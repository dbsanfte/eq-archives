<p class="body">The last sliver of the setting sun shone brightly in a halo of crimson gold as it slid slowly 
past the jagged peaks of the mountains to the north.  Tralik kneeled, resting, and watching the onset of the 
coming night.  A chill wind was in the air, cool, but not uncomfortably so.  He sat there, alone for a moment 
resting his mind and body from the long journey.  His run through Kithicor forest earlier that evening had worn 
on him both physically and mentally.  Not that the journey was nearly as perilous for him now as it had been 
when he was younger, but one still had to be wary of the inhabitants of that evil haunt, especially as evening 
approached.  Memories flashed through his mind of times past.  He recalled his first venture to Antonica and 
ultimately through Kithicor when he was younger and much less skillful as a ranger.</p>

<p class="body">Word had reached him then of a small mountain village under siege.  Sieges were fairly common in 
Norrath, in Antonica especially, but this siege posed a very serious threat.  Highpass Hold, as it was known, 
was a small fortress and village formed at the peak of the only passable rift in the Serpent Spine mountains 
that divided the continent of Antonica.  For years, the citizenry of Highpass Hold, humans for the most part, 
had held off persistent attacks from the Mucktail Gnolls to the North and the Shralok Orcs to the south, 
allowing generally unimpeded passage between Qeynos to the west and Freeport to the east.  The Highpass citizenry, 
brave as they were, did most of the fighting, though with no formal training in the finer arts of combat, their 
sentinels were perilously close to being overrun on several occasions.  Such an incident was what brought Tralik 
to Highpass Hold for that first visit.</p>

<p class="body">On that occasion, rumor had reached him in Kelethin that Lanys T’Vyl, Innoruuk’s despised child, 
was rallying an army of the Teir’Dal, or dark elves in common speak, to march on Highpass Hold and take the keep 
for themselves.  Knowing the consequences of such a turn of events, he had set out almost immediately to try to 
reach Highpass before the dark elven armies arrived.</p>

<p class="body">Most of the trip had gone smoothly and swiftly.  Passage across the Ocean of Tears was uneventful 
and fair winds swept the ship he had booked passage on across the watery deep in record time.  Arrival in Freeport 
was likewise uneventful, and after loading up on supplies for the journey ahead, he had set out on foot across the 
plains of the commonlands.  The plains drifted by swiftly under the graceful gate of the ranger as he strode as 
swiftly as his lungs and energy would allow.  Eventually, the gentle plains gave way to small rolling hills.  
Drawing ever closer, he could see the jagged peaks of the Serpents Spine mountains clearly now, and at their base 
lay the dark forest where many years before, a great battle between the dark elves and the more fair races of 
Antonica had been waged.  That battle, Bloody Kithicor, as it came to be known, was told to be the fiercest battle 
waged in recorded history upon all the lands of Norrath.  Even the incident with the Heretics on Odus ages ago that 
resulted in the creation of the Hole, as it was known was said to pale in comparison.  </p>

<p class="body">Rumor held that the death and destruction in that forest on that day had transformed the woods from 
beautiful greenery teeming with life, to a dark, cesspool of living torment.  He had heard the stories told a number 
of times around campfires and at inn’s over glasses of strong ale and hearty meals, but had figured most of it to be 
wives tales and drunken embellishments.  But, as he drew ever nearer the forest, he began to sense a foreboding 
presence of evil.</p>

<p class="body">Evening was approaching on the third day of his journey, much as it was on this evening, with a cool 
breeze and clear skies as he approached the edge of the woods.  Still uneasy about the looming evil he felt, he 
immediately began to focus his thoughts on what was around him.  Tralik had learned very early on that he held a 
strange ability to track the movements of any living thing around him.  All rangers, as far as he knew, were created 
with this ability, a blessing from Tunare no doubt, for which he was eternally thankful.  On more than one occasion 
this ability had saved him from impending doom, and allowed him to avoid potentially lethal confrontations with 
creatures he was no match for.  Over time and through much practice he had improved his skill in tracking and was 
now quite adept in the practice.</p>

<p class="body">As he scanned the area around him with his mind, nothing unusual stood out.  A few wolves were about, 
but nothing Tralik had to fear as a friend to most animals.  Rangers held a very deep respect for animals and the 
simple lives they lived.  As a result, over the ages most animals had come to rely and trust most rangers and often 
times even the most aggressive of animals would look kindly upon a ranger as one of their own.  </p>

<p class="body">Aside from a few wolves running about, hunting for small rodents and rabbits to fill their bellies, 
a few bixies were about.  Tralik had never actually seen a bixie before that time, but had heard stories of the tiny 
bee-like creatures that flitted around gathering honey and supplies for their colonies.  Most were said not to be 
aggressive towards strangers unless they were provoked, in which case, like any bee-like creature, they could get 
ugly and swarm someone in a hurry leaving them feeling the pain of a thousand stings.</p>

<p class="body">Convinced that the woods were relatively safe, he set out warily along a small path leading through 
the heart of the woods to the entrance to the pass on the other side, ever tracking any living thing around him.  
Trees, rotted and partially decayed, hung still in the clammy air.  Whether the forest itself prevented the movement 
of air or some evil presence literally held it at bay, he did not know.  Very little underbrush or growth of any kind 
was readily visible and clearly, some great evil had transformed this place, although it had not yet driven all life 
from its borders.  </p>

<p class="body">The sun finally dipped behind the horizon to the west, it’s last rays flickering brightly through 
the twisted bare limbs of the ominous trees as he recalled. He approached a large rock along the path that had 
hastily chiseled upon it an arrow pointing north and the words Highpass Hold in the common tongue.  Stopping for 
a moment beside the crude sign to take a drink from a pod of water, he sat to take a moments rest before continuing 
on.</p>

<p class="body">No sooner had he sat down than a twinge of danger flashed through the corner of his mind.  
Immediately he began to sense and track a change taking place in this forest.  What few animals he had sensed 
became overwrought with fear and began to scamper away looking for a place to hide from the oncoming storm of 
darkness that approached.  A heavy mist began rolling swiftly through the forest floor, quickly obscuring the 
ground and threatening to impede sight of the trail.  It was a cold, damp mist that sent a chill straight 
through his bones.  Quickly, he had gathered up his pack and loosened his swords in their scabbards sensing 
that his journey might lead him into peril and not wanting to be caught off guard.  Although his eyes were 
superb and he usually had little trouble navigating in the dark, Tralik quickly chanted a few words.  Out of 
the dark around him tiny globes of light formed and coalesced into a rapidly swirling ball of light that danced 
as though a thousand fireflies had been bound together around his hand.  The light was bright and true, but 
flickered eerily off the dark trees around him, making them seem to move in the light as though awakened from 
a long, horrible sleep.  The mist glowed ominously in the light and continued to move and swirl although there 
was still no breeze to be felt.  Swiftly he set off on the trail, deciding to make haste.  He continued to track 
as he ran.  For an hour or so he ran, swiftly as he could now in the chill dark.  The forest was thinning out 
now some and he sensed that the end of this wood could not be far.  </p>

<p class="body">Quite suddenly, and without warning, a shrill scream rang out through the forest followed by 
the tortured cries of some dreadful evil presence Tralik had no desire to ever meet.  Immediately he began to 
sense the presence of creatures whose evil rose off them like an acrid reek off a rotting carcass.  Faintly, 
through the mist he could make out the haunting shapes of corpses literally rising from the ground.  Many were 
clad in suits of mail and armor that had clearly one been splendid works of craftsmanship but was now rusted 
and showing the signs of decay ages in the ground had brought. Clearly these creatures were the haunted souls 
of those who died in the horrific battle of Bloody Kithicor, seeking revenge for the untimely death brought 
upon them. They were powerful and very clearly they despised life itself, and even more, they despised the living.</p>

<p class="body">Tralik set out running then as fast as he could.  He could hear the footsteps and tortured 
moans of the undead inhabitants of the woods upon the path behind him, drawn to his life force, desiring it 
for themselves though it would never satisfy the endless craving of those that are neither dead or alive but 
trapped somewhere between the two.  Knowing full well that he was no match for these creatures, he ran then 
more swiftly than he had ever run before.  </p>

<p class="body">Quickly he followed the trail, leaping fallen trees and ducking limbs as he went.  Abruptly, 
he rounded a curve in the path and just like a wall, the woods ended and before him rose the rocky path leading 
to Highpass.  Scrambling up the rocks, he reached a small precipice where he briefly glanced back at his pursuers.  
For some reason the undead hordes chasing him had halted at the edge of the wood, unable or unwilling to give 
pursuit beyond its edges.  Their hatred and lust for his blood was clearly visible in their pale eyes as they 
shone now in the light of the moon as it made its first appearance over the edges of the mountain peaks.</p>

<p class="body">Exhausted, but unscathed, he had sat down to catch his breath and say a word of thanks to Tunare 
for her blessings of life.</p>

<p class="body">Ultimately, he had arrived at Highpass Hold only to learn that the armies of the Teir’Dal had 
been routed in the Commonlands shortly after he had passed through.  A surprise army of commoners, Freeport 
militia and various adventurers turned mercenaries had banded together to thwart Lanys’ evil scheme.</p>

<p class="body">This night was very similar in many ways, but then again, a lot had changed in his life 
since then.  Over a year had passed since that night in Kithicor, and many adventures and friends had 
been had along the way.  That night in the woods, along with a few other close encounters shortly thereafter 
had changed his philosophy on life.  </p>

<p class="body">For the better part of a month afterwards, Tralik had spent many days in the Commonlands of 
the east near Freeport.  There he spent much of his time trying as best he could to make an earnest living.  
Often he did odd jobs and small errands for local merchants.  Many of these tasks were bounties placed on Orc 
heads or rewards sought for the death of criminals or those sought by the law.  Though he seldom made any serious 
money, he continually improved his combat skills and practiced and learned many new forms of magic.  Though his 
spell casting abilities were very limited in comparison to some of the more powerful wizards and mages he had met, 
they were typically combat enhancing magics that suited his fighting technique very well.  Not too long after he 
had began his career as an adventurer for hire in the Commonlands, he began hearing rumor of a cave in the southern 
part of the Commonlands which had become increasingly popular as a gathering place for adventurers to meet and swap 
stories and show off items of treasure won from battles in far off lands.  </p>

<p class="body">Upon visiting this vast cave, he was surprised to discover that the rumors were not only true, 
but were very much an understatement.  Torches lined the rough hewn walls of the cave, dancing merrily off the 
ceiling and glowing warmly in the would be dark depths.  The cave itself was teeming with travelers of all races 
and professions.  Ogres, Trolls, and even some Dark Elves and Iksar mingled freely among Humans, Elves and the 
other light races, laughing and sharing tales of adventure.  What was even more amazing was that the place had 
become a vast marketplace with vendors and adventures alike peddling their various wares from food, to armor, to 
spells, to incredible weapons wrought in ages past.  The supply of items to be had here seemed limitless.  It was 
this discovery that ultimately lead Tralik to becoming as wealthy as he was today.</p>

<p class="body">The next month of his life was spent learning the in’s and out’s of the complicated marketplace 
of the East Commonlands Tunnel.  Through much patience and practice, Tralik slowly but steadily acquired a small 
fortune by learning how to buy items of value for low prices and selling them for a fair profit.  Periodically 
he would find an item that suited him or complimented his fighting technique and would latch on to it.  Many of 
the items he bought and traded had various enchantments places upon them and some were works of great craftsmanship 
that time had forgotten and whose origins were unknown.  He learned very quickly that certain enchantments tended 
to be more valuable to some than others.  With that knowledge, his wealth grew rather substantial. </p>

<p class="body">Eventually, the call of the woods and the desire to explore and adventure began to grip him again.
By the time he said goodbye to the marketplace of the commonlands, his fortune had been made and he was able to 
equip himself with some of the finest armor and weapons money could buy.</p>

<p class="body">He set out again at that point, exploring and traveling the continents of Norrath.  For a few 
months he traveled, often staying in the woods and living off the land.  Like always, there was much evil afoot 
in Norrath and wherever he went, he had little trouble finding work to be done and battles waged against the evil 
creatures that roamed the lands.  Until, one day, he happened across a group of strangers in the seaport of Firiona 
Vie.</p>

<p class="body">That day had dawned clear and bright.  It was early fall and the leaves had just begun to change 
color.  A light dew was on the ground and various song birds were already piping merrily.  As he recalled, he 
broke camp early and hastily stamped out the last remaining embers of the fire he had built the night before to 
cook on and warm him through the night.  The distant sounds of the waves crashing on the shore could be heard 
repeating methodically.  Though he did not like sea travel much, preferring firm soil beneath his feet instead, 
there was something he found subtly peaceful about the sound of the ocean.  </p>

<p class="body">His camp had been made just outside the walls of the town since the inn had been unusually busy 
and had no vacancies that night.  He opted to stay as near the walls of the city as he could.  Though he generally 
felt at ease in the woods, the woods surrounding Firiona Vie were unusually perilous.  He had thought it best to 
try to keep within shouting distance of help should a band of drachnids or drolvargs decide to make a midnight raid 
upon the outlying villages.  </p>

<p class="body">It was the drolvargs in particular that worried him and were the main reason for his venture to 
this land.  A vile race of dog-like creatures they were.  Huge, easily towering over most men and easily dwarfing 
an elf like him.  Though they were intelligent and walked upright, drolvargs had a notoriously nasty temperament 
and dislike for any other race.  Even though they had no knowledge of the magic arts, drolvargs more than made up 
for it with their ferocious strength and ability to detect outsiders with their keen sense of smell.  So keen was 
that sense that most could even detect a person who had made themselves invisible to the eyes of the living through 
various magics.  </p>

<p class="body">Word of an alliance between the Drolvargs and an Iksar necromancer named Venril Sathir, who was 
thought to have died centuries earlier, had raised the concern of many across Norrath and had sent warriors and 
adventurers scrambling to help stop the potentially lethal alliance.  Thus had he come to Firiona Vie to lend his 
sword to the defense of the town.</p>

<p class="body">He packed up his gear, tossed it on his back and headed back into town after supplies.  His food 
supplies had waned and his longing for food more substantial than the berries he often foraged drove him to the 
nearest store.  There he had headed off towards the bank to stow away a few items for safekeeping before he headed 
out to help in the fight with the drolvargs patrols.  </p>

<p class="body">The bank was bustling with activity although it was still early yet.  Stepping inside, he waited 
a moment for his turn, then handed the lady working the counter a few bandages, some coin and a small knife, bid 
her farewell, and headed out the door.</p>

<p class="body">He had not taken two steps out the door when out of the blue the air around him became electric 
with energy.  Instantly two figures coalesced a few feet above him and came tumbling down and landed squarely on 
him.</p>

<p class="body">"Whoa, sorry 'bout that", said one as he stood and brushed himself off, the sparks from the magic 
still dancing about him momentarily.</p>

<p class="body">Tralik quickly sprang back up, unsure what to make of the two newcomers.  </p>

<p class="body">"It's nothing." He had replied, still trying to collect his thoughts.  Clearly they were both 
spell casters, or casters as they were commonly known, that much was easy to tell from their garb.  Both were 
clad in the usual robes worn by the various magic-wielding sects.  The first stranger, the one who had apologized 
was clad in a flowing red robe trimmed in a golden-brown embroidery that formed small symbols unknown to most 
but learned scholars of sorcery and magic arts.  The second figure was clad in a regal blue robe trimmed in white 
and inlaid with golden hieroglyphs.  The latter had an air of charisma that was almost overpowering even though he 
had not yet spoken a word.</p>

<p class="body">The three of them had continued to exchange pleasantries the rest of that morning and had become 
fast friends.</p>

<p class="body">Through that chance meeting a few months ago, Tralik had formed a close friendship with the two 
casters he came to know as Happydog and Badnewss.  In fact, it was the two of them he was currently heading to 
meet on this chill night.</p>

<p class="body">Rested now, Tralik cleared the whispers of memories from his mind and set it to the task at hand.  
It was getting late and he was due to meet Happy and Bad at the Combine Teleportation spires a mile or so away in 
less than an hour.  He put away his water and rummaged through his pack for his spell book, which was beginning to 
show some signs of wear.  Quickly he found the incantation he was looking for, and set to memorizing the words.  
Folding the book back up, he gently tucked it away again in the top of his pack, ready to retrieve at a moments 
notice.  </p>

<p class="body">Slowly he arose, stretching the now refreshed muscles in his legs and torso.  Recalling the words 
he had just memorized, he began uttering the spell.  In the distance, the cry of a wolf could be heard rising as 
the elements of nature began converging in a mystical energy field around him.  As the spell reached its end, a 
crescendo of light surrounded him and he felt his body merge with the spirit of the wolf drawn forth through nature. </p>

<p class="body">Imbued now with the swiftness of the wolf, Tralik headed east now at a clip only a well-trained 
bard could match.  His journey to the spires was uneventful and as if on cue, the mystical portal created by 
Happy opened at its center and Badnewss and Happy stepped forth just as he himself was arriving.</p>

<p class="body">"You guys are getting better at the landings," Tralik jested as he greeted both with a smile and 
a wave.</p>

<p class="body">"Yep," replied Happy.  "How have you been?"</p>

<p class="body">"Not bad.  The trip here was pretty uneventful."  He paused for a moment, then began again.  
"The west is pretty quiet now, not much happening since the plague broke a few days ago."</p>

<p class="body">"Well, that’s good news at least," Spoke Badnewss.  "That plague was making food hard to come 
by for a while out there, or so I heard."</p>

<p class="body">"Aye, nasty stuff it was.  But, it should be over now and things should return to normal before 
long."</p>
