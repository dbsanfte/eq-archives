	To Start the epic:</P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Find Camin in Erudin]</P>
  <P CLASS="Response">
   You say, 'hail Camin'</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman and you will 
   receive positive TrueSpirit faction.</P>
  <P>
   Camin says, 'So you have met Solomen, eh? He is a man with a wealth 
   of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.</P>
  <P CLASS="Response">
   You say, 'What are you searching for?'</P>
  <P>
   Camin says 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about 
   such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The 
   knowledge I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.</P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Give Camin 1000 platinum]</P>
  <P>
   Camin says, 'Good, good, you show a willingness to learn of this with 
   your offer. What I can tell you is that Solusek Ro had four followers 
   who had shown exceptional aptitude in the arts of wizardry. Solusek 
   Ro himself tutored them. He considered them to be like his own 
   children. I know of one who still exists. He goes by the name of 
   Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize in the storing of magic into 
   physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and 
   will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep your eyes open. 
   Anyway, be off, I need to continue my research. Return to me if you 
   ever find Arantir Karondor.'</P>
  <P STYLE="text-align : center;" ALIGN=CENTER>
   <HR ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2">
   </P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have no idea what Verant was 
   thinking when they did this part of the quest. There are zero clues 
   as to who or where this person is and honestly, it's sort of 
   disturbing to me that every other class' quest is straightforward, 
   but still has a very good degree of difficulty. None the less, there 
   is a female NPC vendor in Halas named 'Dargon' that sells a potion 
   called Ro's Breath. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. 
   Purchase this potion from Dargon for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp 
   depending on your faction and charisma. (**evil races be warned - you 
   ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's. See this page for Halas Guard and 
   Vendor info**). There is also three other known vendors in the world 
   that sell Ro's Breath -</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Female Barbarian, Marlyn McMerin (loc -3825, +1665), who is found on 
   the dock shops in Fironia Vie.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Female Iksar shaman vendor, Klok Scaleroot in West Cabilis.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Female coldain dwarf, Hudda, who is found within the bank inside the 
   city of Thurgadin.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   You can buy Ro's Breath from any of these vendors but you cannot 
   return it to them. Neither of them will turn into Arantir. However, 
   it is confirmed that you can buy Ro's Breath them, take it to Camin 
   to be stripped of it's charge, and then take it to Dargon. Handing 
   this potion to Dargon in Halas will make her turn into Arantir and 
   the quest will continue.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin and hand it to him. He 
   will reply with the following:</P>
  <P>
   Camin says 'Very interesting... I've seen this work before. Yes, yes! 
   It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give this back to the person you 
   got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's location.'</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<BR>
   You gain experience!!</P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Receive the potion and give it to Dargon in Halas - She will respawn 
   into Arantir Karondor]</P>
  <P>
   Dargon says 'So, I've been discovered! You must know Camin - he is 
   one of the only people who could have recognized my work. I have 
   worked very hard to mask my presence here.'</P>
  <P CLASS="Response">
   You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Before I tell you anything, I require you to 
   help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then 
   return to me.'</P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Receive Arantir's Ring (My love has no bounds)]</P>
  <P>
   <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2">
   </P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Find Challice in Felwithe and give her the ring]</P>
  <P>
   Challice says 'Oh yes? Arantir? What a fool he was! the man gave me 
   everything, but for all his intelligence, he could never understand 
   why I was truly with him. It was for his power; he could do anything. 
   But when he mysteriously lost it, he became just another toy. I never 
   loved him. Return this ring to him. He will understand that I have no 
   desire to see him again.'</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better<BR>
   You gain experience!!</P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Receive Arantir's Ring (I never could love a man like you)]</P>
  <P>
   <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2">
   </P>
  <P CLASS="Action">
   [Return the ring to Arantir or Dargon]</P>
  <P>
   You say, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How I 
   could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love 
   her. It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my 
   powers. When I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love 
   to her, my magic failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of 
   me, do you wish to hear my story?'</P>
  <P>
   you say, 'I wish to hear your story.'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'I once was one of four true followers of 
   Solusek Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made 
   us each a special item. We did not know what the others' items were, 
   but we realized that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after 
   receiving the item, began to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us 
   believed we had enough power to dominate Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this 
   and at the time we needed our powers most, he stripped us of them. 
   Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One was called Sylen 
   Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard was a gnome, 
   but I can't think of his name.</P>
  <P>
   you say, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many 
   high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of 
   his birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than 
   anyone else. I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast 
   area of water, his powers were stripped from him in midflight. He 
   fell and was captured by a rival wizard who specialized in magics of 
   the water. Search for that wizard and you could find a trace of Sylen.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   The 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in 
   Kedge Keep - the Blue Crystal Staff. When this item is identified, 
   the power of Solusek Ro radiates from within.</P>
  <P>
   you say, 'What about Demunir Scry?'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He 
   was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was 
   more interested in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he 
   immediately traveled to it, believing there to be powerful relics 
   left undiscovered there. While exploring, he came upon a dwelling 
   that housed a powerful warrior. Believing himself to be more 
   powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. While in 
   battle with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left him 
   helpless. It is said that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized trophy.</P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   The Demunir item is the Gnarled Staff found off of Venril Sathir from 
   within Karnor's Castle.</P>
  <P>
   you say, 'Who is the gnome?'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I know 
   he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's 
   craft was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim 
   of one of his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his 
   mind diminished in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others 
   calling him 'Old Stewpot' in jest. I do not know if this is his birth 
   name, but it may help you to locate him. I hear he also stays close 
   to water because of the explosion. You never know when another 
   gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this letter to help motivate 
   him to remember.</P>
  <P>
   <HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="2">
   </P>
  <P CLASS="Information">
   The gnome is Kandin Firepot. Kandin can be found in the Southwest 
   region of ButcherBlock Mountains (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. You 
   can hand him the note (when identified it reads - &quot;This item 
   appears to be written in Common Tongue. Item Lore: What is lost must 
   be found.&quot;) from Arantir and he will give you the text below:</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Brother! I have one of those. He's great, but 
   he's dead. His name was Gabstik and he was a really powerful wizard. 
   I still have one of his greatest possesions! You look like you could 
   use it. I've added another thing to my shopping list. I require a dry 
   brittle skin that I can mold or a rare oil found in the planes that I 
   can soak the fuse in. Get me one of these things and I'll trade it 
   for my bother's stick.'</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   You can do this part of the quest two ways now but it is easier to do 
   it the new way (thank you Verant for realizing our epic quest was 
   nearly impossible).</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   THE FIRST WAY (the hard way) -</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   If you have happen to have Cazic's Skin from Cazic Thule in Fear 
   (some may have the skin from before the patch), you can hand it to 
   Kandin and he will reply with the following -</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Great! This is? What is this for again? Oh yeah, 
   the casing for my firework. Here, you can have this then, oh no, 
   wait. You can't yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, 
   and you are exactly the person to get it for me! I need some 
   mistletoe powder. Now, go find some for me! Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, 
   wait! Hold on to my bag for me, please. You can give it back after 
   you've given me what I want.</P>
  <P>
   <!-- $MVD$:spaceretainer() -->&nbsp;</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</P>
  <P>
   At this point, Kandin Firepot will give you 'Kandin's Bag'. When 
   identified, the bag comes up with: Item Lore: Warning - 
   Explosive!&quot;. Although it is a bag, it cannot be opened. Don't 
   worry about this, continue with the quest.</P>
  <P>
   The mistletoe powder is found within Old Sebilis upon Tolapmulj. Once 
   you have the powder, return to Kandin and hand only the powder to 
   him. Upon handing Kandin the mistletoe powder, he will return to you 
   the Staff of Gabstik. Once he hands you the staff he asks for his bag 
   back. Hand him 'Kandin's Bag' -</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Great! Give this to Arantir so he knows you've 
   helped me! Hey! Have you seen my lantern anywhere?</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</P>
  <P>
   THE SECOND WAY (the new way) -</P>
  <P>
   If you hail Kandin instead of handing him the skin, the following is 
   what will happen -</P>
  <P>
   You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm 
   workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!</P>
  <P>
   You say, 'what oil?'</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Ah the oil! I recently sent a specially crafted 
   golem to explore through a huge portal to another plane. It's 
   instructions were to collect special oil that I suspect existed in 
   the plane. What I think is the golem broke down. This looks like a 
   good task for one like you. Go see what's wrong with the golem. Here 
   is spare gears of mine incase it's broken. Be careful though, if you 
   put it in wrong it could explode or worse!</P>
  <P>
   This golem is a non-aggro 'broken golem' that is found in the Plane 
   of Fear (-720, -109). Hand the broken golem the golem sprocket -</P>
  <P>
   an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction! Destroy!<BR>
   an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst 
   in me.'</P>
  <P>
   You now have an enraged golem on your hands that is aggro. The 
   enraged golem can double hit for 400 each, has approximately 150k HP 
   and is not a caster. Flame based spells and lures are most efficient 
   to use in bringing him down. Once he is dead, loot the green oil from 
   his corpse. Take this green oil back to Kandin in the ButcherBlock Mountains.</P>
  <P>
   You say, 'hail Kandin Firepot'</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Hello, there! Don't have time to talk. I'm 
   workin', workin', workin'! Careful! Don't slip in the oil!</P>
  <P>
   Hand over the oil -</P>
  <P>
   Kandin Firepot says 'Oh wow! You found the oil! Where is the golem? 
   You didn't hurt him did you? I am very fond of him. Anyways, here is 
   your reward a note and staff to give to that guy you were asking me about.</P>
  <P>
   Your faction standing with Truespirit got better</P>
  <P>
   You will now have BOTH the note to take to Dargon/Arantir and the 
   Staff of Gabstik.</P>
  <P>
   Now take this note from Kandin and give it to Dargon in Halas. This 
   will cause Arantir to spawn in the place of Dargon once again. Once 
   Arantir has spawned, hail him and continue -</P>
  <P>
   You say, 'hail Arantir Karondor'</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Ah yes, you again. Do you have the items? Give 
   me the three you possess and I'll combine them with my own.</P>
  <P>
   At this point, hand Arantir all three staves, the Blue Crystal Staff, 
   the Gnarled Staff, and the Staff of Gabstik.</P>
  <P>
   Arantir Karondor says 'Here, this pack contains all of our items. You 
   will never be able to open it again, so you must deliver the pack, 
   intact, to Solomen. He will then reward you. Now that I have helped 
   you, leave me in peace.</P>
  <P>
   Now you must go back to Solomen and hand him this pack. Upon doing so 
   will result in getting the epic item, Staff of the Four.</P>
  <P>
   Solomen says 'You actually did it! I never would have thought that 
   anyone could have truly followed this path. This is a tribute to your 
   intelligence and patience. Here, take this staff and know that you 
   have made Solusek Ro and all the wizards of the world proud this day.</P>
