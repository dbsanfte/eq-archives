<p class="body">I have no past. My eyes have opened to a new and mysterious world. I have no memories. Nothing. 
Just blackness until the moment I awoke. I remember finding myself standing on a large wooden platform. The 
darkness seemed to close in, held off only by the persistent flame of a few torches lining the edge of the 
platform. Awestruck, and confused, I struggled to grasp the reality of my very existence. How had I come to 
be here? What place is this? I sank to my knees trying to get a grip on what was occurring. I was alone, cold, 
and even worse, scared. </p>

<p class="body">Gradually, my fear subsided and was replaced instead by a determination to find out why I was 
here. I slowly began to explore my surroundings. As I searched about the platform, I approached what appeared 
to be a walkway extending from the platform into the mist beyond. Upon approaching the walkway, partially 
obscured by empty boxes, a slight glimmer of light reflected off of a shiny object and caught my attention. 
I moved the boxes to discover what appeared to be some food, a small note, and a short sword that was showing 
the signs of age. Not knowing what manner of place I was in, I hurriedly packed up the food and note and quickly 
strapped the sword to my side to defend myself with should this strange land prove to be filled with danger. 
As I began to cross the walkway, I quickly read the note, which said only that it should be delivered to a man 
named Maesyn Trueshot in the Ranger's guild of Kelethin. The walkway lead to another platform similar in 
construction to the first, only as I approached, I began to hear voices and eventually began to make out the 
shapes of other beings as I drew near. The stir and commotion clashed violently with the solitude and sense of 
aloneness I had felt just moments prior. All manners and types of beings hustled and bustled about there lives 
oblivious to my confounding situation. My anxiety grew, not knowing where I was or what I was to do.</p>

<p class="body">"Greetings Tralik, you look like you could use a rusty spear," came a voice from nearby. </p>

<p class="body">"Uh, what?" I said, turning to face my unknown addressor. "How do you know my name?"</p>

<p class="body">"I said, you look like you could use a rusty spear," the man replied, beaming a radiant smile 
that enhanced his already vigorous appearance.</p>

<p class="body">"No, no thank you," I replied. "But you still haven’t told me how you know my name."</p>

<p class="body">"Why, Tunare has foretold of your coming. We all know who you are," he said as he waved his 
arm to indicate all those around us.</p>

<p class="body">"You mean to tell me that everyone here knows my name?"</p>

<p class="body">"Indeed," he chimed.</p>

<p class="body">"How can this be?" I prompted him, longing to know what powers that be, gave all those around 
me such knowledge.</p>

<p class="body">"The ways of the Gods are mysterious, and the powers they bestow on us all are likewise a 
mystery. Many questions you will have, and many answers you will find. But wisdom comes through patience and 
trial. In time, you shall discover powers that make knowing others names before having meet seem insignificant 
by comparison."</p>

<p class="body">Perplexed and yet intrigued at the same time, I prepared to leave to seek out these answers 
that had thus far eluded me.</p>

<p class="body">"Good day to you Merchant Lludrae, and thank you for your kindness," I said as I turned to depart.</p>

<p class="body">"You see, you are already discovering your power," he said, once again catching my attention.</p>

<p class="body">"What do you mean?" I asked as I once again turned to face him.</p>

<p class="body">"You knew my name," he replied with a wry grin creeping across his young face.</p>

<p class="body">Indeed I had. I turned away once again heading into the throng of people bustling about. Amazingly,
I found that I did indeed know the names of those I passed. Like whispers of wind through the trees, the voices 
slipped freely through my mind imparting the names of those around me. I paused for a few moments leaning against 
a very large, ancient tree that appeared to be supporting the massive platform upon which I stood. As I continued 
to explore this newfound ability, I soon discovered that not only did I know the names of those around me, but I
could also sense their location in reference to me even when they were distant enough to be beyond detection by 
sight or sound.</p>

<p class="body">While exploring this newly found gift, I sensed the presence of an individual that seemed somehow 
familiar. Realizing almost immediately where I knew the name, I desperately began fumbling through my pockets 
searching for the note that I knew would confirm my suspicion.</p>

<p class="body">"He’s here!" I thought to myself as I read the name again on the letter. "this must be Kelethin, 
and Maesyn Trueshot is here, close by."</p>

<p class="body">Concentrating, I followed the guidance provided me by this power. I turned to my left, and headed 
across yet another walkway heading into the night. Onto another platform, left again and up a ramp to another 
slightly smaller platform. I saw what appeared to be a place of some importance with many people gathered around, 
eager to buy, sell and trade their various wares. At the edge of the platform stood a small building with a sign 
proclaiming it to be the Bank of Kelethin. On I went, taking another ramp higher into this mysterious city in the 
trees. To my left stood a small, quaint home with a warm light emanating from within. I sensed the presence of two 
people inside, one male and one female. Knowing that they were not who I was looking for, I pressed on. To the 
right of the platform was a ramp extending downward this time, which I followed. Upon reaching the platform below, 
my eye was caught by the grandeur and craftsmanship displayed in the large building before me. Outside hung a sign 
boldly proclaiming this place to be the home of Faydarks Champions. I knew Maesyn Trueshot was inside this building.
My anticipation grew as I summoned the courage to enter the building.</p>

<p class="body">As I opened the door, I was hit with a wave of pure awe. The air crackled with pure energy and 
sizzled and sparked while balls of light danced mysteriously about. A number of people stood around the edge of 
the entryway, chanting words unknown to my ears. Like sacred rituals, these chants were repeated, calling forth 
some mysterious force that created the energy that charged the room. I stared in awe as I watched one man begin 
a chant that called forth a power which enveloped him causing his skin to become as hard as wood. Momentarily 
shocked, I stood staring wide eyed at this amazing demonstration of raw power. Remembering why I was there, I 
headed through the hall into the antechamber beyond, where stood the man I sought. </p>

<p class="body">"Hail, Maesyn Trueshot," I said as I approached him and handed him the note I had found. He was 
a tall man, of the same race as I. His stature spoke of years of wisdom gained through struggle that belied his 
youthful appearance. In his right hand rested an intricately carved bow that appeared to have been well used, 
yet was still an awe inspiring weapon.</p>

<p class="body">"Welcome Tralik, to the guild of Faydark Champions. I have been expecting you." He replied in turn.</p>

<p class="body">"You were expecting me?" I inquired. "Why?"</p>

<p class="body">"Indeed I was, as were we all. Tunare, the Great Mother, has foretold of your coming and has sent 
you to us to help battle the evil that threatens this land that we call home. It is for this purpose that you 
were created by Her."</p>

<p class="body">"Of what evil do you speak?" I inquired further. "And who is Tunare?"</p>

<p class="body">"Tunare is the God, and the mother of our people, the Fier`Dal, though we are known to most as 
Wood Elves. Likewise, our brethren the Koada`Dal, the High Elves as they are known, are her children also. She 
has charged us, and our brethren, to protect this land and all the lands of Norrath from the many faces of evil 
that threaten it. Here, on this continent of Faydwer, a great force known as the Crushbone Orcs threatens to 
destroy all we have worked for. The orcs are a vile race that spread like a plague amongst all the lands of 
Norrath, decimating the very ground with their vile behavior. They continually attack and maul the peaceful 
citizens of this land, and plunder and pillage our supplies. You have been called to help us in this battle. 
You will be trained in the ways of the Ranger, the protectors of the land, and you will be melded into a force 
that the orcs will cower from in fear. In time, you too will learn to harness the powers Tunare grants us in the 
ways of magic, as well as becoming skilled in the arts of war. We should begin immediately since the forces of 
evil never sleep."</p>

<p class="body">Thus began this adventure that is my life.</p>
