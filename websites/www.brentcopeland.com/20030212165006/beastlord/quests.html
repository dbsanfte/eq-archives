        <p><font color="#FF0000">Ogre Beastlord:</font><a name="ogre"></a></p>
        <p>The questgiver for all the Ogre quests is Grapok. He can be found in 
          Oggok, just along from the Beastlord trainers (in the room with six 
          exits which leads to the trainers, Grapok's tunnel is two tunnels clockwise 
          from theirs - i.e. the tunnel directly north of point two <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/oggokmap.html" target="_blank">on 
          this map</a> )</p>
        <p><b>Quest 1: Ruthless Bracer</b><br>
          Items Required: Four Lizard Meats</p>
        <p>Lizard meats are dropped by any of the Lizardmen in the Feerrott. Your 
          primary source will be the Lizardman Broodlings, who are level 1.</p>
        <p>Reward: Ruthless Bracer - AC 3, +2 STR, Weight 0.3, Slot: WRIST, LORE, 
          NO DROP</p>
        <p><b>Quest 2: Ruthless Cap</b><br>
          Items Required: 4 Silk Threads</p>
        <p>Silk Threads need to be tailored from Spiderling Silks. You will need 
          two silks to tailor each thread - the combine trivials at 21, and I 
          believe it never fails. The silks can be tailored either in your kit 
          if you have one, or alternatively at the loom in Oggok (which is in 
          one of the tunnels you pass through on the way to the Shaman guild).</p>
        <p>Spiderling Silks can be obtained from either the Jungle Spiderlings 
          (levels 1-3) or Jungle Spiders (levels 3-5) in the Feerrott. Both are 
          plentiful and easy to find.</p>
        <p>Reward: Ruthless Cap - AC 4, +1 STA, Weight 0.3, Slot: HEAD, LORE, 
          NO DROP</p>
        <p><b>Quest 3: Ruthless Leggings</b><br>
          Items Required: 1 Mystic Doll</p>
        <p>Mystic Dolls are dropped by Lizardman Mystics. These spawn at all of 
          the small Lizardman camps in the Feerrott. You can take one of these 
          camps at about level 4 in a group, or level 6 solo. Be warned that the 
          Mystics will blind you. Constantly. The Dolls are NO DROP.</p>
        <p>Reward: Ruthless Leggings - AC 5, +2 AGI, Weight 0.3, Slot: LEGS, LORE, 
          NO DROP</p>
        <p><b>Quest 4: Ruthless Claw</b><br>
          Items Required: 2 Giant Bat Furs &amp; 2 Giant Bat Wings</p>
        <p>These can be obtained from Giant Bats (big surprise!) which range in 
          level from around 5-7. They spawn in two areas in the Feerrott, near 
          the zones to Innothule Swamp and Rathe Mountains. In both areas you 
          will encounter Marsh Bears, who are around levels 10-12, and will attack 
          you, so be careful. In my experience the zone to Rathe Mountains has 
          more bats and less bears, and so I would recommend hunting there.</p>
        <p>Reward: Ruthless Claw - Hand to Hand Weapon, Damage 5, Delay 24, Weight 
          3.5, Slot: Either Melee, MAGIC ITEM, LORE, NO DROP</p>
        <p><b>Quest 5: Ruthless Leather</b><br>
          Items Required: 4 Lizard Tails</p>
        <p>Lizard tails are dropped uncommonly by the Lizardman Warriors and Mystics 
          on the pyramids outside Cazic-Thule. They &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; also 
          drop at the camps on the far side of the bridge to the Rathe Mountains 
          zone, which have higher level lizards than those nearer to Oggok. The 
          warriors and mystics in this area range from around level 8 to level 
          11.</p>
        <p>Reward: Ruthless Leather - AC 11, +3 STR, Weight 0.3, Slot: CHEST,

        <p>First quest is the citizen quest which yields the slate, a cloak from 
          your guildmaster. Cloak is like ac2. He tells you to take the slate 
          to Poren (standing next to him... to the left if guildmaster is behind 
          you) for the next quest.</p>
        <p>Second quest is givin by Animist Poren and she says combine the pattern 
          with 3 bandages and you will get gloves. Gloves are like ac3. Return 
          the scraps to her for the next part of the quest. The silk can be gotten 
          from Xakra Silkworms in Shadeweaver Thicket.</p>
        <p>Third quest is getting the gloves, 2 claws from young rockhoppers and 
          foraged fasteners and placing them in stitching kit to make claws. They 
          are 6/37 I believe and are H2H.</p>
        <p>Was extremely late when I was doing these so sorry if they are kinda 
          odd, but that is all I can remember right now accept after you finish 
          your innitiate quests with Poren she sends you to Marhon Sood to turn 
          in a seal, once you have done that you have to goto Kery Miann with 
          a map and give that to her. When you give her the map she says to take 
          this knife (she gives you it) and cut two strips from high quality rockhopper 
          hides. Tailoring is required for all these first quests. I completed 
          that and you turn in the two strips with your two claws and now I have 
          claws that are 7/28 +1str +1dex</p>
        <p>Basically if you take the time to go through the quests your H2H weapons 
          get better and better. Anyway, hope that helps alittle. </p>

        <p><font color="#FF0000">Champion Cloak </font><a name="champion"></a></p>
        <p>Part 1 <br>
          The first thing I would do is go to the Loda kai camp in the caves. 
          There are poachers and Traders that spawn here. Collect at least 12 
          Poached hides (6 more if you want the shoulders when you are done or 
          extra if you fail) and 3 drops of blood. The blood drops of Traders 
          that I have seen and the Poached hides drop off both.</p>
        <p>Part 2<br>
          Seek Sentry Fenin and hail him. Say what about poachers. after the responce 
          say I will champion their cause. He will hand you a coffin to put 6 
          poached hides in and combine. Give the coffin back to Fenin and repeat 
          this part to get 2 hero shawls.</p>
        <p>Part 3 <br>
          Talk to the npc just as you come out of Shar Vahl make a left and head 
          for the group of rocks behind the first tent. Hail the NPC there. Say 
          I am a hero. He will ask for proof. Give him ONE shoulder and he will 
          return it to you with a champion pattern.</p>
        <p>Part 4<br>
          My tailoring skill was at 28 when I did this and failed the first time. 
          I did it a second time and succeeded but no trivial message. You combine 
          the 2 hero shawls a shade silk thread and a pattern in the sewing kit 
          to get a Champion Cape</p>
        <p>Part 5<br>
          Go to priestess bast that is in that same section of rock sitting on 
          the ground. Hand her the Champion Cape and the 3 drops of loda kai blood. 
          You will get a Blessed champion cape</p>
        <p>Stats are AC8 str +2 cha +2 wis +3 sv cold +10 and has a Faction modifier</p>
        <p>Wearing the cloak I am Ally to everyone in the city that I have found 
          so far. <br>

        <p>If you are hunting in Shadeweaver, come out of the city and stay a 
          little bit to the right of the path and you'll see a guard house whith 
          a man standing outside named &quot;Kaza Raj&quot; I believe. it thats 
          not it, it's close enough. Go up to him and naim what peice of armor 
          you want, such as &quot;What tunic?&quot; or &quot;what gloves?&quot; 
          you know, that sort. For each peice, he will ask for 4 of a certain 
          no-drop item. the ones I've handed in so far are Shadowed claws for 
          boots, broken brigand skulls for a bracer, and sharp bloodling mandibles 
          for gloves.</p>

        <p>Hail the master smith (merchant) in the armory (the building Kagazz 
          is standing in the alcove of). Tell him, &quot;I am looking for work&quot;. 
          He'll go through some scripted text, ask him, &quot;What broodlings?&quot; 
          Buy the Carapace Shield Frame from him (looks like a shield, scroll 
          down past all the molds).<br>
          Once you have the frame (it's an 8-slot pack), go out into Shadeweaver's 
          Thicket and kill the Cht'thk Broodlings (little rhino-beetles). Get 
          eight of their carapaces, combine in the pack. Voila, you now have a 
          4AC 4SV Disease shield! Since we can't dual wield till level 17, we 
          might as well put something in the secondary slot.</p>
        <p>BTW, check the vendors near Shar Vahl (in Shadeweaver's Thicket, to 
          the north past the trainee tents, first building past the banker) for 
          the carapaces. Most people simply sell carapaces to the merchants, and 
          these can often be found for sale. Just a little over 3sp each to buy.
