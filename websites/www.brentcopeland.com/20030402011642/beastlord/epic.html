        <p>1. Hail Historian Sharar<a name="epic1"></a><br>
          Hail historian Sharar and she gives you some long text about taking 
          a book to Elder Animist Dumul. Just answer [yes] to this and she hands 
          you the book. Now the key here is to notice the last line of text. She 
          states that the Khati Sha are disturbed as of late. If you ask what 
          they are disturbed about she doesn't have a complete answer but knows 
          it has to do with the spiritual realm. This is VERY important. Head 
          to the Beastlord guild and Elder Animist Dumul is standing behind a 
          counter next to the guildmaster. </p>
        <p align="center"><a href="#top">-top- </a> </p>
        <hr>
        2. Take book to Elder Animist Dumul<a name="epic2"></a><br>
        Hand him the book and he says something to the effect of not trusting 
        you or something. He asks how much you know. This is where you use the 
        text from Sharar. You state you know the Khati Sha are disturbed about 
        the spiritual realm. I believe the trigger here is the word spirit/spiritual. 
        He then states basically you are a nosy little punk but he likes that 
        and you might be the person they are looking for. He asks you to bring 
        him back the Copper Medal of War. He says it can be retrieved by helping 
        the scouts in the Grimling Forest. <br>
        <hr>
        3. Complete &quot;Copper Medal of War&quot; Quest<a name="epic3"></a><br>
        Scout Husman asks you for 6 people of about his level. To wipe out a grimling 
        camp nearby. 
        <p>Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start 
          the quest. </p>
        <p>The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. 
          It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the 
          follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, 
          and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. </p>
        <p>Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than 
          the Grimlings). Kill him to recieve a medallion from Scout Husman. </p>
        <p>You Must keep Scout Husman alive in order to finish the quest. </p>
        <p>Suggested force is about 6 level 40s or 2 or 3 high level 50s. As a 
          57 enchanter, the officer proved annoying since he could not be mermerized. 
        </p>
        <p> Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist 
          Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati 
          Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that 
          has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look 
          like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal 
          at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal 
          and would please like another and he gives you another. He also says 
          to stash those two items and return to him in a bit when you are ready 
          to be briefed. I stashed the two items in my bank, ran back over there 
          and stated [I was ready to be briefed]. He speaks of a magic-user that 
          is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new 
          magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent. 
          He then states that through further research, they (the Khati Sha) have 
          discovered the name of the magic-user</p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p>Elder Animist Dumul says 'I have received word from several of our 
            scouts indicating your impending arrival. We are all very pleased 
            that you were able to release all of the spirits before any true harm 
            could manifest itself. Your efforts have not only restored balance 
            to the spirit realm, they seem to have also acted to hinder any other 
            plans our antagonist may have had... for the time being. '<br>
          </p>
          <p>Elder Animist Dumul says 'Our Taruun scouts have discovered Draz 
            Nurakk's location. A scout has returned from a set of islands on the 
            Old World. The islands are in a place called Timorous. The Taruun 
            returned while leaving a scout behind to insure that the foul Animist 
            does not evade us any further. You will need to find the island on 
            which our scout has set up camp. The island has a great statue on 
            it. Hopefully, he will still be in that location. Show him this seal 
            and he will know that I sent you to assist. '<br>

        <p>Scout Sihmoj says 'Good to see you, now keep your head down friend. 
          He may look out here at any moment, though he's been asleep most of 
          the day. He's been staying in a ruined building on that island over 
          there. I'm sure you can see it from here. You should be able to surprise 
          him with little trouble. Just take care to avoid any traps he may have 
          set. He's proven to be a very capable magic-user. '</p>
        <p>Scout Sihmoj says 'When you finish with him, please bring any evidence 
          of his being dispatched back to me in this bag. I'll direct you from 
          there. Good luck... I'll watch from here. '</p>
        <p>Green-con Draz Nurakk spawned in the small ruin on the opposite isle. 
          Killed him, dropped nothing. <br>
          Draz Nurakk's corpse explodes into thousands of brilliant glass fragments! 
          '</p>
        <p>On his death 6 blue con iksars named &quot;Draz Nurakk's Image&quot; 
          spawned. All but 1 was slowable. I had 24 people there, was handled 
          very easily. Not sure as to what they hit for.</p>
        <p>each of these images dropped &quot;Shards of Broken Glass&quot; in 
          which you combine in the pouch given by the scout.</p>
        <p> Scout Sihmoj says 'I knew that this creature had power, but how do 
          you explain this? That fight was well beyond my comprehension. I'm not 
          sure what to do other than have you return the bag to Elder Dumul. I'm 
          sure that he will know what to do next. Take care and be swift. '</p>

        <p> 7<a name="seven"></a>. Return to Dumul</p>
        <p>Elder Animist Dumul says 'My fears were well founded, and I am glad 
          that I have had people that are able to understand those fears. Please 
          do not think that I have intentionally placed you in the path of harm, 
          but I did have my suspicions about our adversary's strength. I am not 
          surprised that he was able to deceive us in this manner. I thank the 
          spirits that you were able to evade harm in your completion of this

          has been researching a means of circumventing any protective magic that 
          Draz Nurakk may have in place. When you meet him next, you will be well

          Your Location is -176.79, 52.26, -188.25<br>
          Arms Historian Qua says 'It is a pleasure to meet you, Rugom. The Animists 
          mentioned that someone would be by, but for me not to wait, so I sent 
          the information that they requested to Weapons Master Rahoul. He is 
          having a master smith finish the blades. '<br>
          Arms Historian Qua says 'Take him this receipt and I'm sure that he'll 
          get you the weapons as soon as possible. Take care, Rugom. It appears 
          that a lot of people are relying on you in this matter. You may be the

          Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Hail friend, are you a new recruit or have 
          you been at it for a bit? '<br>
          Your Location is -105.99, -540.14, -258.75<br>
          Weapons Master Rahoul says 'You are just the time. The weapon that Elder 
          Dumul requested has almost been completed. We need you to gather a few 
          items in order to complete the weapon. These items will not require 
          much effort to acquire, but I will need to tell you where to look. Place 
          all of the items that I request in this box and return it to me as quickly 
          as possible. '<br>
          Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Now, seek out <b>a large chunk of perfect 
          acrylia ore</b>,<b> two Gems of the Void</b>, and<b> chunk of dense 
          fungal padding</b>. Once I have those items, I can finish the weapon 
          that you will need to use to kill the dark animist. ' <br>
        </p>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'The ore that I require is often used 
            to create living rock formations. These collections of rocks and boulders 
            will often leave a trail of energy that causes other rocks to collect 
            and come to life. Our scouts have seen these formations in a variety 
            of areas. Take care when you attempt to gather this ore. '<br>
          </p>
          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'If you look in the Maiden's Eye, you 
            will find entities that are the embodiment of darkness. Their twisted 
            spirits are not allowed to escape the form that they inhabit. They 
            have no hope of escape, unless they are released during the destruction 
            of their material form. There are some occasions when the power that 
            is used to keep them in this realm will turn upon itself during this 
            period of destruction. This process is what produces the Gems of the 
            Void. '<br>
          </p>
          <p>Weapons Master Rahoul says 'When traversing the Deep, you will run 
            across a shrieking fungus. Those creatures are much more durable and 
            dangerous than the other fungi that you may encounter in the caverns 
            of Luclin. It is for this reason that we use their flesh as padding. 
            Take care when hunting them, for they will provide a good challenge.

            The design was research by Historian Qua. They should work to neutralize 
            the magical field that protects the dark animist and allow you to 
            tear his scaly flesh from his frame. Remember that all of this is

            to assist us. He knows who you are, so it will be best for us to get 
            him before he can conjure up any more surprises. Find Scout Halmia 
            in the Grove and give her this seal. Then bring the evidence of his 
            destruction to me when you are done. Place his head, the seal, and
