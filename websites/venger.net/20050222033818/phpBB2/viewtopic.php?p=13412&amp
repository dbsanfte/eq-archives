_____________________________________________________________
<br />

<br />

<br />
Christmas, Shadowknight Style
<br />

<br />
T'was the night before christmas, all through Everquest
<br />
Folks were trying to be happy, and doing their best.
<br />
The druids and wizards were porting about,
<br />
The clerics were rezzing, and the merchant would shout.
<br />

<br />
The chanters were charming, the shamans were dishing out buffs
<br />
VI was nerfing drops and making mobs more tuff.
<br />
It seemed all was well as the long nite wore on,
<br />
But somewhere lurking and waiting, one man proved it wrong.
<br />

<br />
He was hidden in freeport, near the paladins Guild.
<br />
He knew his target would stop there. and the kids would be thrilled.
<br />
Off in the distance, a bard playing his flute
<br />
was coming home from a night filled with fun and much loot.
<br />

<br />
The one in the shadows readied himself for his quest
<br />
Tonight would be a battle to put his skills to the test.
<br />
His spells were all ready, his armor was clean,
<br />
His blade hard been sharpened to a nice evil sheen.
<br />

<br />
He bagan casting his spells, improving his sight
<br />
Nothing would get by him on this cold and dark night.
<br />
He could see the invisible, nothing would get past
<br />
This had been his mistake in the Christmas last.
<br />

<br />
At last he saw his target, crossing the skies
<br />
He gathered shadows about him, evading most eyes.
<br />
As the sleigh drew ever closer he could see his victim well,
<br />
It pleased him to send one more down to Hell.
<br />

<br />
The guards were all sleeping, they'd been drinking too much
<br />
They didnt hear the sleigh as it landed with a gentle touch.
<br />
As the fat man stood grinning he made not a sound.
<br />
He stopped and he took a good look all around.
<br />

<br />
He reached in the sleigh for his bag of phat lewt,
<br />
Then stopped as he saw a light gleam off his boot.
<br />
It was at this moment the hunter attacked
<br />
He lept through the air at the fat man's large back.
<br />

<br />
"You will not evade me Santa!" was the battle cry,
<br />
Tonight was the night when the fat man would die.
<br />
Santa whipped around and began to cast
<br />
But a shield upside his head interrupted the blast.
<br />

<br />
There was a moment of silence as the men stared into each other's eyes
<br />
But the silence was broken with new battle cries.
<br />
"I've come for you fat man, your soul shall be mine."
<br />
Was answered with "Bring it, it's Inky bashing time."
<br />

<br />
Santa was quad hitting, but did little damage
<br />
The DS on Kralthan made much battle spammage.
<br />
The fight was going badly for poor old St. Nick
<br />
He was getting a beating with every tick
<br />

<br />
When it seemed it was over, it started anew
<br />
Santa CH'd with a sound like "Achew"
<br />
Kralthan was frustrated, and used his Harm Touch
<br />
Which sent the fatty running, it had hurt him much.
<br />

<br />
Kralthan gave chase, and hit Santa with a snare
<br />
Santa CH'd again and turned to fight there.
<br />
They stood on the rooftop, trading their blows
<br />
As the world slept around them, nobody to know.
<br />

<br />
Kralthan was winning, soon phat lewt would be his
<br />
The sleigh, and the horses, and all that good shiz
<br />
But then Verant stepped in, he was struck down with lag
<br />
The fat man made a run and jumped in with his bag.
<br />

<br />
As Kralthan stood helpless Ol' Santa managed to Gate.
<br />
The lag went away and he stood frozen with hate.
<br />
Somewhere far away, at the north pole
<br />
Santa was thanking the Gods for returning him whole.
<br />

<br />
Though it seemed somehow Kralthan had lost the duel,
<br />
He'd try again next year, and perhaps break the rule.
<br />
As he snuck into the shadows and out of sight,
<br />
He shouted "Merry christmas to all, and to all a good fight."
<br />

and all throughout Norrath no one did greive.
<br />
Their differences had all been put aside,
<br />
For one strange week Everquest was a smooth ride.
<br />

<br />
The monks were off pulling, with clerics to heal.
<br />
The warriors and rogues had much damage to deal.
<br />
Necros, beastlords and mages gave gifts to thier pets,
<br />
Shamans got shafted on dog bones, none had arrived yet.
<br />

<br />
Wizards and druids were begging to port,
<br />
with the portals from Knowledge it was now last resort.
<br />
Rangers were happy kiting stuff with thier bows,
<br />
And bards stood by to sing once the time arose.
<br />

<br />
Enchanters were busy making plat by the ton,
<br />
everyone needed KEI for the battle to be won.
<br />
It seemed all was peaceful throughout the land
<br />
except for the evil in the heart of one man.
<br />

<br />
This night brought him memories of a battle lost,
<br />
when the Gods had forsaken him and his luck had been tossed.
<br />
The year had been spent planning, he knew what to do.
<br />
Tonight would be different, this was round 2.
<br />

<br />
He'd been through some nerfings, but overall was stronger.
<br />
His spells did more damage and lasted much longer.
<br />
His shield and sword traded for an axe with great power,
<br />
He began his long journey as he realized the hour.
<br />

<br />
The hunter moved swiftly across the dark night,
<br />
his path laid out carefully with the end far from sight.
<br />
Through the cold snow he silently made his way,
<br />
cursing himself for not doing this by day.
<br />

<br />
The sky above was moonless and utterly black,
<br />
more than once he lost his way, but he'd never turn back.
<br />
Finally in Iceclad he summoned his pet.
<br />
"Now listen here Goner, dont make me regret."
<br />

<br />
"We have far yet to travel, it will be a long swim
<br />
So you'd better keep up or fall prey to my whim"
<br />
The skeleton nodded and said "Following you master."
<br />
Kralthan picked up the pace, they had to move faster.
<br />

<br />
Far out to sea did they need to travel,
<br />
but it was the only way for this scheme to unravel.
<br />
Swimming and swimming they made thier way north and east.
<br />
Below in the waters they were tracked by a great beast.
<br />

<br />
Its presence was felt and the evil knight slowed,
<br />
he turned to the waters and his fiery eyes glowed.
<br />
"Begone from me Lodi or you'll not survive!"
<br />
The great turtle turned away wanting to stay alive.
<br />

<br />
Finally they came to thier resting place,
<br />
an island unknown to nearly every race.
<br />
"Now sit right here Goner, and wait til you're called"
<br />
The skeleton fell to the ground in a pile of bones sprawled.
<br />

<br />
The Gravelord had feared he was late, it was nearing dawn.
<br />
But just at that moment his victim had spawned.
<br />
Santa popped right in front of him much by surpise.
<br />
Kralthan moved quickly and jabbed 2 fingers in his eyes.
<br />

<br />
"Why you dirty blue bastard, I knew you'd be back!"
<br />
"Dont sweet talk me Santa, I've come to attack!"
<br />
"I see you found my bindpoint,this time I cant gate."
<br />
"Thats right you fat slob, you'll bow down to my hate."
<br />

<br />
Both men stood thier ground, neither wanting to move.
<br />
When suddenly Santa did something crazy and began to groove!
<br />
He summoned 2 strange looking elves with a magical dance.
<br />
But both conned green to Kralthan who held his battle stance.
<br />

<br />
"I see you brought friends, but they'll help you not
<br />
This year you shall fall fat man, your body will rot.
<br />
You'll deliver no presents, not one single piece."
<br />
With this the dark warrior let his power release.
<br />

<br />
"Come to me Goner, the battle is nigh!"
<br />
The skelly jumped up and ran to attack the elf near the fat guy.
<br />
As the dark one moved forward, his axe caught the other an elf,
<br />
which was thrown to the ground like a vase from a shelf.
<br />

<br />
Santa finally fell victim to his own rage,
<br />
and rushed madly onward ready to engage.
<br />
Thats when the first spell hit him, draining his might.
<br />
Followed by another which set his very blood alight.
<br />

<br />
Goner the dead had defeated his foe,
<br />
and was now beating Santa from the waist below.
<br />
But Santa cared not as the battle waged still,
<br />
Kralthan merely laughed as he waited for the kill.
<br />

<br />
Santa was weakened, he put up little fight.
<br />
A well timed harmtouch stopped his CH outright.
<br />
A few axe swings later the fat man met his death.
<br />
"A curse on you Kralthan" came from his final breath.
<br />

<br />
The victor stood over his prey with a smile.
<br />
His hatred had finally been quenched for a while.
<br />
Then to his horror he noticed one fact,
<br />
Santa had no bag of gifts, not even a backpack!
<br />

<br />
He searched the fat corpse, but found only 2 gold.
<br />
His heart was again beginning to grow cold.
<br />
Just as he felt overcome with demise,
<br />
a smile crossed his face and he realized.
<br />

<br />
In the hands of the dead man there was still clutched a great stave.
<br />
At last the great reward due would be his to have.
<br />
Inspecting the weapon he felt a great joy,
<br />
never before had there been such a toy!
<br />

<br />
85 damage, with just 20 delay.
<br />
And stat boosts and bonuses to make him shout "Yay"
<br />
But to his horror he saw it was no drop,
<br />
Oh well, why sell such a thing in a shop.
<br />

<br />
But thats when he relized with utter disgust,
<br />
That in Verants nerfing he always could trust.
<br />
A staff of such power would never be used,
<br />
He felt so revolted and frankly abused.
<br />

<br />
Far at the bottom, on the base of the stick
<br />
He saw something that made him want to be sick.
<br />
The battle rewards totally stunk.
<br />
The Race was only Gnome, and the class only Monk!
<br />

<br />
All across the world curses were heard
<br />
Gm's all shuddered at the sound of the words.
<br />
They soon showed up, and banned our poor friend.
<br />
And bah humbug to all, this is the end.
