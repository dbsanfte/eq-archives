				<td colspan="2"><span class="postbody">I was tired last night and reading fantasy novels late like i normally do and decided to write. I'm not at all finished with it, but just thought I would post what I have.-----
<br />

<br />
	The sun began to dip below the mountians in Autumndale. It was an unusally warm September evening, the kind one would normally expect in midsummer. Ninia Silverwind cursed softly at the fading light. "What do you suppose it says, Nin?" Her brother asked, staring at the writing that lay etched on a vine covered stone. Ninia rolled her eyes at him. "Between the sun setting and you hanging over my shoulder every two seconds, I can't make out a thing." Elan laughed to himself, not hurt by the tone of his twin. 
<br />
	She had always been like that when she was stuck on something she couldn't quite figure out. All the years of their childhood, he remembered, neither could ever seem to stand one another. Always having a completly different opinion on everything. He was always entranced by the adventurers that would pass through the forest paths, their horses grunting under the weight of their swords and axes, or a hoarde of gold from a recently slain dragon. Her passion was in books, and magic, and everything else he considered to be a waste of time. However, in spite of their differences in opinion, and constant arguing, they were inseperable. Both of them shared a love of the unknown, discovering new things, or at least what was new to them. He thought back to when he and Nin had "discovered" humans for the first time, he could almost hear their parents calling his name, yelling at them for wandering so far from home. 
<br />
	"Elan... Elan!" He snapped out of his daydream just in time avoid a rather large rock aimed at his head. "You going to just stare off into space or will you make yourself useful for once and get me some light!" She mumbled something else about mother was right about him being special, at least thats what he thoght she said, but he wasn't all that concerned with her insults at the moment. "You almost hit me with that! That rock was bigger than my hand!" he said, sounding a bit hurt. "You're lucky I threw a rock and didn't hurl a ball of fire at you!" he looked puzzled for a moment. "Then why do you need me to light a torch if you can just-" An arrow stuck in the dirt about two steps to the left of him. "Gods, first rocks now arrows, Nin watch out!" 
<br />
	His sister hit the ground just in time to miss the arrow that was meant for her chest. She stood up, cursed, and started weaving a spell. Elan was already on his way into the forest, sword drawn. If they were lucky, their attackers were human, and he would have an advantage in the darkness of the trees, but judging by how close those arrows came to them, they could be Elves like themselves, or worse, Dark Elves. 
<br />
	Back at the old stone, Nin finished her spell. Light appeared around three people in the woodline, giving away their positions. They squinted their eyes, blinded for a moment by the sudden light. Elan saw them ahead. He was right, Dark Elves. He took advantage of their having to adjust their eyes and cut through the nearest one to him with ease. The other was faster, already holding a wand in her hand. She yelled a word in Dark Elvish and the light faded, as if the wand absorbed it. Now it was Elan that was at a loss, though normally Elves have no trouble seeing in darkness, the sudden loss of light caught him by suprise and he found himself staring up at the Drows wand.
<br />
	 "Drop the sword, Elf, and your deaths will be quick. I have no time to, ah!" A burst of magic exploded between her and the one behind her, throwing them both in opposite directions. "You talk too much." Ninia said, helping her brother off the ground. The two Drow tried to get up but they were bound by the roots that Nin had cast around them. "You're trespassing on sacred land, Elf!" The drow mage yelled, still struggling to get up. "Those ruins are no business to your kind!" The Drow went on yelling and cursing her. Nin knelt down next to the mage and took her wands from her belt, as well as a few other items of intrest. 
<br />
	"Theif! Give those back!" The woman, or more appropriatly "girl" now that she had a better look at her attackers, screamed at her. They were no older than her and her brother, most likely just curious about the ruins as they had been. But they knew something, she thought. She had referred to it as "sacred land". Nin looked down at the Drow, who had stopped struggling and was now just staring up at her hatefully. "Consider it payment." she said, smiling now, "for making me have to waste three spells on you, not to mention almost putting an arrow in my chest. Besides, you're lucky I let you live, my brother wouldn't be as.. forgiving." 
<br />
	There was a thud behind her and Ninia turned to see her brother sprawled out on the ground. As she raised her hands to start a spell she felt a sharp pain in the back of her head, and her world went dark. 
<br />
				---------------------		------------------------		-----------------------		----------------------
<br />

<br />
	Elan slowly slipped back into conciousness, his head throbbed in pain but there was no mark or wound that he could feel. The sunlight that came through a window next to the bed he lay in felt good, like when he was young and used to lay in the sun and nap when he should have been studying. He looked around at the room, which was simple, but it had a certian charm to it, and definatly a feminine touch. Where exactly was he, Elan wondered. How did he get here, more importantly, what happened to nin. 
<br />
	Last he remembered they were ambushed by two more Drow. One caught him off guard and knocked him out for a few moments. When he came to, his sister was on the ground with a Drow male on her who seemed intent on having a bit of fun before he killed her. He didn't have his sword, he remembered, so he kicked him off Ninia. Then he remembered the feeling of cold steel piercing his chest and the words "That wench had no clue what she took from Shara, did she?" Then a soft laugh. Then nothing. He looked down at his chest. Nothing, not even a bandage. Had he dreamed it, maybe the first blow actually did knock him out?
<br />
	As he stood up, realising he was naked, he pulled the sheet off the bed and wrapped himself in it. Looking out the window he saw a wooden fence and beyond that a lake that seemed to wrap around the house. The grass around the house looked very soft and there were flowers everywhere, some that he had never seen before. The colors were vivid and the way the sun shone on them made the scene out the window look like something in a painting, or maybe a dream. He didn't recognize the forest beyond the lake or the green rolling hills off in the distance. His first question to himself still remained unanswered then, where exactly was he. 
<br />
	"Kinda takes your breath away, doesn't it?" The girls voice that came from behind him was sweet, musical almost. Elan turned around startled. A woman stood in the doorway carrying a plate of food. It smelled delicious. Eggs, biscuits, and the sweet scent of fruits, though he couldn't quite put his finger on what kind they were. His attention moved from the smell of food, and how hungry he now noticed he was, to the woman that stood before him. At first glance she looked like an elf, she was only a bit shorter than he was, her ears came to a point, and her face had the same elongated features that his did, but there was something different. Her skin sparkled in the sunlight, it was almost like it had a light of its own. And her eyes, looking into her eyes he saw all the colors that he saw outside in the yard. They were mainly green, but there were flecks of gold, violet, blue and lavender. Then there was the matter of the wings. Behind her back he could see what looked like the wings on a fairy, but she couldn't be a fairy, she was as big as an elf, or as small as an elf. He pondered the phrase "big as an Elf" for a moment. He always did have a short attention span, he thought.
<br />
	She half waved at him with her free hand, looking rather amused. "Hi." she said to him, laughing. "I'm Coriel," she paused, laughed again and said "And you're staring." Elan blushed and attempted to introduce himself. "I, uh, I'm Elan Silverwind." He blushed more, a bit embarrased for stuttering, and for being naked except for a sheet. She laughed again. "I know who you are Elan, your sister told me all about you." His embarrasment changed to his original concerns. "Ninia, where is she? Is she alright?" She smiled and pushed a few strands of long golden brown hair that had fallen in her face behind her ear. Gods she was beautiful, Elan thought to himself. " Ninia is fine, it was you I was worried about. You were in bad shape when Dar came across you two. Either you two have incredible luck, or the Goddess must really have taken a liking to you. Whatever the case, it's a good thing that ranger came though the stones when he did." Also a good thing that I made him go get me raspberries she mumbled to herself. "Anyway, you'll want to know more, I'm sure, but first you should eat. You've been asleep for a few days and I didn't cook this to throw away. I'll set this on the table here for you, there's clothes in the closet that you can wear, though Dar is quite bigger than you, I'm sure you can find something." With that she set the plate down and left him to his thoughts, and more importantly, his food. Food! He thought to himself, almost rushing to the table, taking a mouthful of fruit.
<br />
	The Food of exquisite, mainly the assortment of fruit. There was honeydew, oranges, slices of a star shaped fruit that he had never seen before, and various berries that he didn't know the name of. The eggs and biscuits filled him up and he felt refreshed, his strength returning. He leaned back in the chair, rubbed his belly and sighed. Even the Burning Leaf Taverns cook Gallak would have trouble topping that. He sat for a moment, letting the food settle in his stomach, as Elan always did eat too fast, then went to the closet and suprisingly managed to fine some clothes that almost fit him. Gar must be human, he guessed from how large most of the clothes were. Elan put the sheet back on the bed, picked up his plate, and went to see his sister.
<br />
	There was a short hallway outside the room with two other doors, other bedrooms he figured. The hall opened up into a large room that, like the room, was simple but warm and comforting. There was a fireplace on one end with a table in front of it and a couch that made a half circle around the table. On the mantle and on shelves around the room were a number of small trinkets, bottles, and jars. Flowers were potted here and there, and dried herbs hung from the ceiling. There was a kitchen area with a small stove, and a dining table where Coriel, Ninea, and a large man, who he assumed was Dar sat drinking tea. He seemed older than the rest of them, streaks of grey ran through his black hair and beard, though being human he was a number of years younger than the elves. Elan didn't bother to guess how old Coriel was, because he didn't exactly know what she was. 
<br />
	"There he is! My lazy brother. Bet you thought you could just stay in bed forever, huh?" Nin said smiling and sipped her tea. "At least I don't wake the neighbors with my snoring." He said as he sat down, proud of his witty comeback. Ninia threw a piece of a muffin at her brother. "I don't snore!" She yelled. "What!?" Nin looked at Coriel and Dar as they laughed. "Oh, bah!" Coriel took her empty cup and Elans plate to the sink. "You're right." she said, "You don't snore. And I haven't had to sleep with my ear plugged for the last three days. More tea anyone?" Ninia started to say something, then sank back in her chair, defeated. 
<br />
	Well now that you're all awake, there are some important matters to discuss. I didn't want to bring it up until Elan woke up so you two you know at the same time." Dar looked at Ninia "Two of the Drow that attacked you managed to escape before I could question them, a lady mage one of her guards. The other two, well they didn't last long enough to get anything meaningful out of them. But the locket, how did you aquire it?" Dar held out a necklace with a silver locket on it. The locket was etched with runes and had four onyx stones set in it. Ninia looked at the locket for a moment. "I've never seen that before. Oh! The mage, I had her trapped and I took her wands and a few other things from her, that must have been one of them. I didn't bother to take a good look at them though, given the situation we were in. It's pretty though." He handed the locket to her. "Yes it is, and I'm sure more than a few people died for the Dark Elves to get their hands on it. That thing has a power about it, and as long as I remember, it's been hunted by just about everyone who knows what it is."
<br />
	Ninia opened the locket. Inside was a painting of a pretty young girl smelling a rose, her hair blowing in the wind. "It's Pretty, like I said, but it's just a locket." Nin put it down on the table and looked up again at Dar.<br />_________________<br />" BAND! "
