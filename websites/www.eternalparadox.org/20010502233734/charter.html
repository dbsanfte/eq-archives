<b>This is rough draft of our charter. Please read it and if possible, print it out so you will have a copy at the meeting to discuss our charter.
<h2>PURPOSE:</h2>

<b>Eternal Paradox is for fun, friendship, honor and helping one
another.&nbsp; We are not a primarily a roleplaying guild but will support
those who wish to roleplay.&nbsp; We are a neutral aligned guild that will
accept all races and classes for the benefit of being able to use all types of
characters to their fullest potential and make our experience in Everquest an
enjoyable one.&nbsp; It is our intent to not only enjoy our kinship and
companionship with one another but to also meet and hunt with other guilds and
individuals.&nbsp; We could like think of our guild as an honorable guild and
not promote any negative actions such as Player Killing (unless dueling or
fighting in the Arena or PvP pits around Norrath), kill stealing, deliberately
causing trains, and being a general nuisance in the current zone that you are
in.</b>&nbsp; 


<h2>NAME:</h2>

<b>The Guild shall be known as Eternal Paradox and shall play on the Drinal Server.</b>

<h2>GOVERNANCE:</h2>

<b><p>Eternal Paradox shall be governed by the Inner Circle which
will be made up of the Guild Leader and seven other Members. Replacement Inner Circle members will
be chosen by remaining Inner Circle Members. Issues are to be decided by a
simple majority and the case of a tie vote, the Guild Leader will have the
deciding vote.</p><br>



<b><p>Members will be divided into two circles: the Circle of
Light which is to be made up of good aligned races and classes and the Circle
of Darkness which is which is to be made up of the evil aligned races and
classes. There is to be an officer in charge of each Circle.</p>


<h2>MEMBERSHIP:</h2>
<p class=MsoNormal>Membership to Eternal Paradox honorable people of any race
and class. Eternal Paradox shall not offer Membership to Player Killers.</p>


<h3>Becoming a Member:</h3> 


People who are well known to current members can be invited
to join the guild without further hunts being required. Other people who want
to join Eternal Paradox must make known to any Member that they seek to join.
The Member will announce in guildsay the name, class and level of the
applicant, in order that Members can seek to the applicant to hunt with them.
 The applicant
will then need to attend five (5) hunts with Members. No more than one hunt
shall be credited per real world day. After the five hunts are completed, the
Members who have hunted with the applicant will attest to the character and
suitability of the applicant. The minimum level to join Eternal Paradox will be level 10 except for alternate
characters of Members.

<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</h2>

If any Member has a problem with another Member, try to
resolve the issues in private tells first. Do not air these problems in
guildchat, please. If the problems can’t be resolved in private tells, inform
an officer of the problem. If the problem is great enough that the officer
can’t help, the Inner Circle may have to deal with the issue.


<h2>RULES, POLICIES AND CODE OF CONDUCT:</h2>

The Guild Leader and the Inner Circle make the rules and policy. Should a particular Rule or Policy be
objectionable, any Member can contact any Officer, and ask for an interpretation or explanation. Should the
Officer be unable to fully answer, the Officer will refer the question to a
member of the Inner Circle. 


<h3>Verant Rules:</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Members of Eternal
Paradox shall, at all times, observe all known rules set by Verant (tm), as may
be amended from time to time and follow the Play Nice Policy. Any knowing
violation of any rule will be grounds for immediate dismissal from the guild.
The final decision concerning dismissal shall be made by the Guild Leader and the Inner Circle.


<h3>Bug Reporting:</h3>

Guild Members shall immediately report any known or
suspected bug to the Council, and to Verant ™ as outlined in the Everquest
manual.

<h3>Aiding Guild Members:</h3>
Members shall always help one another when possible. However players supporting groups are not
expected to leave or endanger their group to render assistance. Members are not
expected to place themselves in situations of sure death, or to help much lower
level Members unfairly. However, Members are expected to offer class based
assistance from time to time, which includes but is not limited to, use of
gained trade skills to craft items for Members at cost, heals and buffs, group
gates, locations of quest items, and quest information, etc. However, Members
are reminded that class based skills and abilities are not to be abused either.
No Member should demand things, such as items, equipment, group gates, heals,
etc. when such items are merely convenient or nice, and not necessary, to the
detriment of the enjoyment of those classes who can provide such goods and
services. Failure to aid a Member should be reported an officer. Willful
failure to aid may be grounds for dismissal depending on the circumstances.

<h3>Aiding Non-Guild Members:</h3>

While Members are required to assist one another, there is
no such general requirement to help non-Members.



<h3>Respecting Guild Members:</h3>
Members shall generally respect the other Members at all times. This is generally meant to
include things such as swearing over guildsay, begging, pestering or otherwise
interfering with the game enjoyment of your fellow Members. At no time should
anyone EVER call another Member a name with malicious intent. Likewise, no
Member should take a jest too seriously. Guildsay is a great tool and a
wonderful method of communication and camaraderie. It is not to be a channel
for complaining, begging, or other such distracting behavior. This general rule
for civility and respect includes any and all interactions between the Guild,
including communications over in-game or out of game channels such as the
website or electronic mail. Any complaint about a violation of this policy
shall be taken before the Inner Circle for further action.
