[Sat Apr 28 20:50:27 2001] Lamminis tells the guild, 'the guild should grow but it should be a controlled growth so as to keep track and not lose the caliber of membership that we have now'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 20:51:49 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'Llwean what he meant was he won't be able to go to the planes with Eternal Paradox because we're not large enough to plan a raid there'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 20:54:21 2001] Merkava tells the guild, 'What I guess I am trying to say is that we need to consider some options. Some of them unpopular.'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 20:55:57 2001] Lamminis tells the guild, 'what are our options......I think we would all like to see the problem solved....I think that we can come up with some suitable solutions'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 20:56:03 2001] Graybor tells the guild, 'lets keep comments, questions on hold till after current member is done with the floor'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:02:17 2001] Kelliana tells the guild, 'I'm not really interested in how fast I can get to 60.  I certainly don't feel held back by this guild'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:02:24 2001] Merkava tells the guild, 'I turn the floor over to Qila...'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:02:24 2001] Velop tells the guild, 'I support the decision of the guild leadership whatever that be obviously no one is suggesting we all jump into another guild as soon as the meeting is over'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:03:03 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'no, nobody is suggesting that at all, Velop'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:03:11 2001] You say to your guild, 'anyway, you have heard Merkava speak of the Knights of Marr..'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:04:40 2001] Llwean tells the guild, 'woopdedoo'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:04:45 2001] You say to your guild, 'they did NOT give up... and neither should we!'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:04:57 2001] Lamminis tells the guild, 'I agree'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:05:05 2001] Llwean tells the guild, 'we're not the Knights of Marr why do we have to hear about them'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:09:37 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'new members they did not know'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:10:22 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'some of them still have regrets about that merger as well.  I don't know if it wasn't well thought out, or the fact that we were allowed wholly to enter the guild, but it was hard on both sides'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:10:51 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'if we take in people from another guild, it is important to not make them feel like stepchildren'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:11:07 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'I think some of the KoM members felt that way and that is why many of us ended up splitting to Drinal'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:11:40 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'yet other guilds have successfully embraced a second guild into their fold.  '<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:13:32 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'we have been friends for longer than half of you have played the game'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:13:42 2001] Xissu tells the guild, 'and those of us that are no longer here are friends too'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:13:54 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'and many of us are friends outside EQ because we are that close to each other.'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:16:06 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'yet we haven't played together for a long time and therein is my concern.  At the moment, with many leaving our guild, there are precious few of us left who can actually play together.'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:16:47 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'we have alternates who can play together, but we haven't been.  for the most part people get pickup groups, as Xissu said'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:17:26 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'I myself feel terrible as a recruiting officer, I have failed the guild in that I haven't made recruiting events'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:17:29 2001] Xissu tells the guild, 'I think a lot of you would be surprised at exactly how high of a level range can group effectively'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:17:49 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'I'm not surprised Xissu.  I can group with Sharard now and he's level 55'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:19:00 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'Merkava's idea of taking in another guild or our joining up with another is a valid one in the sense that more people means more people can plan things.  getting new members higher level who are interested in planning helps that as well.  so 3 options'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:19:05 2001] Xissu tells the guild, 'I am sure you are not ... but some of us have this 5 level stigma... I group with Rarasil from time to time and it works quite nice for both of us I think... he is 11 levels higher than me'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:19:27 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'to be honest, I'm NOT a good planner.  I don't think I was a good leader when I was assistant leader of KoM.'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:20:37 2001] You say to your guild, 'you do know that lemmings mostly just fall in the ocean and drown?'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:20:48 2001] Shaphedra tells the guild, 'perhaps my role as recruiting officer would be better served by someone with more time and energy.  I have a lot of responsibilities with my work that, as you know, keep me away from time to time quite often.'<p>

[Sat Apr 28 21:20:56 2001] Kelliana tells the guild, 'I'm not ready for raids.  I read about "acceptable casualties" and I shudder.  I HATE when members of my group die when I'm the cleric'<p>
