                are different kinds of enchanters. There are
                int/mana enchanters, AC/HP enchanters, cha
                enchanters, nuking enchanters... it all depends
                on what your opinion is of the class, what
                matters and what doesn't. we all have our ways of
                playing. so here i am to rant about how i play my
                class and what role they play.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">everyone
                plays their class their own way, this is just the
                way i play mine. i'm still &quot;evolving&quot;
                of course and i'm constantly learning things as i
                go along... and the rules keep changing to boot.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">NOTE:
                THIS IS PRIMARILY MY OPINION. IF YOU DISAGREE I'M
                SORRY, BUMMER FOR YOU. there's also a lot of
                factual info about spells and durations and stuff
                too.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ahem</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">so.
                i'm always getting these tells from people who
                have either just started playing the game and
                have chosen the path of an enchanter or more
                commonly people who know me that have decided to
                start an enchanter twink. &quot;got any advice
                for a young enchanter?&quot;</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">damn
                straight i do.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">MEZ.
                </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">that's
                our most important job, though more mana goes to
                buffing. an enchanter's job is crowd control.
                there is no class better at it, i don't care what
                those little flaming bards say. =P i also
                emphasize learning the durations of your mezzes.
                know when stuff's gonna wake up and prevent it
                from doing so. i get irritated working with
                chanters who let their mobs wake up. they're not
                supposed to do that. i primarily use entrance and
                enthrall. i actually can't think of the last time
                i had dazzle memmed... unless deceiver was
                playing me =P. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">for
                some reason a lot of people don't seem to realize
                that MEZ IS FIXED DURATION. cool huh? my primary
                mez is entrance, which lasts 72 seconds for 85
                mana. recast is 1.5 seconds after the 2.25 you
                gotta wait for all spells to recycle. my
                secondary mez for raids and stuff is enthrall
                which lasts 48 seconds for 50 mana and recast is
                one quarter of a second. basically instant
                recast. it's slightly more mana efficent and the
                recast is better than entrance but the duration
                is just too short and makes me uncomfortable.
                more than 3 or 4 mobs and you aren't going to be
                able to keep them all asleep when you factor in a
                resist or two. with entrance i can turn stuff off
                and sit around and med a bit and get back up and
                refresh every 60 seconds. makes my life easy cos
                i just watch my second hand on my clock go around
                once.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">and
                then there's dazzle. 96 seconds for 125 mana and
                2.75 second recovery after spells recycle. i
                don't like the duration/mana ratio on this at all
                and the recast is just too long. the additional
                24 seconds over entrance just isn't worth it to
                me and the whole 2 or 3 days i used dazzle i had
                mana problems. entrance is just easier to time
                and costs less. i can keep 3 mobs asleep with
                entrance without really losing any mana if i sit
                and med between. BUT that's just me, my
                experience and my comfort zone.</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">what
                was my point? oh yeah. learn your mez, whichever
                one it is. get used to timing it and know the
                mana cost. if you have your timing down you can
                med a lot durring battles. usually if they pull 4
                or 5 mobs i'm back to 80 or fm by the time they
                have killed the last one just cos i know how long
                i can safely med between recasts. theft of
                thought helps too =P</font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">okay,
                so anyone can hit their friggin mez hotkey and
                make something go to sleep if they don't get a
                resist. in actuality the most difficult part of
                being an enchanter when it comes to fighting in
                dungeons is targetting quickly and casting under
                attack. you gotta pick the one mob the tank isn't
                on and then click on just the right pixel to get
                his friend next. pay attention to the little
                glowing names above the mobs' heads. if you have
                4 froglok dar knights that's the only bloody way
                you're gonna know if the one that's still awake
                is the one you have targetted. if i'm having a
                problem targetting the one that's still awake,
                i'll cast a color stun (the level 4 stun is my
                favorite, 1 second cast time and lasts 4 seconds
                and costs 20 mana), esc my target, then wait for
                the one that's awake to hit me. if it's one of
                the quicker hitting mobs cast another stun (i
                always always have at least 2 color stuns memmed,
                the level 4 and the level 52) and then mez. </font></p>
                <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">color
                stuns will save yer ass about as often as mez
                will. however, used incorrectly they'll also get
                you killed. they vary in cast time, range and
                mana. </font></p>

                face="Verdana">See the pattern? they get longer
                in duration and larger in range but longer in
                cast time before color slant. color slant is a
                nasty mana cost but i use it anyway because the
                shorter cast time makes a difference. because
                it's 1.5 seconds instead of 2, i can cast color
                flux then immediately cast color slant and
                everything stays stunned. i cannot emphasize how
                useful the level 4 stun is. the range is small
                but that's actually a good thing. it keeps you
                from aggroing whatever else is in the room being
                fought and just gets whatever is on you at the
                time off for a second. it'll unstun just as you
                finish casting mez but if you've moved during the
                2.25 seconds you're waiting for the spells to
                recycle you should be able to cast mez before it
                gets to you to interrupt. even if it gets to you
                you can usually regain thru 1 or 2 hits.</font></p>
