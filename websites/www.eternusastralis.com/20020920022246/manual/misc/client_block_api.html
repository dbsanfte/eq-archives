    <h1 align="CENTER">Reading Client Input in Apache 1.2</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>Apache 1.1 and earlier let modules handle POST and PUT
    requests by themselves. The module would, on its own, determine
    whether the request had an entity, how many bytes it was, and
    then called a function (<code>read_client_block</code>) to get
    the data.</p>

    <p>However, HTTP/1.1 requires several things of POST and PUT
    request handlers that did not fit into this module, and all
    existing modules have to be rewritten. The API calls for
    handling this have been further abstracted, so that future HTTP
    protocol changes can be accomplished while remaining
    backwards-compatible.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>The New API Functions</h3>
<pre>
   int ap_setup_client_block (request_rec *, int read_policy);
   int ap_should_client_block (request_rec *);
   long ap_get_client_block (request_rec *, char *buffer, int buffer_size);
</pre>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Call <code>ap_setup_client_block()</code> near the
        beginning of the request handler. This will set up all the
        necessary properties, and will return either OK, or an
        error code. If the latter, the module should return that
        error code. The second parameter selects the policy to
        apply if the request message indicates a body, and how a
        chunked transfer-coding should be interpreted. Choose one
        of 
<pre>
    REQUEST_NO_BODY          Send 413 error if message has any body
    REQUEST_CHUNKED_ERROR    Send 411 error if body without Content-Length
    REQUEST_CHUNKED_DECHUNK  If chunked, remove the chunks for me.
    REQUEST_CHUNKED_PASS     Pass the chunks to me without removal.
</pre>
        In order to use the last two options, the caller MUST
        provide a buffer large enough to hold a chunk-size line,
        including any extensions.
      </li>

      <li>When you are ready to possibly accept input, call
      <code>ap_should_client_block()</code>. This will tell the
      module whether or not to read input. If it is 0, the module
      should assume that the input is of a non-entity type
      (<em>e.g.</em>, a GET request). A nonzero response indicates
      that the module should proceed (to step 3). This step also
      sends a 100 Continue response to HTTP/1.1 clients, so should
      not be called until the module is
      <strong>*definitely*</strong> ready to read content.
      (otherwise, the point of the 100 response is defeated). Never
      call this function more than once.</li>

      <li>Finally, call <code>ap_get_client_block</code> in a loop.
      Pass it a buffer and its size. It will put data into the
      buffer (not necessarily the full buffer, in the case of
      chunked inputs), and return the length of the input block.
      When it is done reading, it will return 0 if EOF, or -1 if
      there was an error.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As an example, please look at the code in
    <code>mod_cgi.c</code>. This is properly written to the new API
    guidelines.</p>
