      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">So, you`re 
        interested in becoming a member of Eternus Astralis are you?</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eternus Astralis 
        is always looking for exceptional individuals who can bring something 
        special to our guild. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are a 
        raiding guild and thus, we spend the majority of our time raiding alot. 
        Therefor, we are not interested in casual gamers. If you have the time 
        to dedicate to raiding and the eagerness to do new and fun things, then 
        Eternus Astralis is a good pick. Eternus Astralis raids on average between 
        3 and 4 days a week, the other 3 and 4 days are spent however our members 
        like. However, if you do not have the time to spend during our 3-4 days 
        of mandatory raid days, then unfortunately Eternus Astralis is not the 
        guild for you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As we are 
        not looking for one specific class at the moment, the best way to becoming 
        a member would be to make friends by getting to know us by grouping with 
        us, raiding with us and etc. By doing this, we get to know you as well 
        and if we feel you have the right attitude, discipline and skill, we will 
        extend an invitation to become part of our family.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">You must 
        let us know of your interest in joining by posting in our <a href="http://pub48.ezboard.com/feternusastralis25155frm6">Recruitment 
        Requests section</a> on our <a href="http://pub48.ezboard.com/beternusastralis25155">message 
        board</a>. Be sure to tell us about yourself, about why you want to join 
        EA and how you think you would contribute to bettering our guild. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After posting, 
        get to know us, make friends in the guild, make a name for yourself. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When we feel 
        you are known enough and have the right attitude, we will move your application 
        to our private section for the vote. Our recruiting officer, Linxs, will 
        create a post in our members section where members will have one week 
        (1 week) to vote. <u>A minimum</u> of <i>25 sponsors</i> are required 
        to pass with <i>no more than</i> <i>5 votes against</i>. After the 1 week 
        period, Linxs will inform you on the outcome of the vote. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. If you 
        do not pass the vote because you have more than <i>5 votes against</i>, 
        that usually means you have some issues to work out with a few members 
        before being able to reapply. You will not be able to reapply for a period 
        of 2 months.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. If you 
        do not pass the vote because you have less than <i>25 sponsors</i> *and* 
        you have <i>no more than 5 votes against</i>, this usually means not enough 
        people know you and you must continue to make friends in the guild and 
        make yourself known to our members. You will be able to reapply in 3 weeks 
        time. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eternus Astralis 
        requires the following to even be considered for membership : </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. You must 
        be of a <u>minimum level of 57</u> (although the higher the better).<br>
        2. You must attend a minimum of 5 raids with EA (raid of 3 groups or more).<br>
        3. You must have Ruins of Kunark and Scars of Velious.<br>
        4. You must have your Sebilis Key.<br>
        5. You must have a minimum of 25 members ready to sponsor you.<br>
        6. You must have no more than 5 votes against.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>

        <font color="#FF9900">Important Requirement</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We oblige 
        all prospects to work out any problems or conflicts they may have with 
        current Eternus Astralis members. Preservation of harmony between guildmates 
        is imperative to our success and achievement of our goals. Thus, if a 
        prospect is seen has having too many conflicts* with existing members, 
        the prospect will not receive an invitation (even if the minimum requirements 
        are met) until the conflicts are worked out.</font></p>

        <font color="#FF9800">The "MORTAL ENEMY" clause </font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If a candidate 
        has wronged an Eternus Astralis member to the point where if that candidate 
        were to join the current member would leave, that candidate cannot continue 
        in the process. Eternus Astralis has built our tight family atmosphere 
        by being, well, a tight knit family. Officers will ALWAYS side with the 
        guild in these kinds of matters. It should be noted however that invocation 
        of this clause requires an investigation into the situation between the 
        candidate and the member, and is not to be used lightly. Abuse of this 
        clause is against Eternus Astralis policy and carries with it heavy consequences 
        (suspension, guild removal). </font></p>

        Membership</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> If the candidate 
        has met the above criteria, then the candidate is invited to the guild 
        by either the Admissions Officer (Linxs) or the Guild Leader (Rovell). 
        He/she will have access to our guild tag, chat, and private message board. 
        As a provisional member, they are on a one (1) month probational term. 
        During this probationary period the new member is required to do the following: 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1. Disband 
        from their current guild (if applicable). <br>
        2. Acquire resistance gear (100 for all resistances, not concurrently) 
        <br>
        3. Acquire a water-breathing device (or have the ability to cast the appropriate 
        spell). <br>
        4. Learn and follow guild policy. <br>
        5. Attend scheduled raids (if they are online). <br>
        6. Attend scheduled guild meetings (unless RL circumstances do not allow). 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Failure to 
        meet these requirements at the end of the one month term is grounds for 
        dismissal. </font></p>

        members are NOT permitted to use the Eternus Astralis guild tag in any 
        public posts during their probational period. They are also NOT permitted 
        to post any derogatory or defaming comments about any player or guild 
        without the express permission of the guild leader. Violation of this 
        policy is grounds for immediate dismissal. </font></p>
