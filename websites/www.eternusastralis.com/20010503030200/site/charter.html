      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<font size="3"></font>It 
        is said even among the most intelligent races that life began upon Norrath 
        with the swipe of Veeshan’s claws. Long before that time though the stars 
        watched the nameless rock for untold eons. No one really knows where the 
        stars came from. Some say they are decorations placed in the infinite 
        space for the Nameless One to enjoy. Some even say they are spirits of 
        heroes from long forgotten ages. Whether spirits or adornment doesn’t 
        really matter, what matters is they are eternal. The stars were there 
        before this world began and they will be here when Norrath is no more. 
        Such is our guilds name – Eternus Astralis. The name comes from a language 
        long forgotten by Norrath’s inhabitants but when translated means “eternal 
        star.” It is a wish for members of this guild to spread the knowledge 
        that we serve a greater purpose in the cosmos than just achieving a level 
        or wearing an item. Living and enjoying life are the paramount focus of 
        this gathered body of people, spirits if you will. When you see someone 
        with the name of Eternus Astralis in your travels, or when you look up 
        some night and see the stars watching you, remember that what you do creates 
        ripples upon the pond of history that echo in eternity. </font></p>

        is lead by one Leader and a set of Officers who make up the High Council. 
        The High Council is in place to assure a solid leadership, to assure that 
        the goals and objectives of the guild are carried out, to see to the best 
        interests of the guild and it`s members as we all strive to be the best 
        we can.</font></p>

        and Ideology of Eternus Astralis</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eternus Astralis 
        is a raid orientated guild. This doesn't mean we will be elitist or exclusionary. 
        It just means we enjoy pummeling mass quantities of things together and 
        at the same time. The most important part of any organization or guild 
        are the members who belong to it. As we grow in members and in levels, 
        we will strive to tackle bigger and stronger foes, bigger and more difficult 
        challenges. </font></p>

        is expected of a member of Eternus Astralis</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 
        an EA member will focus on being the best player that they possibly can 
        be. Willingness to help anyone should they need it is paramount. Courtesy 
        and respect need to be adhered to at all times. If things are getting 
        so heated in game and you cannot see straight and feel like blowing off 
        steam do it offline and not in guild chat or ooc. Obscene language needs 
        to be held to a minimum. While I know certain situations may call for 
        a "slip" now and then keep it in-group or in tells not in shout, OOC or 
        guild chat. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although 
        it is not required for all members to attend every single event we organize, 
        it is strongly encouraged and is paramount for certain raids, etc, to 
        have maximum assistance (ie.: Venril Sathir, Trakanon, other uber mobs). 
        Being on time and showing up when you say you will show up are keys to 
        success and must be taken very seriously. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your guild 
        should always come first when you are online and are needed, it is your 
        family.</font></p>

        a member of Eternus Astralis</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refer to 
        our Joining Section. <a href="joining.html">Click here</a>.</font></p>
      <p><img src="images/circle.gif" width="15" height="10"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF6633"><font size="2" color="#FF9900">Raids</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During a 
        raid there can only be ONE leader and it is expected that when you participate 
        in any raid you respect that leader whether he/she is EA or not. If you 
        have a disagreement with the leader then handle before the raid or after 
        the raid in tells. If you find it too hard to continue in the raid then 
        politely bow out and hold your opinions to yourself and discuss with the 
        leader AFTER the raid has concluded. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being punctual 
        on a raid is very important. When a raid is scheduled to start at 7pm 
        EST, it is at 7pm EST and not 7:15pm EST. Those who come late should not 
        expect to have a spot on the raid unless otherwise noted, of course there 
        are exceptions, but as a general rule, don`t be late.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As a general 
        practice EA raids will be merit/ looted. The characters that have participated 
        in more raids will be eligible for no drop stuff first. Remember that 
        you may not get anything this time but eventually your turn will come. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participation 
        is expected if at all possible. If you are online during a scheduled raid 
        and help is needed then by all means drop in. The whole purpose of EA 
        is to have fun with friends so if a friend is in need don't hesitate to 
        drop what you are doing and come help. </font><br>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We are currently 
        debating whether or not we should implement a points system for loot. 
        For the time being, loot is being handled by merit. Those who invest the 
        most time will be eligible for an item first. Earn it to own it as they 
        say. Remember that everybody`s time will come, you may not get anything 
        this time, but eventually your turn will come. </font></p>
