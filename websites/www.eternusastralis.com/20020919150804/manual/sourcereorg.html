    <h1 align="CENTER">Source Re-organisation</h1>
    As of 1.3, the Apache source directories have been
    re-organised. This re-organisation is designed to simplify the
    directory structure, make it easier to add additional modules,
    and to give module authors a way of specifying compile time
    options or distribute binary modules. 

    <h2>Summary of Changes</h2>
    The source changes are: 

    <ul>
      <li>The non-module source files have moved from
      <code>src</code> into <code>src/main</code></li>

      <li>The module source files previously in <code>src</code>
      have moved to <code>src/modules/standard</code></li>

      <li>The <code>support</code> directory is now in
      <code>src/support</code></li>

      <li>The existing symbol names used for global Apache function
      and variable identifiers have been renamed in the source.
      This way namespace conflicts are avoided when linking Apache
      with third-party libraries. See the file
      <code>src/include/compat.h</code> both for the list of
      renamed symbol names and for a way to get source backward
      compatibility in existing third-party module sources.</li>
    </ul>
    In addition, the following enhancements have been made: 

    <ul>
      <li>OS abstractions can be added in the <code>src/os</code>
      directory. Currently this contains information for unix, OS/2
      and Windows 32 platforms.</li>

      <li><code>Configuration</code> syntax has been simplified for
      adding new modules. Users no longer need to enter the
      module's structure name. In addition, new modules can be
      located anywhere on the file system, or typically in new or
      existing directories under <code>src/modules</code>.</li>

      <li>Module authors can give simpler instructions for adding
      their modules to Apache compilation. They can also now
      provide compile time information required by
      <code>Configure</code>, such as additional libraries
      required.</li>

      <li>Module authors can distribute pre-compiled (.a or .o)
      versions of their modules if required, along with a "module
      definition file" which contains the information required by
      <code>Configure</code>.</li>

      <li>All the sub-directories (main, modules/* and os/*) are
      built as libraries.</li>

      <li>The new Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) script
      named <code>configure</code> replaced the old top-level
      <code>Makefile</code> and
      <code>src/helpers/InstallApache</code> stuff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Adding Modules</h2>
    Modules are added to Apache by adding a reference to them in
    <code>src/Configuration</code> then running
    <code>Configure</code> and <code>make</code>. In earlier
    version of Apache before 1.3, the line added to Configuration
    looked like this: 
<pre>
  Module    status_module    mod_status.o
</pre>
    From 1.3 onwards, the <code>AddModule</code> line should be
    used instead, and typically looks like this: 
<pre>
  AddModule    modules/standard/mod_status.o
</pre>
    The argument to AddModule is the path, relative to
    <code>src</code>, to the module file's source or object file. 

    <p>Normally when adding a module you should follow the
    instructions of the module author. However if the module comes
    as a single source file, say mod_foo.c, then the recommended
    way to add the module to Apache is as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Put <code>mod_foo.c</code> into the directory
      <code>src/modules/extra</code></li>

      <li>Go to the <code>src</code> directory and add the
      following line to <code>Configuration</code><br />
       <code>AddModule modules/extra/mod_foo.o</code></li>

      <li>Run <code>./Configure</code></li>

      <li>Run <code>make</code></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New Facilities for Module Authors</h2>
    In previous releases of Apache, new modules were added to the
    <code>src</code> directory, and if the module required any
    additional compilation options (such as libraries) they would
    have to be added to <code>Configuration</code>. Also the user
    would have to be told the module's structure name to add on the
    Module line of <code>Configuration</code>. 

    <p>From Apache 1.3 onwards, module authors can make use of
    these new features:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simplified <code>Configuration</code> command AddModule
      which only requires a path to the module source or object
      file</li>

      <li>If the module requires compile time options (such as
      extra libraries) these can be specified in the module file
      source or an external "module definition file".</li>

      <li>If a module is distributed as binary (.o or .a) then an
      external "module definition file" can also be distributed
      which gives the information Configure needs to add the
      module, such as extra libraries and the module's structure
      name.</li>

      <li>Modules can be installed anywhere on the file system,
      although a directory under <code>src/modules</code> is
      recommended.</li>

      <li>If the module is in its own directory, Apache can
      automatically create a Makefile to build the module given a
      file containing the module's dependencies.</li>

      <li>For building a third-party module
      <strong>outside</strong> the Apache source tree the new
      <code>apxs</code> support tool can be used to compile the
      module into a <a href="dso.html">dynamic shared object
      (DSO)</a>, install it into the existing Apache installation
      and optionally activating it in the Apache
      <code>httpd.conf</code> file. The only requirement is that
      Apache has DSO-support for the used platform and the module
      <code><a href="mod/mod_so.html">mod_so</a></code> was built
      into the server binary <code>httpd</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    The rest of this document shows how to package modules for
    Apache 1.3 and later and what to tell end-users of the module. 

    <h3>Building a simple source distribution</h3>
    Consider a simple add-on module, distributed as a single file.
    For example, say it is called mod_demo.c. The archive for this
    module should consist of two files, in a suitable directory
    name. For example: 

    <ul>
      <li>mod_demo/mod_demo.c</li>

      <li>mod_demo/Makefile.tmpl</li>
    </ul>
    (Of course end-user instructions, README's, etc can also be
    supplied in the archive). The end user should be told to
    extract this archive in the <code>src/modules</code> directory
    of their Apache source tree. This will create a new directory
    <code>src/modules/mod_demo</code>. Then they need to add the
    following line to the <code>Configuration</code> file: 
<pre>
  AddModule  modules/mod_demo/mod_demo.o
</pre>
    then run <code>Configure</code> and <code>make</code> as
    normal. 

    <p>The <code>mod_demo/Makefile.tmpl</code> should contain the
    dependencies of the module source. For example, a simple module
    which just interfaces to some standard Apache module API
    functions might look this this:</p>
<pre>
  mod_demo.o: mod_demo.c $(INCDIR)/httpd.h $(INCDIR)/http_protocol.h
</pre>
    When the user runs <code>Configure</code> Apache will create a
    full makefile to build this module. If this module also
    requires some additional built-time options to be given, such
    as libraries, see the next section. 

    <p>If the module also comes with header files, these can be
    added to the archive. If the module consists of multiple source
    files it can be built into a library file using a supplied
    makefile. In this case, distribute the makefile as
    <code>mod_demo/Makefile</code> and <strong>do not</strong>
    include a <code>mod_demo/Makefile.tmpl</code>. If
    <code>Configure</code> sees a <code>Makefile.tmpl</code> it
    assumes it is safe to overwrite any existing
    <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

    <p>See the Apache <code>src/modules/standard</code> for an
    example of a module directory where the makefile is created
    automatically from a Makefile.tmpl file (note that this
    directory also shows how to distribute multiple modules in a
    single directory). See <code>src/modules/proxy</code> and
    <code>src/modules/example</code> for examples of modules built
    using custom makefiles (to build a library and an object file,
    respectively).</p>

    <h3>Adding Compile time Information</h3>
    Apache source files (or module definition files, see below) can
    contain information used by <code>Configure</code> to add
    compile-time options such as additional libraries. For example,
    if mod_demo in the example above also requires that Apache be
    linked against a DBM library, then the following text could be
    inserted into the mod_demo.c source: 
<pre>
/*
 * Module definition information - the part between the -START and -END
 * lines below is used by Configure. This could be stored in a separate
 * instead.
 *
 * MODULE-DEFINITION-START
 * Name: demo_module
 * ConfigStart
    LIBS="$LIBS $DBM_LIB"
    if [ "X$DBM_LIB" != "X" ]; then
        echo " + using $DBM_LIB for mod_demo"
    fi
 * ConfigEnd
 * MODULE-DEFINITION-END
 */
</pre>
    Note that this is contained inside a C language comment to hide
    it from the compiler. Anything between the lines which contains
    <code>MODULE-DEFINITION-START</code> and
    <code>MODULE-DEFINITION-END</code> is used by
    <code>Configure</code>. The <code>Name:</code> line gives the
    module's structure name. This is not really necessary in this
    case since if not present <code>Configure</code> will guess at
    a name based on the filename (<em>e.g.</em>, given "mod_demo"
    it will remove the leading "mod_" and append "_module" to get a
    structure name. This works with all modules distributed with
    Apache). 

    <p>The lines between <code>ConfigStart</code> and
    <code>ConfigEnd</code> as executed by <code>Configure</code>
    and can be used to add compile-time options and libraries. In
    this case it adds the DBM library (from $DBM_LIB) to the
    standard compilation libraries ($LIB) and displays a
    message.</p>

    <p>See the default distribution's mod_auth_dbm.c for an example
    of an embedded module definition.</p>

    <h3>Module Definition Information for Binary Distribitions</h3>
    If the module is to be distributed as binary (object or
    library) rather than source, it is not possible to add the
    module definition information to the source file. In this case
    it can be placed in a separate file which has the same base
    name as the object or library file, but with a
    <code>.module</code> extension. So, for example, if the
    distributed module object file is mod_demo.o, the module
    definition file should be called mod_demo.module. It contains
    the same information as above, but does not need to be inside a
    C comment or delimited with
    <code>MODULE-DEFINITION-START</code> <em>etc.</em> For example:
    
<pre>
Name: demo_module
ConfigStart
 LIBS="$LIBS $DBM_LIB"
 if [ "X$DBM_LIB" != "X" ]; then
     echo " + using $DBM_LIB for mod_demo"
 fi
ConfigEnd
</pre>
    See the default distribution's mod_auth_db.module for an
    example of a separate module definition file.
