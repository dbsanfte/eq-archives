    <h1 align="CENTER">Multiple Log Files</h1>
    It is now possible to specify multiple log files, each with a
    fully customizable format. This is compatible with existing
    configurations. Multiple log files are implemented as part of
    the <a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a> module
    which as of Apache 1.2 is the default log module. 
    <hr />

    <h2>Using Multiple Log Files</h2>
    Multiple log files be created with either the
    <code>TransferLog</code> or <code>CustomLog</code> directive.
    These directives can be repeated to create more than one log
    file (in previous releases, only one logfile could be given per
    server configuration). The <code>TransferLog</code> directive
    creates a log file in the standard "common log format",
    although this can be customized with <code>LogFormat</code>.
    The syntax of these two directives is the same as for the
    config log module in previous Apache releases. 

    <p>The real power of multiple log files come from the ability
    to create log files in different formats. For example, as well
    as a CLF transfer log, the server could log the user agent of
    each client, or the referrer information, or any other aspect
    of the request, such as the language preferences of the
    user.</p>

    <p>The new <code>CustomLog</code> directive takes both a
    filename to log to, and a log file format.</p>
    <hr />
    <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Syntax"
    rel="Help"><strong>Syntax:</strong></a> CustomLog <em>filename
    "format"</em><br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Context"
    rel="Help"><strong>Context:</strong></a> server config, virtual
    host<br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Status"
    rel="Help"><strong>Status:</strong></a> base<br />
     <a href="mod/directive-dict.html#Module"
    rel="Help"><strong>Module:</strong></a> mod_log_config 

    <p>The first argument is the filename to log to. This is used
    exactly like the argument to <code>TransferLog</code>, that is,
    it is either a file as a full path or relative to the current
    server root, or |programname. Be aware that anyone who can
    write to the directory where a log file is written can gain
    access to the uid that starts the server. See the <a
    href="misc/security_tips.html">security tips</a> document for
    details.</p>

    <p>The format argument specifies a format for each line of the
    log file. The options available for the format are exactly the
    same as for the argument of the <code>LogFormat</code>
    directive. If the format includes any spaces (which it will do
    in almost all cases) it should be enclosed in double
    quotes.</p>

    <h3>Use with Virtual Hosts</h3>
    If a &lt;VirtualHost&gt; section does not contain any
    <code>TransferLog</code> or <code>CustomLog</code> directives,
    the logs defined for the main server will be used. If it does
    contain one or more of these directives, requests serviced by
    this virtual host will only be logged in the log files defined
    within its definition, not in any of the main server's log
    files. See the examples below. 
    <hr />

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    To create a normal (CLF) format log file in logs/access_log,
    and a log of user agents: 
<pre>
TransferLog logs/access_log
CustomLog   logs/agents     "%{user-agent}i"
</pre>
    To define a CLF transfer log and a referrer log which log all
    accesses to both the main server and a virtual host: 
<pre>
TransferLog logs/access_log
CustomLog   logs/referer    "%{referer}i"

&lt;VirtualHost&gt;
  DocumentRoot   /whatever
  ServerName     my.virtual.host
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
    Since no TransferLog or CustomLog directives appear inside the
    &lt;VirtualHost&gt; section, any requests for this virtual host
    will be logged in the main server's log files. If however the
    directive 
<pre>
TransferLog logs/vhost_access_log
</pre>
    was added inside the virtual host definition, then accesses to
    this virtual host will be logged in vhost_access_log file (in
    common log format), and <em>not</em> in logs/access_log or
    logs/referer.     <hr />
