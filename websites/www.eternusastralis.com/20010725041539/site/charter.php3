            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;<font size="3"></font>It 
              is said even among the most intelligent races that life began upon 
              Norrath with the swipe of Veeshan’s claws. Long before that time 
              though the stars watched the nameless rock for untold eons. No one 
              really knows where the stars came from. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
              say they are decorations placed in the infinite space for the Nameless 
              One to enjoy. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some 
              even say they are spirits of heroes from long forgotten ages. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Whether 
              spirits or adornment doesn’t really matter, what matters is they 
              are eternal. The stars were there before this world began and they 
              will be here when Norrath is no more. Such is our guilds name – 
              Eternus Astralis. The name comes from a language long forgotten 
              by Norrath’s inhabitants but when translated means “eternal star.” 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">It 
              is a wish for members of this guild to spread the knowledge that 
              we serve a greater purpose in the cosmos than just achieving a level 
              or wearing an item. Living and enjoying life are the paramount focus 
              of this gathered body of people, spirits if you will. When you see 
              someone with the name of Eternus Astralis in your travels, or when 
              you look up some night and see the stars watching you, remember 
              that what you do creates ripples upon the pond of history that echo 
              in eternity.&quot;</font></p>

              Astralis is lead by one Leader and a set of Officers who make up 
              the High Council. The High Council is in place to assure a solid 
              leadership, to assure that the goals and objectives of the guild 
              are carried out, to see to the best interests of the guild and it`s

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Eternus 
              Astralis is a raid orientated guild. This doesn't mean we will be 
              elitist or exclusionary. It just means we enjoy pummeling mass quantities 
              of things together and at the same time. The most important part 
              of any organization or guild are the members who belong to it. As 
              we grow in members and in levels, we will strive to tackle bigger 
              and stronger foes, bigger and more difficult challenges. </font></p>

              is expected of a member of Eternus Astralis</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Overall, 
              an EA member will focus on being the best player that they possibly 
              can be. Willingness to help anyone should they need it is paramount. 
              Courtesy and respect need to be adhered to at all times. If things 
              are getting so heated in game and you cannot see straight and feel 
              like blowing off steam do it offline and not in guild chat or ooc. 
              Obscene language needs to be held to a minimum. While I know certain 
              situations may call for a "slip" now and then keep it in-group or 
              in tells not in shout, OOC or guild chat. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Although 
              it is not required for all members to attend every single event 
              we organize, it is strongly encouraged and is paramount for certain 
              raids, etc, to have maximum assistance (ie.: Venril Sathir, Trakanon, 
              other uber mobs). Being on time and showing up when you say you 
              will show up are keys to success and must be taken very seriously. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your 
              guild should always come first when you are online and are needed, 
              it is your family.</font></p>

              a member of Eternus Astralis</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Refer 
              to our Membership Section. <a href="membership.php3">Click here</a>.</font></p>
            <p><img src="img/button.gif" width="20" height="14"> <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#FF6633"><font size="2" color="#FF9900">Raids</font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">During 
              a raid there can only be ONE leader and it is expected that when 
              you participate in any raid you respect that leader whether he/she 
              is EA or not. If you have a disagreement with the leader then handle 
              before the raid or after the raid in tells. If you find it too hard 
              to continue in the raid then politely bow out and hold your opinions 
              to yourself and discuss with the leader AFTER the raid has concluded. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Being 
              punctual on a raid is very important. When a raid is scheduled to 
              start at 7pm EST, it is at 7pm EST and not 7:15pm EST. Those who 
              come late should not expect to have a spot on the raid unless otherwise 
              noted, of course there are exceptions, but as a general rule, don`t 
              be late.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
              a general practice EA raids will be merit/ looted. The characters 
              that have participated in more raids will be eligible for no drop 
              stuff first. Remember that you may not get anything this time but 
              eventually your turn will come. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participation 
              is expected if at all possible. If you are online during a scheduled 
              raid and help is needed then by all means drop in. The whole purpose 
              of EA is to have fun with friends so if a friend is in need don't 
              hesitate to drop what you are doing and come help. </font><br>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Loot 
              in Eternus Astralis is done by Merit and is usually decided by EA`s 
              Leader, Officers and select raid leaders. Each Guild has a different 
              perspective on what merit means for them. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
              Eternus Astralis, merit means : </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. <i>A<b>ttendance/Participation</b></i> 
              : EA is a raiding guild and thus, raids alot. Coming to raids is 
              not only required but it plays a big role in determining Merit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.<b><i>Attitude</i></b> 
              : Having a positive, winning attitude is the way to go. Nobody wants 
              to listen to people complain about how long a pull is taking or 
              about their chances for loot or etc. Our member`s attitude reflects 
              also on guild morale which *does* have an effect on the outcome 
              of a raid.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.<i><b>Dedication</b></i> 
              : Being dedicated to the guild, staying the full duration of raids, 
              going out of your way to help here and there, etc.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.<i><b>Need</b></i> 
              : Is this an item that will benefit one class over another class? 
              Will this item benefit one person more than another based on what 
              they are currently using?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">.<i><b>Levels</b></i> 
              : Levels are the most important investment you can make for your 
              character and Eternus Astralis. There are so many benefits of reaching 
              that magical number which is 60. Although level plays a minimal 
              part in Merit, it still plays a part.</font></p>
