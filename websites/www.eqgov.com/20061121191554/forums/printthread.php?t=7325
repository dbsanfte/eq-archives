			<div><strong>2004 DVD release Review!</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>Well thought i would give my incite on the DVD releases of this past year.<br />
Keep in mind this is my opinion so say what you want about it :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets start off with some easy ones<br />
<br />
Spider-man 2- Well another dashing return to the dvd Kristen and that dood that played spiderman like any one cared who he was.  Well this movie kept the meaning of a Sequel wasnt the greatest movie but hey we got to see Kristen wet in the rain again and its a plus. 4 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Harry Potter 3- Being a part of the great series of Books this was a major dissappointment to me.  The actors/kids came into there prime in this movie and the with great stars like Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman i cant say it was all that bad.  But the Storyline was so rushed during this movie they missed out on important information containing to all the books.  Id like to see them make the 4 book into a movie since it was the best book imo. 7 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings Return of the King (both Version)- Alright well i digged the first two movies and the third kept its way stayed as close to the story as they could but did we really need 5 different endings i mean end the movie already. 6 outta 10 star<br />
<br />
Collateral- I must say that even in Tom Cruises age he still has the great acting ablity like in TOp Gun.  Rising Star Jamie Foxx gave this movie what it needed.  Suspense Thrilling and all around Great Movie. It keeps you wondering what is going to happen at the next stop. Havent seen it you should see it.  8 outta 10 stars/<br />
<br />
Wimeldon- Okay its a romantic comedy typical girl meets boy boy and girl fall in love one leaves the other one to return in the end yeah we seen this a million times. but in Wimbeldon its a tad bit different its Girl meets and OLD guy and they fall in love,  with the tennis thing in the middle of the realtionship it kinda gave the movie a different twist humor and the same fancy love you all came to love in Pretty in Pink exsist in this movie.  and its a Kristen Dunst movie so its always a plus to see her in anything but sorry fellas no nudity again.  5 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
I. Robot- all i got to say is WTF WTF WTF its a Will Smith Future movie of total crap.  Is it just me or does this guy every play a different character lets take a look at the other great Blunders hes made, Men in Black 2, Independence Day, Bad Boys i mean he plays the same wanna be bad ass cop person in each flim.  Put him in a movie where he actually has to act like a different person you might win over my 15 bucks. 2 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Pirates of the Caribbean- Johnny Depp this guys been around a long time and still making great movies starring along side Orlando Bloom *LOTR Legolaus* and Geoffry Rush the three of these actors put on hell of a show and preformance Action, Sword play, pirates, and ugly drunk wenches hey what more can you ask for.  8 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Eurotrip- Okay this movie came from the same people that did Old School and Road Trip and well this is just like Road Trip but its in Euro.  If you dig Cheap laughs and occasional female nudity this is the movie for you.<br />
4 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Underworld- Well this was probably a good movie if i could stay awake long enough for it start, Movie starts way to slow to keep interest in me. 1 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
The Chronicles of Riddick- Now to me Vin Diesel is a horrible actor but girls just want to see him with out his shirt on. Being the prequil or Sequel cuz well it makes sense either way it works it was actually a good story line and a pretty well laid out film.  The movie had no big name actors or actress in it so it brings you back to watching Vins poor acting ablities but he is actually a decent action actor its worth renting the movie for 2 hours of action but dont waste your 15 bucks on it. 6 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Dreamcatcher- was release really early in the year or late last year but i figured it needed to make the list.  Now most of the Stephen King books that become movies arent that great.  This was a bit different i actually enjoyed watching this movie the story line was really original and the actors were pure.  Was nice seeing Jason Lee in a movie that didnt have Kevin Smiths name on it.  Also having one of the great supporting actors of today Tom Sizemore (dont let the jail time hes doing atm fool you hes a great supporting actor).  8 outta 10 stars <br />
<br />
Matchstick Men- This was different a con man teaches hes long lost daughter the tricks of being a con artist.  Nick Cage and Sam Rockwell make a great pair of Con men but bring in a ALison Lohman whos acting even at her age was pretty poor.  Movie had funny parts and keeps you interesting and the ending has quite a nice twist to it.  5 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Passions of the Christ-  Now this movie has called alot of controversy in media all over the world and well it should because it tells the story the best way it could graphic and violent which is how the story really was.  Most of the media couldnt except the truth about this movie.  Mel Gibson did a great job bringing the story to life in this epic movie.  9 outta 10 stars <br />
<br />
Hero- OMG its another Jet Li Movie how many can this guy make.  Well they put him with Queinten whos made some great movies.  It wasnt bad but i would recommend buying it its another Jet Li movie directored by someone different. 4 outta 10 stars<br />
<br />
Resident Evil 2- this was just released last week.  so if you havent seen it yet heres my review.  Well the movies got two hotties in it one being Mia and the other chick looking like Laura Kroft from Tomb Raider but its and stays along the lines of the first one if you digged that one you should dig this one just the same. 5 outta 10<br />
<br />
Indianan Jones Trilogy- Well i think most people will agree its about time they released it to DVD.  In a good way they didnt add stupid crap to make the movies more enjoyable its the same thing you had on VHS years ago just now its digital. No Ranking cuz its Indinana Jones<br />
<br />
Star Wars Trilogy-  Now im not a huge ass Star Wars fan because episode 1 and 2 kinda dragged me outta the whole SW thing-  The added features of the new one are to noticable in the DVDs they should have just let this shit alone and not messed with it leave it the way it was dont fix shit thats not broken.  No Ranking its Star Wars<br />
<br />
Police Academy Box Set- OMG all 7 on DVD imo should have just cut out the last 4 and made it a trilogy because do any of you actually remember the movies after Police Academy 3? No Ranking<br />
<br />
Well this was just my review on some of this years releases feel free to flame the hell outta of em. hell or add your own i like seeing peoples opinion and seeing them badger mine.<br />

<br />
Just wanted to add that Hero wasn't done by Quentin Tarantino actually.  Was actually directed by Yimou Zhang in 2001, when it was released in China.  Tarantino's name got attached because he helped fund/distribute the US release this past year.  I don't know much about Jet Li, but I liked Hero a lot.  The cinematography was some of the best I've ever seen in any movie.  I didn't think Jet Li is that integral to the feel or enjoyment of this movie, as honestly all the story elements play a secondary role.</div>

		<div>Only thing good about Pirates.... Kiera Knightly is HOT!<br />
<br />
You left of Bourne Supremacy which I think was one of the best movies of the year. Very very good action flick... Also, I think Matt Damon should give his friend Ben a few acting lessons.<br />
<br />
Underworld - Just watched this last week. Yeah, beginning is slow in developing. Ending ends to quickly. Movie only really has flow for about 20 minutes near the end. Other then that if you don't like vampires and werewolfs probably not a movie for you.<br />
<br />
Kill Bill 2 - It was ok. First one was better imo. This one didn't have the same catch and draw as the first one to me. The flow is... Well like all Tarentino movies.<br />
<br />
Fell asleep watching I Robot so no comment on that. <br />
<br />
Chronicles of Riddick was ok.... Pitchblack was a much better movie. Mianly because Vin was not the center piece of the movie. The other characters were developed more.<br />
<br />
Other then have not seen most of the movies on that list.... Damn I suck!</div>

		<div>There are a few movies on the list I didn't see, but I have most of them. I have to disagree with several of your ratings there bud...<br />
Spiderman - little too low, 7 of 10 in my book.<br />
<br />
Collateral - a little too high. Foxx makes the movie. I like Cruise (one of the best action stars out there) but shouldn't play the bad guy. Just not convencing enough. 5 of 10 at best.<br />
<br />
Return of the King - Won Best Picture for a reason...it's awesome. The extended version makes it that much better. 10 of 10<br />
<br />
Eurotrip - I thought it could have been better, but the "cheap laughs" are great. The song Scotty Doesn't Know playing throught the entire movie in several different countries was the best. 6 of 10 from me.<br />
<br />
Dreamcatcher - Dude, you hit this one on the head. That movie rocked. It is funnier than scary but very entertaining. 8 of 10<br />
<br />
Hero - If i gave this a 1 it would be too generous. That movie wasted 2 hours of my life I will never get back. I don't care well something is shot, if the plot sucks, the movie sucks...and that one did in spades. <b>.</b>5 of 10<br />
<br />
Harry Potter 3 - Didn't care for it that much, but I am not a big fan. I have seen the other 2 and liked them much more. 5 of 10 from me<br />
<br />
Star Wars Box Set - George Lucas has lost my respect. The added features just take away from the masterpiece saga he created. Still love the movies, but I like to old ones better. <br />
<br />
You forgot 1 more I wanted to add to the list:<br />
King Arthur - Everything about this movie sucked. The action scenes were boring, the friendships between the characters was totally unbelieveable, they had Arthur at war with Merlin...everything that we know about the great love story and adventure wasn't there. Even Kiera Knightly couldn't save this movie. Another 2+ hours wasted. 1 of 10  (still better than Hero)<br />

The Manchurian Candidate is a remake of an old movie from what my ma tells me, and is a little predictable but still good none the less, gotta love a govt can hide anything they want movie, "Shhh The Man is watching."  :cool:</div>
