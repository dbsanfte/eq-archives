<br />
As im going to spend 6 month in an british university i need a notebook.<br />
<br />
But im not really sure of what configuration i want/need.<br />
<br />
I'll use it to work but i want to be able to play games on it too (like WoW) so when i come back i can use it when i play with friends.<br />
<br />
As i will need to move it around i was thinking of a 15.4" screen size. 1 or 2gb ram, approx 100 gb, intel duo core 2 at 1,88 ghz  should be the base.<br />
<br />
My main problem is in the choice of the graphic card, and i don't know if some  brand (can i say "brand" in english speaking of laptop?) like Dell, Hp, Acer...are good or not.<br />
<br />
I need your input ! :typeing: <br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice</div>

		<div>I would recommend AGAINST the alienware ones, they are way heavier than a "laptop" would be, as they use regular PC parts, and their service policy is to ship it out and be without one for 4+ weeks.  They also from reports run kinda hot.<br />
<br />
One of my friends had an alienware system that he eventually had to get a refund for because they just *couldn't* fix it.  The mobo would burn out within 2 weeks and he'd send it off again to be repaired.<br />
<br />
I'd probably recommend the Dell XPS systems, honestly.  Dell has a pretty solid laptop reputation overall, and they are pretty good systems.   I'm not sure which of the ATI-based systems would run WoW well, as I don't follow their chipsets much.  The last time I followed them much at all I tore my hair out trying to get drivers for a system that the manufacturer didn't want to make DX9 drivers for.  At the time (about 2 years ago) ATI wouldn't release reference drivers for their laptop chipsets.   <br />
<br />
I haven't heard much good or bad about the newer HP laptops, but I'd probably be wary of Sony's lineup.  They usually are decent multimedia systems, but they do not handle themselves in the long run.<br />
<br />
Depending on what you are really trying to do, and if you are wanting to experiment enough with it, you could check out a Apple unit as well.  WoW does run well on that enviornment from what I've been told, and their units seem to have a really proven track record as well.  Not sure if they've come out with their Intel-based version yet that is dual-boot capable, but you will pay a premium for the apple logo more than anyone else.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm kinda awed by the top of the line Dell XPS though - <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/xpsnb_m2010?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" target="_blank">they call it the Showstopper</a>.  It has a wireless keyboard and everything!</div>

		<div>where as the 2010 is ooh and ahhh it's way too big for what xor wants i think :)....anyway xor, I'd recommend going with dell, for the price and performance i don't think you can beat it anywhere else.....go with the dell xps 1210 if you want portable performance, 12 inch widescreen and option for nvidia graphics card...if you want a bigger screen you can go with the 1505 but i don't recommend doing that because of the hypermemory video card on it....<br />
<br />
If you don't mind the weight you can pick up a 1705 notebook with 17 inch widescreen and nvidia graphics card...it's about a pound and half heavier i belive....a lot depends on how much you want to spend too....hope this info helps if you need more let me know and i'll go into detail....</div>

		<div>Dell now owns Alienware, so maybe somewhere in the mix there is some uniformity.  Video card I would definitely use anything Nvidia as ATI has the worlds worst customer support as well as driver support.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to get to Alienware if  you want to make  your one decisions.  I have never heard anything bad about the performance of the Alienware products, but I would definitely take what Ewan said and Heiken said into consideration as well.  The best decisions are always the ones you make on the greatest amount of info you can get whether it is reliable or not the more info  you get the more you can attest to the reliability of any one piece of info.  Good Luck and let us know which one you get.  Personally I would not be concerned with encumbrence if your thinking about performance.  I would definitely prefer to lug around the extra weight if it meant getting the performance and screen size that I wanted.<br />

		<div>Alienware SUCKS ASS!<br />
<br />
Sorry, had to be said.  I bought one for a project at work.  They lied to me about its capabilities then will not give me the support I need and drivers are rare.  I won't go into details as it still pisses me off that I paid $4500 for that shit.  Would have gone Dell but at the time, their Duo's weren't out and they didn't support above 3GB of RAM.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest going with Dell as others have said.  Best support in the world period.  There are Dell horror stories but they are few and far.  I have delt with a lot of other brands but none can consistantly compete in quality and service.<br />
<br />
So, go with the 2010.  Bigger IS better.  Make all those Brits feel inferior sitting next to you in class.  It will act as a nice space heater in the comming months as well.  =)</div>

		<div>With a mac book pro you can play WoW but thats about the only game. I will say the mac book pro is a great machine, when I was at E3 almost all the article writers had one.<br />
<br />
I suggest if you want to play other games to get a dell. You can configure it with a decent graphics card like a Geforce Go 6800 (or higher), a gig of ram (or more) and a core duo cpu which would be powerful enough even for EQ2 *wink*. If you can afford it you may want to get dells small series laptop (forget model) for school work and then a 9300/xps for gaming and school work at home/dorm. The 9300/xps's are a bit heavy and dont have the best battery life.</div>
