		<div><i>By Claudia Parsons <br />
2 hours, 34 minutes ago<br />
 <br />
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two of America's top authors, John Irving and Stephen King, made a plea to        J.K. Rowling on Tuesday not to kill the fictional boy wizard        Harry Potter in the final book of the series, but Rowling made no promises. <br />
 <br />
&quot;My fingers are crossed for Harry,&quot; Irving said at a joint news conference before a charity reading by the three writers at New York's Radio City Music Hall.<br />
<br />
The author of &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; and a string of other bestsellers said he and King felt like &quot;warm-up bands&quot; for Rowling, who is working on the seventh and last book in the Harry Potter series, and who has said two characters will die.<br />
<br />
King, who shot to fame in 1974 with &quot;Carrie,&quot; said he had confidence that Rowling would be &quot;fair&quot; to her hero.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want him to go over the Reichenbach Falls,&quot; King said in a reference to Arthur Conan Doyle's effort to kill off the character of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Pressure from fans eventually led Conan Doyle to resurrect Holmes, who was found in a later story to have survived.<br />
<br />
Rowling, a Briton whose books have sold 300 million copies worldwide according to her publishers, said she was well into the process of writing the final book.<br />
<br />
&quot;I feel quite liberated,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can resolve the story now and it's fun in a way it wasn't before because finally I've reached my resolution, and I think some people will loathe it and some people will love it, but that's how it should be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We're working toward the end I always planned but a couple of characters I expected to survive have died and one character got a reprieve,&quot; she said, declining to elaborate.<br />
<br />
Asked about the wisdom of killing off fictional characters, Rowling said she didn't enjoy killing the major character who died in book six -- for the sake of those who haven't read it yet she avoided naming the victim -- but she said the conventions of the genre demanded the hero go on alone.<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand why an author would kill a character from the point of view of not allowing others to continue writing after the original author is dead,&quot; she added, leaving the door open to the worst fears of some fans -- that Harry could die.<br />
<br />
King recalled that when he had a character kick a dog to death in his novel &quot;Dead Zone&quot; he received more letters of complaint than ever, to his surprise.<br />
<br />
&quot;You want to be nice and say 'I'm sorry you didn't like that,' but I'm thinking to myself number one, he was a dog not a person, and number two, the dog wasn't even real,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;I made that dog up, it was a fake dog, it was a fictional dog, but people get very, very involved,&quot; King said.<br />
<br />
Rowling noted that Irving had killed off many more characters than she had.<br />
<br />
&quot;When fans accuse me of sadism, which doesn't happen that often, I feel I'm toughening them up to go on and read John and Stephen's books,&quot; she said. &quot;I think they've got to be toughened up somehow. It's a cruel literary world out there.&quot; </i> <br />
<br />
<br />
Dear God PLEASE don't kill Harry off!  I don't want anyone else to die really.  I don't know why they just can't all survive (Except he who shall not be named) and just ride off into the sunset :)  I like HAPPY endings!</div>

He marries herminooneeeeee and re-lives his glory days over a 6pack of beer after getting home from selling womens footware. ovbliously with a hand down the front of his pants...</div>
