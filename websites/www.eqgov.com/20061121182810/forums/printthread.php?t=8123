		<div>Ok, Kulina and I came up with this great idea to buy my oldest some star wars books for Christmas. So Im like &quot;sure it'll be easy and its good for her and something she really enjoys&quot;. You knowticed I said &quot;it will be easy&quot;.......<br />
<br />
Now as a parent you think I would know better then to use the words &quot;It'll be easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
I went to Walden books and found the D&amp;D books and sat there for a good 2 hours pouring back into my childhood memories, simply amazed at the changes they have made to the game and such. And it dawns on me that I'm waisting time and start looking for the Star Wars section. After all theres only gonna be like maybe 6 books right. And it took me a while to find it, because I looked all over the store, without realizing that the books were right on the next damn Isle I was standing in. And thats when the reality of it all sunk in!<br />
<br />
There are 100's of starwars books! OMG!! My jaw hit the floor, I was so astonished at how many books there were. Starwars has its own row. <br />
<br />
So then I'm like &quot;Fook, what the hell do I buy?!&quot; So start reading the back of the books to figure out what the heck is going on. And I found out all kinds of juicy info that I had never known before. And that I won't discuss here because I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, I found one book I had to get her...and of course I forgot the name of the book already. But its the story of what happens right after the 6th movie. After Vader and Sidious die. But I want to get her a few more books and there just so many I dont know what to get. I want to follow the correct time line, that way she won't get confused but I cant seem to be able determine what's next in the story line. I know alot of you read books by the dozen and just wanted to know what you all have read and what you would suggest I get. Or if you know a web site that will break down the books in some sort of timeline order that would be great too.The Starwars.com wasnt very helpful, they just want you to buy products.<br />
<br />
Anyway...if anyone has any helpful info, please let me know. And please do put spoilers here. Let peeps find out stuff on there own. It makes the experiance all that much more enjoyable. <br />

		<div><i>Shadows of the Empire - Perry</i><br />
<br />
This book actually takes place between Empire and Jedi.  Good story!<br />
<br />
<i>The Truce at Bakura - Tyers</i><br />
<br />
I take it this is the book you are referring to that you bought.  It takes place like 5 mins after Jedi.<br />
<br />
<i>The Courtship of Princess Leia - Wolverton</i><br />
<br />
I can't recall if I read this one, but it seems very familiar, as if I had.  It follows Truce.<br />
<br />
<i>Heir to the Empire - Zahn<br />
Dark Force Rising - Zahn<br />
The Last Command - Zahn</i><br />
<br />
This trilogy follows shortly after Jedi, and after Courtship.<br />
<br />
Everything other than these has been crap imo.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div>

		<div>Have to agree with Dark on this one.  Most of the Star Wars books aut there are crap.  The trilogy written by Zahn are by far my presonal favorites.  <br />
I've heard that the rogue squadron series is worth the read, but I just haven't found the time to look into them.</div>
