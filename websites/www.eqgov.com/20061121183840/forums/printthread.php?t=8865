		<div>So I was surfing the dish last night in my recliner. Came across a documentary on HBO, some of the best I see are there.<br />
<br />
I saw Naked World, first thought HBO, so its some kind of education or art thing. Click the info, photographer that persuades people to pose nude on the street. Why not. I sat and I watched and thought it was pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
Spencer Tunick is his name, a 35 year-old photographer that admits he doesnt take great individual shots. He got like 2000 people in Montreal to pose nude in the street in a Massive layout and then did the same with 4000 people in Melbourne. Pretty interesting.<br />
<br />
I recommend this as a worthwhile watch, even if you're not an artsy type person like myself.<br />
<br />
Naked World on HBO, yes it is nudity, so only let the youngins watch if you think it'll be educational for them to learn about different forms of &quot;nude non-erotic art&quot;(direct quote from the photographer).<br />
<br />
Noteworthy links on him.<br />

&quot;Art&quot; is when everyone that looks at it goes &quot;what the heck is this?&quot;<br />
&quot;Art&quot; is a pile of stone (literally) and an &quot;Artist&quot; claiming the pile of stone represents the meaning of life.<br />
<br />
Over here in Netherlands, there is a law, that when government builds something, they got to spend 2% of the cost of the building on art. Where I work, we just build two office towers for aprox 500 million each. The art budget being spend on &quot;conceptual art&quot;.<br />
<br />
According to the artist hired, the art is not in the end product, but in the making thereof....so yes...we literally got a pile of bricks as artwork now, costing several million :)</div>

		<div>My definition of art is looking at something someone and feeling an emotion of wonder, amazement, curiosity or even negative emotions i suppose, but it brings out some emotion. If you look at a piece of art and feel absolutely nothing then well, maybe it's not art... or something...<br />
<br />
Anyhow... just because it's modern, and uses a camera instead of a paint brush... that doesn't make it &quot;just a bunch of naked people&quot;... there is over 2000 years of art that includes a whole lot of naked people... Da Vinci, Botticelli, Michaelangelo, Raphael, Titian, etc. used paint brushes and paint... This guy uses a camera... <br />

		<div>Art is what you like. Sure art can be done with a camera. I wasn't saying that. Do i like this stuff no, its not that great. After about 3 naked people on just looks like blobs of color.<br />
 <br />
 I know that famous great artists used brushes. To me that more work and makes the piece better. Almost, and I said almost so dont go thinking I said all, photo art can be done by anyone. Mainly cause Art is what you make it. <br />
 <br />
 But if I had a picture to hang and one was nake people from this guy or nake people from a painter Id hang the one by the painter. It just looks better to me<br />
<br />
Since every peson interupts &quot;art&quot; in a different way, then to ME its just naked people, when talking about those photos. Ive seen art by those wonderful paintes you named, and to me their paintings are art. No one can be wrong on this subject. hehe</div>

		<div>Hmm....kinda interesting.<br />
<br />
However, it just kinda got back to me thinking about a thought I had. I started wondering when, why and how everybody considered themselves an artist. It used to be that you were a person of skill and trade - ie, you were a furniture maker, a painter, a photographer, a singer, etc etc etc. Now everyone and anyone is an artist. Perhaps it's the money and fame angle? Perhaps it is another way of trying to protect your trade?<br />
<br />
I dont know....all I know is that the terms art/artist have been used and applied so widely that it has little to no meaning to me anymore.<br />

		<div>I've actually seen this documentary before, I think.. at least seen reports on this guy's work.  Personally I think it's cool, and nothing near &quot;porn&quot; in the most part.<br />
<br />
Then again, for the most part I don't find what Playboy puts in their magazines as porn, either.. unless they've changed format from when I used to peruse it.  Just because it gets you aroused doesn't mean it's porn, remember.<br />
<br />
Melting clocks or melting flesh, beauty (and art) is in the eye of the beholder for sure.  Now, peeing into a cup with a crusifix in it has been determined to NOT be art..</div>

		<div>I love this stuff it is great!!  I think stuff like Hustler and Playboy are exploitations of women this is every kind of naked body. I think it is not just the naked bodies but the enormity of the naked bodies. Sometimes even in the way they are placed.  It is all about the creativity and uniqueness of the idea.  <br />
<br />
I think and agree that to some people this could be offending, in the same sense we consider democrats human beings as well we can consider this kind of art offensive.  Dont get me wrong...not all republicans are sane as well.  I think Bush started out okay, but now his idea of republicanism has breached the bounds of politics and encompasses his own business aspirations....sad but true.  Once again I guess it is how we interpret our enviroment.  Some people can only see apples as apples and cant see beyond what the true visual interpretation is.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the introduction to this art!!</div>
