<p><b> Mid-Levels to Crystal Caverns!</b></p>

<p>Thursday, September 13 at 10PM EST, 9PM CST, and 7PM PST, the mid-levels will be taking over the Crystal Caverns.  Once again, everyone is welcome.  And don't worry all of you who suffered untimely deaths on the way to Mistmoore... we'll seek vengeance on the Brownies and that wretched stallion Equestrielle the Corrupted some day soon!</p>

<p>I will come if I can. I don't really know if I can right now... for some reason EQ has forzen my account so I can't log in as Aideen. Hope all goes well even if I can't make it<br />
