			<div><strong>Hotel Rwanda</strong><br />&nbsp;</div>
		
		
		
		<div>In my opinion, this is a movie that everyone should watch at least once. It is a very graphic and moving depiction of the genocide during the 90s within Rwanda committed by the Hutus. I wouldnt allow a child to watch this movie unless they were at least 15 or 16 years-old.<br />
<br />
I can honestly say I haven't cried that during a movie for a very very long time.<br />
<br />
If you do take my advice and watch this movie, be prepared to cry and if you do not cry once during this movie, you need to re-examine yourself and look in the mirror.<br />
<br />
The sad thing about this movie, somewhere in the world. Genocide is being committed and the western world does nothing still after so many cases that pile up year after year.<br />
<br />
It makes you wish you were bad and deaf sometimes.</div>

		<div>Look at those incidents that you listed, it was the ones in power or responsible for the violence of genocide who took up arms against us.<br />
<br />
Mogadishu, the skinnies; supporters of the warlord in power at the time in Somalia. <br />
<br />
Bosnia, more military might turned to personal agenda, I got a lot of friends who served in that skirmish, two who were part of the 98th General Hospital.<br />
<br />
Iraq, power party supporters wanting us to leave so they can stage a coup and now just people tired of foreigners in their country, plus many other nonsensical bullshit. <br />
<br />
Fundamentalists should not have power in a country, look how it tears up the USA, we're really not that many steps behind Militant Islamics with our Christian Conservatives, they say peaceful? You ever been a Buddhist in a high school in central Oklahoma? I could tell you things that would make you think I was black and it was 1956 in Alabama.<br />
<br />
Next, look at Asia, southeast and Africa for the next camp affair.<br />
<br />
One line from Hotel Rwanda that is true, &quot;You think this getting out will make them intervene? They see the footage and go how horrible, then go on eating their dinner?&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason the US gets shitcanned anytime we go trotting off to play hero in some third world hut is because no one wants to be saved by us. The whole how dare you think you can understand what is going on here rhetoric train jumps the rail faster than you can blink and you got former bloc munitions raining down on you. &gt;_&gt; Really think I forgot what I was talking about. Ah shit.<br />
<br />
I think I meant to say is we as a people still haven't quite gotten the whole never again idea in their heads quite rright. Civilization may think its evolved but we're still stuck at stupid. Tribe against tribe, kingdom against kingdom, empire against empire, guess we're at the empire stage now. People like to say never again every time some atrocity is committed against a group of people. But doesnt anyone see the cycle, every couple of years 500k - 1000k people are slaughtered and thrown in mass graves. Never again? Its not just the United States duty, it is the world's duty to do something.<br />
<br />
We just seem stupid enough to think if we go, well there is something wrong there, we always goof up at some point and fingers get pointed back at us with a piece of ceramic steel in front of it.<br />
<br />
Thanx for the derail, Bene. Why did I get onboard?  :think:</div>
