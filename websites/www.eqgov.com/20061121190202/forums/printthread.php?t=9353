		<div>Looking to upgrade my computer here and looking for some advice.  I am not the most computer Savi person in the world when it comes to Motherboard &amp; CPU's so I need a lil help.  Looking to get a combo that will allow me to play games EQ2 with less problems, requires ~ 3.1Ghz processor.  Also going to be bumping up the RAM another gig to about 2G.  If still needed afterwords will work on video card but think it is still going good.  If you guys got any advice for gamer on a budget plz lemme know.</div>

That and the whole "beat down the evil empire" concept.  I love that AMD trumped Intel with the 64-bit x86 cores, and that it's a competition again with the dual cores.  Honestly the power thing with the quad cores could get VERY interesting.</div>

The EE version (65W) of the 4200+ is less than $5 more than the 89W version.  And there is an even bigger spread on the idle power versus full draw, if you read the review fully.  Intel seems to have the power stable across the board, but you don't rev back nearly as much in idle states.<br />
<br />
What they are saying about how Intel is pushing out the 4x cores is that the cores are not 100% independent, either.  You will power up/use 2 cores at a time, so if you only need 2 cores you are good, but if you need 3 you have to fully power up the 4th core as well.  AMD's early chip designs are showing they have 4 fully independent cores in the system, and can power up/down cores individually as needed.  More important for server farms than home PC's for sure, but very interesting to see what is happening.<br />
<br />
Again, the sharkey's guide that I"m referring to has both an Intel and an AMD version clearly listed for processor and motherboard decisions.  I'm just an nVidia/AMD fan overall, so I stuck with what I'm comfortable with, and the guide came out with a good machine that took me about an hour to put together.  And for me, I find that working out what pieces work with each other to come up with a good system (and figuring out why stuff DOESN"T work after you build it) takes more time than the actual build.  This guide definitely took a lot of that work off of my hands, and I'm quite pleased with the system that I got from it.<br />

		<div>Sounds interesting.  I was looking at trying to get a mid to higher end AMD, cause that is what I have always used.  and keeping with the NVidia once I update my  CPU and Motherboard to handle it.  But as of now it is seriously holding me back on coming back to play EQ2.</div>

		<div>Hey Grant,<br />
<br />
Both AMD and Intel processors will do fine and honestly you are probably not going to notice much difference between the two. Right now from a price for performce perspective the Intel Core 2 Duo is much better then the Athlon X2. The Athlon will get better performance on lower energy, if that matters to you.<br />
<br />
However, either way you go it would probably be better to wait about a month. Both Intel and AMD are close to luanching their 4 core chips. This will of course drive down the price of the dual core chips.<br />
<br />
I can't answer your question morthboard from an Intel standpoint as honestly I don't buy Intel ships.<br />
<br />
But, from an AMD standpoint. I've using an nForce250 based motherboard and its been doing fine. <br />
<br />
When you are selecting a motherboard look at what other hardware you want to upgrade. If you are getting a brand new processor and brand new motherboard its more then likely going to have PCIe 16 and no AGP slot so your Video card would need to be upgraded also. If you are carrying over the ram make sure its supported on the new board. If you want to go to SATA drives then make the motherboard has SATA.<br />
<br />
There are hundreds of motherboard variety's out there now and there really is no wrong answer there. Basically find a board in your price with your features and then read reviews on it. Then base your decision off of that.</div>
