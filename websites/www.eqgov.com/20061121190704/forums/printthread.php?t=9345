		<div>Okay, so Calalene was in Dire need of a new machine (her's was a Pentinum 4 that I bought less than a month before Luclin was launched).  I had upgraded what I could on it - RAM to 768M, Video card to a AGP 6800, but it was done.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many of you are familiar with Sharkey Extreme, but they produce a guide for different gaming rigs about once a quarter.  The "Value" systems always fit into what I can buy, but I've never done (or seen) a system built entirely on their specs done before.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.sharkeyextreme.com/guides/MVGSBG/article.php/3633106" target="_blank">Sharkey Extreme September Value Gaming Guide</a> <br />
<br />
Their goal is to make a complete machine in under $1000.  I changed out a few things, more accurately bought brands on stuff they said "generic" to, but I bought basically down the list of what they said to get - most noteably in regards to Case, Motherboard and video card level.<br />
<br />
I bought everything at NewEgg.com, as that's my favorite place to buy parts.  Again, I could have saved a few dollars by buying parts from all over, but I like the quality of what I get there, and I trust them as a retailer.  My invoice is the following.<br />

Now, I did this Sunday, and it just got here today.  More accurately, it got here at 2:00pm Eastern time.  I'm writting up the experience already, well, because Vista is installing right now on the machine.  I give 100% of the credit to the to the case.  The Antec Sonata II has to be the absolute best case I've ever worked inside of.  The layout is a little cramped, and if you read the reviews on NewEgg it has a lot of bad marks against it, but I really feel that these are bad marks for folks that didn't understand how to <i>read</i>.  I wouldn't put a dual-SLI system in this case for heat and power reasons, and the biggest complaint was power supply dying.  I think this is mostly because of folks not understanding the power needs of their super hungry systems, and they never say <i>what</i> they loaded inside of the box.  We'll see if in 6-9months this system has a new power supply in it or not.<br />
<br />
This case is the quietest system case I have ever seen as well.  I would probably replace the 120mm fan they include with a fan that powers off the motherboard instead of one that powers off the supply itself, but it's there and works fine.  Even in "high" mode, it's super quiet (it has a 3-way switch for speed, I put it on "high" because of possible heat "concerns" with the system).<br />
<br />
So far, I'd say if your budget is in the $750 category, that Sharkey's guide is going to give you a kick ass result for the money you spent.  Once I get Vista installed completely I'll write up how it's doing.</div>

		<div>If your mobo will take it, I'd bump up to 2GB on the memory, but other than that it looks like a pretty solid machine.  One thing I learned with my new system (my first AMD dual core)  is that you have to install drvers for the processor.  They are on AMD's site.  Other than that I have been extremely happy with mine.</div>

		<div>yeah, only issue is that RAM is about $100 per gig in pairs right now.  Dual channel stuff is going nuts, so I set her up with 2x 512 and going to hold for a while.<br />
<br />
First major issue found is that either I have a bad sound chip on this MB, or the integrated sound just sucks.  I plunked in a SB Live!  card I had in her old machine, and sound is working.  Considering the problems that I continually have from Realtek <b>crap</b> I'm just as happy doing this.<br />
<br />
Looks like the driver disc from Biostar had the Athlon drivers on it, and my old copy of XP Home found both cores.. so we'll see how it does!</div>

		<div>If you want to use the onboard sound its better to use the nForce sound drivers then the ones from Realtek. Also the nVidia sound tools are very nicely designed. Thats only if you had another use for that SB card otherwise I'd use the SB over the onboard sound like your doing now.</div>
