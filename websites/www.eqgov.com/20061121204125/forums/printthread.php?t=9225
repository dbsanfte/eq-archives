		<div>Friday night alliance raid with T(Torment) and all i have to say is WOW!  We first set up to take down Lockjaw the Ancient.  Let me tell ya, he's gotten WAY bigger since we last seen him 500 years ago in Oasis of Marr.  We took him down with little effort.  Tons of guild xp from the kills in The Court of Al'Afaz a T6 Raid zone.  Due to the amount of people and the "low quality" of my PC I was unable to get any screen shots. (/e nudges Theramor)  As a guild we almost achieved a complete guild level! In one night!<br />
 <br />
 Saturday evening we gathered up again with T(Torment) to do our first T5 Raid Spirit of the Lost.  We gathered in Feerrott and moved to the entrance of Cazic-Thule.  After a zoning in and a little confusion with mentoring we got the zone to green out for us.  Nishu started pulling mobs and we started the crawl through the zone.  Drof lead us through quite an intricut raid zone.  After killing several named mobs and clearing out the area under the pyramid we set up to take out Venekor (you may remember him from the EQ2 demo movie).  We had a little trouble at first with agro and a few deaths but no wipe (what kinda raid has no wipe?!).  We killed Venekor and started setting up for Varanak.  Unfortunately we couldnt do Varanak.  The encounter is set up so that you have to kill both Venekor and Varanak at the same time.  Well get em both next time.<br />

 <br />
 All in all we had an outstanding weekend!  Grats to everyone in both guilds on loots, xp and a successfull alliance raid!</div>
