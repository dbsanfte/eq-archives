<a href="http://www.everlore.com/guides.asp?ID=441300" target="_blank">http://www.everlore.com/guides.asp?ID=441300</a><br />
<br />
Here is the good stuff that I thought really sums all the warrior problems and possible fixes that variant should really implement into effect immediately IMO. It is a little old but most of this still applys today. I am not posting this to start a giant flame, but to look at some frustrations that I have been seeing lately. It might be a little long but well worth it....enjoy. :D<br />
<br />
In the following discussion, and in my suggestions for fixes, I have gleaned from the forums some of the best insights, observations, and suggestions that I and my fellow player-warriors made about the warrior class in EQ. My purpose in this is to (hopefully) revive something of a discussion between player-warriors and Verant. My purpose is NOT to disparage the other melee classes in any way at all. I fully understand that other classes have their issues as well, and I truly do empathize with those issues. Although I do compare warriors to other classes, I try to do so fairly, without in any way minimizing that class’s problems. <br />
<br />
Also the comments I make below are merely an extremely brief summary of what I have written at great length elsewhere. They are very brief, and by no means complete, but I hope they give you the idea as to where I was going when I wrote the full length version. (If I included the entire essay, this guide would be far far longer than it is now.)<br />
<br />
Hit Points and AC Problems<br />
<br />
I encourage each of you to do a simple experiment, the next time you are grouped with another melee class your level. Ask them what their HP and AC are unbuffed. You will be amazed. Both AC and HP are very close to your own. If they self buff, they may even be higher than yours. And the vast majority of the other classes have hidden caches of HP they can draw upon at will (using the root and heal strategy, lifedraw, mend, LOH, etc), giving them more HP than is initially obvious.<br />
<br />
The sad fact is that the other melee classes have very nearly what you have in AC, and they actually have more functional hit points (FHP) than you do. Don’t get me wrong, at high levels you’ll have 200-300 more hit points than they do (which is maybe worth 3 to 4 hits at most by a mob at this level), but they’ll have immediate access to a lot more HP at will.<br />
<br />
Now you do have the highest potential AC in the game, if you can get the uber gear you need. This is unbelievably difficult. In other words, you’ll probably never get much of this stuff. So you’ll probably have to buy it piecemeal at the EC tunnel, and bankrupt yourself. A whole suit of sentient armor sells for 13k; cobalt boots sell for 15k alone. Get the idea?<br />
<br />
As a small example, when I was 51 I grouped with a 51 troll SK, and asked my AC and HP questions. My AC was NINE points higher than his, and I had 220 more HP. He told me that he never self buffed (with shieldskin or vampiric embrace) and never bothered to get his 280 pt uber-lifetap spell. He didn’t need to. He advised me that he could lifedraw for 75pts per cast, and if he had full mana, this was worth about 1k of HP. I thought maybe he was bragging until he did it right in front of me. Never missed a tap, either. To keep things brief, I’ve done similar experiments with paladin (nice self buffs, greater heal, and LOH), and they have way more FHP than even the previous example. In fact, when everything was figured in, the pali had almost double the FHP my warrior had. Everyone speculates, but no one really compares. Ask them yourself, and weep. <br />
<br />
Problems with Offense<br />
<br />
The simple fact is that melee + spells = more offensive output than melee alone. Should be obvious but this is, remarkably, a debated point. In other words, you are fifth in overall offense (monks, rogues, rangers, SKs, then warriors). <br />
<br />
You know that you are using dual wield because it enhances your taunt, not because it does more damage than 2h slashing or 2h blunt. They fixed the bonuses on two-handed weapons a number of months back, so that DW doesn’t have the advantage it once had. You also know that your kick and slam don’t get better with time, and that disarm is broken beyond belief. And you know the disciplines are also a problem, in that they don’t do all that much, they are all on the same timer, and they have incredible reload times. And berserker frenzy, the class defining skill of the warrior class, is so badly flawed that you probably forget about it most of the time. Offensively, warriors aren’t exactly pushing the overpowered envelope. In addition, the spells + melee combination makes hybrids better taunters than you are. <br />
<br />
I could go on and on and on about the many problems warriors face, but you know them all to well, fellow veterans. You posted most of them for Verant to see during the class balance forums. Yet Verant keeps making statements like “Warriors are right at the point of being overpowered” (Gordon Wrinn), “Warriors’ AC is much higher,” (Gordon again) and asking questions about how the warrior class should be nerfed, to keep them balanced (Alan Vancouvering). <br />
<br />
The Solution: The Warrior Make-Over<br />
<br />
I have listed several possible solutions below. Before I give the details, it should be mentioned that ALL of the overall solutions include the following universal fixes. <br />
<br />
1. Verant should recognize that the warrior class is badly underpowered, and that the class needs some serious work. No minor, small, token fixes are going to fix this problem. They need a real make-over like the shaman class got a while back (wherein new spells, pets, very well thought out class armor, the alchemy skill, and the use of piercing weapons was added). Truly, nothing short of this type of repair will address the problem adequately. <br />
<br />
2. Fix Bind Wound. Cap it at skill level 255, and make warriors able to BW anyone to 70% (like they can do to themselves at level 60, when it’s nearly useless). This solves the utility problem (to some degree) that I discussed above, and allows them to contribute something to the group besides tanking. It also makes perfect sense, in that warriors who spend their lives on the battlefield should be the best medics, field surgeons, and first aid providers in the game. (Should I mention that this makes the mage’s bandage summoning ability far more desirable?) As binding between fights saves healing mana and cuts downtime, it’ll make the warrior more desirable as a group member. <br />
<br />
3. Fix Kick, Bash, and Slam. Kick caps at 150, unnecessarily handicapping small race warriors. The damage on all three of these never improves during a warrior’s career, and needs to be improved.<br />
<br />
4. Fix Critical Hits. Has anyone ever noticed that these usually do less damage than a normal weapon hit? Admittedly, crits occasionally do some significant damage, but more often than not they are simply lame. Making all crits the way crippling blows are now would be more appropriate. <br />
<br />
5. Fix Taunt. Warriors aren’t doing enough damage to keep them high on the hate/aggro list, and as a result the taunt skill is simply not working well. With the recent “fixes” regarding increased hate for healer types, this is a REAL problem. If warriors are supposed to be the best tanks, this has to be fixed. It’s an integral part of the job. <br />
<br />
6. Fix Disarm. A mob carrying a Fine Steel sword hits you for 80 points of damage. The warrior disarms it. It then hits for 80 points of damage. There is no other discernible difference (its not slower, angrier, more likely to flee, or anything else). And it doesn’t work on mobs carrying so much as Velium weapons. Useless.<br />
<br />
7. Fix Berserker Frenzy. This is a big lame-O skill for a class defining ability. Put it on a button, make it improve with time, and make it impressive like LOH or HT. <br />
<br />
8. Fix the Disciplines. If the disciplines are to be regarded as the result of a veteran warrior learning new skills, tricks, tactics, strategies, and physical abilities during the course of a long career, they should reflect these superior abilities. The disciplines, as discussed above, are of very limited usefulness the way they are now. They are all on the same timer, that timer is too long, you only get them at the end of your career, and some of them are useless (i.e., Fearless.). Every discipline should be on a separate timer, each should be usable once per game day, and there should me many of them, spaced out across the levels. They should not stack with each other. If a warrior is using a discipline that lasts ten minutes, and five minutes into it he uses a second discipline (as the tactical situation demands), the first discipline is immediately canceled out, and the effects of the current discipline are felt. This gives warriors some strategy to employ, as well as several dozen tactical choices to make. These could make up for the warrior’s lack of skills and spells. The appropriate use of a discipline could be the thing that sets one warrior above another, and their use in a critical situation might save the party. <br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to these six fixes, I’m suggesting that Verant implement one of the following thematic solutions to the problems faced by the warrior class.<br />
<br />
Solution #1: The Masters of Disciplines<br />
<br />
When Kunark first came out, the idea was that melee classes get disciplines, while the mana-using classes get new spells. As has been the trend (of making everyone more and more similar to warriors), the disciplines have now been extended to all hybrid classes. <br />
<br />
If the disciplines are fixed as described above, making the warriors the Masters of Disciplines can solve their many problems. Give the warriors many disciplines, possibly even one per level (similar to the bard class). The discipline would reflect, in a level appropriate way, the warrior’s improving knowledge of his craft. Again, each discipline should be on its own timer, and usable once per day. By the time a warrior was level 50 or so, he would have several dozen disciplines to choose from, and could use them as situations required. <br />
<br />
As an example, let’s say that we gave warriors the discipline Fleet of Foot at level ten. This discipline has limits, in that it won’t stack with any other discipline, and can be used once per game day. Furthermore, as it is a physical skill and not magic, it lasts only five minutes. But this discipline reflects a warrior’s growing physical abilities, in that it reflects his ability to run a long distance at great speed. Thus when a warrior uses Fleet of Foot, he runs at sow speed for that five minutes. This gives a warrior an escape ability, as well as the ability to cross a dangerous zone, or escape a dangerous mob, when all else fails. <br />
<br />
Other disciplines could include the level 5 discipline Guard, which raises his AC by 25 pts. At level seven he could receive the discipline Rage, which would raise his ATK by 25 pts. Each would last five minutes. At level fifteen he might receive the discipline Camouflage, which would invis him for five minutes. At level thirty he might receive Fury, which would give him a haste-like effect for five minutes. <br />
<br />
Others might be one-use type disciplines. Leg-strike (a powerful chop to an opponent’s legs) would have a snare effect, usable once per day. Body-blow (a similar strike to the mob’s midsection) would have a single use slowing effect. Others might be an AC debuff (by damaging a mob’s armor), a Fear type effect, etc. The discipline the warrior receives should be level appropriate; the inherent limitations discussed above keep them from being too powerful. There are numerous possibilities.<br />
<br />
I’d like to point out how easy this suggestion would be to implement. No artists, no new graphics, no new animations, nothing difficult at all. This would take a programmer a couple of days to rework the code. <br />
<br />
<br />
Solution #2: The Three Timer Warrior<br />
<br />
As the name suggests, this solution involves placing a number of new skills on the three timers that warriors already possess: the Taunt timer, the Kick/Bash/Slam timer, and the Disarm timer. <br />
<br />
Much like the discipline suggestion above, this would involve adding a number of skills to the warrior class. This suggestion proposes that warriors get somewhat fewer skills, but these are obviously not subject to the limitations of the disciplines. These skills would be fewer in number, but would recycle every few seconds, much like Taunt does now. A warrior might get Taunt, Group Taunt, and Instill Doubt all placed on the current taunt timer. This forces the warrior to make a choice in combat, depending on the tactical circumstances at hand. Should he taunt the mob off the caster, or attempt to fear it using ID? Similar skills should be placed on the other timers as well. <br />
<br />
Solution #3: The Tank<br />
<br />
If you want the warrior to be simply a tank, you have to give him some ability to actually do that job—take a ton of damage, and keep the mob off the casters. The warrior could be a viable character class if he were given the ability to absorb massive amounts of damage. As I discussed earlier, the HP and AC issues that currently exist preclude this from actually occurring. <br />
<br />
This fix would include giving the warrior a damage reduction ability. This would reflect a warrior’s ability to “roll with the punches” in melee situations (much like a talented boxer does in our day), thus negating a portion of the mob’s blows. If a warrior got a 1% damage reduction skill every level, he would be able to absorb far more damage than he does now. A warrior at level 50, who has far fewer HP than he needs to do his job, and has an AC that is the same as the other melee classes out there, isn’t the tank he’s cracked up to be. Give him a 50% reduction to every blow against him, and he suddenly becomes formidable. He can travel more safely, do CR better, is a better tank than the other melee classes, etc. If warriors were meant to outlast the mobs and other classes during a fight, this ability would enable them to actually do that.<br />
<br />
Solution #4: The Masters of Chaotic Damage<br />
<br />
Giving warriors a number of special events that can occur during combat is another possibility. There should be a small but significant chance that with every hit by a warrior, something special might occur. The warrior might score a crippling blow. The mob might have his AC reduced (from armor damage). The mob might be blinded (from a head blow). It might be feared (wanting to retreat). It might receive DOT damage (as it bleeds out). It might be slowed (from a body blow), or snared (from a leg blow), or suffer from other similar effects. The rate at which a warrior stuns a mob with a normal attack should also be increased.<br />
<br />
Although this suggestion doesn’t address all the issues discussed above, it does increase a warriors offensive output without actually increasing the amount of damage that he does. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
After reading this little editorial, I hope you understand the plight of the all-but-forgotten warrior class. These guys have really been the neglected step-child of Verant for far too long. Like the neglected step-children of fairy tales, they have been constantly reminded of the many good things that have been done for them, but in reality they are still eating gruel. Let’s give warriors a break. <br />
<br />
In saying this, I’m not in any way trying to take away from, demean, disparage, or otherwise frustrate the other melee classes out there. In one of my suggestions, I’ve even spoken about fixing the disciplines, which benefits all the melee classes. Truthfully, I hope that each of you can see this from a new point of view, and support the warriors out there. I fully believe that the improvements to other melee classes (the raising of skill caps, the recent mana increases, etc) were all appropriate. I’ve tried, in writing this, to point out that there should be some type of corresponding improvement to the long-ignored warrior class as well. Each of the melee classes has its issues. Rangers are way too fragile. Paladins can certainly use some offensive spells to balance them out, especially at lower levels. Rogues are in virtually the same boat as warriors. <br />
<br />
As customer service has become increasingly difficult for Verant, they have chosen to shut down the EQ message boards. As it stands now, our only method of communication with Verant is through email. If you would like to see some of the changes discussed here implemented in EQ, let Alan Vancouvering know. Now Alan is a genuinely nice, diplomatic guy. Although I have voiced some of my frustration with Verant in this little editorial, I don’t want Alan deluged with nasty-grams. I am suggesting that a polite email might make him want to look again at these issues. You can reach him at <a href="mailto:Avancouvering@Verant.com">Avancouvering@Verant.com</a> I would suggest that you title your email “The Warrior Make-Over.” Feel free to copy sections of this editorial and include them in your message. Perhaps if enough of us send Alan our suggestions, he will take a second look at the warrior class, and give them the break they so desperately need.</div>

		<div>wow... lots of reading there... but I do have a problem with it... it was written 2.5 years ago, give or take... by someone who doesn't appear to play the high end game... <br />
<br />
Not that some of the things aren't still valid, but seriously... warriors have far more hps than other melee, their AC is considerably higher, their damage mitigation is far better, and they now have higher skill caps, etc.... the list goes on, basically warriors are awesome tanks, when played right. <br />
<br />
The other part that gets me... <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

<br />
I don't think rangers are broken. Their damage output is insane... with atk ratings as high as 2300 now days, and with archery, there is little chance they are going to need any kind of AC or hps =) <br />
<br />
Paladins have good defense, good hps, good healing abilities, etc. but they're not a DPS class, they dont' need offensive spells... it would be nice, yes, but so would letting melee bind, and casters melee... but it wont' happen<br />
<br />
Rogues in the same boat as warriors?! since when! when you need sustained (Aten style) DPS, or hell, just plain DPS, it doesn't get much better than a rogue! don't expect them to tank, that's not what their class is for!!<br />
<br />
Anyhow... i think the author of this lost my faith in his post when he posted some of it, i lost more faith when i realized how old the post was... (Early velious era, hell, look at the price he quotes for Cobalt boots!) <br />
<br />
I think any current high end warrior could probably give a far more accurate picture of where warriors are lacking... for one, Taunt is still difficult without relying on taunt weapons... the taunt skill should be adjusted for warriors... however... not so much that nobody has to worry about aggro control... that would be making things way too easy....</div>

		<div>You know alot of the posts I read on this come from people playing at the "high end" and "end game" and they constantly state there's no problems at all with the warriors or what they are capable of. Most of them being elemental/Time flagged guilds. Well the problem with that is I'm neither of these two and playing a warrior I can state first hand glaring weaknesses of the class. I'm sure everyone has things they dont like about their class. But it's pretty bad when people in your group say things, which has happened to me on more than one occasion. So in short the solution is we all get elemental/time flagged and every class works "as intended" Till then I'll still play my warrior and live with the glaring apparant weaknesses my class has that the uber leet people must of left behind in the wake of their godhood forgetting what it's like to be from the ghetto.</div>
