		<div>SO awesome. I loved this. Saw it on my birthday. I thought the story was cool. I love all this pirate lore. Therre were things that happened that I didn't expect. I loved Davy Jones, he just looked so cool. I can't wait for the thrid movie. Its more of a second part to this one, but I know it's gonna be great.<br />
<br />
The end credits are long, but try an stay til end. Thers a lil bit there and it's supposed to hint to the third movie. I'm trying to figure out how, but I did stay to see it hehe</div>

		<div>Yeah, Dead Man's Chest leaves a lot of hanging questions. But the 3rd movie will most likely (I hope!!) answer them all.<br />

It was a good flick, I think they tried to jam a lot of the old pirate lore into it though. Even though this is a &quot;Disney&quot;, I seriously wouldnt bring a kid under 12ish. Davy Jones' crew may just give the child nightmares.</div>

I didnt think was too much stuff. I tok Noah to see it. He was fine during the movie but when I told him  wanted to wait til after the credits he freaked. I totally forgot that at the end of the 1st ne the undead Monkey sorta jumped out at the end, he hated that. But he was fune no nght mares, hes a bit braver than most heh<br />
<br />
Can ask in PM Grant never know I might be able to explain, that is if ya cant wait til next movie hehe</div>

		<div>It was better than average.  Took awhile to get the story going, and Capt Jack Sparrow wasn't as fun of a character as the first movie.  Plus they had a lot of lore they tried to explain that kinda dragged on.  Eventually it gets good though.<br />

I give it 3.5 stars out of 5.</div>

Things were left hanging, but itleaves it open for number 3, Johnny Depp actually wants to do number 4 too, I don't mind, he can hoist my sail anytime!!  I enjoyed it, it was a bit of a trip down memory lane for me, the 10 times I rode the Pirates of the Carribean at disneyland all those years ago.... :)</div>

		<div>Opening day happened to be my Birthday so i took myself out to see it ;) <br />
 <br />
 I liked it... and knowing that the 3rd movie was filmed at the same time I figured it would end on a Matrix style cliffhanger. I didn't stay through the credits... &gt;&lt; i should have known but I had a huge diet coke during the movie and i REALLY had to run the second the credits started rolling!<br />
<br />
Fall, you gotta go again, they just reopened PotC at dismal-land with Barbosa and Sparrow (with the movie actor's voice) and the ship was turned into the black pearl. <br />
<br />
Also, the Columbia got a revamp into the black pearl... and on the premier day Johnny Depp was there in person for the show, dressed as Jack Sparrow =)</div>

I do want to go again, I have heard that they revamped it but didn't know exactly what, that sounds great, I would have loved to be there on opening day, specially to see him dressed as Jack Sparrow! that would have been awesome!  I am a big kid at heart, I just love Disneyland, PoTC got the biggest workout of all the rides there though when we went :)  Loved it!</div>
