<p><b> Happy New Year!</b></p>

<p>I cant believe 2002 is just around the corner. I remember when I was just a kid thinking about how cool the year 2000 would be and that we would have hover cars, etc. What the heck happend?... its 2002 already!! <br />
<br />
I hope every one has a Happy and safe New Year.</p>

<p>Lol when I was little, I was in awe of the fact that I would be turning 23 in the year 2000!!!  (woo)... I also remember telling myself that I was going to have my first baby that year so it would be easy to keep up with how old he/she was.  Apparently I'm either psychic or I plan really well....</p>
