Well, with Venril Sathir approaching its first birthday, we thought we would give you all the chance to find out what makes the GM staff tick! How did we end up working in EQ? How old are we? Can you have your summoned bag back (answer: no, of course not!)<p></b><br><br><p>Here are a list of questions posed by players and some (hopefully) interesting answers!<p><br>From Cyrium Lichekiller:<br><br>I would be interested to know what your feelings are regarding interactive content within EQ? <br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I love interactive / dynamic content in EQ and especially enjoy the simple, well done events, rather than trying to entertain with grandiose spectacle and huge, complex themes.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I personally prefer treasure hunt like events and have a dislike of slash and hack content unless it is an organized PVP tournament.</font><br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I have never been a great fan of the calendar, as advertising events, post PoP in particular, causes them to be swamped by players who feel frustrated that there is not enough content for 170+ players. I like the more “random” and personal touch of smaller impromptu events. I would obviously try and make more use of the calendar, especially if we go on to run a server Best of the Best this winter.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>The calendar is a good idea, but like Tartharon I prefer random and undisclosed events.</font><br><br>From Loltheb:<br><br>Suppose there's the "How on earth do you find yourself a job like that?"<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Ubi advertised the job. I applied, got a phone interview and then went to Paris for a face to face. The rest is history!</font> <br><br><font color=red>Sharodika   <br><br>I saw the job advertised on a german job site and sent off my application by email and in French. I’d already been living in Paris for a number of years.</font><br><br>"What is the mix of game-time to office and people management and is that an ideal ratio?"<br> <br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Recently I have taken more of a back seat role and provide more assistance and ideas bouncing for the GMs, rather than the early days after my promotion when I was missing server GM’ing so much I was on server for any excuse! I still love going on server and helping people out, but I have had to learn I am there to do the things the other GMs can’t, rather than the things I find interesting!</font><br><br>"Do you still play?" (If you had the spare time)<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Yes, but nowhere near as regularly as before I got the job. Being a Game-keeper all day and then going out at night poaching soon loses it’s appeal.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I did stop playing for about 6 months, now I play off and on, but sometimes it’s like stuffing your face with chocolate until you feel ill….</font><br><br>"Is it still as much of a challenge / fun as it was back in December 2002?" would be good too!<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I would say the challenge is even greater now, than when we first launched. The last 3 expansions have added depth and complexity to the game and our population has continued to grow throughout the past year. So we have more customers, with more complex problems than when we launched.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Yes it is a fun and interesting job.</font><br><br>From Rancour:<br><br>I think it's a marvellous idea, and actually very brave of you! I would certainly be interested in contributing some questions for you. I wonder if you would be prepared to provide any background, eg, general age range, general area of origin, schooling, education, etc - I emphasize general, you don't want to end up with disgruntled gamers knocking on your door!<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I was born in Louth, Lincolnshire in 1971. So that makes me the ripe old age of 32! Possibly not the pimple-faced 17 yr old kid that some may believe me to be! I was educated to ‘O’ level standard at school and gained an Electrical Engineering qualification with the RAF. I have self-learned a smattering of HTML, but I am not a programmer / coder by any standards.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I come from a place called Eccles in Manchester. ‘O’ level education standard also, but I left school to go and wander around Europe. I lived in Munich for several months before moving to Paris where I learnt French and became the manager of a record shop for about 12 years before having my own venture with an internet ‘gaming’ café.</font><br> <br>Also, how you got into this line of 'work', what your gaming or computing background is, favourite games. Do you have goals or ambitions in the gaming world or do you just enjoy being a part of something like this?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>My gaming or computing background started with playing “Rhino” and “Night Driver” on my friend’s father’s Commodore PET. From there we went through the Atari 2600, to the Vic-20 (I still love Radar Rat Race and the quality music!), to the Commodore 64. I thought the games on the 64 were some of the most polished in terms of the technology base they worked on. Elite+, Revs+ and ‘The Sentinel’ were incredible. I bought myself an Amiga with an 80 Meg HDD later and became totally hooked on F1GP. Then onto the PC and EQ!<br><br>Also: GoldenEye on the N64<br><br>Gran Turismo and Driver (God that was tough to complete!) on the PSX<br><br>Gran Turismo III A-Spec, Tony Hawk II on the PSII<br><br>Halo and Project Gotham Racing on the X-Box</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I have never been a big gamer where computers are concerned a part from Everquest, Heroes of Might and Magic 3,Diablo, Masters of Orion and Starcraft.I love adventure/enigma games, Phantasmagoria (1+2 great game that was&#61514;), Myst, Riven, Pandora Directive. I am in fact a chess player with an international ELO though. My Computing background is actually the shop I owned, the park was put together by myself with some help from friends.</font><br><br>From Celdile:<br><br>I would be interested to know if the job has turned out as you envisaged it would. Also, is there much interaction between our GMs and the SOE GMs?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I think overall the job has turned out quite close to my original thoughts. I cannot say I expected to get promoted quite so quickly, but necessity makes strange bedfellows and I hope I have acquitted myself well in the role so far. <br><br>I am in contact with a lot of the SOE staff on a more admin and technical level. We were trained by the SOE Global Customer Services Manager, who is still my mentor and a remarkable guy. So, we are trained to the same standards as SOE GMs, but we do not have a great deal of direct interaction with the SOE server GMs. I tend to deal more with the Dev Team and occasionally with Ops.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Hmm yes and no!</font><br><br>From Guts:<br><br>My question: whats the single most funny petition / situation you have dealt with as a GM?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br>We get so many petitions that can be considered funny that it is hard to really pin one down as the funniest. Sometimes you get a petition: “help plz” and the petitioner has already logged off, which are always amusing.<br><br>Some of the giggle ones are just the sort of: “Did someone really do something that silly?” type petitions. Stacking gems on Velious armour quests still happens all too frequently, which leads us to believe that those are the first quests players seem to attempt these days.<br><br>I got the chance to tank a PoP mini-boss last week, after it had spawned / pathed in a wall and kept disappearing into the zone geometry. Flame Lick is a really fun spell to get agro with!<br><br>We got a petition this week: "Help I've just been kicked off EQ and when I re-logged all my characters had been deleted!". Sharo checked the character names and could find no trace of them on Venril Sathir. Questioning the player lead us to find out they actually played on a different server, which had some bearing on us being unable to trace the characters!</font><br><br>And did you resolve it ?!? <br><br><font color=green>Yes, I managed to reposition Rydda`Dar out of the zone geometry, which was satisfying as otherwise I would have had no option but to kill the mob and the players would have lost their spawn.</font><br><br>From Fenlon Treekin:<br><br>What drove you to become a GM in the first place?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>A Volvo 360! I was working nights in a mail order catalogue warehouse in England when I applied for the GM job. The market fell out of the WAN Networking industry in the UK in the 2001, post 9/11 and I had been doing temporary work for months before I had this opportunity.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Internet gaming café’s are really not a good idea to make a living with!</font><br><br>And would you make the same choice now knowing how you are treated/seen by the community?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Definitely! I am not so arrogant that I don’t see that some players may not like me, or the decisions I have made. Overall though, I would like to think that I have been fair and consistent and most anger directed towards me is because I am the tangible face of the company.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Yes, I have always been in the direct line of ire from disgruntled customers, just now they can’t hit me :p . I realise that we cannot please everyone, we have rules and conduct codes to abide by, as do the players.</font><br><br>From Lodan:<br><br>How much time do you actually get to play EQ?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Not a great deal, certainly not as much as some players!</font><br><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Not that much either, and when I do I am a trade skill freak!</font> <br><br>Do you still enjoy EQ and want to play it after working in it all day<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Yes and no. I still enjoy playing, but at a different pace now than before. I am less “goal-driven” and more playing for the fun and friendship.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I tend to get frustrated with tradeskills, but I love them.</font><br><br>How many GM's have been killed in game and how many times?<br> Preferably with stories. Ever had a God trained on you?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I haven’t died as a GM, although both Sharodika and I both came close, trying to solo Nagafen on the Beta server. I did tank Rydda`Dar last week, to sort out a bug. I’m sure I’ll forget my GM invulnerability one day, but I’ve been okay so far!</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Hmm actually the other day on the Sebilis server, I had to go and sort out the warrior GL in Freeport. I didn’t have my GM superman buff and somehow did what every newbie does and hit him by mistake :p He turned out to be an Shadow Knight (!!) and DT’ed me for about 5K = dead Sharodika.</font><br><br>Do you ever get bored and go solo Quarm?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>No. Before the Beta server went live we ran around like kids in a sweet-shop but things like that hold only a passing interest. Like any game with “Cheat mode” it quickly loses appeal. Also many of the scripted events require the correct triggers to be up and you could quickly find zones broken if GMs used them as “stress balls”.</font> <br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>No if and when I get bored, I go and read the Venril Sathir community board!</font><br><br>From Iilolian:<br><br>Do you guys (CSR staff) talk about us in private? <br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>It is one of the most important parts of the job and team-work, to share relevant information. Whether it is about the game, or known bugs, or even players!</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Wouldn’t you all love to know eh?</font><br><br>From StellaEQ:<br><br>Has the past year turned out as you expected? I started here the day VS went live, and VS is very different now than what I thought it would be a year down the line (mostly in a good way).<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I think it has turned out rather well. I shared the frustration of the community when we fought to open the server as a “clean start” and also when the economic reality left us with no option but to allow movelogs far earlier than we would have liked. I think the server community has coped with every challenge given to us and we are still getting stronger and stronger.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Yes, there were a couple of things we ourselves were not keen on, but it had to be done. It was lovely starting with a brand new server though, and everyone growing up together.</font><br><br><br>From HaggardVS:<br><br>How do you feel your job is affected by Ubi's relationship with SoE? Does this relationship have much of an impact on the way YOU would like to carry out your CSR role?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Hmm, we have a license to administer CS on Venril, but that license is under pretty strict guidelines as to what we can and cannot do. That is required to maintain the integrity of SOE’s product (We could not run VS as a “free candy” server, without seriously damaging the product image of EQ).</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>We have to abide by the rules set out by SOE, they made the game what it is and I respect it.</font><br><br>From Xzith:<br><br>What do you bite to control the attacks of hysterical giggles you must get at times? What are the funniest petitions you've dealt with? I don't mean name names, but just a description of the situation would be good <br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Again, there are so many. A lot of the “gentle” funny pets are very welcome, as they can take the edge off a tough shift and raise your mood. I would be lying if I tried to say that we don’t have a good old giggle when players do silly things. But that does not affect the way we do our jobs… apart from when we can’t type because we are laughing too hard!</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I have no recollection of only one funny situation, what does make me laugh though is the fact that’s some players do not realize we are normal human beings and yes we listen to things like Type o Negative and Grooverider and we do drink Smirnoff Ice</font><br><br>From Seffrid:<br><br>1.Given that once we transfer to a Ubisoft server from a SoE server we are unable to transfer back, are you aware of any plans to enable Ubisoft customers to benefit from the SoE All Access Subscription and if not would you be willing to put the case to Ubisoft for allowing that please?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>This has been looked at. The current reality is that if you are not an SOE customer, you are not entitled to offers which SOE provide for their customers. The difficulty is, Ubi do not administer CS for the other products in the bundle at this time. So, if a bundled subscription was offered, the division of revenue would be complex to say the least. This is something which is still open to review though.</font><br><br>2.Where do you think MMORPGs will be in 3 years time? Where do you think YOU will be then ie do you have career plans within the industry beyond your present position?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I think the market will continue to grow, but with more of a diversity. I think the community aspect of  EQ is one of it’s strengths and any game that can create a strong sense of community will do well. I hope to continue in the industry. I would like to think that the excellent grounding in MMO CS that I have received with EQ can be the foundation for a career in this business.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I feel that the world of MMORPG is rather ethereal and I’m not sure if it will actually serve as a solid base for a career, even though I hope so </font><br><br>3.If you were given a free hand by SoE to make one change in the structure/coding/content of EQ, what would you choose?<br><br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Umm, possibly fix the Wizard Al`Kabor spells to have a useable mana cost and damage per mana. Maybe fix root to work better with direct damage spells at low level. Possibly either permanently fix boats, or just put the gnomes in place and remove the boats altogether. The advent of PoP and the LDoN Farstones has shrunk the world so much that the boat journey as a time sink loses relevance now, I feel.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Certainly get rid of the boats, make all Paladins Halflings (just to reduce the ego side), introduce items made from trade skills with click effects and give druids a resurrection spell!!</font><br><br>From Gaimon:<br><br>Did you make ingame-decisions you later regretted?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I don’t recall anything major. Sometimes there have been decisions you regret having to make, but not actually making them. Players getting themselves banned, simply because they won’t tell you the truth is always difficult, as I know only too well how much the game means to people. Every major decision in the team always leads to a discussion and we try to learn from any issue that might have been better considered, to make sure our quality and consistency of decision-making continues to improve.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>I never regret anything I do, I avoid having to by thinking carefully before making any decisions.</font><br><br>Do you talk to your girlfriend about your job?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>Every day! She is an EQ player herself. So while many of the “behind the curtain” things cannot be talked about, the everyday stresses and strains of the job are discussed, yes. Luckily she is very patient and has the ability to make me see that it is not worth getting up tight over.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>Hmm not really, I talk more with my boyfriend about it! He doesn’t play Everquest at all so we talk more about the working environment and everyday normal work stress.</font><br><br>Are you personally looking forward to any of the upcoming other MMORPGS?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I’ll be interested to see how Matrix Online shapes up, as I love the films. Of course EQ2 will be the big one for me. To see how SOE will take the success and market position they have with EQ1 and provide a new challenge and a new angle to MMOs will be very exciting.</font><br><br><font color=red>Sharodika<br><br>EQ2 and Matrix online, I will also try Uru the new Myst online.</font><br><br>Why did you choose your in game appearance as a human bard?<br><br><font color=green>Tartharon<br><br>I wanted to be as anonymous and unassuming as possible in my choice of avatar. I strongly believe that humility is a great part of being a good GM. I hope that people remember me for my actions and not for my appearance. I chose a Bard, because naively I wanted to be able to track mobs, but to wear plate armour. By the time I got far enough into the GM tools to realise that track was largely irrelevant, I had become comfortable with the avatar, so I didn’t want to change. I like the fact that I have looked exactly the same since the day the server opened.<br><br>Well! We hope that was fun for you all to read. We will look to add to the piece this week; perhaps adding answers to the same questions, but fielded to memebers of the Volunteer Guides on VS</font><br><p><br><br><br><? echo _datepost?> 06.11.03<br><br>>> <a href="index.php?languesite=uk">See other news</a>		</td>	<td class="fondtexte" width="10"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="10" height="1"></td>	<td class="encadrefondtexte"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></table>		<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr valign=top>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bg.gif" width="17" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif" width="100%"><center><img src="img/frise_bas.gif" width="121" height="28" border="0" alt=""></center></td>	<td align=right background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bd.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td></tr></table></td>
