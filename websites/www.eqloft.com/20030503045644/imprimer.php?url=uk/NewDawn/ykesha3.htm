<p align="center"><b>FAQ THE LEGACY OF YKESHA</b></p>
<p><b>1 &#150; What is The Legacy of Ykesha?</b> <br>
  <br>
  The Legacy of Ykesha will be the first download-only extension for EverQuest. 
  This product will not be available in stores. This extension will include some 
  great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for characters ranging from 
  level 35 up to level 60. </p>
<p>Legacy of Ykesha Features include: </p>
<p>A new playable race: Frogloks <br>
  Enhanced Looking For Group Tool <br>
  New Cartography System <br>
  New Magic Item slot: Charms <br>
  Armor Dyes <br>
  Dozens of new creatures <br>
  Expanded bank capacity <br>
  New zones <br>
  New spells </p>
<p>For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com" target="_blank">www.legacyofykesha.com</a> 
</p>
<p><b>2 &#150; What is the price for this expansion? </b><br>
  <br>
  The Legacy of Ykesha expansion will cost players US$17.99 to obtain if they 
  pre-order ($21.99 if you order after February 24th) with an international credit 
  card. <b>It should be available soon in Euro with a national credit card. </b></p>
<p><b>3 &#150; How can I get the expansion? </b><br>
  <br>
  If you preorder it, you will have an incremental download. It means you will 
  download pieces of the expansion from time to time and you will be able to use 
  it the 24th of February. If you wait this date to order it you will download 
  the expansion all in once. <br>
  <br>
  By selecting 'yes' to the &quot;Predownload Ykesha&quot; option on the patcher 
  or, in the advanced options, clicking the box next to &quot;Legacy of Ykesha 
  (predownload)&quot;, you can begin downloading the files early to reduce your 
  download on release day. <b>This option will be available soon for european 
  patcher</b>.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that ordering from the EverQuest login will bill the charge directly 
  to the credit card on account for your EverQuest subscription (though the card 
  will not be billed until the day the extension goes live). You will need an 
  international credit card.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to charge the extension to the same credit card that you 
  have on record for your EverQuest account, or if you use Game Cards and do not 
  have a credit card on account, you can pre-order the extension at our online 
  store. Again, your credit card will not be charged until the day the extension 
  goes live and you need an international one. <b>It should be available soon 
  in Euro with a national credit card. </b></p>
<p>Once The Legacy of Ykesha goes live you will only be able to purchase it from 
  the online store, and the pre-order discount will no longer be available. Once 
  you purchase the extension, and once The Legacy of Ykesha goes live, you will 
  be able to download it immediately and begin your adventure. </p>
<p><b>4 - What if I want to cancel my pre-order?</b></p>
<p>You can cancel your pre-order up until 12:01 a.m. (PST) - 20:01 p.m. (GMT) 
  on the live date. Thereafter, all sales are final. To do so, just log in at 
  our online store and visit the My Account link. You will be able to cancel your 
  pre-order from there. Just follow these steps:</p>
<p>Directions to Cancel Pre-Order<br>
  1. Visit Station Store.<br>
  2. Go to Billing Info and sign in.<br>
  3. View Current pre-orders.<br>
  4. Click Cancel button; you will receive a cancellation email.<br>
  <br>
  <b>5 - How does this download-only thing work?</b></p>
<p>This extension will only be available as a product download. There will be 
  no box to buy in the stores, so all of the data needs to be downloaded from 
  our servers. You will be able to incrementally download the files for the extension 
  before the release date. We will make these files available for download during 
  the EverQuest login procedure. Downloading the files gradually prior to the 
  launch of the extension will minimize the size of your patch on launch day.</p>
<p>If you purchase the extension after launch day, you will need to download all 
  of the extension files (we estimate it will be about 120 megabytes). Purchasing 
  the extension after launch will cause your account to be flagged and you will 
  be able to download The Legacy of Ykesha extension files immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>6 - I have a dialup connection; any hints on patching?</b></p>
<p>If you do not have a broadband connection, your downloads will be slow. What 
  you might do is try to manage the process by patching the new files while you 
  work or sleep. To do that, in the patcher Advanced Options, keep the Legacy 
  of Ykesha box unchecked (so that you aren't checking for and patching any available 
  extension files before every play session). When you are done for the evening 
  (or perhaps in the morning), open the patcher, check the Legacy of Ykesha box, 
  and then rerun the patcher. That way, you don't have to sit idly at your machine 
  and wait for it to patch for hours.</p>
<p>Please be advised that we expect the final patch (on the live date) to exceed 
  50 megabytes and, depending on your connection speed, may take you several hours 
  to download.<br>
</p>
<p><b>7 &#150; If I am a European player, what will happen for me? </b><br>
  <br>
  Nothing special, wherever you preorder the expansion you will get it with an 
  incremental download or a complete one and you will be able to use it the 24th 
  of February. <br>
  The patcher for all three servers (Venril Sathir, Sebilis, Kael Drakkal) will 
  be updated soon to make that download available. <br>
