<p align="left"><b>From Pond to Paladin</b><br>
  or<br>
  <i>The Origins of Froglok and Man</i><br>
  by<br>
  Glupurp Stoneskipper, Paladin of Marr<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  My noble kinsman, I bring to you the knowledge or our origins, as well as the 
  origin of Man that has been bestowed upon me by the scholars of the City of 
  New Tanaan, and those who have visited the Halls of Honor, home of our Lord 
  Mithaniel Marr. I am but a humble Paladin of Mithaniel Marr, born like many 
  of our kind in the swamps of Southern Antonica, and deserve no adulation for 
  penning these words. This work is in honor of all Froglok, current, past, and 
  yet to come. In the early ages of Norrath, before the arrival of Man, the Marr 
  Twins did walk the face of Norrath. The children of a God of Power, Tarrew<br>
  Marr the Water Lord, the Marr Twins searched amongst the mortals of Norrath 
  a cause to champion and embrace with their divinity. The Gods of Nature puzzled 
  over the Marr Twins absence of a divine purpose, and the Gods of Influence scoffed 
  at the twins for seeking such a purpose amongst the mortals. The most malicious 
  of the Gods, Innoruuk, and Cazic-Thule, sought to corrupt the young twins to 
  strengthen the forces of hatred and fear.<br>
  <br>
  Innoruuk, the twisted God of Hatred and Spite sent his mortal followers to Tarrews 
  daughter, Erollisi Marr, to tempt her and seduce her into the darkness. With 
  the wisdom imparted to the Goddess by her father, she saw through the Teir'Dals 
  deceptions, and their wickedness was more visible to her eyes than even their 
  physical forms. So it came to pass that Erollisi journeyed to the lands of Tunare's 
  fair elves, to escape the sickening advances of the Teir'Dal. It was in the 
  early kingdoms of the elves, that Erollisi did find warmth, peace, and beauty 
  in the harsh realm of the mortals and it was there that she embraced and was 
  in return embraced by a most mortal of traits. It was there she found love.<br>
  <br>
  While Erollisi fended off the advances of Innoruuks mortal agents, the forces 
  of Cazic-Thule beset her twin brother, Mithaniel Marr. Serpents, phantoms, and 
  all manner of frightful creatures conjured and<br>
  commanded by Cazic-Thules mortal minions came to Mithaniel to assault his body 
  and mind. Mithaniel was no mortal however, and his will is strong, the minions 
  of Thule could not instill within him the fear of their dark lord. They did 
  succeed however, in luring the brave Mithaniel to the swamps of Norrath, the 
  deadly, dank, lands where the creatures of Cazic-Thule were the strongest and 
  most numerous. An army of Trolls, Lizard Folk, and forgotten creatures of unspeakable 
  horror beset Mithaniel Marr, and so it came to pass that he became a captive 
  to the minions of the Lord of Fear.<br>
  <br>
  Mithaniel, imprisoned in magical bonds provided to his captors by Cazic-Thule, 
  and tortured by relentless monstrosities, prayed to his father day and night 
  for forgiveness and salvation. The prayers continued,<br>
  unanswered, until the brave God, weary from torture and weakened by the dark 
  magic of Cazic-Thule fell into a deep slumber. <br>
  <br>
  It was then that Terris-Thule visited the slumbering God to inflict his sleep 
  with nightmares more horrible than the events he had endured at the hands of 
  his captors during his waking hours. However, at the<br>
  beseeching of her father, Cazic-Thule, Terris was not permitted to inflict such 
  terror onto Mithaniel Marr until after she first deceived him through his dreams 
  and stole the gift of life from his body. So Terris did as her father commanded 
  and then the slumbering horrors began.<br>
  <br>
  Morell-Thule, the forsaken son of Cazic, and brother of Terris, took notice 
  of Terris manipulations of the slumbering God, for while Terris is the Queen 
  of Nightmares, Morell is the King of Dreams. For reasons<br>
  unknown, perhaps simply to foul the plans of his wicked father and sister, Morell-Thule 
  stole the gift of life that had been taken from the slumbering Mithaniel and 
  escaped into his Demi-Plane of Dreams. Knowing that his enraged family would 
  soon visit his home, Morell divided Mithaniels Gift of Life, scattering one 
  half across all the swamps of Norrath, the sacred lands of his father, Cazic-Thule. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Where Mithaniels Gift of Life fell upon the swamps of Norrath, the first Froglok 
  Tads were born. Those first Tads had the hardest trials of our people. Until 
  that point, the swamps belonged only to the foul and<br>
  destructive creatures of the dark gods. Fortunately the gift of life that had 
  brought our first ancestors into being also empowered them with the bravery 
  and valor Mithaniel Marr had exhibited during his trials in the mortal realms.<br>
  <br>
  Once the swamps had been seeded with the first of our kind, the Lord of Dreams, 
  Morell-Thule, visited Mithaniel Marr's twin sister, Erollisi Marr. While the 
  Goddess of Love blissfully rested in the lands of the fair elves, Morell-Thule 
  visited her in a dream and gave to her the second half of Mithaniel's Gift of 
  Life. It was soon to be evident to the fair elves that their visiting daughter 
  of the Gods was with child and they took her to an uninhabited region of the 
  frozen northlands of Antonica, where they could tend to and guard her in seclusion.<br>
  <br>
  While the elves watched after Erollisi, the first of our ancestors grew from 
  Tads into adult Frogloks, and Morell-Thule gifted them with dreams of the imprisoned 
  Mithaniel Marr, and visions of a means to free<br>
  the brave son of Tarrew. So it came to pass that from all the swamps of Norrath, 
  the first Frogloks rose in arms against the minions of Cazic-Thule, fighting 
  valiantly to the site of Mithaniel Marrs<br>
  imprisonment, guided by visions from the Lord of Dreams.<br>
  <br>
  For uncounted years the Frogloks battled the evil inhabitants of Norraths swamplands, 
  learning the lessons of both victory and defeat. Alas, Cazic-Thule is an ancient 
  and powerful God and his minions are<br>
  numerous and diverse. Try as they might, the ancestor Frogloks could not reach 
  their imprisoned God, but never did they cease their efforts, despite the daunting 
  odds.<br>
  <br>
  Then, after some time, a small army arrived on the borders of the swamp that 
  was Mithaniel Marrs prison. Not an army of Frogloks, but an army of Northmen, 
  the children of Erollisi Marr. They too had been guided by visions and dreams 
  of the imprisoned God from whose life they were conceived. Seeking justice for 
  the imprisonment of their father, the Northmen joined with the Froglok armies 
  and the alliance of Froglok and Man succeeded in freeing their father Mithaniel 
  Marr. The minions of Cazic-Thule and the Avatar of Fear himself fell before 
  the unity and valor of the children of Marr. For the first time in the history 
  of Norrath, the swamps were not safe for the evil creations of the dark gods.<br>
  <br>
  It was in the brave and selfless actions of the ancestor Frogloks and Northmen 
  that Mithaniel Marr discovered the mortal trait of Valor, and because of Morell-Thule's 
  honorable delivering of the truth of our origins to our ancestors in visions 
  and dream, Mithaniel also chose to champion the virtue of honesty as well as 
  valor.<br>
  <br>
  Such is the tale of my Lord Mithaniel Marr, and the origins of my fellow Frogloks, 
  and of our distant brethren, the race of Men. It is a shame that so many of 
  our kind, as well as many of the race of men, have<br>
  strayed from the virtues of our ancestors. May Mithaniel Marr bless us, his 
  faithful servants, with the powers to redeem our fallen kin from the clutches 
  of evil.<br>
