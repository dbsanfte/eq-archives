<font class="orange"><b>Bard</b></font> <br> 
<br>
Bards are good solo players (because of their "hybrid" nature  - being Tank, Caster and Healer all rolled in one). Nevertheless it is when they are in a group that the Bards reveal their true strength. Their songs affect all companions and their various powers can nurse (or "buff" - increase attributes), charm, frighten and wound enemies. Bards also have the ability to learn a new song at each level!<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Beastlord</b></font><br>
<br>
Beastlords are the spiritual warriors of the primitive cultures of Norrath and Luclin. Like the Shaman of their peoples, the Beastlords have a close relationship with the spirit world and an uncanny affinity with the spirits of the animal kingdom. The Beastlord's fighting style is derived from tactics used by wild beasts thus they prefer to fight unarmed or with only small piercing weapons such as daggers which to the Beastlord represent claws and fangs. Beastlords are so closely attuned to the animal spirit world that they can befriend or control animals to serve them and fight along side them.<br>
<br>
<b><font class="orange">Cleric (Clerc)</font></b> <br>
<br>
At low levels the Cleric belongs to one of the best ‘all-rounder’ classes. They can buff and inflict magical damage, and know how to fight as well as take a beating (thanks to their armour and defensive spells). At high levels, Clerics lose their versatility but can become a guardian angel to a group dedicated mostly to the Tanks, whom they can protect and care for. Resurrection spells are particularly popular!<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Druid</b></font> <br>
<br>
Druids are odd-job characters. Brilliant at nothing but gifted in everything! Their versatility makes them a very good loner while they are gifted with buffs, treatments, attack spells and numerous motion spells which speed up (Spirit of the Wolf) or slow down (Snare) their targets. At high levels the Druid can even teleport companions! It is this, most of all, which makes them very popular with groups because, on the whole, they are less suited to physical or magical fighting than the other two Healers (the Cleric and the Shaman).<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Enchanter</b></font> <br>
<br>
The Enchanter’s magic is primarily defensive. They can possess Pets (‘animations’ who are, kind of, invisible guardians) but are much less versatile than those belonging to the Magician or the Necromancer (they cannot receive orders so their only function is to follow their master and defend him against his enemies.) An enchanter’s attack spells are pitiful but they possess the best buffs and debuffs (to increase allies’ attributes and weaken enemies), and are the undisputed masters when it comes to illusion and controlling spirits. They alone can influence Intelligence, Wisdom and Mana! Vulnerable as a solo player they shine when in a group, especially at high level.<br>
<br>
<b><font class="orange">Magician</font></b><br>
<br>
The Magician has some pretty effective attack and defense spells with the main weapon being their Pet: a powerful and capricious elemental creature (whose powers vary according to its elemental kingdom). With such an ally the Magician can play solo easily (at least at low levels). Conjuration spells can provide food, drink, useful objects and magical weapons free of charge and it’s this ‘horn of plenty’ function which make Magicians very popular with groups.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Monk</b></font><br>
<br>
If a Warrior’s role is to take punishment, the Monk’s role is to mete it out! Of course, with fewer Life Points than the Warrior and, specifically, the inability to wear heavy armour, Monks are, and have to be, better at avoiding blows and they are still the most powerful of the hybrids (Rangers, Paladins and Shadow Knights). Most of all they have many means of attack and are all swift and devastating! From level 17, Feigning Death is a craft which often helps save a Monk’s own life and those of his companions.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Necromancer</b></font><br>
<br>
The Necromancer is one of the most complete classes in the game. Possessing various powerful spells: DOTs (‘Damage Over Time’) are unbeatable, main attack spells drain ‘Life Points’ off enemies to regenerate their own, they have all the Casters’ common distortion and divination spells and most of all can summon skeletal pets as bodyguards (from the very first level!). And the downside to this terrifying power? A VERY bad reputation, which means death on sight in most of Norrath’s towns…<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Paladin </b></font><br>
<br>
A Paladin is not as good a fighter as the Warrior or the Monk. On the other hand they possess some valuable assets. Access to the most powerful weapons in Norrath (the legendary Soulfire and the mythical Fiery Avenger), the power to Lay Hands (restoring all of a character’s Hit Points) and, from level 9, he acquires the Cleric’s spells. These specific powers make Paladins the sworn enemy of the living dead. As Tank-Healer hybrids they must earn more Experience Points than the ‘pure’ classes to go up in level.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Ranger</b></font> <br>
<br>
The Ranger is the ‘ecologist’ twin of the Paladin. Refusing to wear metal armour (making him more vulnerable) they prefer Druid spells to those of the Cleric (thus emphasising versatility at the expense of power), from Level 9. In a group, the rangers’ special skills make them the ideal scouts. Using the ability to Sneak, they move without a sound, allowing them to explore an area without drawing the attention of potential enemies. They survive in the wilderness by Foraging food and water and can Track anyone and anything in a given zone (thereby avoiding hours of searching). As a Tank-Healer hybrid Rangers must earn more Experience Points than the ‘pure’ classes to go up in level.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Rogue</b></font> <br>
<br>
The Rogue is a worthy combatant, but not as powerful as the real Tanks. Their strengths lie in skills, of which there are many varied kinds including picking locks, silent movement, mastering the art of poisons etc., and virtually one new skill can be learnt at each level! Unfortunately they’re all far from useful… A Rogues most rewarding ability is being able to Backstab (acquired at level 10) allowing the infliction of increased damage when attacking an opponent’s back with a piercing weapon..<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Shadow Knight (Chevalier de l'Ombre)</b></font><br>
<br>
The Shadow Knight is an evil version of the Paladin and can inflict vicious wounds on any opponent using Harm Touch (once every Norrathian day). From level 9 onwards the ability to use some of the Necromancer’s spells (such as summoning Pets) comes into play but, like the Necromancer, there’s often a price on their head in most of Norrath’s towns. As a Tank-Caster hybrid, they must earn more Experience Points than the ‘pure’ classes to go up in level.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Shaman</b></font><br>
<br>
Healers are the most combat-oriented class. They have a varied range of spells including DOTs (Damage Over Time) and very effective buffs. At high levels they can also summon a Pet (which materialises in the form of a ghostly wolf).<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Warrior (Guerrier) </b></font><br>
<br>
An archetypal Tank the Warrior has two vital functions: striking hard and taking blows. Up to level 15 they inflict most damage (with the possible exception of the Monk), while from level 15 onwards they are outstripped by most of the attack spells but the Casters need them to keep the enemy busy! And it’s here that a Warrior’s second great asset comes, supremely, into its own: nobody has as many Life Points as a Warrior and few can rival their class of armour.<br>
<br>
<font class="orange"><b>Wizard</b></font><br>
<br>
The Wizard is the only Caster not to have a Pet but makes up for this weakness by the incredible power of their attack magic. The DD (Direct Damage) spells they possess can reduce enemies to ashes in a matter of seconds but the inability to defend or nurse themselves effectively prevents solo play, even at low levels. A group is required to protect them and take any beatings. Fortunately, you don’t have to go down on your bended knees to get people to accept a Wizard’s help, especially at high level, when, in addition to firepower, they have a teleportation service that’s worthy of a Druid’s.		</td>	<td class="fondtexte" width="10"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="10" height="1"></td>	<td class="encadrefondtexte"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></table>		<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr valign=top>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bg.gif" width="17" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif" width="100%"><center><img src="img/frise_bas.gif" width="121" height="28" border="0" alt=""></center></td>	<td align=right background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bd.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td></tr></table></td><td><img src="img/blind.gif" width="10" height="1"></td></tr></table><br><br><br><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%">
