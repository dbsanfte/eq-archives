		   <p align="justify">Those who wish to move to any of the three 
  European servers may do so through our standard transfer service. This service 
  is similar to our traditional Character Transfer Service, except in three ways: 
  <br>
</p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. All characters from a single server only on your account are moved to the new server. 
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	You keep all items and coins possessed.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	The Sullon Zek server is excluded from this character transfer service.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">The fee for transfer of all characters on a single account from a single server only to a European server through this service is $50.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">Characters and accounts will be transferred "as is" from Sony Online Entertainment to UbiSoft. Once a transfer is completed under service, you will become an UbiSoft customer and no longer a customer of Sony Online Entertainment for billing and customer service purposes.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">Furthermore, when a character move is made from a SOE server to a UbiSoft server, you must consent to allow your personal account information, along with valid credit card information (not including Global Collect account information) to be shared with UbiSoft. Sharing your account information with UbiSoft will allow UbiSoft to establish your account on their servers. Note that, when transferred to a UbiSoft server, your personal information and your credit card information will be governed by UbiSoft's <a href="http://www.ubi.com/US/Info/PrivacyPolicy.htm" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. Personal information and credit card information retained by Sony Online Entertainment will continue to be governed by SOE's <a href="http://sonyonline.com/tos/tos.jsp#privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>. Further note that this service is <b>not available</b> to Legends subscribers. If you elect to transfer your characters through this service, your account will be transferred to UbiSoft for billing and customer service purposes, even if you have other characters under the same account which you do not transfer to the new servers.  If you take advantage of this offer, and your account becomes an "UbiSoft account," <b>you will not be permitted to transfer your account back to SOE</b>.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">All requested transfers are subject to SOE and UbiSoft approval.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify">For more information about taking advantage of this service, please review the policy, guidelines and restrictions below.
             <br></p>
            <p align="justify"><b>All terms and conditions of the </b><a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_EULA.jsp" target="_blank">EverQuest User Agreement and Software License</a> <b>(EULA) and the </b> <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp" target="_blank">Rules Of Conduct</a> <b>found on www.everquest.com apply to any transfer or attempted transfer of characters. You will not be allowed to transfer any characters to an account that is not yours and that was not originally registered by you.

                            <div align="justify">For moving Characters from a US based server to one of the new Europe-based servers, Characters will be moved intact with all items and coins.  This includes all items located in the character's bank and all scribed spells. It is highly recommended that you do not give away or destroy existing items upon requesting a server-to-server transfer, as it is possible that your move request may be denied. Items deleted or given away in anticipation of a future move will not be replaced. <b>(Note: Character corpses cannot be transferred. Before initiating a transfer request, please ensure all your character corpses are looted and are no longer in the game.)</b>
