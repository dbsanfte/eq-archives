<b>1.0 General questions.</b><br>
<br>
<b>1.1 What is a FAQ?</b><br>
<br>
FAQ stands for Frequently Asked Questions. FAQs are designed to cover the most common questions and answers regarding a product.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2 What is EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark?</b><br>
<br>
The EverQuest Expansion Pack is essentially an add-on to the massively multiplayer game EverQuest.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2.1 What is EverQuest?</b><br>
<br>
EverQuest is a real 3D massively multiplayer online RPG. Another equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is to call it a graphical MUD. EverQuest was released March 16, 1999.<br>
<br>
<b>1.3 What are some of the main features of the Expansion?</b><br>
<ul>
<li>An entire new continent, called Kunark, located south of Faydwer.</li>
<li>20+ Brand New Zones, including newbie zones all the way up to zones filled with dragons.</li> 
<li>A huge array of new, even more visually stunning NPCs.</li> 
<li>A more detailed world, using more polygons and larger textures.</li> 
<li>More animation of objects throughout the new continent.</li>
<li>New Playable Race, the Iksar (Lizardman).</li> 
<li>Lizardmen are neutral/evil and can be Monks.</li> 
<li>New ships will sail from both Antonica and Faydwer to Kunark.</li> 
<li>New cover and box art by famous fantasy artist Keith Parkinson.</li> 
<li>The ability for players to exceed the previous level 50 limit.</li>
</ul> 
<b>1.4 How do I upgrade to the Kunark expansion?</b><br>
<br>
Currently, the Kunark expansion comes in a boxed set that includes the full version of EverQuest and is available through the Station Store.<br>
<br>
<b>1.4.1 Will purchase of the Expansion affect the monthly subscription rate?</b><br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
<b>1.4.2 What if I don't purchase the Expansion?</b><br>
<br>
You will still be able to play EverQuest as usual. You will be able to view characters of the new race and trade/purchase new items from Kunark, but you will not be able to create an Iksar character yourself nor will you be able to travel to Kunark.<br>
<br>
<b>1.5.1 Will the graphical upgrades used in the Expansion affect the rest of the EverQuest world?</b>
<br>
<br>
No. To take advantage of the advanced techniques used in the creation of the Expansion we would have to completely recreate the older EverQuest zones, and we've made the decision to focus our resources on new content instead.<br>
<br>
<b>1.5.2 Will Kunark Allow More Character Slots?</b><br>
<br>
No. Kunark is an expansion to the existing game. It contains landmass, content, and an additional race. The core game of EverQuest really isn't changing as a result of it exept to include quests related to Kunark and the boats to get there. Hence, the 8 character limit per server won't change as a result of the expansion.<br>
<br>
<b>2.0 EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Product FAQ</b><br>
<br>
<b>2.0.1 What is the Kunark Expansion Pack Upgrade?</b><br>
<br>
The Upgrade allows current EverQuest subscribers the ability to access the new features of the Ruins of Kunark. Such new features include the continent of Kunark with 20+ brand new zones as well as a new playable race the Iksar. The Upgrade comes with a Kunark CD, Upgrade Account Key, and a cloth map of the EverQuest world including the new continent. The Upgrade key will allow an existing EverQuest subscriber to access the Ruins of Kunark and enjoy all the new features.<br>
<br>
<b>2.0.2 What is the difference between the Kunark Upgrade and the retail Kunark Box Edition?</b><br>
<br>
The Kunark Box Edition includes both the EverQuest and Kunark software as well as an Account Key allowing for the creation of a new EverQuest account. The Upgrade only includes the Kunark software and an Upgrade Account Key that allows existing players access to the Ruins of Kunark. If you are not currently an EverQuest customer we recommend you purchase the Kunark Box Edition.<br>
<br>
<b>2.1 Will I need to order the Upgrade to keep playing EverQuest?</b><br>
<br>
No. You can still play EQ, but you won't have access to the new continent or the new playable race.<br>
<br>
<b>2.2 Once I get the Kunark package, what do I do?</b><br>
<br>
Install the Kunark software off the CD then register for the Kunark service using the account key on the CD. Remember that if you purchased the Kunark Updgrade, your key can only update and existing EverQuest account. You can update your account from the server selection screen by clicking Register Kunark, or by going to the account, change account menus. If you purchased the full Retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark you may use your key to either create a new EverQuest account with both EQ and Kunark access, or update an existing EQ Account. BUT YOU CANNOT DO BOTH.<br>
<br>
<b>2.2.1 I keep getting "invalid account key" errors when trying to register. What should I do?</b><br>
<br>
Sometimes zeros can be confused with o's and I's can be confused with 1's. With the font used on the key labels, remember that o's appear angular (kind of like diamonds) and zero's look more rectangular. Try the combinations. If you still have trouble, contact customer service for help.
