The inventory window offers a wide range of information among which your character’s level of advancement and statistics.  The orange gauge on the left shows the amount of experience that you need to reach the next level.  You get experience from killing creatures and doing quests.<br>

<p><font class="cyan">Statistics</font></p>
Four stats depend directly on your level :<br>
<ul>
<li>Hit points (HP) : based on your class, <i>STAmina</i> and level.</li>
<li>Mana : you earn a certain number of mana points per level.  It depends on your class, <i>INTelligence</i> and <i>WISdom</i>.</li>
<li>Armor Class (AC), determined by your <i>AGIlity</i> and your Defense skill.</li>
<li>Combat skill (Attack or ATK), which is based on your <i>DEXterity</i>, your offense skill and the weapon(s) you are using.</li>
</ul>
Some items or spells can temporarily improve these stats.<br>
<p><font class="cyan">Skills</font></p>
Each time you level you are allowed 5 training points to allocate freely among the various skills your masters can teach you.  You can spend them immediately or save them to use on skills you only acquire at higher levels.  Some skills such as Meditate or Dodge require only 1 point to get them started and increase automatically  while others depend entirely on practice.  There is a skill cap for each level (you won’t see a level 10 master smith) so there is no point in wasting time and money on a trade skill if you’ve reached your level’s cap.<br>
<br>
After a certain point, your masters will require payment to help you increase in certain skills and may even refuse to teach you any further – this is to encourage you to use them on the field.  So practice as much as you can.<br>

<p><font class="cyan">Loot</font></p>
You may loot the corpses of you vanquished foes and retrieve all their items to keep or sell back to merchants or other players.  To avoid going back and forth between your hunting grounds and the  closest city, you should acquire containers as soon as possible.  You may buy these from merchants or get them from NPCs who may give them to you in order to complete quests.<br>
<br>
When buying from merchants, it’s always a good idea to compare prices to get the best offer.  At lower levels, buying weapons and armour from merchants might not be such a good idea: you can loot them from decaying skeletons and other low level creatures.  You’ll be better off spending your hard earned money on spells and bags or save it up for later.<br>
<p><font class="cyan">Travel</font></p>
It is generally a good idea to solo in your starting area until at least level 5.  Once you reach level 6 you may start exploring the neighbouring areas and joining other players to fight higher level creatures.  As a rule, the further you are form a city, the more dangerous the area.  Although you may enter any zone regardless of your level, getting out alive is another matter entirely.<br>
<br>
Many dungeons are available at level 20.  You’ll start getting magic items and may consider beginning your epic quest – a very long and dangerous quest that will yield an extremely powerful magic weapon.<br>
