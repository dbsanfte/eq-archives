<p>Choosing a race is one of the most important parts of your character’s creation (along with your class, it determines your alignment and therefore the cities which you can visit safely).  Each race has its specific characteristics: some are especially intelligent or agile, others stronger and more enduring.  Ready for a challenge?  Try the evil Dark-elf Necromancer – one of the most powerful combinations in the game but one of the hardest to play.<br>
<br>
<br>
<p><font class="orange"><b>Barbarian</b></font><br>
Classes : Beastlord, Rogue, Shaman, Warrior.</p>
<ul>
  Strong, enduring and agile, they make very good warriors. Their Shamans are 
  very well balanced - wiser, therefore more skilled at magic than trolls or ogres, 
  and stronger than the Iksars. They also have the <b>Slam</b> skill : an extra 
  attack that can stun their adversaries.</li> 
</ul>

<p><font class="orange"><b>Dark Elf</b></font><br>
 Classes : Enchanter, Cleric, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow Knight, Warrior, 
Wizard. </p>
<ul>
Highly intelligent and agile, the Dark elves vie with the Erudites and the Gnomes for the title of best Magician, Necromancer or Wizard. They have the gift of Ultravision, which allows them to see in the dark as though in broad daylight. They also have the ability to Hide so they can quietly regenerate their Life Points and Mana without the risk of being interrupted by wandering monsters.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Dwarf</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Cleric, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior. </p>
<ul>
Dwarves are strong, hardy and skilful. Not as powerful as Ogres, Trolls or Barbarians, but they make up for this with their dexterity and their superior wisdom, endowing them with better combat skills and making them very good Clerics and Paladins. They have the gift of Infravision, which allows them to see fairly well in the dark.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Erudite</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Enchanter, Cleric, Magician, Necromancer, Paladin, Shadow Knight, 
  Wizard.</p>
<ul>
Erudites are VERY intelligent and fairly wise. They are the best Wizards and they make excellent Enchanters, Magicians and Necromancers. What’s more, they learn skills with great ease. Like all Humans they are accepted in most cities in Norrath.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Gnome</strong></font> <br>
  Classes : Enchanter, Cleric, Magician, Necromancer, Rogue, Shadow knight, Warrior, 
  Wizard.</p>
<ul>
Intelligent, agile and skilful, Gnomes vie with the Dark Elves and the Erudites for the titles of best Magician, Necromancer and Wizard. They are gifted with Infravision allowing them to see fairly well in the dark. They have the ‘Tinkering’ skill that enables them to make gadgets that sometimes come in useful - like Infravision goggles, which are much sought after by Humans!
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Half Elf</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Druid, Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior.</p>
<ul>
Agile and skilful, Half-elves make excellent Bards. They are gifted with Infravision allowing them to see fairly well in the dark. Their Human inheritance means they are accepted in most of the cities in Norrath. They have four native towns (Surefall Glade, Qeynos, Freeport and the tree city Kelethin).
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Halfling</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior.</p>
<ul>
Agile and skilful, Halflings make very good Rogues and without a doubt the best Druids. They have the gift of Infravision allowing them to see fairly well in the dark. They have the ‘Hide’ ability which allows them to  quietly regenerate their Life Points and Mana without running the risk of being interrupted by wandering monsters, plus the ‘Sneak’ skill which allows them to walk safely through places bristling with enemies! Their native town, Rivervale, is one of the simplest in Norrath and their first hunting ground, Misty Thicket, is the most profitable in the game. Their neutrality entitles them to safe conduct in most of Norrath’s cities.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>High Elf</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Enchanter, Cleric, Magician, Paladin, Wizard.</p>
<ul>
Intelligent, wise, agile and charismatic High Elves compete with the Erudites for the title of best Enchanter and their mastery of clerical magic is unequalled. Their natural charm allows them to buy and sell at the best prices. They are gifted with Infravision allowing them to see fairly well in the dark. Their native town (Felwithe) is one of the simplest in Norrath.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Human</strong></font><br>
  Classes : toutes, sauf Shaman. </p>
<ul>
Humans have no special weaknesses and are accepted in most of the cities of Norrath.  Being well balanced, they make very good Bards, Monks and Rangers.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Iksar</strong></font> <br>
  Classes : Beastlord, Monk, Necromancer, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior. </p>
<ul>
The Iksars’ natural agility makes them first-rate Monks. They are gifted with Ultravision, allowing them to see as well in the dark as in broad daylight, they regenerate Life Points more quickly than the other races and their scales provide them with natural armour. They also have a base Swimming skill of 100 (master)!
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Ogre</strong></font> <br>
  Classes : Beastlord, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior. </p>
<ul>
Ogres are the STRONGEST and HARDIEST beings on Norrath. Nobody can match them in pure strength (damage and Life Points). They are gifted with Ultravision allowing them to see as well in the dark as in broad daylight. They can ‘Slam’ into things giving them an extra means of attack with which they can sometimes stun their opponent.  Their dire charisma, however, does nothing to improve their reputation of mindless brutes.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Troll</strong></font> <br>
  Classes : Beastlord, Shadow Knight, Shaman, Warrior.</p>
<ul>
Trolls are strong and hardy. Only the Ogres are physically stronger than them (damage and Life Points). They are gifted with Ultravision allowing them to see as well in the dark as in broad daylight. They regenerate Life Points twice as quickly as the other races. They can ‘Slam’ into things giving them an extra means of attack with which they can sometimes stun their opponent.
</ul>
<p><font class="orange"><strong>Wood Elf</strong></font><br>
  Classes : Druid, Bard, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior.</p>
<ul>
Agile and skilful Wood Elves vie with the Halflings for the title of best Druid. They are gifted with Infravision allowing them to see fairly well in the dark. They have the ability to ‘Hide’ enabling them to quietly regenerate their Life Points and Mana without the risk of being interrupted by wandering monsters. They can also ‘Forage’ enabling them to find water and food free of charge in the natural world! They can wear small armour (which is less expensive to buy and weighs less in the overload calculation) or medium-sized armour (which is very easy to find)..
</ul>
<p><strong><font class="orange">Vah Shir</font> </strong><br>
  Classes : Beastlord, Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Beastlord, Bard.</p>
<ul>
The Vah Shir civilization is based upon strong tribal roots. The Vah Shir do not keep written records. Due to this, folklore plays a vital role within their society as does honor. Shamans and Bards form the focus of their civilizations political system as the lore keepers and teachers of the tribe but are not the only classes that make up the Vah Shir community. A Vah Shir's superb agility lends well to the disciplines of the Rogue, and their endurance makes for a formidable Warrior. Since the Vah Shir are a feline species, they have the innate abilities to Sneak and Infravision to see in the darkest of nights. They also have a Safe Fall ability from certain heights
