<b>The Erudites, Necromancy, and the rise and fall of Miragul 
as told by Aradune Mithara, sometimes historian, more often Ranger Lord, Outrider 
of Karana</b><br>
<br>
Over three thousand years in the past humanity was in its infancy. Mankind dwelled 
in the center of Antonica, spreading out slowly to inhabit the vast and fertile 
plains of Karana. Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the size of 
towns, and two even became cities -- Qeynos to the west, and Freeport to the east. 
Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who watched from afar, was strong 
-- it rapidly gained a solid foothold in the world of Norrath and was there to 
stay. <br>
<br>
This is not to imply, however, that humanity was at peace. Early on small groups 
formed, some linked by similar appearances, others by common goals. Competition 
was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason or another many groups 
abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and fought. A few leaders spoke 
out against the violence, urging the masses to remember why they had fled the 
cold north. They had broken away from the lands of Halas and their barbarian brothers 
in the name of peace, and these leaders insisted that humanity adhere once again 
to those principals to which all had agreed. <br>
<br>
Their cry was not totally ignored, and the fighting subsided. Villages were encouraged 
to trade with one another and to respond to competition nonviolently. An economy 
based largely on agriculture appeared and the villages and small towns were surrounded 
by large farms. Most of humanity&#8217;s leaders were pleased with this, wanting 
nothing more than peace and food on every man&#8217;s table after a hard day of 
work. A few, however, wanted more. Even though their people had risen well beyond 
the standard of living endured by their barbarian brothers to the north, they 
were not content. Explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of elves, 
dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient abandoned 
cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and the mystic 
arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard all of this, they became 
both jealous and determined. <br>
<br>
A small, fragile man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed 
them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow 
man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud&#8217;s followers 
fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the 
west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse 
and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their people. They quickly 
built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, 
for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within 
it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed 
reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their 
spies. The first human mages were then born &#8211; wizards, sorcerers, and enchanters 
occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely in both power and knowledge. 
<br>
<br>
One of the more adept practitioners of the arts was named Miragul. Unlike and 
more extreme than the others, he not only abhorred his human brothers on the mainland 
to the east, but he also grew to hate his fellow Erudites. To him they were both 
short sighted and narrow. They created schools of thought, categorizing magic 
into three groups and assigning themselves to three classes: Wizards, Sorcerers, 
and Enchanters. Miragul found this limiting and thoroughly resented the thought 
of being restricted to one school of thought or another. <br>
<br>
He soon found others who felt similarly. They were a small but growing group of 
outcasts who often studied forbidden texts and other knowledge generally kept 
secret from the majority of students. The council was morally and ethically opposed 
to much of the information gathered afar by their spies. Miragul found that these 
outcasts not only studied the three schools of magic, but also a fourth. It was 
called Necromancy and a few lucky spies had returned from a distant underground 
city (Neriak, it was called, home of the dark elves) with both their lives and 
also ancient texts describing this art. Miragul was intrigued, and, by using powerful 
magic, created for himself four identities, four separate countenances and names, 
and joined all four schools without the knowledge of the council, nor anyone else 
for that matter. <br>
<br>
It came to pass some years later that the council, in its ever growing desire 
to know all there was to know, both in distant lands and also in its own city, 
discovered the group of Necromancers. They were branded heretics and great conflict 
arose. For the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They 
engaged in a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed 
and fled from back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference 
&#8211; they did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was 
terrible. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, 
and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in 
the southern regions of Odus. <br>
<br>
Miragul, being a member of all four schools, was not blind to the implications 
when the conflict began. He left the heretics before they fled the city, abandoning 
his fourth identity and siding apparently with the council. But this was only 
a ruse in order to buy time. He soon gathered every artifact and tome he could 
discreetly steal and then left Odus entirely, taking a ship back to Antonica and 
to the city of Qeynos. The lands of men, however, were not only to his dislike, 
but also filled with Erudite spies. Miragul grew afraid, even paranoid, and soon 
fled again. He headed far to the north and then to the east, wishing to avoid 
the barbarians of Halas. After many weeks he found himself near the great lake 
called Winter&#8217;s Deep and he hid there for some time. <br>
<br>
While Miragul waited in secret his mind was not idle. He schemed and planned, 
and looked over every letter of every scroll and tome he had taken from Erudin. 
Time passed and his understanding and power grew. But he was unsatisfied and a 
deep hunger for even more arcane knowledge ate away at him. He soon left his hiding 
place and began to travel long distances in search of more ancient texts and artifacts. 
His power had grown and confidence overcame his fear of Erudite spies. Once again 
he cloaked himself in false identity and countenance and traveled the lands of 
men. <br>
<br>
Not far to the south of where his cache of artifacts lay, Miragul soon found another 
of the new races, the Halflings, and their town Rivervale. The mage feared these 
small people and their propensity to sneak and to steal, and as his treasures 
grew in both size and value, he eventually made the decision to move even farther 
north, and away from all intelligent life. He traveled leagues and leagues, far 
beyond the range of both Erudite spy and curious Halfling, and eventually came 
to a vast tundra. This land had no name, and was not until centuries later referred 
to as merely the Frigid Plain. This frosty and remote environment appealed to 
Miragul&#8217;s heart, for it had grown cold, obsessed with only knowledge and 
the abstract, and filled with only hatred for others. Creatures with intelligence 
forced him to be discreet and slowed his acquisition of knowledge and items. He 
had as little to do with them as he could, only hiding amongst them when absolutely 
necessary. <br>
<br>
Under the icy ground of the Frigid Plains, Miragul created a large network of 
tunnels and rooms in which to hide and study his collection. He used no labor, 
but rather deep magic to remove the earth from his way. Room after room, passage 
after passage, he did create to house his store of artifacts. He split his years, 
spending one score out in the world, exploring and amassing knowledge and items, 
returning them to his cache, and then the next dabbling with them, experimenting 
in one of several laboratories he had created. <br>
<br>
Many years passed, even centuries. Miragul grew old, even though he did his best 
to extend his life using magical means. There was a limit to his enlightenment 
when it came to aging, and he soon acknowledged that one day even he would die. 
Only one aspect of death did he fear, and being no longer able to learn and collect 
wrought him with terror. As his skin grew wrinkled, and his breath short, Miragul&#8217;s 
time was spent less exploring the world of Norrath and more studying the existential. 
He soon discovered the various hidden dimensions that neighbored his own, the 
Planes of Power and Discord. He discovered means by which he could traverse these 
planes, making portals that led between them. But his strength was leaving him, 
and his journeys into these realities were short and often unprofitable. More 
and more, his own mortality limited his reason for living, and the specter of 
death haunted him daily. <br>
<br>
The mage&#8217;s research into life and death was built upon a foundation he had 
learned from his fellow outcasts centuries before in Erudin. Necromancy, more 
than any other art, became Miragul&#8217;s obsession. Eventually he discovered 
a means by which to create portals within his own plane and made them to travel 
great distances in mere seconds. He traveled back to Odus, to its southern regions, 
in search of the other Necromancers. Perhaps, he mused, they had unearthed by 
now a way to cheat death. <br>
<br>
The mage soon found that the heretics of Erudin had built a city into a great 
hole that led to unknown depths beneath the earth. This chasm was apparently the 
result of that huge civil war from which Miragul had fled centuries earlier. The 
city, called Paineel, though somewhat suspicious, allowed Miragul to enter and 
after a time he earned its inhabitant&#8217;s trust. Many humored the old man 
and his claims, while a select few respected him and were willing to trade knowledge 
for knowledge, power for power. They revealed to him the true power of necromancy, 
the ability to raise the dead, creating zombies and wraiths obedient in every 
way to their master. Many of the heretics planned to assault Erudin with vast 
armies of undead, to wreak revenge upon the council that had exiled and made war 
upon them in centuries past. <br>
<br>
One important aspect of their necromancy interested Miragul, the fact that the 
undead ceased to age. Their lives appeared endless and the elderly mage knew that 
he must discover a way to be like them. He feigned interest in the heretic&#8217;s 
goals, learning spells to raise the dead, helping them raise their undead army. 
All the while, however, he was experimenting himself, hiding much of his research 
in the small home he was given in Paineel. After some time he discovered that 
which he had sought, a way to transform a living being, as opposed to a corpse, 
into the undead. Unfortunately, time was scarce, for he was tired and almost dead 
himself, his body deteriorating with age, and the heretics were almost ready to 
make war once again. <br>
<br>
Miragul then left Paineel, using a small portion of his dwindling life energies 
to make a portal back to his cache hundreds of leagues to the north. Upon arrival, 
he withdrew silently to his most secret laboratory and prepared his final spell. 
Dreaming all the while of endless exploration and discovery, he slowly made ready 
his ultimate experiment. The enchantment laced with necromancy was finally made, 
and Miragul hid his remaining and fragile life within the phylactery, a small 
device he had pilfered from the other necromancers. Clouds of mystical energy 
gathered and then dispersed, revealing a shell of the man Miragul once was, an 
undead mage, what ancient scripts and legends called a lich. <br>
<br>
In his haste, however, Miragul had made a miscalculation. The lich, while retaining 
all the mystical power of his formal self, lacked a spirit. Only the mage&#8217;s 
soul, now locked within the phylactery hidden deep in the cache, retained the 
ambition and desire to amass knowledge and power. The spiritless lich possessed 
none of these human traits, and Miragul&#8217;s soul screamed in silence as the 
undead creature began to aimlessly wander his menagerie of wisdom and enlightenment, 
his rooms filled with artifacts of power.<br>		</td>	<td class="fondtexte" width="10"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="10" height="1"></td>	<td class="encadrefondtexte"><img src="img/blind.gif" width="1" height="1"></td></tr></table>		<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width="100%"><tr valign=top>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bg.gif" width="17" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td>	<td background="img/bas_recentnews.gif" width="100%"><center><img src="img/frise_bas.gif" width="121" height="28" border="0" alt=""></center></td>	<td align=right background="img/bas_recentnews.gif"><img src="img/corn_bd.gif" width="18" height="18" border="0" alt=""></td></tr></table><br><center>[&nbsp;<nobr><a class="sousmenu" href="page.php?url=uk/Encyclopedia/Background/history.htm">A History of Norrath</a></nobr>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<nobr><b>The Fall of Miragul</b></nobr>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<nobr><a class="sousmenu" href="page.php?url=uk/Encyclopedia/Background/history_c.htm">A History of Kunark</a></nobr>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<nobr><a class="sousmenu" href="page.php?url=uk/Encyclopedia/Background/history_d.htm">A History of Vellious</a></nobr>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<nobr><a class="sousmenu" href="page.php?url=uk/Encyclopedia/Background/history_e.htm">A History of Luclin</a></nobr>&nbsp;]</center></td><td><img src="img/blind.gif" width="10" height="1"></td></tr></table><br><br><br>	<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
