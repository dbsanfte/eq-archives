Everquest Renaissance is a subscription-based on-line roleplaying game: once your trial period is over, you will be billed on a monthly basis.<br>
<br>
In order to play, you must first set up an EverQuest account. <br>
<br>
To do this, do the following: <br>
<br>
* Connect to the Internet <br>
<br>
* Double click on EverQuest.exe, or double left-click on the EverQuest shortcut on your desktop or taskbar (if you have one). This connects to the EverQuest login server and downloads any additional files that have been changed or added. When you do this for the first time it is normal to download several files. EverQuest is updated on a regular basis, and you will need to download the changes that have been made since your game CD was created <br>
<br>
* Click Play after the patcher program is done downloading any files <br>
<br>
* Click on Account, then click on New Account to register and set up a name and password for your new account. You will need your CD Key here to set up the account <br>
<br>
* Choose a password that NO ONE will know. Account security is the responsibility of the account holder. Please note EverQuest accounts are not to be shared. Each family member should have their own account. The exception to this that parents may purchase an account for a child. Please refer to the End User License Agreement, which you click I Accept to every time you play EverQuest, for a detailed description of policies regarding account sharing. Please be sure to let us know if your email address changes in the future by changing your account information from www.station.sony.com if it happens to change due to switching ISPs, etc. Keeping your email address up to date is important, as it is our primary method of contact with you. <br>
<br>
* Click on Change Account to set up a billing option. You will need a credit card to do this.<br>
<br>
* Click on Connect to start the game.<br>
<br>
* Select a server on the list, then click Play EverQuest.<br>
<br>
* Click on Create New Character. At this point, you will be required to choose a race, class and deity. You will also need to invest your ability points into your attributes. The recommended attributes to add to are colored green.<br>
<br>
* Before your character is done, you need to choose a name. It is strongly suggest you read the EverQuest naming policy before choosing a name. In order to protect our role playing environment, the naming policy is necessary. Please refer to the naming policy at www.EverQuest.com before selecting a name for your character. Also, you can choose to click on Get Name for our random name generator to suggest some names you might like. Be aware that some of these names have been taken by other players, so you may not get a random name approved every time. <br>
<br>
* Once you have chosen a name, you may or may not be able to change your starting city (most races only have one starting city, though some have two). After a deity and starting city has been determined, click Enter World to start the game.<br>
