      <p align="justify">The EverQuest community continues to grow each day, and we receive many requests to transfer characters to different servers. We have implemented a value added service and have enacted a new policy to meet these requests.

            <p align="justify">Due to the many requests to transfer characters from account to account, or server to server, we have implemented a value added service and have enacted a new policy to meet these requests.

This is a value added service which requires a fee that can be billed to your credit card.<br></p>
