Here is some advice for your first fights.  Whether you are a low-level caster, healer or tank, you have to face your enemies with a small range of spells, skills and weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Consider</font> <br>
So you’ve just left the safety of your city’s fortifications to brave the wild world of Norrath. You see a moss snake straight ahead of you, a decaying skeleton ambles past on your left , and a large spider is glaring at you on the right… What do you attack? First rule of survival: <font class="orange">/con</font> all potential foes. Avoid <font color="#FF0000">reds</font> and <font color="#FFFF00">yellows</font>, which will tear you to shreds. Attack <font color="FFFFFF">black/whites</font> only when your health and mana bars are full, and leave the <font class="vert">greens</font> to lower level characters (you won’t get any experience). Focus your efforts on <font color="#0000EE">blues</font> (<font color="#99FFFF">light blues</font> will give you some experience, but it often isn’t worth the trouble). Keep in mind that the experience you earn from a fight depends on the danger your target represents: <font class="vert">greens</font> will give you no exp, <font color="#FF0000">reds</font> will give you a lot.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Target</font> <br>
You’ve got your foe, now check you’ve equipped your weapon and that you’ve memorized your spells (especially after resuscitation) and are fully <i>buffed</i>.  Left-click on your target, its name should appear on the target window.  Sometimes clicking on your target isn’t possible (someone or something gets key to target the closes NPC. in the way, lag makes targeting impossible…).  You can either move to get a better view or hit the <font class="orange">F8</font> key (check you get the right one – you don’t want to attack a guard by mistake).  If you’ve selected the wrong target hit the <font class"orange">Esc</font> key to deselect it.  You are now ready to fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Pulling</font><br>
The <i>pulling</i> technique allows you to bring your adversary to a more defensible position.  The aim is to take it away from the path of other aggressive creatures - thereby avoiding being swarmed by a group of monsters or having it slain by other players - while remaining close to a safe area (a zone line or a guard).  When you zone, your enemy “forgets” you attacked it and stops chasing you.<br>
Once you are familiar with your surroundings, go out and hunt.  If you find a potential victim, use a range attack, cast a spell, or hit it.  Once you’ve got its attention, run to your “safe” area and engage combat.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Hack, slash, crush, nuke…</font><br>
Try to keep your back to a wall to avoid being stabbed in the back.  While your evasive skills (dodge, parry…) are automatic, you have to activate your special attacks (bash, kick…) and spells.  Hopefully, you’ve already assigned these to your hot buttons, making them available at the stroke of a key.  Try to synchronize your spell casting with your enemy’s attacks – if it hits while you’re casting, your spell will be interrupted.<br>
Use your first fights to become acquainted with the different camera views and their uses (you can change angles by hitting the <font class="orange">F9</font> key then pan and zoom with your mouse).  The aerial view  can be useful to make sure there are no unpleasant surprises.  Some creatures, spiderlings, for example, are “social” : when one of them is attacked, the others will rush into the fray to help it.  When this happens, the best solution is to run for your life.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Taking evasive action</font><br>
Although some casters may <i>gate</i> to safety, most classes have to take more down-to-earth measures of evasion when faced with unfavourable odds: turn around and run to the closest guards or the zone.  You can jump (<font class="orange">space bar</font>) for a little extra speed - this will quickly lower your stamina and bring you to a crawl and most certain death if you’re not careful.  You will also be slowed down if you are encumbered, fatigued, or severely wounded (if you are down to your last two bubbles of life).  If you are poisoned and manage to distance your opponent(s), try to find clerical help ASAP.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">HEEEEELLLLP !!!</font><br>
When all else fails, you can call for help.  Name one of your social buttons “Mayday” or “SOS” and assign to it the <font class="orange">/yell</font> command.  If you feel you are in over your head and won’t be able to make it to a safe area, press this button.  This will send a message requesting the assistance of all players close enough to hear you and will give them an idea of where you are.  Many a player has died from /shouting for help: although all can hear you scream, no one knows where you are…<br>
If you wish to help someone who is in trouble, target him and type <font class="orange">/assist</font> : you will automatically attack his opponent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Coma</font> <br>
When your wounds exceed your life points, you fall unconscious.  You still have a few “negative” life points so healing or your natural regeneration can still save you.  However, if you are still attacked or suffer from poisoning, you will most certainly end up dead.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font class="cyan">Victory !</font> <br>
You have managed to avoid certain death and have slain your opponent!  You will get a message indicating you have earned experience (unless you’ve been attacking those <font class="vert">greens</font> again…).  You may now loot the remains of your foe. Right click on its corpse and any coin it may have been carrying will be transferred to your pockets.  An inventory window will open next to yours.  You may transfer an item automatically to your inventory by right-clicking on it or using the old drag-and-drop technique to place it in a specific slot.  If your inventory is full, the item will fall to the ground.  You may also choose to destroy it by pressing the destroy button in your inventory.  This is especially useful when grouping in enclosed areas: unless relieved of their possessions, corpses will not disappear for a while and will clutter the area causing lag and hindering targeting – most annoying when a new foe pops up unexpectedly and you can’t target it or your friends to /assist.  So if you won’t tidy your room, at least keep your hunting grounds clean!
