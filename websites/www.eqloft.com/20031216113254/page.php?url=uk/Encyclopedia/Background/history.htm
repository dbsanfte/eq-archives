It is said that outside of space and time an entity known only as the Nameless exists, and that this being created all that there is and was and will be. It 
is also written in ancient texts that from His mind sprang not only the universe 
and its countless suns and worlds, but also a myriad of sentient, powerful, yet 
finite creatures whom one such as a man, or elf, or dwarf, would call a god. <br>
<br>
In aeons past came one of these gods upon the world Norrath. Veeshan, Crystalline 
Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky, found this world pleasing and deposited 
her brood onto the frozen continent of Velious. With one swipe of her mighty claws, 
Veeshan opened several great wounds upon the surface of Norrath, staking her claim 
to this promising new world. Dragons then walked the land and flew the skies, 
powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength. Thus began the Age of 
Scale. <br>
<br>
In time the other gods noticed Veeshan's work, and being often petty and jealous 
beings, they too came upon Norrath, intent upon leaving their mark. Brell Serilis 
was first, and from his Plane of Underfoot, a dark realm of vast caves and endless 
tunnels, he quietly created a magical portal to a cavern deep in the belly of 
Norrath. Through this portal the Duke of Underfoot seeded the depths of Norrath 
with all manner of creatures. Brell then returned home, sealing his portal within 
a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living Stone. <br>
<br>
And when the other gods came to Norrath, Brell Serilis approached each of them, 
and after some time convinced them to meet as one to discuss the fate of the world. 
The Great Mother Tunare, and Prexus, The Oceanlord were in attendance, and Rallos 
Zek, the warlord, was also there, yet in mistrust kept his distance. Brell, carefully 
avoiding all queries as to the origins of his information, told of Veeshan's discovery 
of the new and potentially powerful world in which she had deposited her brood. 
Words befit of the King of Thieves poured forth from Brell's lips and he proposed 
that they accept an alliance of sorts, to which all save Rallos Zek agreed, ignorant 
of the fact that Brell had already released some of his creations into the Underfoot 
of this new world. The planet that would be called Norrath was divvied up between 
these beings of power for the purpose of keeping the Wurmqueen in check. Each 
would create a race of beings to watch over Norrath and keep a vigilant eye on 
the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell claimed the bowels of the planet and created 
the Dwarves, stout and strong, deep beneath the mountains of Norrath. In the abysmal 
depths of the oceans Prexus left his children, the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings 
of great mental power and stamina. And on the surface of Norrath did Tunare create 
the Elves, creatures of limitless grace and beauty, and Rallos Zek the Giants, 
fierce and formidable beings, intent upon the defense of their lands. Thus began 
the Elder Age. <br>
<br>
It was inevitable that such energies involved in seeding planets with life would 
attract even more of the gods, and it was the Elves who drew the unwanted attention 
of Innoruuk, Prince of Hate. In a decrepit tower overlooking the dark decaying 
alleys of the Plane over which he ruled, Innoruuk waited, stoking the fire of 
his Hate until it was a raging inferno. He cursed his fellow gods for not including 
him in their pact and vowed to make them regret such disrespect. From the halls 
of the Elves' fair city, Takish-Hiz, the Prince of Hate snatched away the first 
Elven King and Queen. In his realm of pain and anger he slowly tore them apart, 
physically and mentally, over the course of three hundred years. He then gathered 
the quivering remnants of these beings of light and rebuilt them into his own 
dark sadistic image, a twisted mockery of Tunare's noble children. In depositing 
the Teir'Dal, as Innoruuk's Dark Elven creations would come to be called, back 
into the Underfoot of Norrath, the seeds for The Prince of Hate's final revenge 
were sown. <br>
<br>
Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath, and Brell met them, 
concocting a second pact with these latter gods, wishing another excuse to create 
more peoples into the world. Rallos Zek again watched from afar, determined to 
add to his creation as well, and this time Brell convinced the Warlord to join 
the pact, assuring him that it was indeed an appropriate time to fulfill his desires. 
Deep in the earth did Brell return to create the gnomes, resembling dwarves to 
some extent, yet more wiry and gnarled, consumed with tinkering with devices more 
so than their cousins. On the surface, away from Elves and Giants, Bristlebane 
made the Halflings, short and stubby folk, agile and with a propensity to meddle 
and even pilfer at times. Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and 
jungles of Norrath and there created the green skinned Trolls and reptilian Lizard 
Men. And Rallos Zek returned to the surface, pleased with his sanction to create 
even more peoples for his army. He made then the Ogres, massive, unmovable beings 
of questionable intelligence, and the Orcs, bred for battle and singled-minded 
in their desire for conquest. <br>
By this time, those who are now known as the elder races of Norrath had begun 
to expand and mature. Villages became cities, and cities became kingdoms. Several 
of the races became bent on expansion and warfare became part of their developing 
cultures. And of all the races, it was the Ogres who quickly proved the most interested 
in battle and plunder, and their empire grew outward from their mountain home 
until it eventually encompassed a large portion of Tunaria, largest of the known 
continents. Their knowledge of magic grew as did their greed, until they became 
weary of only Norrath, and when they learned of other planes and dimensions, invaded 
the Plane of Earth itself. Rallos Zek watched with pride as his creations challenged 
the gods of that realm, and when they eventually knew defeat, the Warlord himself 
led a second invasion. The war that ensued shook the heavens and angered the greater 
gods. Through their combined might, Rallos Zek was finally thwarted and forced 
back to his domain, after which a great barrier to the Planes of Power was erected, 
denying entry to both the lesser gods and mortals as well. And then, in what some 
view as spite and others justice, the gods cursed the Warlord's creations. Thousands 
of Ogres were slain and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were spread 
from one end of the earth to the other, forced to flee their homes as the gods 
brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. And the goblins were also 
cursed, but no writings remain of their punishment as they no longer keep records 
of their history (which is perhaps some indication as to the severity of their 
curse). Thus began the Age of Monuments. <br>
<br>
As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. Mithaniel Marr, god 
of Valor, and Erollisi Marr, goddess of Love, created the Barbarians, a hardy 
race who settled the cold and rugged northlands, near the ruins of the Giant empire. 
Being the youngest race, they were generally unwashed and rugged, possessing very 
few social graces. And while they too had a warlike culture, there were those 
amongst them who began to believe in something more. By this time the other civilizations 
of Norrath had either long since declined, or were well on their way, and this 
small minority of Barbarians saw an opportunity to triumph where the others had 
failed. Perhaps this was a seed of wisdom planted by the Marr Twins, or perhaps 
it was only by chance, but as the Barbarians spread out across the lands, warring 
with both each other and any other race encountered, this tiny movement continued 
to grow. And so even amidst desolation and war, there was hope. Thus began the 
Age of Blood. <br>
<br>
The last of the old races to decline was the empire of the Elves. The Elddar Forest 
spread across the entire southeastern quarter of Tunaria. Cities and villages 
built high into the trees housed thousands of Wood Elves, and the marble cities 
of the High Elves were built in the forest's clearings and meadows, their white 
towers and spires climbing out of the forest, higher than the tallest tree. But 
then came the last curse of the gods, as Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame, arched the 
spine of the serpent mountains, bringing heat from the burning sun to the ancient 
forest. The rivers ran dry, it rained less each year, and while the great elven 
druids fought long and hard, using their powerful magics to combat the change, 
they could only delay the inevitable. Slowly the forest gave way to desert, and 
eventually even great Takish-Hiz crumbled and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, 
leaving much of their greatness behind. Thus began the Lost Age. <br>
<br>
This next period of Norrathean history as it relates to many of the races is the 
least known. It is surmised by the more knowledgeable historians that while the 
elder races regrouped and reestablished themselves, a small group of Barbarians 
were suddenly transformed both physically and intellectually. Most believe this 
to be the last major and direct act of divine intervention, and perhaps the reason 
so little is known about this period is that the gods wish it to be so, deciding 
afterwards that they would have less to do with their creations. In any case, 
this small and enlightened group were the fathers of the Human race, and they 
rapidly gained a foothold throughout the lands, studying the lost art of geomancy. 
The Combine Empire, as this lost race of Humans is called, spread throughout the 
known world, but then died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still 
unknown. And while they are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath and their 
relics and ruins still litter the lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of 
this period remains. <br>
<br>
After the fall of the Combine Empire, the remnants of mankind dwelled mostly in 
the center of Tunaria, inhabiting primarily the vast and fertile plains of Karana. 
Villages appeared and prospered, several reaching the size of towns, and two even 
became cities. To the west a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius 
Bayle the First, founded Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. Freeport, to 
the east, became an active and dangerous port of call for all who dared to venture 
into the Ocean of Tears. Humanity, much to the disdain of the elder races who 
watched from afar, remained strong, even daring to rename their home after one 
of their own instead of one of the gods. The great continent of Tunaria would 
forever more be known as Antonica. This is not to imply, however, that humanity 
was at peace. Competition was fierce, and when resources grew scarce for one reason 
or another many groups abandoned the promises and alliances of their past and 
fought. A few leaders spoke out against the violence, urging the masses to remember 
why they had fled the cold north. Others reminded them of their former glory and 
the might of the Combine Empire. These leaders insisted that humanity adhere once 
again to those principals to which all had agreed. Explorers and adventurers returned 
from afar with tales of elves, dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as 
descriptions of ancient abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge 
of sorcery and the mystic arts. And when that discontent minority of leaders heard 
all of this, they became both jealous and determined. <br>
<br>
A small, frail man of great intellect called Erud led this group, and he formed 
them into a council. They quickly became irritated, even disgusted, by their fellow 
man. Leaving a small network of spies behind, the remainder of Erud's followers 
fled the city of Qeynos and boarded a small fleet of ships. They sailed to the 
west and landed upon the barren coast of the island of Odus. The land was sparse 
and uninhabited and quite appealing to the council and their people. They quickly 
built a city of their own, dissimilar in almost every way to both Qeynos and Freeport, 
for it was almost entirely a towering castle. Erudin it was called, and within 
it the scribes and scholars, who called themselves High Men, gathered and analyzed 
reports, captured books and scrolls, and other artifacts brought to them by their 
spies. The first human mages since the Combine Empire were born &#8211; wizards, 
sorcerers, and enchanters occupied the great halls of Erudin and grew immensely 
in both power and knowledge. Thus began the Age of Enlightenment. <br>
<br>
It came to pass some years later that a small group of Erudites discovered the 
lost art of Necromancy. They were branded heretics and great conflict arose. For 
the first time in several hundred years, the Erudites fought. They engaged in 
a civil war not entirely dissimilar to that which they had loathed and fled from 
back on the mainland. But there was one very significant difference &#8211; they 
did not use swords and bows, but rather magic, and the result was terrible. Lives 
by the hundreds were lost, great buildings and structures destroyed, and eventually 
the heretics were forced to flee Erudin, to hide and regroup in the southern regions 
of Odus. In one final battle, great mystic energies were released and an immense 
hole leading to unknown depths beneath the earth was created. Into the sides of 
this chasm the heretics built their own city which they called Paineel. And while 
both sides still seethed with anger and hatred towards one another, their fear 
of what the last battle had wrought has kept any further conflict at bay. Thus 
began the Age of Turmoil. <br>
<br>
It is in this age you find yourself, an age filled with wonder. The elder races 
have begun to reclaim their former glory. The younger races have matured, and 
an active economy stretches across Odus, Antonica, and Faydwer. And while conflict 
and battle is hardly rare, it has also been centuries since open war has plagued 
the lands. A myriad of alliances and factions exist, friend and foe plot and scheme, 
and the world of Norrath is ripe for action. Equip yourself for adventure, seek 
allies and knowledge, and head out into a rich world of dungeons, towers, crypts, 
even planes and realities beyond your imagination. Learn skills, earn experience, 
acquire treasure and equipment, meet friends and encounter enemies. And whether 
you assume the role of a noble human knight, a vicious dark elf thief, a greedy 
dwarven merchant, or whatever suits your desire, remember one thing: <br>
