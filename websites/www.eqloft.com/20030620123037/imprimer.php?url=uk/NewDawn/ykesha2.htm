<p><font size="3"><strong>The Prophecy of Grozmok</strong></font><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  In the Elder Age the trolls followed one god: Cazic Thule, their creator. They 
  grew and evolved under his guidance, and the blood of Fear beat strong through 
  their hearts. The unity of the trolls was broken when Innoruuk, the Prince of 
  Hate, touched a young troll mystic named Zraxth.</p>
<p>Zraxth's deviation from the followers of Cazic Thule was small at first. He 
  would gather small groups of other mystics in secluded camps far away from the 
  troll cities. There they would perform ceremonies to channel their hatred, and 
  through it give power to the trolls who were being oppressed by the dominant 
  forces of the Rallosian armies. Hatred drove the trolls, making them more bloodthirsty 
  and savage, but their might was still not enough to confront the will of the 
  Ogre Empire that dominated Southern Tunaria. Zraxth saw that his efforts were 
  futile, and asked his new lord, Innoruuk, when the trolls would see the power 
  they were promised. The knowledge he sought came with a price; Innoruuk demanded 
  a blood tithe in exchange for a vision. Zraxth was instructed to slay the high 
  priests of Cazic Thule so their blood could be used to grant him foresight.</p>
<p>Zraxth and his followers did as the Prince of Hate demanded. Cloaked by the 
  night, he and his disciples crept into the camps of their brethren and killed 
  every elder priest to yield the blood to be used in the rite. The blood of their 
  kin on their hands, Zraxth and his disciples set about performing the rituals 
  described in Innoruuk's instructions. A great stone tablet was brought before 
  Zraxth, and the ceremony began. Zraxth meditated for days without sleep or food, 
  trying to transcend his mortal mind and see what Innoruuk had promised him.</p>
<p>On the eighth day, Zraxth spoke. The disciples tried in vain to record his 
  words but found that no ink would hold them; the words ran like quicksilver 
  off their parchments.. Zraxth, still in a deep trance, took the stone and began 
  to record his words with the elder's blood and a chisel made from their bones. 
  As he laid each symbol into the stone, it blazed with dark flames and then settled. 
  As the stone cooled, the disciples saw that the words appeared as though they 
  had always been a part of the stone, rather than carved and painted into it.</p>
<p>Zraxth's visions foretold the coming of the Grozmok. The Grozmok would be the 
  greatest of all trolls and would unite the troll clans through Fear and Hate. 
  Through his knowledge of war and magic he would topple the empires in Tunaria. 
  The stone would be the symbol of his power. No true Grozmok would rise without 
  the stone, but many false Grozmoks would die because of it. This was the prophecy, 
  the curse and the legacy of Grozmok.</p>
<p>The ceremony killed Zraxth. His body was burned, and his ashes were scattered. 
  His disciples returned to their tribes, each assuming their old positions among 
  the mystics, teaching their people of the prophecy of Grozmok. Zraxth's first 
  disciple was given the stone, as his tribe was the strongest and most likely 
  to give rise to the Grozmok. They protected the stone and its secrets for many 
  generations, until whispers of the prophecy spread to the Rallosian Empire.</p>
<p>The ogres did not fear the trolls; however, they did fear the power that the 
  stone might grant them. To stifle any hope that the stone may have provided, 
  they raided the home of the tribe that held the stone. After slaughtering all 
  who lived there, they returned the stone to their vaults, attempting to end 
  the prophecy and any power that may have been drawn from it.</p>
<p>The stone remained in the fortified strongholds of the Ogre Empire until the 
  curse of the Pantheon struck the minions of Zek down for their hubris. The fall 
  of the empire created a void of power in Southern Tunaria. The two largest troll 
  factions, Clan Broken Skull and Clan Ykesha, began to battle for rule over the 
  once conquered lands. As their war raged, knowledge of the stone faded from 
  the trolls' minds. It lay forgotten, until marauders from Clan Ykesha found 
  the stone hidden in the vaults of a decimated ogre fortress. The lore and memory 
  of the stone's true meaning had been long lost to the trolls; still they recognized 
  the stone as an artifact from their ancient history, and presented it as a tribute 
  to their clan leader, Warlord Ykesha.</p>
<p>The ancients of Clan Ykesha eventually managed to translate the writing on 
  the stone; this revealed the lost prophecy of the Grozmok to them. Warlord Ykesha 
  took his capturing of the stone to mean that he was destined to be the Grozmok. 
  Rumors of the stone spread throughout the Clans. Meanwhile, the power of Clan 
  Ykesha grew as other tribes joined them to fight for the Grozmok.</p>
<p>Innoruuk, seeing the hate among his children fade as more and more joined Ykesha, 
  planted seeds of doubt in the Warlord's mind. Ykesha grew reclusive, moving 
  deep within his compound to protect himself from attempts to usurp his power. 
  This growing insanity weakened him. As dissention grew within Clan Ykesha, other 
  clans grew bold and struck the might of the Ykesha. It was Clan Broken Skull 
  that managed to finally overthrow Ykesha and lay claim to the stone.</p>
<p>The remnants of the Ykeshan clan regrouped slowly, rising under the might of 
  Warlord Jurgash, and formed Clan Grobb. The new clan grew under the direction 
  of Ykesha's descendent, while the stone remained hidden on Broken Skull Rock. 
  Innoruuk, again seeing the hate among the trolls settling, granted one of Grobb's 
  mystics a vision that revealed the location of the Grozmok stone. Clan Grobb 
  invaded Broken Skull Rock and recovered the stone. The victorious clan returned 
  the stone to Southern Tunaria.</p>
<p>Today, the Grozmok stone rests hidden and well protected deep within Grobb. 
  Knowledge of the stone and the prophecy it contains has once again begun to 
  fade as new generations pursue their own dreams of power. The young consider 
  the old stories of the stone and the first great warlord, who rests in his fortress 
  now swallowed by the swamp, to be campfire myths. Yet, many of the clan elders 
  wait with the hopes that one day the Grozmok will rise from their ranks and 
  fulfill the legacy of Ykesha.<br>
