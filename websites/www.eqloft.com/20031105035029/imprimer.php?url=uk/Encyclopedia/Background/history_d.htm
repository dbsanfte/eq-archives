Before recorded time, Veeshan, the great Crystalline Dragon marked Norrath by 
striking the continent of Velious with her foreclaw, and deposited her brood there 
to dwell. The legends of that time also tell that Veeshan blasted Velious with 
her breath, encasing it in eternal ice and creating a barrier of deadly ice flows 
and stormy weather. This marked the beginning of the Age of Scale. <br>
<br>
The Age of Scale lasted untold millennia. From the tidbits of information passed 
down, it is known that a group of dragons mastered magic and spellcasting during 
this era. Additionally, dragons of power and influence among their kind gathered 
together and formed a hereditary ruling council known as the Claws of Veeshan, 
who rule the dragons of Velious to this day. Few of Norrath&#8217;s inhabitants 
know more of this Age, and none that do would dare to speak. <br>
<br>
The end of the Age of Scale was marked by the Gods creation of the other races 
of Norrath. Many of Veeshan&#8217;s vainglorious brood perceived that they might 
rule over these lesser beings and left Velious. This splinter group became known 
as the Ring of Scale. Those dragons that remained upon Velious had little interest 
in temporal power, and were content to pass the millennia in homage to their goddess, 
and in quiet contemplation and the study of magics. <br>
<br>
In the Elder Age, the Ogres, Giants and Goblins conquered much of Norrath and 
began an assault on the Plane of Earth, precipitating retribution from The Rathe 
in the form of a great curse against all of Rallos Zek&#8217;s creations. The 
fertile homelands of the Giants (now known as Everfrost) were frozen, and those 
giants caught in the epicenter of the curse were transformed wholly into immortal 
creatures of living ice. Those nearby were struck to the core of their beings, 
becoming lesser creatures in mind and body than they had been. Those few who escaped 
the effects fled Tunaria for other lands, coming to the attention of Prexus the 
Oceanlord, who sent a great storm to destroy them. The storm drove many ships 
back to Tunaria and to Kunark, where the curse of The Rathe took hold to a lesser 
degree than in Everfrost. Many of the most powerful giants managed to escape the 
storm thanks to their great powers, and passed through the Frigid Barrier to land 
upon the Icy Fingers in Velious. The Kromrif established themselves in the Eastern 
Wastes and lived as nomads, eventually coming into conflict with the Coldain. 
The Kromzek were the most powerful of all Rallos Zek&#8217;s creations. Not content 
with a nomadic lifestyle, they established a mighty fortress city named Kael Drakkal 
in the Great Scar of Veeshan. The Claws of Veeshan took exception to the intrusion 
of the Kromzek upon their sacred lands, and thus began the long conflict between 
the two mightiest races on Norrath, in this most inhospitable of all places. Ages 
passed, leaving the eastern regions of Velious largely in the control of the Giants. 
It was during this time that the ships of the Coldain, or Ice Dwarves, were wrecked 
upon the ice of the Frigid Barrier. Those few who survived to reach the shore 
escaped the notice of the Claws of Veeshan, but were devastated in a conflict 
with the fearsome Kromrif. Fleeing the giants, the Coldain established Thurgadin, 
a hidden underground fortress in the mountains. Since these times, none of the 
other races of Norrath have dared to approach the Frigid Barrier, and thus Velious 
remained undiscovered. <br>
<br>
In the present day, the Gnomes of Ak&#8217;anon have revealed an ocean vessel 
with the capability of navigating the roughest seas and breaking through ice flows. 
Upon it&#8217;s maiden voyage, the Gnomish Icebreaker successfully penetrated 
the Frigid Barrier and discovered the islands known as the Icy Fingers. Upon the 
largest of the islands, the crew discovered an ancient and massive bridge, which 
arced away into the mists and revealed the tip of a massive glacial continent 
- Velious! For a price, these Gnomes and their allies will offer the brave adventurers 
of Norrath passage to these frozen, uncharted lands. <br>
<br>
You may be one of the first to explore this deadly and forbidding icy land. You 
feet may be the first tread its deadly caverns and ancient shrines. If you are 
among the stout of heart, you may dare to enter The Scars of Velious. You are 
in our world now!
