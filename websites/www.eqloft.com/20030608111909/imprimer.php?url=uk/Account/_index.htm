<b>1.1 Play Nice Policies - Activity within EverQuest</b><br>
<br>
In addition to the general guidelines listed in section 1.0, players are also subject to these supplementary rules while playing EverQuest. While by no means an all-inclusive list of the do's and don'ts in EverQuest, it provides a suitable foundation by which the player can determine what activities are appropriate:<br>
<br>
<i>1. You may not steal kills.</i><br>
<br>
Kill Stealing is defined as the killing of an NPC for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing another player or group that is prepared to engage that same NPC without that group's specific permission. The intent of this rule is discourage and make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy.<br>
<br>
<i>2. You may not ninjaloot.</i><br>
<br>
Ninjalooting is defined as taking special equipment from a fallen creature without the express permission of those who killed the creature if they are in attendance.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this rule is to stop those who stand near creatures that carry special items and attempt loot that equipment prior to it being looted by the rightful owner.<br>
<br>
3. You must comply with arbitration for contested spawns.<br>
<br>
There are cases where two or more groups wish to kill the same NPC or hunt in the same area. In these cases, the groups are required to compromise.<br>
<br>
If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will mandate a compromise. Any such compromise is final and not open to debate. Refusing to abide by these terms will be considered disruption and may result in disciplinary action.<br>
<br>
It is therefore strongly suggested that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.<br>
<br>
Note: A "group" in this case is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.<br>
<br>
<i>4. Foul language is not permitted, in any language.</i><br>
<br>
Excessive use of foul language in an inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane.<br>
<br>
<i>5. You may not harass others.</i><br>
<br>
Harassment is defined as specifically targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them. As harassment can take many forms, the EQCSR involved will make a determination as to whether or not a "reasonable person" would feel harassed and act accordingly.<br>
<br>
<i>6. You may not disrupt the normal playability of a zone or area.</i><br>
<br>
Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a specific player or group of players. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Monopolizing most or all of the kills in an area.</li>
<li>Deliberately blocking a doorway or narrow area so other players cannot get past.</li>
<li>Refusing to cooperate with the other parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do so by an EQCSR.</li>
<li>Making excessive and inappropriate use of public channels of communications (/shout, /ooc, etc.).</li>
<li>Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).</li>
<li>Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally training NPCs on other players, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<i>7. You may not defraud other players.</i><br>
<br>
Fraud is defined as falsely representing one's intentions to make a gain at another's expense. Examples of this activity include, but are not limited to, using deception to deprive another player of items, slandering another player or impersonating them with the intention of causing harm to that player's reputation, or falsely representing one's identity in order to gain access to another player's account or account information.<br>
<br>
Fraud in all transactions between players may result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an EQCSR.<br>
<br>
<i>8. You may not abuse other players or Customer Service Representatives.</i><br>
<br>
The following actions would be considered abuse:
<ul>
<li>Hate Mongering - participation in or propagation of Hate literature, behavior, or propaganda related to real -world characteristics.</li>
<li>Sexual Abuse or Harassment - untoward and/or unwelcome advances of a graphic and sexual nature. This includes, but is not limited to, virtual rape, overt sexual overtures, and stalking of a sexual nature.</li>
<li>Attempting to Defraud a CS Representative - Petitioning with false information with the intent of receiving benefits as a result. This includes reporting bug deaths, experience or item loss, or accusing other players of wrongdoing without basis for it.</li>
<li>Impersonating a Customer Service Representative - falsely representing yourself to another player as a Guide or a Verant Interactive employee.</li>
<li>CS Personnel Abuse - This includes, but is not limited to, sending excessive /petitions (as an individual or group), sending excessive /tells to a CS Representative, excessively using say or other channels to communicate to a CS Representative, making physical communications (/shout, /ooc, etc.).</li>
<li>Intentionally causing excessive zone latency (creating excessive corpses, abusing spell effects, etc.).</li>
<li>Causing intentional experience loss to other players (deliberately impeding fleeing players by blocking their escape route, intentionally training NPCs on other players, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<i>9. "Role-playing" does not grant license to violate these rules.</i><br>
<br>
Though EverQuest is a Role-playing game, the claim of "Role-play" will not be accepted in defense of any of the anti-social behaviors mentioned above. We strongly encourage role-playing, but cannot allow it to be done at the expense of others.<br>
<br>
<i>10. You may not operate a guild that habitually violates these rules.</i><br>
<br>
Disciplinary issues involving guilds may be addressed with the entire guild. Guilds whose members habitually violate these rules may be issued guild warnings, and can even be permanently disbanded.<br>
<br>
Guild Leaders and/or officers may be held accountable for any actions of their guild members, in addition to any other actions that may be taken. It is therefore the responsibility of the guild leadership to ensure that all guild members abide by these rules.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2 Message Board Conduct</b><br>
<br>
As the Official EverQuest Forums are part of The Station, posting to these forums is bound by The Station's Terms of Service that can be found in their entirety at . In addition to these terms of service, we have a few supplemental rules that apply to the EverQuest Forums.<br>
<br>
In general, you may post any material, written in a courteous and mature manner, providing that it is on-topic for the forum to which you are posting. This includes material that disagrees with the way that we, the developers, operate the game. We will not interfere with the communication of thoughts and ideas as long as the presentation is appropriate for all those capable of reading the forum.<br>
<br>
You may not, however, post any material that:
<ul>
<li>Attacks or insults others on the board. Feel free to debate the idea, but do not turn your disagreement into an attack upon the poster.</li>
<li>Engages in name-calling, harassment, or threats. See above.</li>
<li>Contains obscenity, vulgarity, or profanity. Though we do have a filter in place to catch the unintentional obscenity from time to time, this is not a license to abuse it.</li>
<li>Disparages any religion, race, nation, gender, or sexual orientation.</li>
<li>Is considered inappropriate for children 13 or over as governed by general standards of decency in the United States.</li>
<li>Infringes on anyone's privacy rights.</li>
</ul>
Furthermore, you may not:
<ul>
<li></li>Make multiple posts on the same subject for the purpose of getting attention paid to your issue.
<li></li>Post off-topic comments in threads for the purpose of drawing attention to another thread on a different subject.
<li></li>Monopolize the front page of any forum by "bumping" threads of the same or similar content to the front. We may intervene by closing threads any time that this occurs.
<li></li>Use the official forums as a staging-ground for creating general unrest within the game (e.g. Sit-ins).
<li></li>Use the official forums as a place to advertise the sale of EverQuest characters or items in exchange for real-world money.
<li></li>Advertise web-sites with content that violates these rules, the EverQuest EULA, or the Station Terms of Service.
<li></li>Advertise products or websites that are not related to EverQuest or other Verant/Sony Online Entertainment products.
</ul>
Action that we might take in regards to a post in violation of these rules on the Official EverQuest Forums will vary depending upon the transgression. It could include any number of the following:
<ul>
<li>Editing of the post.</li>
<li>Deletion of the post/thread.</li>
<li>Closing of the thread.</li>
<li>Suspension (results in user being unable to play EverQuest for the duration of the suspension).</li>
<li>Banishment (results in the user's station account being canceled. User will no longer be able to access EverQuest, or any Official EverQuest Forum).</li>
<li>Legal Action (I.e. Contacting law enforcement personnel in regard to a threat.)
People who violate the rules of the boards may or may not receive any warning before any action is taken. In the event that a warning is given, the warning will be recorded upon the game account and may result in further action should the player show a pattern of engaging in prohibited conduct. Philosophically and administratively, there is no difference between conduct in game, and conduct in the Official EverQuest Forums.</li>
</ul>
<b>B – Naming Policy</b><br>
<br> 
The naming policy can be found <a href="http://www.eqloft.com/page.php?url=uk/Support/General_FAQ/naming.htm"  target="_blank">here</a><br>
<br> 
Names are a very important part of your EverQuest identity. Your name is associated with your character even more than your race, class, or equipment. When choosing a name, keep in mind that it will identify you for many levels to come! Although SOE Customer Service staff does not like to interfere in your role-playing experience, there are some simple guidelines you should follow when creating a character name. If your name violates the rules outlined below, it may be changed when it is brought to the attention of a Guide or the GM of your server.<br>
<br>
<i>What kinds of things should I keep in mind when creating a character name?</i><br>
<br>
You should keep in mind that the following types of names are unacceptable:<br>
<br>
<b>a.</b> Offensive names: This includes rude, profane (swear), or vile words. It also includes racial slurs, sexually offensive terms, and references to the anatomy. A name that sounds like an offensive word (homonym) when sounded out will also be considered unacceptable. Commonly known abbreviations for offensive words will not be allowed, nor will intentional misspellings of offensive words. Combinations of names that result in an offensive phrase or word are also off-limits. Repeated attempts to create a character with a name in this category can result in a warning or banning, so please be mature and don't attempt to get these through the filter. If you do make a character with a name that violates this policy the character will be deleted, and your account may be subject to suspension or banning depending on the nature of the name.<br>
<br>
<b>b.</b> Religious names: Don't try to name yourself Jesus or Allah or Beelzebub. This type of name can also offend many other players.<br>
<br>
<b>c.</b> Words that are offensive, religious, or known as part of popular media in another language besides English.<br>
<br>
<b>d.</b>Trademarked services, concepts or products: Trademarked names are not part of Norrath. Names such as Kleenex, Tylenol, Marlboro, etc. will not be allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>e.</b> Non-fantasy names from television, movies, comic books, books, and other popular media: Rambo, Cinderella, Darthvader, etc. are all unacceptable.<br>
<br>
<b>f.</b> Common words that would not be found in a Norrathian setting: Switchblade, Microwave, Phaser, Sloegin, Website, Cannabis, Computer, etc. are all examples of this type of name. Also included here is slang common to the gaming culture, such as leet, uber, or phear.<br>
<br>
<b>g.</b> Names of NPCs and places already found in Norrath: Kedge, Innoruuk, Trumpy, Erudin, Odus, Cindreela, Rathe, etc. will not be allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>h.</b> Names with titles in them: Mothermary, Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Masterbob, Therogue, Ladyelise, Kingsteve, Queentara, Fatherbill, etc. are all unacceptable. Titles in Norrath may be bestowed in an epic quest or other similar event, but giving yourself a title in your name won't be allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>i.</b> Names chosen to imitate, make fun of, or harm the reputation of another player, SOE employee, or Guide. Fitzsucks, Gmsarebad, Ralfencheats, Brenlo, Absor, etc. are all examples of what would fall into this category.<br>
<br>
<b>j.</b> Names of the fantasy genre which are known in popular media: Gandalf, Merlin, Belgarath, Drizzt, etc. are not allowed.<br>
<br>
<i>That tells me a lot about my first name, but what about my surname?</i><br>
<br>
All the same rules apply to your surname. Further, the combination of names cannot violate any of the guidelines set forth in the Naming Policy. For example, the name Absolute, when combined with the surname Vodka, violates Naming Policy. Similarly, names such as Merr Linn, Belg Erath, Sylvester Stallone, Klee Necks, etc. are all unacceptable.<br>
<br>
<i>How about apostrophes and double capitals? Can I have those in my first name?</i><br>
<br>
No, we're sorry, but you may never have apostrophes or double capitals in your first name.<br>
<br>
<i>What if my chosen first name is not offensive but the name filter doesn't accept it?</i><br>
<br>
It is likely that someone else already has reserved the name, whether or not they are actively playing at this time.<br>
<br>
<i>What about my surname? It's not a phrase or sentence, and it's not offensive, but I can't get the filter to accept it.</i><br>
<br>
Someone else likely already holds that surname. You can still petition and be granted this surname knowing that it will not be unique to your character.<br>
<br>
<i>Ok, how about apostrophes or double capitals in my surname?</i><br>
<br>
Apostrophes and double capitals are allowable in a surname, particularly if they lend themselves to role-playing. However, apostrophes and capitals cannot be used to create a title or sentence, or to break up what would otherwise be considered an unacceptable word<br>
<br>
<i>What about the word "The" as part of my surname?</i><br>
<br>
We're sorry, but "The" would make your surname into a title, which is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<i>Why do I see some people running around with a "The" in their name then?</i><br>
<br>
In special cases, such as Events and Historical Quests, sometimes a last name including "The" is rewarded for winning a tournament or participating as an integral part of a Quest. Additionally, Guides and GM's may be seen with a "The" in their names.<br>
<br>
<i>Under what circumstances can I get a name change?</i><br>
<br>
Customer Service will change a player's last name at his or her request, provided that the player is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and surname does not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the player receiving a new surname or else with the removal of the surname altogether. If your current surname violates naming policy, it may also be changed. Your first name may never be changed unless it violates naming policy.<br>
<br>
<i>Who has the ability to change my name?</i><br>
<br>
Senior Guides and GMs have the ability to change names. You will need to petition to seek a name change. Please be patient, there are some time-sensitive situations on every server that may take priority over name changes. It is also very helpful to report names you see which you feel are in violation of the naming guidelines.<br>
<br>
<i>This policy seems pretty restrictive! What kinds of names are encouraged?</i><br>
<br>
We try to promote names that are descriptive and encourage role-playing. Treehugger, Giantslayer, Windwalker, Stormcaller etc. are all examples of surnames that are encouraged and allowed. The variety of names and combinations that don't violate naming policy is varied and broad. We urge you to use creativity when choosing a name for yourself. After all, you and your name will be inseparable as you travel the many roads of Norrath! <br>
