<p><b>Guild Leaders </b><br>
  Usually your first task as a new player is to find the proper non-player character 
  guild for your class and meet its leader. When you hand over the right scroll, 
  you form a lasting association with a group and agree to abide by its charter. 
</p>
<p>Player-created guilds have a leader (usually the creator) who invites other 
  players to join. As the group grows larger, he or she can create officers to 
  help manage the guild. </p>
<p>The best way to locate a guild leader for a guild you want to join is to ask 
  other players. Search out another member and find out the best time and location 
  to contact the guild leader.<br>
</p>
<p><b>Joining/Leaving a Guild </b><br>
  Before you join a player-created guild, find out whether the guild's plans are 
  similar to those of your character. Most guilds have a web site that lists their 
  charter, goals and requirements. To join a non-player character guild specific 
  to your occupation, give the correct scroll to the guild master. To join a player 
  guild, find the Guild Leader and ask to join. You're not obligated to accept 
  a guild invitation, and player guilds aren't obligated to invite you. </p>
<p>Once you join a guild you assume the guild name. This name appears in &lt;brackets&gt; 
  after your character's name onscreen. Your guild affiliation is also revealed 
  when someone uses the &quot;/who&quot; command. </p>
<p>You can leave a guild at any time by typing the following: </p>
<p>/guildremove [your character's name]<br>
</p>
<p><b>Creating a Guild<br>
  </b>If you decide that none of the existing guilds are quite what you are looking 
  for, you may found your own guild. In order to establish your guild you must 
  have an acceptable name, charter, and a membership of 10 players who wish to 
  form this guild.<br>
  The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for you guild:<br>
  <br>
  1. The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server 
  and issue the #makeguild command. This will create a private guild channel. 
  The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel, although this 
  name can be edited later during the creation process.<br>
  <br>
  2. Once the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the members 
  of his guild into the channel. To do this he needs to tell the guild members 
  the name of the channel and the password for access.<br>
  <br>
  3. Once a total of 10 members are in the channel and have issued the #guildapprove 
  command, the guild leader can then issue the #makeguild command. This will move 
  the guild leader to the guild creation screen.<br>
  <br>
  4. In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of 
  the guild’s charter. This summary should focus on the guild’s role in Norrath 
  and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild 
  need not be included. You may also edit your guild’s name in this screen. Once 
  completed, hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for approval.<br>
  <br>
  5. The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating the 
  GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for revision, 
  the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button. Comments regarding 
  the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation 
  screen. The guild leader can edit the charter and the guild name as needed and 
  hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the 
  leader is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. 
  If the leader hits FINISH the guild will be resubmitted for approval and the 
  leader will be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit screen.<br>
  <br>
  6. Once the name and charter have been approved, the guild leader will be notified 
  via email that the guild is ready to be created. Please verify that your email 
  is correct in our files by going to account:change account:edit registration 
  from the login screen.<br>
  <br>
  7. Once the guild leader has received notification that the guild has been approved, 
  it is his responsibility to petition and meet the GM of his server to complete 
  the guild creation process.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Guild commands<br>
  </b>Guild leaders and members can send special (&quot;/&quot;) chat commands 
  to others in their guild. Replace items in [brackets] with the indicated information. 
  Valid users are listed in parentheses after the definition. </p>
<p>In order for a guild leader to make an officer, the player must not be in the 
  guild when using /guildinvite o [playername]. If a guild leader wants to promote 
  someone to officer, simply have the player to be promoted target themselves 
  and type /guildremove in order to be ready to be promoted to officer. This will 
  remove them from the guild, which will allow the guild leader to then use the 
  /guildinvite o to make them into an officer. Please be careful in choosing who 
  will be the officers in your guild, as only the guild leader and officers can 
  invite new members into the guild. Only the guild leader can make someone an 
  officer. </p>
<p>/guildinvite [name] [rank] - Invite a person to join the guild. If this person 
  is to be an officer, include the argument [O] (as in Oscar) for the rank. Usable 
  by the Guild Leader and Officers, but only the Guild Leader can make officers. 
  You would also use this function to promote a member to an officer. </p>
<p>/guildremove [name] - Remove a member from the guild. Only the Guild Leader 
  may remove Officers. You may use this command on yourself to leave the guild. 
</p>
<p>/guilddelete - Disband your entire guild. Only the Guild Leader may use this 
  command. </p>
<p>/guildstatus [name] - Will return information on whether the named person is 
  a member, an Officer, or the Guild Leader. </p>
<p>/guildleader [name] - Transfer guild leadership to [name].</p>
<p>/guildsay [text] - Sends a message to all guild members.</p>
<p>/guildwar [name] [duration] - Initiates a guild war against the guild of the 
  Guild Leader which appears in the [name] field. [Duration] sets the duration 
  in real days for the guild war. This defaults to one real day if left blank. 
  The opposing Guild Leader must send the same command with the [name] of the 
  enemy Guild Leader to fully initiate the conflict. </p>
<p>/guildpeace [name] - Ends a guild war before the duration has expired. [name] 
  is the name of the opposing Guild Leader. Both sides must send this command 
  to end the war prematurely.</p>
<p><b>Guild Wars </b><br>
  Conflict may arise between guilds from time to time. When this occurs, guild 
  leaders may decide to declare war between their guilds. If both leaders agree, 
  they can open hostilities by using the /guildwar command. </p>
<p>Guild wars may vary in duration from the default of 1 day to a maximum of 14 
  days. During this period of time members from either guild may cause harm to 
  each other regardless of their adherence to the tenants of Order or Discord. 
</p>
<p>If the forces in conflict decide that peace would be a better option before 
  the war has run its course an early end to the war may be declared. In order 
  to accomplish this, both guild layers must issue the /guildpeace command.<br>
</p>
