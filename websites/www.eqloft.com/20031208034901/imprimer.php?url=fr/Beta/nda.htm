<p>In order to participate in the beta testing of EverQuest&reg;, you must read 
  and accept the terms of use and license agreement below. Please read the TERMS 
  OF USE AND LICENSE AGREEMENT closely. By clicking the &quot;I ACCEPT&quot; button 
  below, you agree to be legally bound by the terms of this agreement. </p>
<p align="center"><br>
  <b>TERMS OF USE AND LICENSE AGREEMENT<br>
  (BETA TESTING OF A PRE-RELEASE GAME) </b></p>
<p>Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (&quot;SOE&quot;) has designed and developed 
  and is the publisher of a software product entitled EverQuest (the &quot;Game&quot;). 
  SOE has licensed Ubi Soft Entertainment SA (&quot;Ubi Soft&quot;) to distribute 
  the Game and establish a Beta Test program (the &quot;Beta Program&quot;) to, 
  among other things, allow a limited number of people to test the features, capabilities 
  and performance of one or more prerelease version(s) of the Game (the &quot;Beta 
  Software&quot;) and provide feedback and comments to SOE through Ubi Soft. </p>

<p>This TERMS OF USE AND LICENSE AGREEMENT (this &quot;Agreement&quot;) is by 
  and between SOE and the Beta tester (&quot;You&quot; or &quot;Recipient&quot;).</p>
<p>Account name: XXXXXXXXXX<br>
  Email Address: XXXXXXXXXX</p>
<p>EverQuest forum name (if applicable): XXXXXX</p>
<p>By clicking the &quot;I ACCEPT&quot; button below:</p>

<p>(1) You promise that you are eighteen (18) years of age or older, and are not 
  a principal, employee, agent, independent contractor, officer or director of 
  a developer or publisher of video or computer games (other than Ubi Soft), and 
  are entering into this Agreement on a completely voluntary basis with no expectation 
  of consideration, remuneration or any form of compensation whatsoever other 
  than what is expressly provided for in this agreement. If you are under 18 years 
  of age, please have your parent/guardian access and print out the confirmatory 
  letter allowing you to enter into this Beta Program at Ubi Soft's website at 
  www.eqloft.com and fax or send by post the confirmatory letter to Ubi Soft at 
  the address and fax number listed on the letter (Ubi Soft may forward a copy 
  of such confirmatory letter to SOE). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and even 
  if Ubi Soft or SOE does not receive the confirmatory letter, you understand 
  and agree that Beta Program Accounts are available only to adults or, in their 
  discretion, their minor child. If you are a minor, your parent(s) or guardian(s) 
  must complete the registration process, in which case they will take full responsibility 
  for all obligations under this Agreement. By clicking the &quot;I Accept&quot; 
  button below, you represent that you are an adult and are either accepting this 
  Agreement on behalf of yourself or your child. You may not transfer or share 
  your Account with anyone, except that if you are a parent or guardian, you may 
  permit one child to use the Account instead of you (in which case you may not 
  use that Account). You are liable for all activities conducted through the Account, 
  and parents or guardians are liable for the activities of their child. Corporations 
  and other entities are not eligible to procure Accounts; <br>
  <br>
  (2) You acknowledge that SOE may, through Ubi Soft, in its discretion and at 
  any time before or during the Beta Program, accept or reject your application 
  for the Beta Program (or terminate your participation therein), and if you are 
  accepted SOE is willing to provide the Beta Software (as defined below) through 
  Ubi Soft for evaluation and testing in accordance with the terms and conditions 
  set forth in this Agreement; <br>
  <br>
  (3) You acknowledge that SOE may, through Ubi Soft, in its discretion, charge 
  a fee for the Beta Software and/or participation in the Beta Program, that you 
  can only access the Beta Program provided you pay the applicable Internet connection 
  fees and your participation in the Beta Program is contingent on your payment 
  of such fee(s); <br>
  <br>

  (4) SOE may, through Ubi Soft, in its sole discretion, reschedule the start 
  date or end date of the Beta Program at any time; and <br>
  <br>
  (5) You agree to all of the terms of the Agreement set forth 
  above and below. 
  <br>
  AGREEMENT <br>
  1. License Terms. <br>
  1.1 License Grant. SOE grants You the non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable, 
  limited right to install the Beta Software onto a single personal computer for 
  Recipient's personal use for testing, analysis, and evaluation of the Beta Software. 
  Recipient may not use, copy, modify, sell, lease, rent, distribute, perform, 
  display, transmit, transfer or disclose any part of the Beta Software except 
  as provided in this Agreement. Recipient may only use the Beta Software for 
  testing and evaluation purposes as set forth in Section 1.4 below. All other 
  rights are reserved to SOE. The Beta Software is to be delivered to Recipient 
  by SOE through Ubi Soft following the execution of this Agreement by Recipient, 
  unless SOE elects, in its sole discretion, to discontinue the Beta Program or 
  terminate this Agreement with You and remove You from the Beta Program. SOE 
  shall have no obligation to deliver any future revisions or versions of the 
  Beta Software. <br>

  <br>
  1.2 License Restrictions. Recipient shall not:<br>
  (a) Sublicense to, transfer, distribute or permit use of the Beta Software by, 
  any third party; <br>
  (b) Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Beta Software; <br>
  (c) Make copies of the Beta Software other than one (1) copy for back-up purposes 
  to be used solely as a replacement for the original copy, provided that Recipient 
  includes on the back-up copy all copyright and other notices that are included 
  on the Beta Software; and <br>
  (d) Export the Beta Software in violation of the export control laws of the 
  United States of America and other countries. <br>

  <br>
  1.3 Indemnification. During the Term of this Agreement, and after termination 
  or expiration of the Agreement, Recipient (a) agrees to indemnify, defend and 
  hold harmless, and (b) hereby releases, SOE and its direct and indirect parent, 
  subsidiary and sister corporations, and their respective officers, directors, 
  employees, agents and licensors, from and against any losses, liabilities, claims, 
  obligations, costs and/or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) which result 
  from, arise out of or in connection with the use of the Beta Software, and all 
  other services or activities related thereto, or by reason of the breach of 
  the warranties and representations of Recipient hereunder. <br>
  <br>
  1.4 Testing and Evaluation. Recipient hereby agrees to perform all of the following: 
  (a) to provide such hardware, operating system software, internet access software, 
  and other materials necessary to properly operate the Beta Software to comply 
  with the reasonable requests of SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft from time to 
  time regarding testing; and (b) from time to time, to provide feedback, suggestions 
  and comments to SOE via Ubi Soft on the functionality (including but not limited 
  to its operation, capabilities) and performance (including, but not limited 
  to, bug reports and test results) of the Beta Software. All of Recipient's feedback 
  and comments shall be the sole and exclusive property of SOE and/or its licensee 
  Ubi Soft, and SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft shall have the perpetual right 
  to use all or part of the Recipient's feedback or comments in any manner or 
  media now known or hereafter devised. <br>
  <br>
  1.5 Personally Identifiable Information; Monitoring; Privacy Issues. Recipient 
  acknowledges and agrees that SOE, directly or through its licensee Ubi Soft, 
  may ask him or her, as a condition to participation in the Beta Program, certain 
  personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;). SOE's 
  retention and use of all Personal Information shall be subject to SOE's posted 
  privacy policy, as that policy may be modified by SOE in its discretion from 
  time to time. Recipient acknowledges that any and all Beta Software character 
  data is stored and is resident on Ubi Soft's or SOE's servers, and any and all 
  communications that he or she makes within the Beta Software (including, but 
  not limited to, messages solely directed at another player or group of players) 
  traverse through Ubi Soft's or SOE's servers, may or may not be monitored by 
  SOE personnel and, accordingly, Recipient has no expectation of privacy in any 
  such communication or in any communications as described in Section 4.3 herein, 
  except for any personal data of Beta Tester both collected and controlled by 
  SOE personnel, as provided under applicable national data protection laws and 
  international treaties. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that SOE may transfer 
  such information to the United States or other countries or may share such information 
  with SOE's licensees and agents in connection with the Game. <br>

  <br>
  1.6 Term of the Agreement. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the 
  date the Agreement is agreed to by Recipient and submitted by Recipient to SOE 
  or Ubi Soft, and shall continue thereafter until the retail release of the Software 
  by Ubi Soft, unless earlier terminated as set forth in this Agreement or extended 
  by mutual agreement of the parties. <br>
  <br>
  1.7 Expiration or Termination of the Agreement. This Agreement shall expire 
  upon SOE's termination of the Beta Program. Recipient's participation in the 
  Beta Program, and the grant of license herein, may be terminated by SOE at any 
  time, for any reason or for no reason, in SOE's sole and absolute discretion, 
  by providing written or emailed notice to Recipient. Recipient may, at any time 
  and for any reason or for no reason, terminate his or her participation in the 
  Beta Program by providing written or emailed notice to Ubi Soft or SOE. The 
  Beta Program will be terminated upon the earlier of (a) SOE's or Ubi Soft's 
  written or emailed notice to Recipient or (b) the commercial release of the 
  Game. The termination of Recipient's participation in the Beta Program and/or 
  the termination of the Beta Program, however, shall not modify or supersede 
  the survival provision in Section 5.1 below. <br>
  <br>
  2. Ownership. Except for the revocable, limited license expressly granted hereunder, 
  SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft retain all rights, title and interests in and 
  to the Game and the Beta Software and all copies thereof, and all game character 
  data in connection therewith. The Game and Beta Software are copyrighted and 
  is protected by United States and other national copyright laws and international 
  treaty provisions. Recipient acknowledges that the Game and Beta Software contain 
  valuable trade secrets of SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft, and that SOE and/or 
  its licensee Ubi Soft own all intellectual property rights in and to the Game 
  and Beta Software, including, without limitation, all patent rights, copyrights, 
  inventions, trade secret rights, trade dress rights, trademark rights and intellectual 
  property rights therein and thereto. Recipient may not remove the copyright 
  and other proprietary rights notices from the Beta Software. Recipient agrees 
  that this Agreement shall be retained with all printed and electronic copies 
  of the Beta Software and documentation constituting the Beta Software. Recipient 
  agrees to prevent any unauthorized copying of the Beta Software. Except for 
  the revocable, limited license as expressly provided herein, SOE does not grant 
  Recipient any express or implied right in any patents, copyrights, trademarks, 
  or trade secret information of SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft. In accordance 
  with Section 1.4, Recipient agrees that SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft own 
  all rights, title, and interests in any and all of Recipient's feedback and 
  comments, without any remuneration, compensation or credit to Recipient. To 
  the extent that any of the rights assigned herein cannot presently be assigned 
  under applicable law, Recipient agrees to assign such rights at such time as 
  the rights are capable of being assigned. Recipient agrees at SOE's request 
  through its licensee Ubi Soft to execute such further documents and to do such 
  further acts as may be necessary or desirable to document, perfect, register 
  or enforce SOE's and/or its licensee Ubi Soft's ownership of any of the rights, 
  title and/or interests hereunder, in whole or in part including, without limitation, 
  execution of a copyright assignment in a form provided by SOE in its sole discretion. 
  If Recipient fails or refuses to execute any such documents, Recipient hereby 
  appoints SOE as Recipient's attorney-in-fact, which appointment is coupled with 
  an interest and is irrevocable, to act on Recipient's behalf and to execute, 
  deliver, record and file such documents. The rights granted, assigned and/or 
  to be assigned by Recipient hereunder are granted for the entire universe and 
  shall inure in perpetuity, and, as set forth above, no further consideration 
  shall be payable to Recipient at anytime in connection therewith. Recipient 
  will acquire no right to use, and will not use without SOE's prior written consent, 
  the names, characters, images, artwork, designs, tradenames, copyrighted materials, 
  trademarks or service marks of SOE or its related or subsidiary companies, employees, 
  directors, officers, shareholders, assigns, successors, licensors or licensees: 
  (a) in any advertising, publicity, marketing, promotion or on any website; or 
  (b) in any manner other than in accordance with this Agreement. <br>
  <br>

  3. Injunctive Relief. To the extent permitted by applicable law, Recipient acknowledges 
  and agrees that a breach or threatened breach of any covenant contained in this 
  Agreement would cause irreparable injury, that money damages would be an inadequate 
  remedy and that SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft shall be entitled to temporary 
  and permanent injunctive relief, without the posting of any bond or other security, 
  to restrain Recipient, from such breach or threatened breach. Nothing in this 
  Section 3 shall be construed as preventing SOE and/or its licensee Ubi Soft 
  from pursuing any and all remedies available to it, including the recovery of 
  money damages from Recipient. <br>
  <br>
  4. No Warranty; No Liability For Damages; No Support; Character Data. <br>
  4.1 No Warranty from SOE and its licensee Ubi Soft; Warranty from Recipient. 
  Recipient acknowledges that the Beta Software is a pre-release version and is 
  not a final Game. RECIPIENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE BETA SOFTWARE MAY WELL CONTAIN 
  ERRORS AND DEFECTS. THE BETA SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT 
  ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY 
  QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, 
  OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE.<br>
  Recipient states and warrants to SOE and its licensee Ubi Soft that he/she is 
  not bound by any agreement, or commitment of a similar or other nature whatsoever 
  prohibiting the conclusion of this Agreement and the full execution of each 
  of its requirements. <br>

  <br>
  4.2 No Liability For Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL SOE, OR ITS LICENSEE UBI SOFT, 
  THEIR DIRECT AND INDIRECT PARENTS, SISTER AND SUBSIDIARY CORPORATIONS, OR EMPLOYEES, 
  AGENTS, OFFICERS AND/OR DIRECTORS OF ANY OF THE ABOVE, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES 
  WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
  SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO 
  USE THE GAME, EVEN IF ANY OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
  SUCH DAMAGES. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no warranty 
  is made that the Beta Software will generate programs with the characteristics 
  or specifications desired by Recipient or that the Beta Software will be uninterrupted 
  or error-free. THESE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF 
  THIS AGREEMENT. <br>
  <br>
  4.3 No Support. SOE does not provide any support for the Beta Software. However, 
  Ubi Soft or SOE may provide an e-mail address and/or a passworded board for 
  Recipient to send any questions and/or comments regarding the Beta Software. 
  SOE does not, however, make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy 
  of any statements or advice provided in response to Recipient's e-mail(s) and/or 
  board postings. <br>
  <br>
  4.4 Test Environment. Recipient acknowledges that the Beta Program is a test 
  environment, that Game characters and/or character data will be frequently wiped 
  or modified at SOE's sole discretion, and that - notwithstanding any fee that 
  Recipient may be charged for participation in the Beta Program - Beta Program 
  Game characters and/or character data shall likely not be exported into the 
  Game once the Game is commercially released. <br>
  <br>

  5. Miscellaneous. <br>
  5.1 Survival. The provisions of this Agreement which by their nature survive 
  the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall continue in full force 
  and effect even after (i) the Beta Program has been terminated or completed 
  and/or (ii) Recipient's participation in the Beta Program has been terminated. 
  <br>
  <br>
  5.2 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed 
  and enforced in accordance with the laws of the country in which the Recipient 
  is resident excluding conflict of law rules and principles. The Courts of the 
  country in which the Recipient is resident shall have exclusive jurisdiction 
  to determine the validity, construction and performance of this Agreement and 
  the legal relations between the parties hereto. Recipient hereby waives any 
  claim that such venue is improper or inconvenient. <br>
  <br>
  5.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or 
  unenforceable, in whole or in part, such provision shall be modified to the 
  minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and the validity 
  and enforceability of all other provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected 
  thereby. <br>
  <br>

  5.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between 
  the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all 
  prior oral and written and all contemporaneous oral negotiations, commitments 
  and understandings of the parties. This Agreement may only by changed or amended 
  by a writing signed by both parties hereto. </p>
<br>
<p>In order to participate in the Beta Program, You must accept ALL OF THE ABOVE 
  TERMS of this Agreement. If you do not accept, you will not be allowed in the 
  Beta Program. <br>
