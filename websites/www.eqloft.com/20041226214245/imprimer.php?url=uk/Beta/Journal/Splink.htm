Splink is a tinker and explorer from The Plane of Innovation, who researched spells and knowledge. He spent a lot of time studying the spells of Luclin to bring them to the Grand Librarian of the city of Knowledge.<br>
<br>
As a rogue, he didn’t want to use magic (he likes studying magic, not playing with it) to travel and designed a special suit with rocket thruster engines.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately he fell to Norrath. He wandered a lot around, asking people to help him with furs (when it was too cold), water (when it was too hot) etc.<br>
<br>
Each time he rewarded the generous adventurers with a special Luclin spell.<br>
<br>
After some studies, Splink found a recipe to refuel his engines.<br>
<br>
Basically, he wanted:<br>
<ul>
a) Cask (to mix the components),<br>
b) Gnomish Spirits (good fuel base)<br>
c) Star Rose Quartz (for particle effects, Splink LOVES particle effects) to be ground up and mixed with the spirits<br>
d) Mercury, to make the fluid heavy, sold by Alchemy component vendors</ul>

He was helped by the guild New Dawn Ascended, who gathered the components and helped him attempt his 1st trip back to the moon, flying from the Aviak Tower of South Karana.<br>
<br>
But the fuel was scarce and Splink was stuck again on Norrath.<br>
<br>
The mage Theron helped him again with the components, but again that was good for one trip only.<br>
<br>
On his 3rd trip, Splink fell near Kaladim, where he heard about a special Cork to seal the Cask that was sold nearby.<br>
<br>
The guild Anachy's Blade helped him but did even more. Instead of just buying the mercury, they decided to hunt the DROPS of mercury from the elementals in Steamfont Mountains.<br>
<br>
Sealed with the special cork, and infused by the powerful elemental mercury, Splink was able to fly back to the moon, and he can do this freely now.<br>
<br>
He doesn’t come back often but when you can see him, he can provide your Luclin spells (from 4 to 29) at a discount price (1pp per spell level).<br>
