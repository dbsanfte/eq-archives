<b>In the Beginning...</b>
<p>There always has been and always will be an entity known as The Nameless. The 
  universe and its countless suns and worlds sprang from the will of the Nameless, 
  as well as many powerful creatures whom one might call gods. Whereas The Nameless 
  created the stage, these gods gave birth to us, the many actors upon that stage.</p>
<p><b>Dragons First &#8212; The Age of Scale</b></p>
<p>Veeshan, Crystalline Dragon and ruler of the Plane of Sky, was the first god 
  to notice the world of Norrath. She found it pleasing and deposited her brood 
  onto the frozen continent of Velious. Dragons walked the land and flew the skies 
  &#8212; powerful beings of great intellect, wisdom, and strength.</p>
<p><b>Early Gods and Their Interventions &#8212; The Elder Age</b></p>
<p>In time, another god noticed Veeshan&#8217;s work. Brell Serilis, the Duke 
  of Underfoot, secretly created a magic portal to a cavern deep in the belly 
  of Norrath. Through this portal, he seeded the depths of Norrath with all manner 
  of creatures and sealed them within a labyrinthine chamber of mystical Living 
  Stone.</p>
<p>With his own supplicants in place, Brell Serilis then discussed the fate of 
  Norrath with the other gods: Tunare the Great Mother, Prexus the Oceanlord, 
  and Rallos Zek the Warlord. With words befitting the King of Thieves, Brell 
  proposed that they accept an alliance of sorts, to divide the planet amongst 
  them for the purpose of keeping the Dragon Wurmqueen in check. All agreed to 
  the division; however, Rallos Zek pledged his allegiance to none.</p>
<p>Thus, the gods each created a race of beings to keep a vigilant eye on Norrath 
  and the schemes of Dragonkind. Brell Serilis had forged the Dwarves, stout and 
  strong, deep beneath the mountains. Prexus the Oceanlord produced his children, 
  the Kedge, hearty aquatic beings of great mental power and stamina. Aboveground, 
  Tunare the Great Mother gave birth to the Elves, creatures of limitless grace 
  and beauty. And Rallos Zek created the Giants, a race of fierce and formidable 
  surface-dwellers, ever intent upon the defense of their lands.</p>
<p><b>Unwanted Attention &#8212; The Age of Monuments</b></p>
<p>Innoruuk, The Prince of Hate, cursed his fellow gods for not including him 
  in their pact and vowed they would regret such disrespect. He took the first 
  Elven King and Queen and slowly tore them apart, physically and mentally, over 
  the course of three hundred years. He then rebuilt them into his own dark sadistic 
  image. These Dark Elven creatures came to be known as the Teir&#8217;Dal.</p>
<p>Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane and Cazic-Thule came next to Norrath. Brell Serilis 
  entered into a second pact with these gods, along with Rallos Zek. From this 
  pact, Brell added the Gnomes &#8212; cousins to Dwarves, yet more wiry, gnarled 
  and consumed by tinkering with devices. Rallos Zek made the Ogres &#8212; massive, 
  implacable beings of questionable intelligence &#8212; and the Orcs, bred for 
  battle and singled-minded in their desire for conquest.</p>
<p>On the surface, away from Elves and Giants, Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane fashioned 
  the Halflings, a short and stubby folk, who were nonetheless agile and had a 
  distinct propensity to meddle (or even pilfer) at times.</p>
<p>Cazic-Thule, Lord of Fear, was drawn to the swamps and jungles of Norrath and 
  there created the green-skinned Trolls and the reptilian Iksar of Kunark.</p>
<p><b>Fall of Rallos Zek and His Children</b></p>
<p>Only the Ogres of Rallos Zek dared invade the Plane of Earth itself. Through 
  a combined offensive effort, the other gods finally defeated and imprisoned 
  Rallos Zek in his own domain, the Planes of Power. Thousands of Ogres were slain 
  and their empire collapsed around them. The Giants were forced to flee their 
  homes as the gods brought snow and ice to their previously lush lands. Rallos 
  Zek&#8217;s third race, the Goblins, were also cursed, although no writings 
  remain of their trials.</p>
<p><b>End of Elven Prosperity (The Lost Age)</b></p>
<p>The Elddar Forest, the Elven realm of old, spread across the entire southeastern 
  quarter of Tunaria. Tree communities as well as cities of marble and gleaming 
  snow-white spires rose out of the forest, higher than the tallest trees. This 
  prosperity drew the jealousy of Solusek Ro, Lord of Flame. The rivers ran dry, 
  and less rain fell. The great Elven druids fought long and hard with their powerful 
  magic, attempting to turn back the change, but they could only delay the inevitable. 
  Slowly the forest gave way to desert, until at last even the fair Elven city 
  Takish-Hiz crumbled, and the elves were forced to flee Tunaria, leaving much 
  of their greatness behind.</p>
<p><b>Birth of Humankind &#8212; The Age of Blood</b></p>
<p>As the dust settled, the last of the gods came to Norrath. These were twin 
  deities Mithaniel Marr, God of Valor, and his sister Erollisi, Goddess of Love. 
  Their creatures, the Barbarians, proved a hardy race and settled the cold and 
  rugged northlands near the ruins of the Giants&#8217; empire. As the Barbarians 
  spread out across the lands &#8212; indispute with each other and any other 
  race encountered &#8212; a tiny movement toward enlightened thinking was sparked 
  by the Twins Marr and began slowly to grow. And so, even amidst desolation and 
  war, there was hope.</p>
<p>This enlightened order of Barbarians became the fathers and mothers of the 
  Human race. Their Combine Empire spread throughout the known world, but then 
  died even more quickly than it grew, and for reasons still unknown. While they 
  are the ancestors of every Human on Norrath, and their relics and ruins still 
  litter lands from Odus to Faydwer, little history of their great empire remains.</p>
<p><b>Early Human Settlements &#8212; The Age of Enlightenment</b></p>
<p>To the west, a strong and noble band of Humans, lead by Antonius Bayle the 
  First, founded Qeynos under the lofty principles of law. To the east, Freeport 
  grew into an active and dangerous port of call for all who dared venture into 
  the Ocean of Tears. The great continent of Tunaria became known as Antonica.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Human explorers and adventurers returned from afar with tales of 
  Elves, Dwarves, and other strange creatures, as well as descriptions of ancient, 
  abandoned cities. A few even came back with limited knowledge of sorcery and 
  the mystic arts. When a discontented minority of leaders heard these tales, 
  they became both jealous of the arts and races described therein and determined 
  to see these lands for themselves.</p>
<p><b>Magic</b></p>
<p>Leaving a small network of spies behind them, Erud and the above mentioned 
  discontents sailed west and landed upon the barren coast of Odus Island. They 
  soon established Erudin, a city almost entirely within a towering castle inhabited 
  by scribes and scholars called High Men. Within the castle walls they gathered 
  and analyzed reports, captured books or scrolls, and other artifacts brought 
  to them by their spies. Soon many &#8220;Erudites&#8221; &#8212; wizards, sorcerers, 
  and enchanters &#8212; occupied the great halls of Erudin, growing immensely 
  in both power and knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Magic in War &#8212; The Age of Turmoil</b></p>
<p>Some years later, a small group of Erudites discovered the lost art of necromancy 
  and were branded heretics. For the first time in hundreds of years, the Erudites 
  knew and engaged in civil war.</p>
<p>But war among the Erudites held one significant difference. In place of swords 
  and bows, they used magic. Lives by the hundreds were lost, great buildings 
  and structures destroyed, and eventually the heretics were forced to flee Erudin 
  and regroup in the southern regions of Odus. The great arcane energies released 
  in the final battle of the war opened an immense hole in the earth, leading 
  to depths unknown. Along the sides of this chasm, the heretics built Paineel, 
  their city of refuge.</p>
<p><b>And, in Kunark</b></p>
<p>Tonight, Vanusk sat in silence until I asked him to continue. He wanted to 
  know what we had learned. When we started to recite the tales back to him, he 
  silenced us and asked again what we had learned. The Bane&#8217;s leader ventured 
  a guess and told him that the only constants seem to be struggle, death, war 
  and deceit. He pulled back the edges of his mouth in what must have been an 
  Iksar smile and said, &#8220;As goes Norrath, so goes Kunark. Now, you are ready 
  to learn of my land.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat back, leaning his strong tail against the railing of our ship and looked 
  south. &#8220;Since the beginning,&#8221; he said, &#8220;Kunark has suffered 
  under the shadow of the wurm.&#8221; His fantastic tale continued over the last 
  days of our sea journey.</p>
<p><b>Shissir Kingdom</b></p>
<p>While the dragons took centuries to grow and organize, a race of intelligent 
  snake men &#8212; the Shissir &#8212; assumed the forefront. The Shissir were 
  a brutal race who enslaved the Iksar, using Vanusk&#8217;s ancestors for workers 
  and food. From their capital of Chelsith in what is now The Overthere, they 
  explored dark rites and forgotten evils which would lay the foundation for much 
  of Iksar knowledge and philosophy.</p>
<p>As learned from the rest of Norrath, nothing is permanent. Eventually, the 
  Shissir angered even their own gods. A horrible plague destroyed every Shissir; 
  however, the Iksar survived unscathed.</p>
<p><b>Iksar Nation</b></p>
<p>Over the next several centuries, the Iksar grew to greatness on the buried 
  ashes of their former masters. They migrated outward across the continent of 
  Kunark and formed five principal tribe-states: Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, Jarsath 
  and Kunzar. This last tribe-state was led by Venril Sathir, a young and powerful 
  warrior-mage, who raised an unyielding army of undead with the assistance of 
  dark magic.</p>
<p>Sathir and his Kunzar armies conquered and annexed the remaining tribe-states 
  under his rule as the first King of Sebilis, the renamed Iksar nation. In order 
  to build his Sebilisan Empire, Sathir brutally captured and enslaved the Hill 
  Giants, Forest Giants and Froglok of Kunark. Throughout Sathir&#8217;s life, 
  the Sebilisan Empire quickly grew in might, power and grandeur.</p>
<p><b>The Rule of Rile</b></p>
<p>King Sathir aged, but, of course, he did not want to die. To cheat death, he 
  made an unholy pact with Innoruuk to rise, undead and immortal. Rile, Sathir&#8217;s 
  heir, had other plans and thwarted the ritual. Sathir&#8217;s soul was trapped 
  inside an amulet that was hidden away as Rile cremated his father&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>Rile assumed the throne; however, little changed in the kingdom. The son of 
  Sathir seized more valuable land and his ruthless reputation increased under 
  the terrors of his warlords: Kurn Machta and Karatukus and the vampire, Chosooth. 
  By the time these warlords finished, most of the continent definitely belonged 
  to Sebilis &amp;ldots; all but a few pockets of Giants and Dragons.</p>
<p><b>The Ring of Scale</b></p>
<p>The Iksar had left the Dragon lands alone, but their threat was easy to see. 
  The Dragon lords convened the Ring of Scale and argued about how to proceed. 
  Trakanon, the large blue, advocated swift intervention on behalf of all races 
  against the Iksar. However, Trakanon was voted down and the Ring of Scale decided 
  to intervene only indirectly.</p>
<p>Trakanon and a number of the younger dragons decided more direct action was 
  required. They conjured a squall at sea that destroyed Rile&#8217;s warship 
  while the King was on board. This action triggered a spectacular war among the 
  Dragons that lasted for almost a half century. Since this Ring of Scale was, 
  in all likelihood, responsible for the capture of our companion, we were understandably 
  curious to learn as much as we could. Vanusk answered only one question with, 
  &#8220;There are lesser dragons that fly across Norrath and pluck candidates 
  for slavery to the Ring of Scale.&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Atrebe&#8217;s Iksar Empire</b></p>
<p>Atrebe, Rile&#8217;s first-hatched son, then became King. This young Iksar 
  was different from his father. He was reclusive and enamored of the dark arts. 
  All feared his use of the evil magic of the Shissir and his grandfather, Sathir. 
  His foul experiments joined a dragon with an Iksar, creating the Sarnak, a race 
  of intelligent Dragon-men. He also joined a Dragon with a Froglok, creating 
  flying mounts for his armies, the Sokokar. On these flying beasts, the Iksar 
  were deadly. Soon, only the hardiest Dragonkind stood unconquered by the Sebilisan 
  Empire.</p>
<p><b>Iksar vs. the Ring of Scale</b></p>
<p>Over the next half century, Dragonkind struggled against the Iksar&#8217; airborne 
  army. Atrebe was succeeded by his son, Ganak, a most capable warrior. The war 
  ended inconclusively over the Field of Bone with aerial duel between Ganak on 
  his Sokokar mount and Jaled-Dar, then leader of the Ring of Scale. Both were 
  incinerated by magic and fire.</p>
<p>The Dragons retreated, but not before destroying the imperial palace and all 
  Ganak&#8217;s hatchlings in a daring final blaze of revenge.</p>
<p><b>The Emerald Circle</b></p>
<p>Instead of a new king, the Iksar nobles created the Emerald Circle, a body 
  of five nobles who wisely worked to enhance the Iksar cities and trade, rebuild 
  the navy, and return prosperity to the empire. Unfortunately, whenever the ambitions 
  of rulers are involved, strife soon follows and the empire was ultimately divided 
  into the original five tribal-states. Even that treaty was soon forgotten, as 
  the tribes began to wrestle for supremacy over each other. Unbeknownst to the 
  Iksar, the Ring of Scale had also rebuilt and was meddling in every alliance 
  and affair, pitting the tribal-states one against another.</p>
<p><b>The End of the Sebilisan Empire</b></p>
<p>The slaves revolted in Sebilis. Goblin lords from Faydwer invaded Kunark. The 
  Giants mustered an army and destroyed the warlord outposts before they attacked 
  the cities. The final destructive attack on the Iksar came when Trakanon and 
  his Dragon allies descended on what was left of the Iksar cities and reduced 
  them to ashes and ruins. The grand Sebilisan Empire was no more. Free from Iksar 
  restraints and rule, all the other races established themselves and began warring 
  amongst themselves in their lust for domination.</p>
<p>Two last warnings came from Vanusk as we bedded down for the evening. Our new 
  friend told us that the undead King Venril Sathir had indeed been brought back 
  into existence and ruled in Karnor, in The Dreadlands, a place he recommended 
  we avoid. The second warning was to avoid the Frontier Mountains. That foul

  children.</p>
