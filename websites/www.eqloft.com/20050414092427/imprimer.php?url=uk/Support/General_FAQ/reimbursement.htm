In an effort to more efficiently assist our customer base, we have evaluated and revised our Reimbursement Policy. The primary goal of these modifications is to give our GMs more latitude in assisting our players. It is our goal to be able to keep our customers as satisfied as possible and to balance that with the overall integrity of the game. We are confident that the changes below will perform this task.
This policy is not all-inclusive and there are situations outside the scope of the policy that may be determined at the specific time to not warrant an item reimbursement. Please remember that no requests for reimbursals are guaranteed to be fulfilled.<br>
<br> 
<b>1. Bind Death Loops</b><br>
<br>
Bind Death Loops occur when a player is killed repeatedly upon return to his or her bind point with no available means of escape, typically due to the player's faction with the NPCs at their bind point.<br>
<br>
<B>1.1.</B> Any losses due to bind death loop situations may be reimbursed after an investigation and solely at the discretion of the Game Master.<br>
<br>
<b>1.1.1 Note:</b> Please remember to only be bound in safe places.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2.</b> If a player is in a bind death loop, the GM may remove the player from the loop once contacted.<br>
<br>
<b>1.2.1 Note:</b> If you find yourself in a bind death loop, please do the following:<ul>
·	Attempt to camp the affected character out of game. <br>
·	Upon returning to the character select screen, either log in another character, or make a new character to log in game on the same server. <br>
·	For assistance, petition in game on that same server with the name, location, and details of what is taking place.</ul>

<b>2. Coins</b><br>
<br>
Coins are the cash that players use as currency with merchants and other players.<br>
<br>
<b>2.1.</b> Coins (platinum, gold, silver, and copper) may be reimbursed under some circumstances. Such a reimbursement would take place after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Containers</b><br>
<br>
Containers as referred to herein are both world containers, such as forges, ovens, or pottery wheels, and mobile containers, such as spits or sewing kits. These containers are those that allow the creation of new items using player trade skills.<br>
<br>
<b>3.1.</b> Items lost when combined in world containers, such as forges, ovens, etc. (intentionally or accidentally) may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<br>
<br>   
<b>4. Deleted/Missing Player Characters</b><br>
<br>
Characters are deleted from the character select screen, which is only accessible using your account station name and password.<br>
<br>
<b>4.1.</b> Deleted/Missing characters may be restored after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<br>
<br>
<b>4.1.1 Note:</b> A restore of a deleted or missing character cannot be guaranteed, including any items of any kind that were on the character at the time of deletion. It is imperative that you contact a GM immediately if you wish to request a character restore.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Destroyed Items</b><br>
<br>
Items are destroyed by using the Destroy option on your inventory screen in game. The option can be set to either Fast Destroy On or Off under your Options in game; this option allows you to confirm whether or not you wish to destroy an item.<br>
<br>
<b>5.1.</b> Items that are destroyed, intentionally or accidentally, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>6.1.</b> Items dropped, intentionally or accidentally, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of the GM.<br>

<br>
<b>7.2.</b> If there is a known server-wide player drop, resurrections may be authorized.<br>
<br>
<b>7.3.</b> Experience may not be restored for any death caused by duels, Player vs. Player combat, or NPC attacks.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Faction</b><br>
<br>
A player's "Faction" is comprised of a combination of their race, class, deity, and deeds (what they've done in the world), and this combination defines how NPCs interact with you in the world. While race, class, and deity are fixed in nature, how other NPCs look at you can be influenced pro or con based on what you do in the world.<br>
<br>
<b>8.1.</b> Factions may be restored to a previous save after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<br>
<br>
<b>8.1.1. Note:</b> A restore of faction cannot be guaranteed. It is imperative that you contact a GM immediately if you wish to request a faction restore.<br>
<br>
<b>9. NO RENT Items and Containers</b><br>

<br>
<b>9.1.</b> All items classified as NO RENT and all contents lost in NO RENT containers may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<br>
<br>
<b>9.1.1. Note:</b> If a player is disconnected from the game while they have NO RENT Items on their character, they have 30 minutes after the time of disconnection before the No Rent item is destroyed. If they log back on within this 30 minute period, the items should still be in game.<br>
<br>
<b>10. NPC's/Corpses of NPC's</b><br>
<br>
An NPC is a non player character that upon death may leave a corpse in game.<br>
<br>
<b>10.1.</b> Any disappearing NPCs, items or corpses of an NPC, may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM. However NPCs may not be spawned and items not looted will most likely not be reimbursed.<br>

<br>
<b>11. PC Corpse Decay</b><br>

<b>14. Roll-backs</b><br>

<br>
<b>14.1.</b> Any lost items, experience, or faction due to a reset to a previous save may be reimbursed after an investigation and at the discretion of a GM.<br>
