	<!-- Naming Policy -->

Names are a very important part of your EverQuest identity. Your name is associated with your character even more than your race, class, or equipment. When choosing a name, keep in mind that it will identify you for many levels to come! Although SOE Customer Service staff does not like to interfere in your role-playing experience, there are some simple guidelines you should follow when creating a character name. If your name violates the rules outlined below, it may be changed when it is brought to the attention of a Guide or the GM of your server.<br>
<br>
<b>What kinds of things should I keep in mind when creating a character name?</b><br>
<br>
You should keep in mind that the following types of names are unacceptable:<br>
<ul>
a. Offensive names: This includes rude, profane (swear), or vile words. It also includes racial slurs, sexually offensive terms, and references to the anatomy. A name that sounds like an offensive word (homonym) when sounded out will also be considered unacceptable. Commonly known abbreviations for offensive words will not be allowed, nor will intentional misspellings of offensive words. Combinations of names that result in an offensive phrase or word are also off-limits. Repeated attempts to create a character with a name in this category can result in a warning or banning, so please be mature and don't attempt to get these through the filter. If you do make a character with a name that violates this policy the character will be deleted, and your account may be subject to suspension or banning depending on the nature of the name.<br> 
<br>
b. Religious names: Don't try to name yourself Jesus or Allah or Beelzebub. This type of name can also offend many other players. <br>
<br>
c. Words that are offensive, religious, or known as part of popular media in another language besides English.<br> 
<br>
d. Trademarked services, concepts or products: Trademarked names are not part of Norrath. Names such as Kleenex, Tylenol, Marlboro, etc. will not be allowed.<br> 
<br>
e. Non-fantasy names from television, movies, comic books, books, and other popular media: Rambo, Cinderella, Darthvader, etc. are all unacceptable. <br>
<br>
f. Common words that would not be found in a Norrathian setting: Switchblade, Microwave, Phaser, Sloegin, Website, Cannabis, Computer, etc. are all examples of this type of name. Also included here is slang common to the gaming culture, such as leet, uber, or phear.<br>
<br>
g. Names of NPCs and places already found in Norrath: Kedge, Innoruuk, Trumpy, Erudin, Odus, Cindreela, Rathe, etc. will not be allowed. <br>
<br>
h. Names with titles in them: Mothermary, Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Masterbob, Therogue, Ladyelise, Kingsteve, Queentara, Fatherbill, etc. are all unacceptable. Titles in Norrath may be bestowed in an epic quest or other similar event, but giving yourself a title in your name won't be allowed.<br> 
<br>
i. Names chosen to imitate, make fun of, or harm the reputation of another player, SOE employee, or Guide. Fitzsucks, Gmsarebad, Ralfencheats, Brenlo, Absor, etc. are all examples of what would fall into this category. <br>
<br>
j. Names of the fantasy genre which are known in popular media: Gandalf, Merlin, Belgarath, Drizzt, etc. are not allowed.</ul>

<b>That tells me a lot about my first name, but what about my surname?</b><br>
<br>
All the same rules apply to your surname. Further, the combination of names cannot violate any of the guidelines set forth in the Naming Policy. For example, the name Absolute, when combined with the surname Vodka, violates Naming Policy. Similarly, names such as Merr Linn, Belg Erath, Sylvester Stallone, Klee Necks, etc. are all unacceptable.<br>
<br>
<b>How about apostrophes and double capitals? Can I have those in my first name?</b><br>
<br>
No, we're sorry, but you may never have apostrophes or double capitals in your first name.<br>
<br>
<b>What if my chosen first name is not offensive but the name filter doesn't accept it?</b><br>
<br>
It is likely that someone else already has reserved the name, whether or not they are actively playing at this time.<br>
<br>
<b>What about my surname? It's not a phrase or sentence, and it's not offensive, but I can't get the filter to accept it.</b><br>
<br>
Someone else likely already holds that surname. You can still petition and be granted this surname knowing that it will not be unique to your character.<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, how about apostrophes or double capitals in my surname?</b><br>
<br>
Apostrophes and double capitals are allowable in a surname, particularly if they lend themselves to role-playing. However, apostrophes and capitals cannot be used to create a title or sentence, or to break up what would otherwise be considered an unacceptable word<br>
<br>
<b>What about the word "The" as part of my surname?</b><br>
<br>
We're sorry, but "The" would make your surname into a title, which is not allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>Why do I see some people running around with a "The" in their name then?</b><br>
<br>
In special cases, such as Events and Historical Quests, sometimes a last name including "The" is rewarded for winning a tournament or participating as an integral part of a Quest. Additionally, Guides and GM's may be seen with a "The" in their names.<br>
<br>
<b>Under what circumstances can I get a name change?</b><br>
<br>
Customer Service will change a player's last name at his or her request, provided that the player is level 20+ and either the requested surname, or the requested combination of the first name and surname does not violate the Naming Policy. Upon approval, this change may either result in the player receiving a new surname or else with the removal of the surname altogether. If your current surname violates naming policy, it may also be changed. Your first name may never be changed unless it violates naming policy.<br>
<br>
<b>Who has the ability to change my name?</b><br>
<br>
Senior Guides and GMs have the ability to change names. You will need to petition to seek a name change. Please be patient, there are some time-sensitive situations on every server that may take priority over name changes. It is also very helpful to report names you see which you feel are in violation of the naming guidelines.<br>
<br>
<b>This policy seems pretty restrictive! What kinds of names are encouraged?</b><br>
<br>
We try to promote names that are descriptive and encourage role-playing. Treehugger, Giantslayer, Windwalker, Stormcaller etc. are all examples of surnames that are encouraged and allowed. The variety of names and combinations that don't violate naming policy is varied and broad. We urge you to use creativity when choosing a name for yourself. After all, you and your name will be inseparable as you travel the many roads of Norrath! If you are still having problems after visiting this support section, you can contact our Technical Support Department through an email via our online form.<br>
