A person who dies in EQ has no right to demand his or her stuff back.  I WILL NOT return anything to a rude asshole that demands I give him his loot.  Any bastard that isn't polite will get the same phrase from me every time.  "You can have the sweat off my nutsack."  However, if I know whoever's corpse it is or if they can be polite I will usually return their stuff back to em.  Yes, it is hard to get started after your corpse has been picked clean, but that's just tough shit.  There will be many corpses of other people you will find that you can loot.  Believe it or not, Everquest is not a team game, everybody in this game is just another deVVd trying to get the best possible character and be the richest bastard in the land.<p>
