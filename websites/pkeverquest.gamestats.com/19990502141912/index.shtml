I am sure you are wondering now, "Why the hell did we even have a poll if we knew what was going to win?"

I think I am going to make a basketball team and call them "Bitch!" and then I will bet on them every game. But don't worry, if my philosophy works the "Bitches" will never lose a game. Why you ask? Because the team they are playing against will over estimate themselves, because heh, who can't beat a team of bitches, right? Then when the game starts, the Bitches will dominate everyone and I will remain rich and powerful. Gwahaha

However, after a few staff changes the site came to a halt and everything was sad. But recently a new life has been pumped into this site. <a href="http://www.pk-hq.com">PK-HQ</a> has returned.

There is a new Voting at <a href="http://www.eqtrade.com ">EQ Trade Board</a> "Which race/class do you prefer ?" 
There are more then 60 points !!! All variations of races/classes are presented ! 
Come everybody and vote for char you play and char you prefer ! 
I hope many players will take part in the voting (I'll try to let everyone know about it) and results will be interesting to absolutly all players. 
We can dispute very long who is the best and whom it is preferable to play but to learn the real situation is interesting to everyone. 
This idea was offered by one of the visitors of our site - Arakias and you also can offer your idea for the next voting at General Board. Offer your variants and we are sure to look them through !!! </font>

<ul> Player killing news is running a bit slow. Most the news is about new web pages or how the annual dwarf marathon was postponed. I have been playing Civ: Call to Power and haven't had much time to invest in EQ. One great thing I learned recently is to look for used games at computer games stores. I found some great games for about ten bucks. I even found some 3do games (yes I was one of the three people that bought a 3do). I hope you don't mind the non-Eq related post, but nothing else for me to do really. Send in anything you think is news worthy though.

<b><i><U>Strat</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul> Here is a little strategy I recieved. I can't confirm this, but it sounds very very useful.<BR><BR><font color="FFD700" size="-1">You might already know but here it is anyways
It involves casting the invisibility spell. If you cast it on someone
with a pet
the pet will disappear, but the person would turn invisible, so be sure
to
keep the person as your target because you can still attack him. Also if
you
have see invisible spell you can still see him. Also I believe you can
cast the
cancel magic spell on them to get rid of this(might have to do it a few
times
to get rid of other enchantments first). Also if you have the person
targeted
and have attack on, you will attack them if they are in front of you.
There are
probably many ways this can be to your advantage.<BR><BR></font>
Thanks! This would be a great anti-necro strategy. If anyone can confirm this, send me a little somethin'.

<ul> The Trolls on Ralloz Zek usually role-play with words like "Danks" and "luter!". But how is everyone else doing? Maybe it is just easy to role-play a Troll, all you have to do is act stupid and have bad spelling. I imagine role-playing a High Elf would take a little more effort.

Civ: A Call To Power was released awhile ago, and I am a avid civ fan, but because of EQ I would never have time to play it. I have also been challenged for some StarCraft but haven't found the time to slaughter my friends. But you can help! Send a check or money order to phlashbak@earthlink.net and I might find the time to play these games. Only you can help me, my gaming is in your hands...

4. 3 prisoners in the tunnel located in the Shaman guild area.
<BR><BR>There is also one prisoner that you can talk to, and is higher level. Don't make the mistake of hitting him and having to run all the way to the zone (atleast that is what I have been told, I have never made that stupid mistake, nope not me)

<ul> At the end of beta I came upon a Troll SK who wanted me to kill him so that he could get back home quickly. It was beta so he didn't really care. Being a Troll Shaman I hit him with a couple Frost Rifts and then started to attack him. The sad thing was that it took me about five minutes to kill this Troll that had no armor on and was poisoned. It was really kind of embarrassing. Right before he died he mentioned about how he would have totally massacred me if we had really been fighting. The point of this poll is to determine which style of fighting is more effective. Good luck on the battle field...

I was attacked a couple times by him and received 40 points of damage every punch. Not only was he incredibly fast, but he could kick, dodge, and do an array of monkish things. The swamp was filled with shouts of "Oh My God" and "The pain the pain!" Groups of powerful Trolls tried to kill one of the NPC but they failed many times. I just found this kind of fun, even though people were getting killed, I can't remember the last time there was a fun quest like this in UO.

<font color="FFD700" size="-1">I want to assure everyone that we are well prepared for programs like EQextreme (which btw doesn't really seem to work anyways). We take this type of thing VERY seriously and you'll see people being banned (regardless of whether the programs work or not). When we do that it will absolutely be done in public view. We
don't want people like that playing EverQuest, and we want people to know we will do a lot more than just issue tough rhetoric.

If Verant doesn't do something to make me mad (like remove Rallos Zek) I don't think I would ever really cheat. But then again, cheating can be heavily debated. What exactly is cheating? Is raising swimming skill by using the auto-walk cheating? If so, I guess I am a cheater. I consider cheating as being very extreme, such as "duping" or using a 3rd party program. It's all in the eye of the beholder.

<b><i><U>Uh-oh</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul> A new program called EQExtreme has been released. It has a few features that manipulate the enviroment, such as always day, filter weather, and movement rate. Also there is a mana regeneration which could be very helpful. However, Verant is saying that they have a way to track EQExtreme, and that they will ban people for using it. That is why I am not putting up a link, for all I know It might just be a virus. I'll keep everyone up to date though.

<ul> Ok, I finally got EQ last night. The first time I went to buy it, my local EB was sold out. Plus there was that whole UUNet problem. So I get on tonight, and of course the name filter screws me up. As of today I will be playing a Troll Shaman named Klass. Yes, I have Klass. Besides that, everything looks good. There are a lot more people on Rallos Zek, which means it is going to be staying up. Thats about it, give me a /tell sometime.

To have a guild in EQ you don't need a web page, but I am going to ask for one. Without a page, there is really no verification that I can make to ensure that this is a real guild. Any suggestions?  I am just a HTML racist, sorry.

<ul> There are a few bug sites out on the web that deliver the best in exploits. I have to admit that I macro'ed in UO after my character was destroyed by a bug. But EQ is different, there are stricter penalties and a higher respect for the game. But does that stop you? Let find out, shall we?

This editorial brings about the dark side of the PvP Switch and talks about what could be done to improve. I feel that the PvP switch is fine, since you should be playing on Rallos Zek anyways.

<ul> If you haven't realized yet, Trolls are your surpreme masters, and now they have their own quest. <BR><BR><font color="FFD700" size="-1">The First Rallos Zek event is to be held Saturday March 20th 1999 at 7PM Pacific. <BR><BR>
The event is called Free da Feerott and will involve Ogres and Trolls roaming the Feerott and politely suggesting (via a lot of bashing, kicking, and slashing) that intruders and sightseers return to their lands, to leave Ogres and Trolls in peace. All player races in the Feerott during the evening of March 20th are targets, except for Trolls (politely asking Dark Elves to leave is left to the discretion of each etiquette group). <BR><BR>
We will meet at the entrance to Oggok at 7PM. From there we will break into groups and find players that need some Ogre and Troll bashing lessons. We will communicate via /shout the locations of known infilitrators and tourists. <BR><BR>
