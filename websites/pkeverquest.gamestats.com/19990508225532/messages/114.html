hey im not gona be mean but thats what the bank is for!<br>Start savin for a rainy day at about level 2-4<br>: What do you guys think about looting on the PvP server? I just had an incident where I looted a person and then immediatly was told to return the item. However, when I die and I see the guy looting me, I often just accept it. I know that this is a PvP server, and It was my fault for dieing. So what do you think? Should looting be a common practice, or should you always give back the items?<p>: Phlashbak<p>
