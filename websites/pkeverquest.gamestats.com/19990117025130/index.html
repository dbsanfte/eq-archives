<b><i><U>All You Wanted To Know, But Were Afraid To Ask!</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul>Guide Abashi tells all in this stunning story, of betrayal, deceit, and "Thumping".<BR><BR>
1. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">The PK Switch <br><br>
It's not going away. The only people who a PvP person will be able to fight will be other people who have chosen to be PvP or have chosen to duel. Gone are the days of being able to kill people who don't want to engage in it. There will be no "PK Days" where everyone is PvP for a few hours, or a day, or a week every 2 months. There will be no special advantages for those who choose to play PvP. There will be no limitations on levels, advancement, or weapons for those who chose to abstain from it. No one will *ever* be forced to engage in PvP against thier will. No one will ever be involuntarily switched PvP as a punishment for an attitude problem. <BR><BR>
If you wish to engage in PvP with other like-minded individuals, EverQuest will provide you a forum in which you can do that. However if the only way you will enjoy PvP is to kill people who want nothing to do with it, EverQuest will never provide that.</font><BR><BR>
2. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">PK vs. Anti-PK. <br><br>
Neither of these exist in EverQuest based on the modern definition. You are all PvP. PvP people will account for all races and classes in the game. <br><BR></font>
3. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">Killing out-of-character <br><br>
Those PvP persons who chose to kill outside the racial and deity hatreds that exist in the land will find themselves without a home. Sorry, but that is how it is. Kill in-character and go home to find yourself a hero with your faction and associates. Kill out-of-character and go home to find a guard wishing to bury his longsword in your skull. <br><br></font>
4. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">One Shot Kills <br><br>
Gone are the one-shot-kills or the 20 second battles some might be used to. If you want to kill someone it's going to take time, and chances are that they will have to be just as willing to fight you as you are them when you meet. The level-limit (currently 4 levels) on PvP combat pretty much insures that no one will ever take anyone else out in one shot. If you are solo and the target decides soon enough in the fight that they want to get away rather than fight, count on them to be able to do so. <br><br> </font>
5. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">Grouping PvPers <br><br>
I pity anyone who tries to solo a +PvP person be they magic, melee, or otherwise. As a solo PvP you will be USDA Prime for any group of PvPers that come your way. Not to mention your back will be unguarded when that Orc has got you down to 20% health, or when you are sitting on your backside regening health or mana. Healing and medding PvPers will be prime targets for other PvPs looking for an easy kill. <br><br></font>
6. <font color="FFD700" size="-1">Best Class for PvP <br><br>
Forget about it. There isn't one. Per #5, You are dead meat if you try to solo as a PvPer. You need a group, and like any group, PvP groups need to be well balanced as well. One on one is just too unpredictable. As a Wizard I will nuke you. As a Necromancer I will suck the life out of you while poisoning you from within. As a magician I'll nuke you and make you a playtoy for my pet. As an enchanter I'll just charm you and "introduce" you to a local Guard or wandering giant. As a cleric I'll thump you while healing myself. As a druid I'll nuke you while thumping on you and healing myself, same with the Shaman. As an SK I'll harmtouch you and suck the life out of you. As a paladin I'll lay hands on myself and heal myself proper as well. As a ranger I'll thump you with dual blades while you *try* to hit me and while I heal myself, and if things go bad I'll just disappear into the wilderness and sneak up on you later. As a rogue I will surprise you when you see how easy it is for me to circle behind you. As a bard you will find me swinging at you faster than anyone else. As a warrior or monk, I'll show you what it *really* means to be thumped. Did I miss any? 
Any questions?
</font><BR><BR>
But wait! For only $3.95 you will also recieve some info on the 4 level pking difference<br><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">The 4-level thing was almost unanimously agreed upon by the "notorios PK's" currently in the beta. It was cited as one thing that needed to go in to make PvP more viable. Quite frankly, much outside that 4 level limit, there is really no amount of skill and/or luck that can turn the tables against the stats.</font><BR><BR>
And we will also throw in this little untensil that tells you about RolePlaying and PlayerKilling, free of charge!<BR><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">I have heard the roleplay defense to massive unrestricted PvP before, I might actually have invented it. The truth is that though, yes, the PvP switch does hamper roleplay of racial hatred in that you cannot necessarily kill your enemy, it does the greater service of allowing all different playstyles to exist in the same world. 
EverQuest is a roleplaying game by definition, but that does not mean we can force people to roleplay any more than we want to force people to engage in PvP. <br>
Now, if we take your same scenario, and if you *both* wish to fight for roleplaying reasons, I suggest you use /duel. 
This tool has been provided for those who wish to engage in roleplayed PvP without the stigma caused by unrestricted full-time PvP.</font> <br><br>

Well, if you didn't know what thumping was all about, now you do. I put up a player killing <a href="faq.shtml">FAQ</a> that will contain any and all info we find on player killing.

<ul>Here is the report, straight from JarJar's mouth <BR><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">Wanted to let you know that Monday Night Madhouse turned out to be a great success....sorta..=)<BR>
<BR>We had around 100 ppl show up for the event. The event kicked off with everyone meeting at the qeynos gates. We then moved to an area away from the guards, and lined everyone up agains the wall.
From there, the fight began. Things were great at first, then I had to stop the brawl and move everyone to a corner where they could be better contained. The reason for this was because people were hiding, and the refs couldnt keep up with em. Once contained in the corner, the fight began again. It was a great sight to see 100 ppl wailing on eachother with whatever they could muster. The monks seemed to be kicking major butt with there roundhouse kicks. People were getting injured, and running for safety, thus causing some cheating to occur.<BR>
<BR>I then announced that newbie weapons could be used, and people started falling at a faster rate. Then all of the sudden the following message was broadcasted.."SERVERS COMING DOWN, PLEASE LOGOUT". The eq team had to ruin our evening....=)<BR>
<BR>Everyone was a little disappointed. Overall, it was a success, as it was the first ever major PVP event in norrath. Currently, the major problem is the lack of a fighting arena.<BR>
<BR>The prize was very nice tonight, but unfortunately, it will have to be won by someone next week, as an entry fee was not charged for this event. I want to thank Marten for donating the 13 plat and the Minotaur axe for the prize. You could win it next week!!! I also want to thank everyone who showed up for the event. I hope to have some killer screen shots of the event for your liking soon! <br><BR>
JarJar
</font><BR><BR>
Yea, the little "SERVERS COMING DOWN, PLEASE LOGOUT" was a nice stunt, but I think it was more than a coincidence, if you get my drift (Wink, wink...Nudge, nudge).

<b><i><U>Monday Night Madhouse</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul>Woohoo! A player killer event. <BR><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">Hello current eq beta testers and future eq beta testers. There is a new event taking place tommorrow night and each and every monday night. This event is called "Monday Night Madhouse". The event will take place at 9pm eastern, 8pm central. I am calling On all current eq beta testers to help me kick off the inaugural event.<BR><BR>
Here is how the event will work: <BR>
#1. Create a character that is good with hand to hand combat.<BR>
#2. No magic users are allowed. (this will change in future).<BR>
#3. Take this character to the priest of Discord in your local town to make him “red”, (pkiller)<BR>
#4. Bring your new red character to the Qeynos city gates. This is the meeting place of the event.<BR><BR>
As of now, getting a character from a far off place will be kind of hard to get to Qeynos, being only a level 1 character. In the future, I hope to have meeting points where gm’s will be able to gate you to the arena.<BR><BR>
Here is how the event will work:<BR>
Players will form a big circle, all facing each other. Once my character “JarJar” says “Let the madness begin”, each player will then proceed to kill any and all other players that are playing. There will be officials there to make sure there are no cheaters. The last man standing will win the prize.<BR><BR>
Rules:<BR>
#1. No armor!! Please abide by this rule.<BR>
#2. No magic.<BR>
#3. All players must be level 1.<BR>
#4. No weapons (might be changed to newbie only weapons)<BR><BR>
In the future I hope to have gm’s and guides there for organization. There will also be an entrance fee that will be used for prizes. Also I hope to have a championship belt that can be proudly worn by The current champion. The prize for the inaugural event should be nice.<BR><BR>
Please email me at jarjar@gtemail.net if you wish to donate something to the prize list. I hope to have the official “Monday Night Madhouse” webpage up shortly. I hope to have everyone show up and support this event. Lets Get it on!!</font><BR><BR>
If you are in Phase 3, I highly recommend that you drop on by and tear some people up. If you start now, you might just be able to get a Ogre Warrior over there in time (Even though the guards would dispatch you with extreme prejudice).

<ul>Ok, here is what you need to know<BR><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">In order to form a guild the following process must be followed: <BR><BR>
1. The leader of the guild must email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com. The header of the email must contain the NAME of the guild. In this email the leader will include a short Charter that includes the guild's role in Norrath. In addition, the leader needs to list at least 9 other characters that have agreed to form this guild. <BR><BR>
2. The leader and 9 other players need to email Eqguilds@sonyinteractive.com with the NAME of the guild as the header. The body of this email must include the name of the character that will be joining the guild and the ACCOUNT on which that character exists. <BR><BR>
3. Once the 10 prospective members (including the leader) have completed the above steps, the charter and name of the guild will be reviewed by 989. If both are approved, the leader of the guild will be notified of approval via email and told to approach a GM for formation of the guild. If 989 has any reservations about either the name or the charter, the guild leader will receive an email listing these concerns and be offered an opportunity to modify the charter or name as required. <BR><BR></font>

This is very important so you might want to spell check twice before you send. I am pretty sure there is limited guild space so hurry up!

</u>
<ul>Sounds like rogues got some power
<Br><br>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">I want to stress that all classes will be balanced, no classes will "suck". Rogues are better melee fighters than any hybrid, and are only second to the warrior and monk. They have skills that are needed, and yes they can steal a bundle. The backstab is fierce, and thier best form of attack, of course it has nothing to do with "3x damage". Thier high agility, dexterity, and the fact they use fast weapons means they will get the max potential out of thier weapons probably more than any other class. 
</font><BR><BR>
They have a while to go before balancing is completed, but I guess they are saving that for next phase.

<ul>Here is some info on the magic
<Br><br>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">Combat skills are reletivly easy except for magi who have trouble with it when they stop using thier staff. <BR><BR>
Magic skills are easy for Magi in one or two diciplines of magic. For instance, a wizard will have no trouble keeping up evocation, but will have a heck of a time keeping up Alteration. <BR><BR>A Necromancer will have no trouble with alteration or conjuration, but will have trouble with Evocation. <BR><BR>This is just due to the limited number of spells from that dicipline that they have. <BR><BR>As for non-combat skills, they will increase as you use them, of course, to do that, you must take time away from combat.<BR><BR></font>

</u>
<ul>A roleplaying organization might be able to convince 989 to host a complete roleplaying server. <br><BR><font color="FFD700">
It seems EverQuest roleplayers may get their own server afterall.
Norrath Roleplay, an on-line community of roleplayers, is preparing to
make claim to one server in the name of roleplayers everywhere. <br><BR>
While 989 Studios have made no official endorsement, the grass- roots
movement continues to swell. With the recent premiere of their new
website at www.norrathrp.com the group has seen their membership grow
to well over 200 roleplayers, including many prominent guilds. "And
that number climbs every day," according to Norrath Roleplay staffer,
Sauleth. <BR><BR>"At this rate, we'll have 400 people by Phase Four of the beta test,"
claims Jerris, another staffer. "And by the mass release, there should
be well over 1,000 roleplayers involved." 
"We just want to make Norrath as immersive an environment as possible,"
says Kha’Dorak, another of the staffers. "Our definition of roleplaying
is pretty liberal. We just want Norrath to smell like a High Fantasy
world. We want to have fun." <br><BR>
In addition to flooding one server with roleplayers, the group is taking
several steps to foster a sense of community and immersiveness in the
world of Norrath. Their efforts include player-run quests and several
in-character taverns. <BR><BR></font>

I think that this is a good idea, and I think that it would be cool for the roleplayers to have there own place. I would REALLY be interested in having a PK sever as well. However, since player killers are stereotyped by everyone as immature, I doubt that 989 would give us the same treatment.
