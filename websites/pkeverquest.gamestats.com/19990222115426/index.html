<ul>I have learned a valuable lesson over the weekend, don't set your pets to guard. As you know, you can make your pet guard you, or even a location. However, the problem is that the pet will also attack players. I spent a good portion of last night getting killed by the same people because my pet attacked some players. But there might be a up side to this, if you have a fairly powerful pet you might be able to have him guard the entrance to a enemy city. Therefor, anyone that comes out will get attacked. I recommend you experiment before trying this out though.

Hmm...It was such a close call, I don't think I can call the winner. But don't worry about newbie killing for too long. Once the factions are in place, it will be a lot harder to get away from the crime.

<b><i><U>A Little Bit of UO in EQ?</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul>I remember Brad proudly pointing out that EQ would never have trade skills, because EQ was a pure adventure game. But I guess they realized that something might be missing with out them. So here they are, stolen directly from <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com">NC </a>.
<BR><BR><font color="FFD700" size="-1">The EverQuest Team is pleased to announce a major enhancement to Trade Skills!<BR><BR>

We’ve just updated our Test Server with over 1,000 new items, the vast majority of which are created exclusively using the various trade skills available to players in the game. The rest of the Phase 4 servers will be updated with this new data shortly.
<BR><BR>
The following is a new section of the EverQuest Beta Manual that will be updated soon explaining the various Trade Skills and how they work:
<BR><BR>
TRADE SKILLS
<BR><BR>
Trade skills in EverQuest allow you to construct useful items from component pieces. This will allow you to make materials which will help your character in their profession, as well as providing a secondary source of income. To get started with a trade skill visit a merchant of the skill you wish to learn. They will have the books and kits which you will need to begin your career.
<BR><BR>
Once you have carefully read a book appropriate to your Trade Skill and acquired the component pieces necessary to build the item, you may attempt to construct it. Start by right clicking on the container used for the trade skill. This will open a window to which you drag the component parts from your inventory to the available slots in the container. Double check that all of the correct parts have been placed in the container, then click on the COMBINE button. If your character skillfully worked their trade skill you will get a new item(s). If your character blundered, you will usually lose all of the component pieces placed in to the container.

<b><i><U>Abashi Sightings</u></i></b> <font size="-1">  -  <a href=mailto:Phlashbak@earthlink.net>Phlashbak</a></font>
</u>
<ul>It was just a regular day. I was selling some items at my local gnome shop, when suddenly EQ Guide Abashi appears right in front of me. He must of been nearly 10 feet tall and he had 6 heads!!! In terror I hid behind the vender. Certainly he was here to kill everyone in the zone, and I had vowed to stop him. Being a level 2 gnome, I decided I would have to keep him here until his busy schedule interfered with his killings. I started to talk to him, still shaking from the pure power of the EQ Guide. I said cautiously, "Hey Thumper." We all know how Abashi is known for thumping, so I thought the words might calm him down. Next I preceded it by saying, "What are you up to?" Slowly one of his heads turned to me and his dagger filled mouth opened to reveal a snake like tongue. "Just dropping by," he said. I finally realized what he meant by, Just dropping by. He wasn't going to kill everyone on the zone, he was going to kill everyone on all the servers!!! It was up to me, I had to stop him! I hit him with a complex question to slow him down, "How are the factions coming along?" His heads grouped and conversed with each other before finally revealing the answer, "They are doing good. We already have some factions in place." The horror...the horror! Did this man not have a soul? A heart? Without provocation he lifted the vender into one of his mouths and swallowed him whole. Tears filled my eyes as I saw this brave NPC risk his very life for me. I had enough with words, I reached for my dagger and charged at Abashi, not knowing is this was the end. He lightly touched me with his index finger, which sent me flying against the wall in pain. He was far too powerful for me alone, but I wasn't thinking about myself when I tried to attack him, I was thinking about the whole 10 people that visit my website, and I cried a little. "Well, I have other things calling me, GoodBye," he said as he vanished away. Coward!  I yelled, "Drop by again sometime." Yes Abashi, drop by again, next time we will be ready! <BR><BR>
<font size="-1">Note: Abashi does not have 6 heads and he isn't very evil. <BR>Phlashbak cries a LOT more than described.<BR> EvilQuest receives about 150 index page views a day, and he loves all of you.<BR>No animals or venders were hurt in the making of this segment.</font>

<ul>I was thinking of having a little spot where I would write my pk experiences every once in a while. Would you guys be interested? Here is my first one, to give you a little taste.<BR><BR>
<font color="FFD700" size="-1">I had finally gotten out of Lesser Faydark after a battle with the high elves, and had traveled to Ak'Anon. This is when I meet Balbus who was sitting next to me, and we were chatting a little bit. He invited me to return to Greater Faydark to stir some trouble with the High Elves again. I told him that I wanted to stay here to build up my character and I wished him luck and we went our separate ways. I killed a couple decaying gnomes, and was returning back to get supplies. Right in front of the entrance to Ak'Anon I met Balbus again and we talked for a second. Suddenly, with no provocation he attacks me. Since I was weak already I ran into the safety of Ak'Anon and hid for awhile. After getting supplies, I went out again and fought some more. I killed a lot of Kobald Runts and was making a good profit. This is when my luck turned around. In the message box I see that Balbus' spells were fizzling, so I knew he was around. I got a glimpse of him and ran after. Without knowing he was being stalked he ran into the mountain were I lost sight of him for a short moment. Luckily he was close enough, so I casted burst of frost on him. I saw that he got hurt and ran around in search. On the very top of the mountain I found him and instantly attacked. With the aid of a fellow Gnome Necromancer, Baslbus was easily killed. The only problem was that he had nothing on him. He must have gotten killed only moments before. But I didn't really care about the loot, I was fighting for principle god damnit! So watch your back  and watch your friends.</font> <BR><BR>
Any good? I'll get up another one sometime.

<ul>I have been getting some mixed feelings about the PvP server. First I have been getting mail saying that newbie killing is running rampant. Groups are gathering and chasing down anything that comes out of the city. This makes it very hard for people to gain levels and fight back. Which makes people leave because they don't like being killed.<BR><BR>

As you can see, newbie killing is very good for the bubble boy. Perhaps the first five levels should be -PvP so that you can build a character that can defend himself. Tell me what you think.

<ul>Brad spoke a little about the PvP server.
<BR><BR><font color="FFD700" size="-1">Last night about 2am Brad logged onto the PvP server and delivered a few words of wisdom. First the looting situation apparently is a bug, as you should not be able to loot the entire contents of another player's body. Second thing he mentioned was that they are considering removing the experience loss entirely on the PvP server. <BR><BR>
I asked Brad about my changes posted below and how feasable it was to modify the combat algorithms for PvP. He said that I had presented some interesting ideas and they would consider making some changes to the combat algorithms, but that nothing would happen in the near future due to the intense release schedule they are working under. Hopefully this means in a few weeks we can expect some help for the PvP combat system! 
</font><BR><BR>

Removing the EXP. Loss is a great idea. I know people are going to get killed a lot, so with the exp. loss it might be impossible to get to level 50. Possibly just cut the loss in half? Source: <A href="http://dragon.everworld.net/">EverWorld</A>

Only thing diffrent was dodging the herd of punching gnomes at the entrance. My feelings at this point is the pvp server can be a success if we make it a success. The +-4 level limit is good, and if the guards would attack people that fought in town, it would be perfect.</font><BR><BR>

I haven't had time to try it today, so I guess I'll try it now.

<ul>If you actually got off EQ and dropped by, there is some good news for you. Today I revealed the project I have been working on. What it lacks in sections, it makes up for in pure content, baby. If you want to add something, or see there is a mistake, please tell me. Ah, it's good getting some content in here. Enjoy!

<ul>Over at the <a href="http://www.notcrazy.com">NC</a> they have an article about a different kind of PvP combat. Inq talks about the idea of having factions control your pvp experience.
