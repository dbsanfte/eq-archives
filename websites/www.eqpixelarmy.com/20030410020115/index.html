						<p>The EQ Pixel Army is approaching camp.  Our estimated time of arrival is in May.  Our mission:  to provide players of EverQuest with pixel portraits through the amazing Gnomish Ultra-High-Powered-Unique-Personification-And-Likeness-Compositional-Arraying-General-Use-Machine (the non-gnomish members of our army are trying to think of something less… well, gnomish, and shorter to call it!).  
						<p>Gnomish brains conceived it, and it took our army to bring it to life.  Using it, you will be able to create your very own pixel portrait, customized from armor to eye color!
