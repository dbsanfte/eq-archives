                <td><span class="postbody">Neilani’s Style Tutorial – Part 2 (The “I-Learned-the-Pen-Tool/Multiply Option” Volume)
<br />

<br />
First of all, let me precede this by saying… I AM NOT AN EXPERT!  I am just an average bear (and an English bachelorette, for goodness’ sake) who has messed around with Adobe Photoshop 7.0 until I found a method I like.  I have bastardized and experimented with other tutorials and tips I’ve found to try to shorten the work involved in creating my own bases.
<br />

<br />
I also assume that the reader is somewhat familiar with the basics of using PhotoShop, which may not be true!  If you need to know more about any of the techniques discussed here, speak up!  If I can’t help you, someone will. J
<br />

<br />
Step 1.
<br />

<br />
Find a photograph/picture that has a pose you would like for your doll.  It’s important at this point to consider where you ultimately want this doll to be positioned.  For instance, if it’s for a signature, you might want a sitting or kneeling pose, depending on how large you make your final doll, so that it doesn’t take up tons of space.  You can use all KINDS of things to come up with a base pose – pictures, paintings, screenshots, your own sketches… whatever you like!  I use photographs most often (though I have to get creative with non-humanoid figures), so that’s what I refer to throughout the tutorial.
<br />

<br />
Step 2.
<br />

<br />
Copy the photograph and paste it into a new document with a transparent background. It gives you the option to make it transparent when you choose a new document and generally constrains the canvas size to the image you have copied.
<br />

<br />
Step 2b.
<br />

<br />
The photograph may be locked from editing. Simple solution: Choose Layer >> New >> Background from Layer.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut2.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 3.
<br />

<br />
Assess the size of your picture. How big do you want it to actually be? If resizing needs to be done, do it now. There are steps you can take to do it later, but really, it’s a pain in the rear and involves redrawing lots of lines. I like to do it, but I’m a masochist.  I still find myself often choosing a size that’s a bit too big, or bit too small, so it’s really worth spending some time here to decide.  Remember also, that your canvas size is different from your image size if you like to give yourself extra room around the edges to work.  You can go back and trim your canvas size later without affecting the size of your image.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut3.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 4.
<br />

<br />
Make a background layer to sit behind the photograph. I use this layer from time to time to check my work against a white, black, bright, and pastel background as I go. I make all the pictures transparent gifs ultimately, so this layer will eventually be trashed.
<br />

<br />
Step 5.
<br />

<br />
Make a layer that sits above the photograph and title it “Outline.”  Formerly, I used the pencil tool and advocated making your pixels in a connecting/stair-step pattern, but I have since learned to use the pen tool and find it MUCH easier.  There are several links to GREAT pen tutorials on the Norrath’s Studio message board that helped me learn quickly.  Don’t waste time with cutting the figure out from the background. You’re not actually going to use that picture for anything but reference, so don’t kill yourself!
<br />

<br />
Step 6.
<br />
Make a new window for your document by choosing Window >> Document >> New Window.  This creates another window for your picture that you can move off to the side.  It stays actual size, and will allow you to see changes that you make on a zoomed in version without having to zoom in and out of your “working” document.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut6.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 7.
<br />

<br />
Decide which color is going to be your dark outline.  I generally choose a rusty brown color for my regular flesh-tone creations, but this is entirely up to you.  Sometimes, if the picture is particularly hard to see or is very close in tone to the color I’ve chosen for an outline, I will put a layer of semi-transparent color over the original photograph so that my new lines stand out much more.  It helps to reassess the dark outline color when you’ve got all your other layers done, and if you have it on its own layer with no other colors, it is EASY to go back and alter the color.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut5.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 8.
<br />

<br />
Zoom in on your “working” document to a size that you’re comfortable working with.  You’ll want to zoom in close enough to see all the small details, but not so close that you can’t see the forest for the trees.  The CTRL + + and CTRL + - shortcuts come in handy for this, but you want to be careful doing this because other combinations of the CTRL, SHIFT, and ALT keys are shortcuts, too, and can make changes to your document that you don’t want!
<br />

<br />
Step 9.
<br />

<br />
Bust out the pen tool.  Make sure that you have a one-pixel –pencil- selected and the color that you want to use for the outline selected before you select the pen tool.  Also be sure that you have your “Outline” layer active.  If you accidentally draw over another layer, it can be a real pain in the ass to fix.  Using the pen tool, create an outline for your picture.  You can do this all at once (if you’re that good with the pen tool, but I’m not!), or you can do it piece by piece.
<br />

<br />
Step 10.
<br />

<br />
Switch to the Paths tab where your layers are displayed.  There you can see the options at the bottom for Stroke Path with Brush and Delete Current Path, which are the only two you’ll be using.  Some programs have different settings for the tool that is used for stroking, so for the first segment of “path” that you make, go ahead and right click on the path, select “Stroke Path” from the drop down menu that appears, and make sure Pencil is selected from the new drop down menu that you see.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut8.gif" border="0" />
<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut9.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
This will “stroke” your path with the color you have selected, and from this point on, when you stroke a path, it will use the pencil tool, so you can just use the little button at the bottom of the Paths tab to stroke it.  When you see that your path is stroked the way you want it, go ahead and delete the current path (using the little trash can button), and move on to making the next segments of your outline the same way.
<br />

<br />
Tip:  It is, of course, possible to do this without using the pen tool.  I did my first several dolls without any knowledge of it at all.  It just requires a more steady hand and a more discerning eye.
<br />

<br />
Step 11.
<br />

<br />
When you’ve created all of your outlines (making sure not to forget all the little details like cleavage lines, lines between legs, etc.), switch back to your Layers tab and hide your photograph layer.  You probably won’t need to make the photograph visible again except maybe for adding shadows and highlights if you’re uncertain about where they should be placed.  You should see nothing but your white background with your colored outline sitting above it.  This will allow you to see and correct any sloppy spots in your outline.  You don’t have to use the pen tool all over again, just go in by hand and erase and redraw any pixels that are out of line.  You do want to be sure that each pixel is touching another pixel, even if it’s just corner to corner.  If you have gaps between pixels, it makes it much harder to use the bucket tool and other steps we’ll take later to quickly and easily create additional coloring to the doll.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut10.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Tip:  When erasing, be sure to do one of two things:  either use the square marquis tool to select the areas you want to correct, and then delete what’s inside the “marching ants” or have your Eraser tool set up with Pencil settings.  If you do it any other way, you’ll end up with “ghosts” or partial pixels that will show up and affect your later layers.
<br />

<br />
Tip 2:  I’ve found that when you have an “L” shaped arrangement of pixels, it looks cruddy and too squared-off, particularly when you’re talking about body outline.  If you can make a two-pixel arrangement on a corner area instead of a three-pixel corner, do it.  It will look better in the end.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut11.gif" border="0" />---<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut11b.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Tip3:  It’s very handy to use the Space Bar + Left Click shortcut to move around on your picture while it’s enlarged.  This makes a little “hand” that grabs and moves the visible area.
<br />

<br />
Step 12.
<br />

<br />
Now is a good time to resize your canvas, if you haven’t already.  You can see, at this point, how much actual space your doll will take up, and trim off the excess.
<br />

<br />
Step 13.
<br />

<br />
Once your outline is done to your satisfaction, create a new layer to sit just underneath your Outline layer, and title it “Skin Base.”  Making sure that you have your Outline layer active, use the magic wand tool to select all areas inside your outlines.  You can SHIFT + Left Click to add additional areas that might be separated by solid lines.
<br />

<br />
Step 14.
<br />

<br />
Switch to your new Skin Base layer.  Use the paint bucket tool to fill in the selected (“marching ants”) areas with a light flesh tone (or a light base tone for whatever skin color you’re using).  You might see that a few pixels here and there weren’t filled in with your base skin color, so just use the pencil tool to go in and put a pixel of color where it belongs.  This might also be a time when you notice mistakes that you made in your outline, so just switch back and forth, correcting your outline on the Outline layer, and adjusting the color as necessary on the Skin Base layer.
<br />

<br />
Step 15.
<br />

<br />
Here comes fun!  Make sure that your Outline layer is selected and make sure to select the color you used for the outline.  Choose Select >> Color Range and use the settings you see in my picture.  This will create a “marching ants” selection around your outline.
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut14.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 16.
<br />

<br />
Make a new layer titled “Medium Outline” to sit just below your Outline layer.  Make it the active layer and go to Select >> Modify >> Expand, and expand your selection by one pixel.  Choosing a color that is darker than your base skin, but considerably lighter than your outline, use the paint bucket tool to fill that area.  Oh my god!  It painted an area outside of the outline!  Don’t worry… we’ll fix that in a second. <img src="images/smiles/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif" border="0" />  
<br />

<br />
<img src="http://home1.gte.net/res0jcs6/tut15.gif" border="0" />
<br />

<br />
Step 17.
<br />

<br />
Go back to your Outline layer, making sure again to select the color you used for your outline.  Select the color range again to make the marching ants selection again.  Make another new layer titled “Light Outline” to sit just below your Medium Outline layer.  Make it the active layer and go to Select >> Modify >> Expand again, and expand the selection by two pixels.  Choose a color that is between your medium and base skin tones, and use the paint bucket tool to fill that area in with color.
<br />

<br />
Step 18.
<br />

<br />
Go back again to the Outline layer, and use the magic wand tool to select all the areas –outside- of your outline.  You can use Shift + Left Click again to get pesky areas like between legs, between arms and body, etc. selected.  Move down to your Medium Outline layer, hit delete, and move down to your Light Outline layer and hit delete.  You should end up with a clean outline, two layers of “inner shading,” and one layer of basic skin tone.
<br />

<br />
Step 19.
<br />

<br />
Now, for MORE fun!  Create a new layer to sit just below your Outline layer and title it “Shading.”  On the layers tab, change the Layer Properties to Multiply.  I don’t understand exactly how this works, but it’s better than the Burn tool for a lot of things!  This allows you to “paint” with a tone of gray and create shading that bleeds through all the layers.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
You’ll have to experiment to see which gray tone you should use to create the kind of shading you want, and it’s even helpful to use several different shades of gray to create darker/lighter shadows.  I find myself using an almost white-gray to create shading I like best.  I use the brush tool here instead of the pencil tool to create softer lines of shadow.  It’s also helpful to use the smudge tool to move areas of shading around, stretch them a little, or correct areas of dark that are maybe too big or too little.
<br />

<br />
The beauty of using the “Multiply” setting for this layer is that if you decide to change the color of your doll entirely, the shading will stay intact!  This is nice, especially if you realize that you made your outline too light, or your base skin color too dark when you think you’re finished with the doll!  It’s also nice to use the brush tool because it creates a range of darker/lighter pixels that would be a ridiculous PITA to do by hand, and especially to do OVER by hand. (This is coming from someone who used the “by hand” method and got just plain sick of it!)
<br />

<br />
Tip:  I found myself on more than one occasion getting pretty irritated because I had some stray pixels on the outside of my outline when I was finished with my doll.  Most times, I didn’t even SEE the errors until I was viewing my picture on the web. Usually, this layer was the culprit!  It’s hard to see the itty-bitty “ghost” pixels that get pushed outside of the outline on this layer.  There are two ways to fix it – either prevention or cure.
<br />

<br />
Before starting work on your Shading, you can go back to your Outline layer and select the areas inside the outline with the magic wand tool, then go back to the Shading layer.  This makes a “marching ants” border that you can’t accidentally push your pixels over.  You can also use the same technique that we used to clean up the Medium and Light Outline layers in Step 18.  I’ve been known to use either, depending on how forgetful I was that day!
<br />

<br />
Step 20.
<br />

<br />
Highlights!  Make a new layer that sits just –above- the Shading layer and title it “Highlights.”  Choose a color that is lighter than your base skin color and, using the brush tool, create small areas of highlights.  Again, it’s handy to use the smudge tool to push these pixels around (show ‘em who’s boss! :box  ).  The same prevention/correction methods work just as well for your work on this layer.
<br />

<br />
Tip:  If you’re unsteady about where to put shading/highlights, go down and make your photo visible.  Hide the Base Skin, Medium Outline, and Light Outline layers.  Ta da!  You can now add shading and highlights on their respective layers right over your view of the actual photograph!
<br />

<br />
…………….
<br />

<br />
At this point, your basic base is DONE!  Of course, you still need to add ears, hair and facial features, clothes, armor, weapons, etc, but that’s really cake once you’ve made it through making the base!  I use the same basic principles to make the clothing, but since you’re generally working with much smaller areas, it’s just as well to do a lot of the work we did on separate layers for the base on the same layer for the clothing.
<br />

<br />
I add the facial features, hair, and ears –above- the outline layer, since sometimes eyes or hair extend beyond and into the outline.  This might mean you have to make a few more corrections by hand if you change your base color, but really you’re only talking about 10-15 pixels worth of work on a small doll.
<br />

<br />
It is important to remember to keep any big parts separate from each other on different layers to aid in the trial/error correction process.  It is also advisable to save your base two ways, once as a layered file (so you can use it again to make new bases!), and again as a flattened file.  Throwing that Multiply layer into the mix when you’re adding clothing can complicate matters, since “Multiply” affects all layers underneath it.
<br />

<br />
Changing your colors.
<br />

<br />
If you realize that you screwed up, it’s handy to be familiar with the method for replacing colors.  Select the color that you wish to change.  This should be easy since we have only one color on each of the layers at this point.  Choose Image >> Adjustments >> Replace Color.  You can use the slider bars at the bottom of this window to adjust the color’s hue, saturation, and lightness/darkness.  It takes some experimentation to get the color just right sometimes, but you can actually see how the color changes affect your picture before confirming the change while you’re moving the slider bars.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Also, if you decide that you’ve made a darn decent human base, but you don’t want to go through the motions all over again to make a dark elf, you can cheat!  It doesn’t work well with some colors, but it does work sometimes!  You can make a layer just under your Shading layer and title it “Color Change.”  Unless the color you’re changing to is only subtly different from your original base color, you will either need to move your highlights layer down a few more layers or delete your highlights layer entirely – you’re just gonna have to do that one over, but it really shouldn’t be so hard to do.
<br />

<br />
The reason I like to keep the highlights area above the shading/color change layers is because it stands out little more in that position, as I tend to overlap my areas of highlight over shaded areas.  It really doesn’t affect your picture too much to have it sit lower, as long as it’s above your skin base, medium outline, and light outline layers.  You might have to make a few adjustments to your shading layer, but that’s just a simple trick of the eraser and smudge tools.
<br />

<br />
Using the magic wand tool and making your Outline layer the active layer, select the bits inside your outline.  Switch to the new “Color Change” layer, and using the paint bucket tool, fill it with a new color.  For instance, if you’re wanting an Erudite, fill it with a nice chocolate brown.  In the Layers tab, change the opacity of your layer until you can see the variance in the layers you’ve created below it – your medium and light outlines, and your base color.  You’ll need to change your Outline color, too, since it sits above all the other layers and won’t be affected by your “Color Change” layer.  Go back and add your highlights, once you’re satisfied with your new doll color.
<br />

<br />
If this doesn’t work, or doesn’t look right, just go to each layer (base skin, outline, medium outline, light outline) and adjust each color accordingly using the “Replace Color” technique.  It takes a little longer than the “cheat” method, but if it makes your doll look better in the end, it’s worth it!</span><span class="gensmall"></span></td>
