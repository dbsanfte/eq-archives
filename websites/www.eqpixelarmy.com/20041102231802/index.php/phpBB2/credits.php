<tr>	<td><p>Well folks, guess what?

<p>It looks like EQPA will be able to be hosted for a good long while thanks to your overwhelming response!  I sent out the plea for donations with just a small hope and no expectation, and your response was incredible!  I have sent a letter to everyone who donated (and please let me know if you donated and didn't get it!), but I want to be sure to say here again -- THANK YOU!

<p>Thank you all for your support, be it financial or otherwise.  Since the creation of EQPA and because of it, I have made wonderful friends, I have seen so many people decide to learn about pixel art and art in general, I have found how fiercely those who love us will defend us, and I can selfishly keep for myself the joy of having helped to make a few people happy!  EQPA was built to be enjoyed by everyone, and your continued enjoyment and support of this project is worth more than money can buy!

<p>Man, I gotta stop this... I'm getting all choked up!

<tr>	<td><p>Hey Everyone!

<p>EQPA has hit its 1-year anniversary, and we've almost hit the end of the line.  That's right -- our donation box is empty.  We're living on borrowed time right now, and it won't last long.

<p>If you enjoy or ever enjoyed EQPA, now is the time to let us know by helping out!

<p>We have so many registered members -- even a dollar from HALF of the forum visitors would keep us hosted for a long while!  We've appreciated all your support before, and we need you all more now than ever!  Tell your friends, your guildmates, your family, your coworkers --  Help keep EQPA alive so that we can continue to provide fun, free, pixel portraits for everyone!

<p><a href=https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr>Donate to EQ Pixel Army Today!</a>  It's quick and easy with PayPal.  Just click the link on our site at <a href=http://www.eqpixelarmy.com/donate.php>www.eqpixelarmy.com/donate.php</a> or make your PayPal donation to eqpadonations@hotmail.com.

<p>Thank you all for your time and help!

<p>Best wishes,

<tr>	<td><p>What a wild month it’s been! We blew through our allotted bandwidth in the first 4 days, but thanks to our generous supporters, we were able to move to a bigger, badder server that’ll hold us and all of ours. Never in a million years did the artists imagine our site would be THIS popular! Thank you all for your donations, support, and kind words. </p>
<p>We’ve gone from being a rag-tag bunch of pixel pushers to a site that was– get this!—featured in the June 21st Sydney Morning Herald: </p>
<p><img src="http://www.eqpixelarmy.com/images/newspics/smheqpa.jpg" border=0></p>
<p>Have you visited the <a href="http://www.eqpixelarmy.com/phpBB2">forums</a>? If not, get over there! We have tons of tips and tricks for manipulating your pixel portraits in various graphics programs, new and interesting creatures, armor, and weapons that are not available in the Gnomish Portrait Machine, and even some amazing things that other forum visitors have created! </p>
<p>If that’s not enough to lure you in, we are blowing the lids off two additions to the site: commissions and contests. Our first contest will be announced in the next few days, and the EQPA is now offering our services to our fans and friends in designing “expert”-made additions to your signatures. Visit the Commissions & Donations Corral on our boards to get more information about that, as well as to find information about the benefits of monetary contribution. We are continuing to maintain EQPA as a free-to-view site, so we still depend on our contributors for help with that hefty bandwidth bill. Donations have begun to decline, but we still have a bill to pay, so even a dollar will help keep us afloat. </p>	</td></tr></table><br><br>
