</FONT><HR>... release files for us to emulate our own servers instead of making Ashran do it? They could make it so you would still have to pay 10 dollars a month if you wanted to play on emulated servers, and when you logged into Everquest, there would be two server selection screens. One would be the Verant-hosted servers, the other would be the ones hosted by the players themselves. The second one would be a HalfLife-esque server selection screen, allowing for filters, and giving you the ping, stats, specs, etc. of the server. They would give the admins of the servers full control just like in Half-Life.<P>This would benefit Verant threefold. First of all, they would gain an entirely new clientelle. Most of the people from the Hackersquest board are ex-EQers who thought the game was a good idea that was poorly executed. And most of us wouldn't weep over 10 dollars a month if we could have a fully working emulator without having to worry about legal troubles, etc.  Most people who quit Everquest are the same way, they like the game, just not camping, Verant, exp. loss, or whatever. Verant would literally make almost twice as much money as they are making right now. <P>Second of all, many people would stop playing on the regular servers so they could play on emulated servers. This would still give Verant the same profit, BUT, it would take a huge load off of their servers. That means a number of things. Mainly, however, bandwidth. Bandwidth is not free, and since Verant hosts 20 servers that hold 4000 people each, their bandwidth bill is probably huge. So when half the people go onto player-run servers, that's a huge ease on their bandwidth bill.<P>Finally, they'd have satisfied customers. No longer would they have to deal with throngs of people bitching about how much they hate Verant or how you should n3rf th1s or make th1s more ub3r. The whiny people would move over the the emulator, but more importantly, they'd satisfy many of their loyal customers who have stuck with them since beta. Now I'm sure this last one means the least to Verant, but it's what means the most to us, the customer.<P>This would be a win-win situation for everyone, because Ashran wouldn't have to work on the emulator anymore unless he really wanted to, and he wouldn't have gallons of newbies asking him pointless questions about when the vaporware will be out. We, the people who want an emulator, will get what we have been waiting so long for, and it will be better than we have ever expected. Verant wins out because they end up getting more money. So everyone is happy. <P><p>[This message has been edited by Terminal Spirit Disease (edited 06-09-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

They answered crap about EQ being an ongoing project and expantions but never even talked about the server software idea.<P>Bottom line, they dont do it cuz they dont have to and with this all-time worst managed game that is EQ doing so well, they just dont care what ppl think since they obviously know what they are doing...<P>I tell you, its just like 1984 (the book).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>There is a problem for Verant though.  If they did use this kind of system, they would need some kind of authentication server much like Half-Life online uses the WON auth servers for online play.  This could be easily emulated, probably easier than writing an EQ emulator for the current system.  Some guy could just make an emulated auth server, and create his own server/player network, except without needing to pay Verant.  Even if the IP of the real auth server was hardcoded into the server program, it could still be hacked.  Is there some other way Verant could provide secure authentication of users?  It would be near impossible to make anything perfectly secure, and giving out the server program doesn't help much.  Plus, having players do what they actually want to do doesn't fit The Vision(TM)  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I don't really know too much about this entire server authentication business (and I don't like pretending I know about things that I really don't), but I think there would be a few ways to prevent this. First of all, to even reach the server select menu, you would have to log in to Everquest just as usual, and then I suppose there would just be another option on the server select screen that would let you pick player run servers.<P>If there was a way to bypass the login screen, people would have done that long ago. But, they don't, because then you wouldn't be able to play on your account, which would defeat the entire purpose.<P>Now, keep in mind it's almost 4 AM so I'm having trouble forming coherant thoughts.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Try and decipher what I said, and I'll think about it overnight and probably end up finding a flaw with it...<P>TSD</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>You could just create your own login server as well, which has already been done.  It may be possible to log in to Verant's servers using a modified version of this emulator's Login Server (though you would need either the source or l33t skills in assembly and too much time).  The problem we have currently is that we don't have an actual working world or zone server.  Under this kind of setup, Verant would be giving out the world and zone servers leaving the easiest emulated parts of the system as the only things needing to be created.<P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Releasing the files needed to run EQ servers would cause all kinds of problems and provide no real benefit to anybody.<P>The amount of processing power (and to a lesser extent bandwidth) required severely restricts the ability for people to run these servers.  As we all know, for each Verant world server there are multiple zone servers.  It's not like running a quake3 server, where you can throw several servers on one machine; you'd need several machines for one server.<P>Aside from the technical restrictions, it could be a customer service nightmare.  Each independant server would have to have several guides and GMs, which would have to have the powers of real guides and GMs - which means they could give people items, experience resses, etc.  Of course that leaves the door open to all sorts of cheating - the GMs at Verant are paid employees who have to watch out for their jobs, how do you keep volunteers straight?<P>The biggest reason this will never happen, however, is that there is absolutely no need for it.  EQ is a service, and every customer is paying 10 bucks a month for this service.  Verant has the resources to provide adequate servers, and they always will as long as people keep paying, so there are really no incentives to allow third party servers.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I think you missed the point Gore.  They want Verant to give the operator of the server the power to allow his players as much access to their exp/items as he wishes.  In other words i Log into Ashran's Server 001 and make myself an Uber 60 (A Verant newb class) and deck him out with some sweet and wierd stuff (you know, the stuff that hasn't dropped more then 3-4 times on VI's servers).<P>Why do you need to keep Volenteers straight and why do you need to have PR hell when the players can simply rez themselves, from 20 zones over, while killing Inno real quick.<P>Of course there would be people running a server for quests and stuff.<P>It is a valid point that there are zone servers, but if you compact it and run the zones all on one comp as long as your population didn't exceed 10-20 people your system might be able to handle it (bandwith in CS holds out...)<P>At worst maybe you only want to run a few zones...<P>We are a bit confused though, i can understand needing a full computer for a single zone when i log into Sebilis and see 50-100 people.  Just allow the host to restrict the number of people in the world.  Who cares about a character when you can make a new one.<P>Im done with this game, though.  Im on the AO beta 4, and minus the fact that they are stress testing it looks great.  Even with all the stress creating lag it runs as well on my computer in Beta as FagQuest runs now.  I can only imagine what that game will be like when it gets outa Beta.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>The incentives are all written in the first post.  Verant would have more customers because people wouldn't be restricted to playing only in Verant's Vision™.  It would add a LOT of replay value to the game to have many different servers running many different rulesets for the game.  If you're only running a server that can hold 60-80 or so players max, you wouldn't necessarily need multiple computers.  You don't have to run an entire EQ world, you could always just put up the zones that people actually want to play in.  The resources required to run an EQ server are not as high as many think.  If you have an 800 MHz computer with a nice connection you can have 100 people playing Half-Life on your server(s).  An EQ zone server would probably have higher requirements, but not by much.<P>As for customer service, it's not something that's absolutely required on a server.  If a server has bad service because it's player run, people could always play on a different server if they don't like it.  It doesn't matter if the customer service people are corrupt on a player run server because again, you could always go to a different one.<P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.<p>[This message has been edited by adenine!

</FONT><HR>I did a lot of research a little toying around with a packet sniffer and discovered that you wouldn't really need all too much bandwidth or processing power to run a decent... say... 100 user server. <P>First of all, lets look at bandwidth. I played with a packet sniffer on one of the live Everquest servers, and found out a number of things. First, you send/receive about 5 to 10 packets a second to and from the Everquest server. The packets average out to be about 70 bytes per packet, so thats 350 to 700 bytes a second. Now, that's just for one user, so lets pretend you are hosting 100 users.  That's 35,000 to 70,000 bytes a second, or 35k to 70k per second. That's about average for a cable modem/dsl user.  So bandwidth isn't really a problem until you start pushing 200 users. Then you're going to start getting lag.<P>Now, onto processing power. RAM isn't too big of an issue because these packets aren't going to stay in memory for very long, because 90% of the packets sent from the server (i assume) update the locations of the NPCs. Most of the stuff that stays in memory is client side. But, what we have to look at is disk latency and processor speed. Graphics tend to be more processing intensive, data tends to be more disk intensive.  Most of the packets sent from the server, from as much as I can tell, update the locations on the NPCs if they decide to move or what not. The rest of the packets come from spells, broadcasts, shouts, etc. etc. So most of the processing comes from keeping tabs on where the NPCs and the PCs are and sending that out ot all the players. But, that's more of a bandwidth issue, because your client computer is keeping track of all the locations of all the NPCs just as much as the server computer is, just the server is sending out the information to more people. The shouts and says and /oocs, etc. are not processor intensive at all, considering most of them are just little 50 byte packets of chat.<P>However, one thing you might want to look into is the disk latency. There's going to be a lot of data processing in terms of items and peoples characters, but that's not really a big issue either, because most hard drives have more than enough power to do the kind of work we're looking for. Unless you have one of those 1500 rpm hard drives that came out back in '94, I think you'd be set.<P>So what we're looking at is anywhere from a 500 mghz - 1 ghz processor to process all the information, and a DSL or Cable line for bandwidth, and you could support anywhere from 50 to 100 users. With a cable, it would probably be less during peak times because of shared bandwidth, but during non-peak times, you could quite possibly get more than a DSL user would get. Anyway, you could most definitely push 250 to 500 users with a T1 and a 1.3 ghz processor. And when we think about it, each zoneserver at Verant holds about 6 to 7 zones. The crowded zoneservers probably have somewhere around 250 to 500 people during peak times. (Of course the servers hosting Toxxulia Forest and Grobb probably aren't getting much action   <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> but that's besides the point). And Verants processors are no more revolutionary than the ones in our home computers, they just have the T1s to back them up with, and about 20 computers for each world server. <P>So, if Verant did decide to release the files, the hosting of the servers wouldn't really be a problem. Realistically, there's no way someone hosting a server off of a home computer is going to get more than 100 people on his server at the same time. The only servers that are going to have more than that are going to be super-dedicated servers that run off of peoples T1 lines from work, college, etc. <P>TSD<p>[This message has been edited by Terminal Spirit Disease (edited 06-11-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>And now Ladies and Gentleman the reason why they wont.  They will use all the excuses we have disproved, but it all comes down to money.  They would have to do some heavy coding and come up with a few good ideas (i feel dirty for using good ideas on a topic about Verant) to pull this off. There are a few valid points brought up in this topic.<P>How to keep people from multi-ing an account while allowing them live assistance.  When i think of this problem, i think of a system like Asheron's Call (god i hate that game).  Anyway, in this game you can get live assistance outside of game on their main page.<P>I would like to rant about something really fast.  For a short 5 minutes you could throw a Rune Sword into the Scabbard for the warrior epic and get your epic even if the scabbard was the only piece you had completed.  They removed that flaw minutes (litterally) after they realized how stupid they actually are.  My point is, how long have pathing problems been in game?  How long has Inno and 2nd floor mobs in hate been able to attack you through the ceiling?  Verant has a nasty habbit of removing flaws that aid players or labeling them as exploits while flaws that hinder players stay in game.  That, above all else, is why i quite the game...<P>So yes, Verant could do what we are saying.  Why wont they, because they dont want to.  I think that discussion would end with Verant saying that they don't want people to go onto another players server to explore zones and try strategies for their Uber mobs.  Zone exploration we already have.  If Verant closed a discussion about that, so too would a combat system be available soon, in my opinion.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000019&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>And yes i do realize that they would gain more money in the long run (at least they might).  It is a little bit of a gamble though (all a part of buisness).<P>All i know is Verant doesn't give a fuck about its players and their opinions.  It is my honest opinion that you will never see the discussed occur and you are free to disagree.<P>Maybe when their client base drops to a couple servers worth of people they might come around.

</FONT><HR>To make it even more juicy for Verant, they could have a 5 dollar surcharge to your account every month if you wanted to use the player run servers. With even half of the 370,000 people paying 5 dollar a month extra, not even counting the extra people that would sign up, that's almost an extra one million dollars per month. That's a fucking ton.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"> <P>I don't think money would be the issue.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>TSD</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>i seriously can't believe they would gain enough people by patching.  If they gained 10K accounts by the patch, and at least 300K people paid the extra $5 a month, it might be worth the extra coding and time.  I can't see it happening.  This is an older game that VI is trying to Bandain fix.  With so many new games coming out and with them already working on an expansion i can't see them devoting workers to a project like this.<P>I agree that it would be nice to see a project like this.  It might even bring me back at 15 a month to play.  If Verant didn't have bad team leads and if they didn't see the negatives outwieghing the positives why wouldn't they do it?<P>As for the player base growing, it will change and soon.  There are many MMOG's coming out that i would rather play over EQ.  We will see how this game holds out when there is actually a little competition with some good graphics. Like i said above though, Verant is trying to Patch over an aging engine...  Only time will tell how well EQ does.  Even UO's client base fell under.<P>I would like to add i may have actually played UO2, now im just disappointed.  I thought about sending VI a list of reasons why i quit but they would just ignore it anyway.<P>Also not sure where that statistic came (60% retension) but i think it is out to lunch. Even so if it is true, saying 60% of our customers remain signed up isn't something to be proud of.<P>As it stands everyone could quit EQ right now, and the company would survive (the game sure as hell wouldn't), but this game has made a few people very rich.  And here we are bitching about something that will never happen, while they are living it up.<P>It will all come down to the fact that Verant doesn't want its players to be able to practice fighting something.  Avatar of War despawns after an hour, leaving you with no time to play with him.  Well you and your guild could practice almost anything, and once perfected do it on the main server.  Not much of a reason either IMO, but hey.<P>It might also come down to the age of the server code.  It might just be too unoptimized for what we are talking about.<P>In the end who knows why VI wont do it, but they probably wont.  Maybe someone from Verant/Sony will read this and say wow these guys are right, we can make some money.  But EQ don't care about HQ, and they don't need any more money (they keep adding servers to play on which are large clusters so they obviously have no money problems).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I'll give you a hint about the real world. There's no such thing as 'enough money'. Companies can and will try and get as much money as possible. If this weren't the case, Microsoft would say, "Oh fuck it! We've got enough money. We don't NEED to put out new versions of Windows. If everyone stops using Windows, the program won't survive, but we will? Right! Oh yeah."<P>But as you can see, that's not the case. They keep putting out more versions so more people will buy, buy, buy, and so they can stuff their wallets even fatter than they are right now. Verant is the same way. They are going to do whatever is possible to get them more money, and this would bring in massive numbers of new clients, and if they added the surcharge, they would make 50% more profits than they are right now. If you know anything about the business world, you'll understand that something bringing in that much profit is a very worthy endeavor. =P<P>TSD</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002855.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Easy+way+out:+Why+doesn|APO|t+Verant...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

What im saying is in my opinion Verant doesn't see the gain in this work it.<P>Really what other reason would they have to not do this project.<P>And you lectured me as if i was a child.  Verant likly doesn't see the little gain in profits (i can't see them making as much more a month as you stated) worth the people gaining free range over their world on monsters within.<P>And i didn't expect you to answer my question, and Verant likely wont.<P>So Im for thinking that this topic is useless.  Im sure Verant has been told to do this numerous times, and if they are going to do it great.  They have made no indications otherwise.
