I must have surfed this board for a few hours after finding out about the EthernalQuest. I must have run in to every single problem there is on this board... oh lucky me =) . At anyrate, I felt really discouraged each wall I ran in to, but I never wanted to give up. I just don't want anyone else to feel the way I did. Soooo... this is what I want to do. I finally got my EthernalQuest to work (and very happy) and I just wanted to leave this post here for all you others to read to save some time surfing these boards...<P>Before I get in to the good stuff, I just wanted to say that the people at Hackers Quest have put together a great product =) . I believe that I have finally found the best zone trainer on the net. I can finally run around most zones at speed of sow, night vision, and fast swimming speed and not take damage from falling or drowning. The perfect tool for all you newbies out there =) .<P>**GOOD STUFF**<BR>To get started, download the EthernalQuest from this link.<BR>http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/downloads/ethernalquest/EthernalQuest.zip<P>Heres a good read me file that I wish had came with the zip files...<BR>http://alvec.hypermart.net/SIPandFAQ1.1.doc<P>Make an exact duplicate of your current Everquest directory. I named my new EQ directory EthernalQuest. I did some small clean up, get rid of a few opt files and what not... it says in the instructions somewhere. Oh and I hope you have a big hard drive... Each EQ directory takes up about 1GB. After you make this new directory, extract the EthernalQuest.zip to this EthernalQuest directory and overwrite all files.<P>I'm not sure why EmuLog was in its own zip file, but unzip that one and put it in the root EthernalQuest directory.<P>Great! Now you have your EmuLog to log in to your own server... So you click EmuLog... cannot find server...? DOH!<P>Change the IP.ini to your IP address... If you need help finding your IP address, click start, run, and type WINIPCFG and look at what your IP address is, copy that in to IP.ini =) .<P>Ok, now I get this funky error that says wrong version of EQ...? But I just clicked on the Everquest.exe and downloaded all the latest patches... whats wrong this time =( ?<P>Ok now you need to download a zip file that was custome made for this hack, EthernalQuest. This zip file has the eqmain exe and dll that you need to run EthernalQuest.<BR>http://alvec.hypermart.net/eqfiles.zip<P>Ok, now I get EmuLog to work, then I get to the disclaimer and click accept... BONG! A stupid error hits you on the head for 364 points of damage! Your EthernalQuest has been slain by a bad_error_001, LOADING PLEASE WAIT... no no, thats not the error I got... I'm just really bored hehe... I forgot what the error was... I think it was EQmain.dll or something, but I fixed it by getting a new txt file.<P>http://razk.netfirms.com/eqtext&zonefix.zip<P>Download that zip file and put the text file and the new zone server in your EthernalQuest directory. If your wondering why theres a new zone server in this zip files, tis because the zone server that comes with the original EthernalQuest.zip file seems to lock up while zoning in after creating a character.<P>Start your LoginServer, WorldServer, and ZoneServer executables then hit your EmuLog executable and let the fun begin =) .<P>OK! I got all my files, everything works great! Now I can get to the character creation screen and make a character and zone in to... South qeynos? How lame... How do I get to the other zones? (Conventional zoning does not work in this emulator) Well, its in the instructions somewhere, I forgot... but read it hehe...<P>SIPandFAQ1.1.doc section 3.3<BR>SYNTAX<BR>#zone qeynos2<P>Don't know how to zone?<BR>http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/002651.html<P>#goto x y z (coordinate values)<P>Got stuck in a room and cant get out?<BR>http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum6/HTML/000100.html<P>So lets say you wanted to check out Veeshan's Peaks. All you have to do is start EthernalQuest, make your character, then type the following...<P><BR>#zone veeshan<BR>/q<P>remake character<BR>#goto 40 1680 320<P>and from there you can explore part of Veeshan's Peak =)<P>Some other helpful things I like to do is...<BR>#summonitem 10400<BR>#summonitem 12260<BR>#summonitem 13015<P>and those items should help you a bit... Speaking of items, remember to download the latest database from http://www.ethernalquest.org/db/emuitems.cgi<P>I'm a student in college and a part time tutor so I like to help people when I finally figure things out =) . So if you ever have any questions, feel free to email me at DONTCALLMEI@yahoo.com ... hehe don't mind the name =P<P>Some other side notes to remember is that the developers of this game have not implimented all of the features of the real Everquest. I would say just use it for a zone trainer so you never get lost in your favorite dungeon ever again. Can't really do much else with the emu...<P>60 Dark Elf Enchantress<BR>Druzzil Ro</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Turbo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Give me credit for the files (the ZoneServer and eqtext.txt fix) damnit! :P</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">HawaiianCow</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">** copies and pastes **<P>Turbo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry =)<P>Turbo, I'm sorry I didn't give you credits... The best I could do was give links to the forum pages that I found them on. They didn't give you credits so I never would have known. The goal of my post was to asssit those EthernalQuest noobs who give up too soon to see the true beauty that you have helped create. If you recall, I pointed out at the top of my post, a few credits to Hackers Quest itself and no one in particular, assuming that each individual gave some sort of assistance at one point or another. Honestly there are too many names to remember, and Ashran is the only name that really comes to mind off the top of my head. I think it would not be enough for me to only give credit to single individuals. Although I think the credits are in the readme file =) .<BR>Again, I'm sorry Turbo. If it means anything, I want to thank you for uploading a copy of the old eqtext file and updating the zoneserver executable... I was beginning to wonder why they werent packaged... now I know... Thank you again Turbo =)<P>HawaiianCow<P>sorry for the double post, but the main reason I made my how to post was to answer all those questions that I see on this board... You must admit, most of them are addressing the same problems that have been answered time and again on this board... The sad part is most of these posters don't bother to search the board at all for any help. They just post their error assuming that some good citizen will post a reply remedy. Most of the posts asking for help have not been answered on this board =( I just want to share what I know...<BR>EthernalQuest is a good thing. I hope the developers manage to design a fully operational EverQuest emulator that they dream of.<P>HawaiianCow<P>sigh... 3rd post in a row... i love spam =P ... maybe next time I'll plan my apology posts much better instead of just spitting it out. Turbo, I noticed your name is even on the post that I made a link to...<BR>http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/002651.html<P>Really sorry, I never would have known it was you... honest.<P>** yes I was lazy with the copy paste, and I know i just made a big fat sloppy spam message on this board now =P ** but I really am sorry Turbo.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Turbo</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">no prob</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">TerbiumTitanium</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Dude.. well..

I'm hoping that this information can help some people out.<P>When I did my HowTo, I didn't copy the EverQuest directory like I said I did in this HowTo... I actually reinstalled all 3 of my EverQuest CD's (Original EverQuest, Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velius) all over again in to a new directory. Then I patched the directory with the everquest.exe to connect to verants update servers. Then I copied all of the EthernalQuest stuff in to the directory as explained above...<P>Unfortunately, now that Verant is launching Shadows of Luclin and has done a lot of strange patching, I'm not sure that patching with verant is a wise thing to do anymore. We shall see how things will go after the launch of Shadows of Luclin tomorrow...<P>HC<P>PS: couldnt they have chosen a better acronyme then SoL? lol!!!<p>[This message has been edited by HawaiianCow (edited 12-04-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">HawaiianCow</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">It seems that http://alvec.hypermart.net/ got the plug pulled out from under him.<P>[403] Error - Access Forbidden<P>I can email the files to anyone if they need them, but I would much rather someone put up a server and host these files...
