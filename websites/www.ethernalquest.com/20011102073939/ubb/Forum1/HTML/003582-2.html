</FONT><HR>People, people....<P>I've been through the gamut of science fiction movies, stories, and novels about time travel.  It's a fun idea, but let's think about what "time" really is.<P>Time is an arbitrary way that we measure entropy.  Entropy is the "running down" of the universe due to the distribution and transfer of energy from atom to atom, always losing some component to heat, which gets spread around (general law of thermodynamics; nothing is lost, just changed) until eventually the entire universe is a big stew a fraction of a degree above 0 Kelvin.<P>Time is not a plane or a dimension or a sense.  We don't "sense" time by looking at a clock, we measure change and decay through an arbitary standard of seconds, hours, days, etc.<P>You can't travel back in time.  10 o'clock last Thursday morning doesn't exist anymore.  We lived through it, it's gone, accept it.<P>Time as a plane or a dimension is an artificial construct that man has created to attempt to understand change and decay.  Instead of understanding it, he's merely found a way to measure the plodding metronome that accompanies us until our death.<P>KaL</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Actually, timedoes exist as a dimension, which means that it exists as a line, not a plane or a volume. So you are partially correct Kal.<P>Of course, the past no longer exists. But if we *did* go back to the past, then it would exixt, since the main thesis in the "no longer existing time" above was the *no longer*. That wasn't to clear. I'll try to clarify.<P>I am posting this at 12:36 CET on the 24th of September 01. At his point, 11:00 on the 24th of September 01 *does not exist*.<P>But if I were to reverse my passage through time and "go back" one hour 26 minutes to 11:00, then 11:00 would be there. <P>When discussing time travel, terms such as "no longer" and "now", "present", "future", "past", "then", etc, have no meaning. Therefore, you cannot say that "the past no longer exists". Only the present exists. Now, the past does not, but if we were to somehow return to it, it would be there.<P>That is like trying to say: "That place over there is not here". "The past is not the present". It is obvious, but if we were to go "there" it would be "here". If we were to go to "then" it would be "now".<P>Don't even get me started on timecones.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Assume for a moment that instead of being "3-dimensional" that you are only "2-dimensional" and that you are just a shape drawn on a piece of paper.  Ok, you'd be unable to "see" any other objects to your left, right or in front or behind you if they didn't "extend" into a dimension outside your perceived universe.  If those other objects had no "thickness" then they'd be imperceivable.<P>It's the same way with us 3-D folk.  If an object had no 4-d "thickness" it would be invisible (almost)...  If an object existed for only "one instant" then we'd be unable to see it since only maybe 1-2 photons MIGHT have made incident contact with it. Once you "saw" it, it would be in what you would call "the past" already.<P>You can feel it only because it existed in the not-too-distant past.  Because if it vanished NOW, even if you are / were holding it, you wouldn't know for a fraction of a second.  If the floor suddenly vanished, you wouldn't know for about 1/30th of a second (even though the light takes only a few nanoseconds).<P>But you can see it, feel it and see it's shadow ONLY because it EXISTED - not because it exists now.  There is no way to detect something that exists ONLY now (unless you have advanced warning that it will exist).<P>Each object that can interact with any other object has a length in that dimension.  Time is simply a dimension like any other.  In "width" you are merely measuring the distance between two points in an aspect of "space".<P>If time were not a dimension like space, then how would time itself also be stretched and distorted by the gravitational bending of space-time by massive objects (like the Earth, Sun, black-holes, etc...).  Or how would time also be distorted as is space during travel at relativistic speeds?<P>To say that objects are "in the past" is misleading.  They exist.  Because the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth in about 1620 or so doesn't mean they are not still there.  If I go there tomorrow, then I will not see them.  But to an observer 400 or so light years away, he'd just see them landing if he peered through a sufficiently strong telescope.<P>To someone 500 light years distant, none of those on the Mayflower were even born yet.<P>Every "event" exists forever, along it's "light-cone".  So you can see two events and I can see the same two events and both of us may disagree on which happened first, and both of us are correct.<P>No item or event that has ever existed will cease to truly exist until the "end" of it's existance reaches the end of the universe.  And that can't happen because the "news" would have to pass the "news" of the big-bang, which is headed away and has had a HUGE head start.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Time travel is no longer regarded as strictly science fiction. For years the concept of time travel has been the topic of science fiction novels and movies, and has been pondered by great scientists throughout history.  Einstein’s theories of general and special relativity can be used to actually prove that time travel is possible.  <P>Government research experiments have yielded experimental data that conclusively illustrate that fast moving aircraft have traveled into the future. This phenomenon is due to the principal of time dilation, which states that bodies moving at high velocities experience a time that ticks slower than the time measured at zero velocity. Not as much time elapses for a moving body as does for everything else.<P>Phenomena known as wormholes and closed timelike curves are possible means of time travel into the future and the past.  However, traveling into the past is a task which is much more difficult than traveling into the future. This feat has not yet been accomplished -to our knowledge- and its theory involves complicated scenarios of tears in four dimensional space-time, and traveling near the speed of light.<P>Obstacles which prevent our hubris attempts to cheat time include our inability to move even close to the speed of light, and finding a source of energy as powerful as an exploding star. Simply because the proposal of time travel is backed by scientific theory, is no reason to expect that it is easily achievable. Numerous arguments are proposed that that prevent time travel into the past. Both common sense and scientific fact can be used to paint scenarios that become serious obstacles. Not to fear, we have all the time in the world to overcome these minor limitations.<P>The proposal of time travel is backed by scientific theory, but that is not enough to make it realistically possible.<P>There you have it   <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/biggrin.gif"><p>[This message has been edited by anon04 (edited 09-24-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Oh, and an explanation on wormholes.<P>Wormholes are holes in the fabric of four dimensional space-time, that are connected, but which originate at different points in space and at different times. They provide a quick path between two different locations in space and time. This is the four dimensional equivalent of pinching two pieces of a folded sheet of paper together to make contact across the gap. Distortions in space cause the points separated by the gap to bulge out and connect. This forms a wormhole through which something could instantaneously travel to a far away place and time. No more problems of traveling in a rocket ship for years to get into the future!<P>This is essentially what was written about in "Alice in Wonderland’s Through the Looking Glass." Her looking glass was a wormhole that connected her home in Oxford, with wonderland. All she had to do was climb into her looking glass and she would emerge on the other side of forever.<P>In reality however, it would require a much more elaborate scheme to create a wormhole that connects two different points in space-time. First it would require the construction of two identical machines consisting of two huge parallel metal plates that are electrically charged with unbelievable amounts of energy. When the machines are placed in proximity of each other, the enormous amounts of energy -about that of an exploding star- would rip a hole in space-time and connect the two machines via a wormhole.<P>This is possible, and the beginnings of it have been illustrated in the lab by what is known as the Casimir Effect. The next task would be to place one of these machines on a craft that could travel at close to the speed of light. The craft would take one machine on a journey while it was still connected to the one on earth via the wormhole. Now, a simple step into the wormhole would transport you to a different place and a different time.<P>Wormholes and closed timelike loops appear to be the main ways that time travel into the past would be possible. The limitation on this time travel into the past is that it would be impossible to travel back to a time before the machine was originally created.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000046&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<P>Its true, time is just like any other dimention, but it extends in a different way. Picture those line above as borders rather than lines which have thickness. The lines extend horizontaly to create length, the space between them creates height, and as in a stack of paper sheets the lines extend into the distatance to create depth. The other dimention though, time, is created differently. When one unit of time passes, another sheet of paper is added on top of the rest creating the distance in time between one instant and the other. This will prove that future time travel is simply impossible because the lines on top of the one your on just dont exist, [i]yet[i]. Massive objects such as stated before, bend and tear the lines of the first three dimentions, but time its self can not be altered. Picture the sheets as rubber. When you place a bolling ball on top of one, it will push that line and the ones below it back into the past. The time will not change becasue the origen of the lines will always remain, but their presense will not. the heavier the bal, the more pressur will be exherted on the lines and the farther the gap will go. By being in the pressense of this massive object, you will also be pulled downward (to the past). The worm holes are the path that these massive objects took as they pushed farther against the lines of time. Not only do the lines of future not exist yet, but if they did no object is "light enough" to push the lines upward.<P><BR>edit: Didnt have enough lines.<p>[This message has been edited by Kerafyrm (edited 09-25-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000047&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Exactly. TImecones nd lightcones, the same thing with different names, is a very usefull tool when determining which event happened first where.<P>Imagine a time-space graph, with time plotted along the y-axis, and space plotted along the x-axis. A point, call it P, happes at one point. It has a co-ordinate in this system, since it MUST have a location in time and space. This event can be anything at all. Say that P(JFK is shot).<P>Then imagine lines issuing from this point. Since this is a time-distance (space = distance) graph, we can plot speeds as gradients. We plot two lines at the lowest possible gradient emminating from P, meeting at P. Since nothing can travel faster than light, the lowest possible gradient is the speed of light here.<P>Now, we have two cones, a "past" cone and a "future" cone. Nothing outside the "future" cone can be affected by the point P, since light from P has not reached that point yet. Likwise, nothing outside the "past" cone can influence P.<P>Now say that you plot a new point. Call it Q. It has the same location on the Y-axis, which means that it happens at the exact same time to a free-standing observer. This point also has a timecone. <P>Depending on where you are, P and Q can have happened at the same time, or P then Q, or Q then P.<P>So timetravel must be possible, in fact, must be happening, because otherwise everything would happen at the same time.<P>If you don't understand that, try actaully plotting it on a graph, and see what you get.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003582.cgi&ReplyNum=000048&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Quantum+Time+Travle+Paradoxes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Quantum time travel doesn't bring up paradox's in many theories as it doesn't effect your reality but parallel realities in which you in another alternate reality (parallel universe) als effects your reallity/universe.<P>For those interested Michael Criton just resently (within the last 2 years) wrote Time line.
