So I thought I'd do something a bit different.<P>Welcome "OmniAuction",  tried to make it side-nonspecific but Auctioneer as taken, and I wasn't feeling too creative at the time. If someone can come up with a better name I'm all for it.<P>The idea is to provide a chat interface driven auction system.  You offer an item for sale with a minimum bid and a closing time.  The bot will accept bids on the item and then notify people on closing of the auction.<P>I'm going to leave it running tonight while I sleep for FEEDBACK ONLY.  Half the functions aren't done yet, most notably bidding on items, searching items, and auction close.  It is not usable yet.  Anyone who is interested try "/tell omniauction help" for a list of commands.  Please leave feedback and suggestions though the comment command on the bot or on the boards here.<P>Again, the bot is NOT functional, any items placed for auction will be deleted before it goes live, along with all my test data. If you really feel like playing the "sell", "view", and "inspect" commands do work, but the time will flip when the auction closes.<P>I just want to get a feel from the community on what functions they would like before I waste time writing useless things.<P>Thanks for the feedback!<P>MKaath</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">DiL</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, some obvious functions would be, item search, outbid notification, "Buy Now" option<P><BR>If you could backend it with a good SQL database you could also make any info availible out of game via web page.  ala the deceased AOBay.com</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MKaath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Search is done now.<P>Features I have in the pipeline right now, these will be done before it goes live:<P><BR>Removing items:<BR> You'll be able to cancel an auction if there aren't any bidders.<P>Bidding:<BR> Minumum bid must be at least 5% greater  than previous bid.  You cannot bid on your own item.  Yes, you can still have your alts shill, not sure what to do about that.  If you think someone is doing it, leave a comment to me to investigate or leave a feedback message on that user.<P>Bid notification:<BR> Will allow you to place a watch on an auction and receive tells with the latest bid if you are online.  If you are the owner of the auction then you will see who the bidder is.<P>Auction closing status:<BR> My idea is once the item is exchanged both users flag the auction as completed or if you didn't receive the item or payment.  If people fail to complete too many auctions they will be barred from buying or selling.  <P>Things I am thinking about:<P>Item Value:<BR>  Right now it won't accept anything under QL50.  Mainly to keep people from filling it with trash.  I can also get the credit value as the game sees it, but that doesn't always give a good idea of the value.  Any ideas?  I suppose I can simply collect data as things sell.<P>Auto-bidding:<BR>  Similar to EBay, you bid the most you'll pay and the bot will automatically bid the minimum amount when the bid changes.<P>Channel spam:<BR>  If I can get a good idea of item value, I can have the bot send messages to the shopping channel as an auction is close to closing on a good item.  Will help add userbase as well as get people the best price.<P>Think that's about it for now.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Trinif</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">hey wanna know waht would be kinda cool? a program like that but on a webpage just like ebay. oh well like waht ur doing, good luck see ya in rubi-ka</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ReetBob</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">there are a couple web page auction sites like <A HREF="http://www.aoBay.com" TARGET=_blank>http://www.aoBay.com</A>  but no one ever looks there.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MKaath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yah, I've seen 'em, never used 'em.<P>That's why I'm doing the auction thing in th chat interface.<P>BTW, I'm working on it right now, so it's up and down, but it will respond to buffered tells when I test it out again<P>Bidding is working, just upgraded my friend list notifications so I can avoid spamming offline people. Now I can properly deal with auction completing and bid watching.<P>Hopefully look for some advertising spam on OT shopping in omni-1 by tonight.  Although I'm very worried about making the same mistake as Funcom and releasing something that's unusable and having the problem of getting people to use it after that...<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Former GM Zereliquis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey cool!

I hope they are, as it adds a good deal of enjoyment to people and reduces their coding.<P>If that's the case I'll release my Delphi AOChat component and an ActiveX so people don't have to dick around with the packet formats.  I've certainly been coding it in a nicely usable way oriented towards public release.  Dunno about releasing the actual bot code and database, but I probably could be convinced.  I certainly would if for some reason I stopped working on it.  Basically it's a pile of string parsing and database work, with the chat code it shouldn't take anyone more than a couple days to write. At least I don't need a UI, bleah!<P>Unfortunately if Funcom _doesn't_ like the idea then I'd be a bit more wary of making the chat interface more easily available.  I think OmniBot and my OmniAuction provide a quite useful service, regardless of Funcom's attitude, and would be hesitant to do anything that would endanger their existence.<P>MKaath</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">ReetBob</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">my experience with FUncom is that if you ask them, they will think about it for 3 weeks, then say no.<P>I asked them if it was ok to do the 50,000 ammo trick.<P>I want to make a bot for my guild to do stuff where you can say <P>/tell myguildbot when is the next meeting<P>and it will tell you<P>anyone have bot code I could borrow and develop?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MKaath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, I just sent FunCom an e-mail with the question, as well as what my beliefs about the subject are.<P>ReetBob, what's your e-mail address?

I'm going on vacation until the 5th of Jan and still have memory leaks from hell and no time at all to test every function.  After my pathetic beta test I'm in no mood to let code run for a week when I have no way of knowing how it's doing.<P>On the other hand, I'm still unemployed, and the girlfriend is away on work for a week. So it should definately be up by the second weekend in January. Probably only need a day or two to track down a memory leak here and there and test all the features, so more likely Jan 11th or so.<P>Update from FunCom.  To be "110% Sure" BlueOffset wanted to take a peek at my code.  Been sending it everywhere else, so I sent him my usual ZIP of my AOChat component.
