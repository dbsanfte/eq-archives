Well, can you see if it is?" <P>"No." <P>"Even if you maybe put your knee on something and lean way over?" <P>"Oh, it's not because I don't have the right angle-it's because it's dark." <P>"Dark?" <P>"Yes-the office light is off, and the only light I have is coming in from the window." <P>"Well, turn on the office light then." <P>"I can't." <P>"No?

A minute later, in full view, they were both eaten by a killer whale. <P>Man Dies in Sleep killed by his own farts.<BR>A terrible  diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no mark on his body but an autopsy showed large amounts of methane gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep from breathing the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed. Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't have been fatal, but the man was shut up in his near airtight bedroom. According to the article, "He was a big man with a huge capacity for creating 'this deadly gas.'" Three of the rescuers got sick and one was hospitalized. <P>Redneck Games: A fellow intent upon killing a raccoon manages to launch himself via a fireball out of a drainage pipe. <BR>In rural Carbon County, PA, a group of men were drinking beer and discharging firearms from the rear deck of a  home owned by Irving Michaels, age 27. The men were firing at a raccoon that was wandering by, but the beer apparently impaired their aim and, despite of the estimated 35 shots the group fired, the animal escaped into a 3 foot diameter drainage pipe some 100 feet away from Mr. Michaels' deck. <BR>Determined to terminate the animal, Mr. Michaels retrieved a can of gasoline and poured some down the pipe, intending to smoke the animal out. After several unsuccessful attempts to ignite the fuel, Michaels emptied the entire 5 gallon fuel can down the pipe and tried to ignite it again, to no avail. Not one to admit defeat by wildlife, the determined Mr. Michaels proceeded to slide feet-first approximately 15 feet down the sloping pipe to toss the match. <P>The subsequent rapidly expanding fireball propelled Mr. Michaels back the way he had come, though at a much higher rate of speed. He exited the angled pipe "like a Polaris missile leaves a submarine," according to witness Joseph McFadden, 31. Mr. Michaels was launched directly over his own home, right over the heads of his astonished friends, onto his front lawn. In all, he traveled over 200 feet through the air. "There was a Doppler Effect to his scream as he flew over us," McFadden reported, "Followed by a loud thud." <P>Amazingly, he suffered only minor injuries. "It was actually pretty cool," Michaels said, "Like when they shoot someone out of a cannon at the circus. I'd do it again if I was sure I wouldn't get hurt." <P>This is just plain stupid:<BR>Australian programmers added armed kangaroos to a military defense simulation program. <BR>Mutant Marsupials Take Up Arms Against Australian Air Force <BR>The reuse of some object-oriented code has caused tactical headaches for  Australia's armed forces. As virtual reality simulators assume larger roles in helicopter combat training , programmers have gone to great lengths to increase the realism of the their scenarios, including detailed landscapes and -- in the case of the Northern Territory's Operation Phoenix -- herds of kangaroos (since groups of disturbed animals might well give away a helicopters position). <P>The head of the Defense Science and Technology Organization's Land Operations/Simulations division reportedly instructed developers to model the local marsupials' movements and reaction to helicopters. <P>Being efficient programmers, they just re-appropriated some code originally used to model infantry detachments reactions under the same stimuli, changed the mapped icon from a soldier to a kangaroo, and increased the figures' speed of movement. <P>Eager to demonstrate their flying skills for some visiting American pilots, the hotshot Aussies "buzzed" the virtual kangaroos in low flight during a simulation. The kangaroos scattered, as predicted, and the Americans nodded appreciatively . . . and then did a double-take as the kangaroos reappeared from behind a hill and launched a barrage of stinger missiles at the hapless helicopter. (Apparently the programmers had forgotten the remove "that" part of the infantry coding). <P>The lesson? Objects are defined with certain attributes, and any new object defined in terms of the old one inherits all the attributes. The embarrassed programmers had learned to be careful when reusing object-oriented code, and the Yanks left with the utmost respect for the Australian wildlife. <P>Simulator supervisors report that pilots from that point onwards have strictly avoided kangaroos, just as they were meant to. <P> <P><p>[This message has been edited by Fire (edited 04-03-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Quest4reality</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">while reading this one site comes to mind......... www.lotsofjokes.com...... uuuuuuh</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">~KPR~</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">thats not funny this is:<BR>http://users.netonecom.net/~marc/audio/armageddon.wav</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
