</FONT><HR>Reading this thread is quite humorous for me, a lurker here. Smed's post seemed to me to be real without the email confirmation. Why? Though it's rather short, it's very direct and to the point. Even if this isn't the real thing (which future posts seem to imply it is), it matches his communication style.<P>Now, for some of what I find humorous:<BR>Vamp - I doubt this is the real Smed. Did you know it is very illegal to impersonate someone over the internet?<P>And what law would that be Vamp?<P>Tux Racer - I'm wondering why your e-mail address isn't @station.sony.com like the others. Nice try pal.<P>Tux, perhaps you're a tad new to this game. The game was produced by 989 Studios, which one way or another became Verant Interactive, which was purchased by Sony. The verant.com email address is what was in place prior to station.sony.com and, though I thought it was replaced completely, logic dictates that both addresses work to get to the same place. Nice try pal.<P>Orboe_Lowblow - [useless explitives defining the lack of communication skills removed]. I suggest you leave here Hitler, and take your Verant bullshit with you, there are other ways to deal with this, then banning people, then making the tech support number A TOLL CHARGE, and you cannot cancel your account using eq.exe because when you try it just says your account has been banned, go to hell you bastard and get a life, THANK GOD my eq addiction is over!<P>Orboe, you flame him for banning cheaters? Clearly you think that instead, he/they should just fix things to make it unhackable. On the assumption that you yourself are not just a leach using others hacks to cheat with, the only reason you would want them to make the game "unhackable" is to provide you further challenge to hack it. Of course, we both know that you can't hack your way out of a glass box given a sledge hammer, so that point is moot. Verant wants the game to be unhackable so that all can be playing the same game. Why do they ban those that cheat? Those that cheat make Verant spend money to fix the problem. This money could rather be spent on new content, like Shadows of Luclin and whatever might come next, if it wasn't a higher priority to stop cheating from happening. Personally, I know you don't care about that so don't waste bandwidth telling me.<P>Phantal - paraphrased: log hacks, who cares. Make it work in a window.<P>Here here! Rock on bro.<P>Another One Banned 2 - LOLROFLMAO Its not hacking you idiot! Its MY memory fool. Go away idot F***r.<P>It's hacking your memory, fool. More importantly it's altering how your game plays when connected to THEIR server, something you agree to not do each time you start the game. Finally, Assuming "F***r" can be reasonably interpreted to "Fuckr", you're missing an e. Stop hacking your memory so much and these things might not happen.<P>Valorum - Smedley.. I know your tellin the truth, and I know its you, but I just hope you did it 100% legally cause with so many people being banned, especially with the programming genious's on this board, they're going to pick it all appart.<P>It isn't difficult to put in checks for what a client is doing, at the server side. In fact, by putting something in the client side (which would be needed to put something that invaded your privacy in), that could be hacked to be turned off. Give Verant more credit than that  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"><P>Bio_War - paraphrased "bet only non-uber-guilds got banned, but i might be wrong"<P>I know you admitted to being wrong, just 2 posts later... but why talk out of your ass in the first place? Trying to get the # posts counter to increase for yourself?<P>Adioman - Why don't someone just ask em how they did it? They gotta tell us right? If it's legal then they have nothing to worry about.<P>They don't have to tell you anything about how they did it. They can ban someone for any reason they choose, including not liking the color of armor they place on their character. If you think your privacy has been invaded by this american company, use american law. Prove them guilty, because they're presumed innocent until you do.<P>Valorum - Whats the big advantage of running a little faster? <P>If there's no benefit, why does the AC get KS'd so much? You later ask why it warrents banning. The answer is really simple: it's cheating. More importantly, anyone who cheated to increase their speed KNEW they would get banned if caught. Many simply didn't think they could get caught. To those banned over it... get over this. You tried, you lost. End of story.<P>Dor! - you know in the first place you aren't susposed to hack, so why bother? they tell you you will be banned, you accpect that you will not hack when you enter EQ, and as you said they make the rules...<P>In a different thread, Dor! posts something akin to "If you don't like that people cheat here, play somewhere else".<P>Dor, I can't figure out what side of the fence you're on. Personally, I would prefer people not cheat, and I'm glad Verant takes steps to actively discourage it. I also recognize the joy of hacking something like this as well as the sense of accomplishment. I would prefer those who did this (I know they're not going to be stopped; trying to stop them only makes it more rewarding) had a place they could maturely enjoy their challenge without the massive number of leaches that exist out here -- most of the leaches are recognizable in how they choose their wording (fuck you blah blah my kewl sp34k skillz r better then urs).<P>il128 - LOL! If you're so good at catching "cheaters" why bother with the threats? Oh, because you suck ass at catching cheaters...<P>Verant is still running a business. Every $10/month they ban is that much less profit and it adds up. More importantly, the time spent to catch someone cheating is time they can't put to more useful purpose. If he can come online and pursued 10% of the people cheating to stop, his 5 minute post saved quite a lot of paperwork in the long run. If you want to cheat, go ahead and cheat. Maybe he'll catch you and maybe he wont. I'll even say... probably he wont since there's so many of you to try to catch... but he'll catch some of you, and it seems there is no first offence slap on the wrist. Spin the wheel and take your chances.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003287.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Hackers+are+not+welcome">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>il128:<BR>&gt;&gt;Verant is still running a business. Every $10/month they ban is that much less profit and it adds up. More importantly, the time spent to catch someone cheating is time they can't put to more useful purpose.&lt;<BR>&gt;Like what telling someone "Sorry, I can't help you."?<P>Actually I was thinking like fix the pathing errors and broken quests people are fond of saying they should do.<P>&gt;&gt;If he can come online and pursued 10% of the people cheating to stop, his 5 minute post saved quite a lot of paperwork in the long run.&lt;<P>&gt;People who cheat with third party programs can not be "pursueded".<BR>&gt;Banning is all done electronicly and takes all of five minutes to permaban someone. Guides have little else to do and they do it at no cost to SOE.<P>Guides don't ban people. Guides are rarely able to even catch someone cheating with 3rd party tools unless they happen to see you race by them faster than they can move themselves. At that, all they can really do is say "Hey, GM, this is messed up, check it out". A guide is someone who sits at home with the same client you have, the difference is they have a flag that tirns on the commands like /zone, without a hack.<P><BR>&gt;&gt;If you want to cheat, go ahead and cheat.&lt;<P>&gt;I wouldn't call what I do cheating. I just look at things and learn from them. I don't really feel any need to alter my avatar.<P>Based on this, you also don't fit the profile of most of the people here. You are truely a hacker rather than someone leaching off the work of others. As I said earlier, while I would prefer you didn't do this, I accept that you will, and I accept that efforts Verant takes to prevent it only give you more of a challenge - and more motivation to "play" in this manner.<P>&gt;&gt;Maybe he'll catch you and maybe he wont.&lt;<P>&gt;They won't.<P>&gt;&gt;I'll even say... probably he wont since there's so many of you to try to catch... but he'll catch some of you, and it seems there is no first offence slap on the wrist. Spin the wheel and take your chances.&lt;<P>&gt;I don't take chances, I take well reasoned risks.<P>Risks are chances, no matter how much you try to stack the odds in your favor. Consider the game of blackjack at a casino. The average player wins some hands, loses others, and typically leaves the table without having won or lost a lot of money (gambling problems aside). The card counter is able to increase his odds of winning through proper betting strategy and a heightened awareness of momentary probability of a hand being in his favor.<P>In the game of hacking the computer system of someone looking for that kind of activity, you seem to think your well reasoned risks (aka card counting, in my analogy) immunize you. They will possibly make it harder for you to get caught but over time, you'll find it only takes a single lost "hand" to have the game come to a close.<P>You say you don't use hacks to alter your avatar. I guess I don't have the vision to understand what else you might be changing. I would imagine though that if you're not altering anything about your avatar, that you're correct in thinking you won't get caught.<P>I mean no sarcasm when I say I hope you're enjoying yourself as you hack and discover what you can do. Though not in many years, I've been there myself and understand the sense of accomplishment it brings. Don't get caught.<P><BR>NYGenXer: Sorry to burst your bubble. I'm not Tellaron. I've posted here under a different (long-forgotton password) name perhaps 2 times, but not within the past 9 months minimum. I'm noone you know unless perhaps we've crossed paths on the same server before, and since I prefer to remain anonymous, we won't get much of a chance to find out.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003287.cgi&ReplyNum=000054&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Hackers+are+not+welcome">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

I doubt it means much if someone just insults him on some hackers board.  Just tank him for the warning and be done with it all insulting someone does is make yourself look the fool. Cause i will laugh when your post is the next that says /sigh i was banned.  Besides this board back when was meant for one purpose and that was ShowEQ.  Which the have a stance on.

I even knew the exact moment you first started checking the /zone hack! It seems you have a little leak. Oh and congrats on the 3 of my customers that were banned who decided not to listen to me! On another note we can battle this out forever but it was fun while it lasted and I have been more than compinsated for the monitary value of the game and monthly play but now you may have forced me to quit playing but it was an enjoyable experiance to rape your little perfect world and make no mistake I will make it public knowledge how to use hex hacks on EQ the way I see it if you bann everyone who the hell will be left to play?

</FONT><HR>What is this? I am so confused by this thread.<P>For as long as I have played EQ, I have seen one constant in the efforts of Verant. Make every efforts to make the game as SLOW as possible. Every patch has made this game more and more like a stupid, boring card game (to me of course. Many people love to play games like cards and chess, but obviously I dont.)<P>Verant has ignored or denied everyone that has ever asked for anything to speed up or make the game more "fun" (fun as in action movie or something, even tough some people find it "fun" to collect stamps).<P>Now, this seems to me like they were saying, "If you dont like it, cancel your account" all along. Of course, they would never say that directly, as every 10$ they can get counts.<P>There is nothing wrong with that. They have no obligations to make us happy. If they want make a game for a very specific type of player, they can. Screw the rest. Our entertainment is not their problem.<P>But why come back here and make threats to discourage people from "making the game work the way THEY like" (yes, cheating). Is it because he cares about us and just hates it when someone gets banned. Well if that were the case, I would assume that they would have cared hard enough to convert one of their server to cater this part of their player base (one server might not be enough tough as many people find the game to slow but dont want/know how to cheat). Hell, people are hacking, actualy hacking the game, paying hundreds of dollars on E-Bay and even making (or trying to make) an EQ server emulator and they still dont want to give us a "fun" game (our brand of "fun").<P>No, the game is all about what they think is fun, they certanly dont care about my tasts, they showed me that. So if they dont care, why did he start this tread to try and discourage further cheats. Its not like its hard to ban someone. Hell, 150+ and it must have taken no more than 30 minutes. Why not ban people who dont play your way and heve your server free of thopse kind of people in no time. It looks so easy to ban.<P>Ha, its so obvious. The reason he doesnt want to ban people is because of the money. Your 10$ a month.<P>So Verant says : "This is OUR game. WE say what goes. If you dont like it, SCREW YOU. Its still OUR game and we will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way. Stop trying to turn it into your kind of game. Just shut up and give us 10$ a month like the good little sheep you are and WE will be happy".<P>Now excuse me for analysing his post, but I am so insulted by this peice of crap I cant help it. I dont know if he made this post on his own initiative or if he was "just following orders" and I dont care. This is an insult and he does not deserve any respect for brigning it here.<p>[This message has been edited by ElBigmac (edited 07-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003287.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Hackers+are+not+welcome">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

I have however used SEQ, for a couple of simple reasons:<P>1) It's a more convenient navigation tool than /loc and a printed map.<P>2) I don't have to bug the druids / rangers in the zone so much when I'm trying to get something rare to spawn.<P>If I had to stop using SEQ I would definitely leave the game.  Point number 2 I could live with, but not point 1.  If EQ had some kind of in-game map I wouldn't need SEQ.  I mean, come on, even some text-based muds have maps!<P>The major problem I see with EQ is that they are making downtime the primary investment that you as a player are putting into your character!<P>I realized the other day when I saw some monk with a RotLC, this isn't a particulary brave or mighty monk - it's a monk that:<P>1) Sat around in S Karana for days shouting '100pp to whoever spots Qwinn'.<P>2) Sat around in L Guk for over 100 hours waiting for Raster to spawn.<P>3) Sat around in Sol B for 20 hours waiting the the Rock guy to spawn.<P>Most of the cheats / hacks are just ways people are trying to reduce downtime.  This is really a game problem, not a player problem!  Some people find other solutions to this problem;<P>1) Read books in your downtime.<P>2) Get two computers and switch back and forth, so you play one character while the other one is medding/healing and vice versa.<P>-M<p>[This message has been edited by Schlegnir (edited 07-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003287.cgi&ReplyNum=000077&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Hackers+are+not+welcome">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Here's my problem with that. You're a hypocrite by all meanings of the word. You talk about how hacks are bad and cheating is bad, yet you use ShowEQ. ShowEQ is a CHEAT program. IT IS CHEATING. Just like Speed Hacks. Just like Offset Hacking. You can make up a reason to justify using each and every form of cheat, but the fact of the matter is, you're still cheating. So don't patronize us with your holier-than-thou "I don't use hacks but I do use ShowEQ".

I even knew the exact moment you first started checking the /zone hack! It seems you have a little leak. Oh and congrats on the 3 of my customers that were banned who decided not to listen to me! On another note we can battle this out forever but it was fun while it lasted and I have been more than compinsated for the monitary value of the game and monthly play but now you may have forced me to quit playing but it was an enjoyable experiance to rape your little perfect world and make no mistake I will make it public knowledge how to use hex hacks on EQ the way I see it if you bann everyone who the hell will be left to play? Sound like the end of the world yet?<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Crackerware&gt;&gt;&gt;<BR>END QUOTE**<P>   Oh goddess, protect me from ignorant ass fools! As much as I like to mess with Trollaron, at least I can tolerate him.

</FONT><HR>Heh, what a nice opportunity.  I get to write a nice message here and JS is guaranteed to read it.<P>I don't use any of the hacks because...I like my account.  Not because of some moral dilemma, mind you, this is purely a fear of punishment.  I know you guys can track hack users if you really put your mind to it, so why take a chance with characters I've been playing with for two years, right?<P>I am however an avid SEQ user.  Barring self revealing actions in-game, I am 100% sure you could not detect SEQ unless you attacked and broke into my LAN.<P>I first heard about SEQ about a year ago.  I didn't pay it much attention, with the WinSEQ version out the window and me not having any unix boxes on my LAN.<P>This changed when I got myself a used laptop and threw Mandrake on it.  Following the instructions found on these very forums I had SEQ up and running in an hour.  Now I was ready to "cheat".<P>Let me digress for a moment and mention that I've been playing online games for a long time now.  I was (and still am) an avid Quake player, Tribes, Starcraft, what have you.  A lot of these (if not most) games have cheats available to them, from aimbots and see-through walls to unlimited resource hacks and character manipulation (Diablo).  I was never compelled to use these cheats.  If I logged onto a game of Quake and saw someone shooting rockets out of their ass, I would find a different server.  If I thought someone was cheating in any of the online games I played, I would quit that game and find another with honest players. <P>This brings me back to EQ.  Never for a moment did I hesitate when offered a chance to use SEQ.  Instead I leapt into it with joy.  What makes EQ different from all the other games I played?<P>It's the persistance.<P>I log on to my server, and there are about 2000 peeps playing.  These are the same people I see day after day.  Every time I log on I see MageX and WarriorY and RogueZ doing their thing.  Due to the nature of the game, being so item-centric and all, I am competing for a scarce resource (items) with the same people day after day.<P>Now, I know that a certain number of people have SEQ on my server.  Pulling numbers out of my ass, I will assume that about 100-200 of the 2000 people out there are running it. This means that every time I head over to camp some item there is a small chance that someone with SEQ is going after the same thing I am.  You know very well who has the advantage here.<P>My dilemma now is this:  I can leave things as they are and resign myself to the fact that some people out there are going to have an advantage over me, or I can join the minority SEQ-using population.<P>Tell me John, what would YOU do, being an ordinary player?<P>It seems to me that Verant is responsible <BR>for SEQ.  There is a famous quote somewhere out there about not leaving anything on the client because the client is in the hands of the enemy.  Unfortunately Verant decided to do just that, and as a result there is a whole host of information flowing through the client which is just asking to be sniffed and decoded.  <P>I am not concerned with the reasons why Verant chose that route.  I am only concerned with the practical effect, which is that a small percentage of EQ players are privvy to ALL the data in the client, whereas the rest get a fraction.<P>Again, I am not concerned with the technical aspects of this.  I really don't care what kind of hoops Verant would have to jump through in order to "fix" SEQ.  All I am concerned about is that Verant has known about SEQ for a long while and had decided to do nothing about it (well the unix version anyway heh).  Apparently Verant figures the proportion of SEQ users is too small (or at least that is the perception of the general playing population, which is pretty much all Verant cares about) to warrant any action.  <P>Thus Verant itself has given us a two-tiered system of playing EQ.  You can play EQ, or you can play EnhancedEQ.  It all depends on your own resources (unix box and a LAN) and persistance.<P>You can throw ethics and morals at me until you are blue in the face.  Tell me I am "cheating" the non-SEQ enabled players.  Tell me that I have an "unfair" advantage. <BR>My response is that the onus is on you, Verant.  You have consciously and deliberately given us a game which rewards people who sniff your client data and you have done NOTHING about it.  For years.<P>Through your inaction you have allowed a small minority of people to get an "advantage" over others AND you allow this to continue.  In essence you are screwing over people who do not have SEQ by not releasing a client which has SEQ functionality, knowing full well that there exist many many others who already have that advantage.<P>If you do not want to release a client which competes with SEQ, and you obviously do not want to allocate resources to 'fixing' the problem (I'll believe it when I see it thank you), then the status quo will continue.<P>Your continual unwillingness to deal with the problem suggests acquiescence on your part.<P>In summary: I use SEQ only because I perceive a large number of others do too.  You are either "in" or you are "out", and I want to be "in".  Verant can eliminate the "in", but they don't.  I have no choice.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003287.cgi&ReplyNum=000084&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Hackers+are+not+welcome">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
