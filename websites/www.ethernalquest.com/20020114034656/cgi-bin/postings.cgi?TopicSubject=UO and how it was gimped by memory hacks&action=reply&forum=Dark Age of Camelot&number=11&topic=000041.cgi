Anyway, down to the nitty gritty.  People started using memory hacks on UO that changed client side information and made them gods...the reason a lot of this stuff was client side was to cut down on lag...well guess what..to "fix" what people had discovered about client side editing they made it server side..When I first started playing UO on my 57k there was NO lag...once i came back with my cable modem..it was unbeleivable how much lag had been ADDed..So this, my friends, is how UO was gimped to hell and back from hax0rz.<P>--Gremio</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jerry</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The idea that UO's servers output enough data to 50,000 clients to cause lag even on a cable modem is beyond ludicrous.<P>If there's lag, it's at a server bottleneck, either CPU or bandwidth.  Your connection is speed is irrelevant.<P>And don't blame the hackers for forcing them to move things serverside any more than bank thieves are to blame for bank vaults.  It's the way things have to be.  Security is always necessary even in a civilized society, has always been, will always be.  That UO had to learn this lesson by being burned was unfortunate, but very, very inevitable.<P>If you really want to blame someone, blame those who decided to create a MMORPG based around an outdated engine  that was initially designed for single player use.<P>If they had rebuilt from the ground up, they would have had far fewer problems.<P> </FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gremio</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Unrelated replies, and why they suck:<P>Yes...your connection and the routers it goes through is a big part of wether you have lag or not..Me stating that i had a 57k and no lag before and a cable now *and better comp* and 10X the lag now was just verifying that it wasn't me causing the lag..and something had happened from one/or more of the updates done by OSI...<P>Anyway.."Outdated engine"....excuse me, but as far as I know UO was one of the FIRST MMORPGs and the best to date *before it got screwed over*..their servers have a LOT more information they have to store and constantly transmit now due to the offsets and addresses people found before.  It is every bit the peoples fault that abused their power.  Matter of fact if UO could come up with a solid method of making it so you couldn't alt+tab out or have it in a window, or really protect it from changing the offsets or whatever..and made all the stuff client side again the engine would still be rock solid...nothing is wrong with the "engine" when you have to constantly send that information out to EVERYONE it causes lag...and it's the hax0rs faults...I'm not mad or anything..i'm not flaming anyone..i'm just saying be a man and accept the blame..<P>P.S. i wasn't even saying that until you replied with your biased opinions.<P>--Gremio</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Froggy</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I just logged on to UO the other day to help a friend, and I had absolutely no lag. There was a point, back before UO hacking was rampant, when I would have horrible latency problems. Does my experience disprove your theory?<P>The only real lag causing feature of UO is the fact that every step that you take is verified by the server, and this has always been the case.<P>More to the point, exactly which UO systems have changed to cause lag? Do you have analyzed packet streams from each period to prove it?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gremio</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I havn't played it within the past few months on the OSI servers.  I have played on a free server and have had little to no lag.<P>I'm not sure what your latency issues were caused by "before" they made the updates to switch everything server side.<P>I only speak from experiences.  I didn't know very much about taking logs of packet streams and such.  But I can tell you there was a point when there were waaay less packet sizes being sent back to you then there were after the changes...just from experiences and the updates that were made to the UO client/server system they got goin on.  Someone can simply look at the changes that were made and come to the logical conclusion that more packets must be being sent now then there were at the begining..there were actually some unrelated latency problems at some point that they did fix *although i never had problems with these* maybe that's what you're refering to.<P>--Gremio</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Jerry</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">There are many possible causes of increased lag, perhaps your connection sucks, perhaps there's alot more server side objects to worry about (this was a big problem for them, no object decay meant each player was storing thousands of things in their houses and banks).  <P>When I say that their engine is outdated, I'm speaking of the fact that they basically used their Ultima 7 engine instead of designing one from scratch.  If their system and protocol can't handle using a reasonably hack proof datastream, that's their (and your) problem.<P>EQ is incredibly secure, they are almost immune to hacks of this nature as evidenced by the lack of such utilities.   <P>So if they can do it....<P>Besides, what are you hoping to gain here?  Get an apology?  won't happen, get people to stop?  won't happen.  Hell you aren't even getting me to feel guilty.  It's the responsibility of a server to be secure, because hacks will happen.  You can't depend on the good will of the playerbase, that's just a fact.  If the game company designs a protocol that doesn't take this into account, they are going to get hosed, end of story.<P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
