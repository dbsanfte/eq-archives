(not bashing Ash here, he's busy...I'm just happy to hear a 70% done)<P>Idea is - proggy that will capture spawn points, what the random chance for loot off mobs is, what the item/s are. Something you would run in the background like the item collector that not only collects items, but "spawn points, the random chance of a mob having an item, what the item is, etc" so you can run around EC, gather the info, and just copy the file to a directory in the emu called "East_Commonlands" and the file would be called "ecommons.zne" or something, whatever the emu format is, and use that as the populated zone...<P>You may even be able to go so far as hailing npc's and gathering quest info that is sent to the client. <P>I understand that much if not all of the random checks for items and such are done serverside, but if "anything" is sent to the client, grab it.<P>I also understand that ShowEQ does almost the exact thing I'm suggesting... ***BUT***, get it to dump the info in a file in such a way that it's usable w/ the emu. if we have that, it'd be easy for us to make Verant-like clones of the actual servers, and then go back and fix what we want...no time consuming "make crap_npc_vendor00...give crap_npc_vendor00 #item 123* or whatever you'll have to do...the proggy will do that for you. just click on the vendor.<P>Not really sure if it's possible, but I figured I'd re-ask, being I didn't get a very satisfactory answer before...and I understand why...we didn't have the knowledge...we really don't now, but if you know how to use ShowEQ, or have helped work on it, perhaps it's possible to make zone files that will either<BR>1. work on the emu<BR>2. look good, and maybe with a little tweaking work on the emu<BR>3. at least give the ppl the info they need (IE loc's of npc spawns, vendors, etc) to do it fast and efficiently.<P>Just an idea, anyway. =)<P>..."Live to play, or get out of the way!!!"...<P><BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Xith</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey there! This is "The Person Formally Known as a_necro". Ash got my account set up :)  He said he'll get my name on the member forum soon ;)  (got my ethernaquest.org email account now tho :)<P>SEQ already captures spawns. Every time a spawn packet is intercepted, it is written to spawn.db I believe. When Megatron was working on the Linyx EMU, he had already implemented a feature where his EMU would read in the spawn.db and spawn all the mobs for that zone.<P>But more than spawn points, we also need wondering and pathing information. I can implement much better pathing (at least for when a mob is trying to get somewhere) than VI did, but there are delicacies to the way some things work that doing so would break. Haven't worked this out yet... Also, with the analysis of despawn and spawning packets, we can determine the overall spawning behavior. Through statistical analysis we can determine rare spawn freqencies, etc.<P>As far as questing, this will have to be gathered in a similar manner: the capture of player to NPC interaction packets. (well, they aren't called that, you know what I mean :). I haven't looked at all the structures in SEQ really close yet, but I believe that when you select an NPC and talk to them, who you have selected is transmitted in the packet. We can also record items given and record responses (xp given, statments made, items given, etc.). Again, I haven't confirmed it by looking at SEQ, but it appears that when you give NPC items, they are sent one at a time and responded to one at a time. So this means that we also have to log what the NPCs "given quest item" cache is :)<P>Currently, SEQ records a lot of this info (if not all of it, I haven't looked into that project a lot yet), but I think for the EMU to become really sucessfull, we'll need to create a client piece, like the item collector, that will collect this info. Verant has stated that they will not ever scan the hard drive and more recently (well, less than a year ago) they stated that they will not monitor running processes, so unless they go back on that, players should be safe running such an information collector.<P>Speaking of vendors, I wish VI would make it client configurable as to how many vendor items they want to download when they go do shop. The obvious reason that you don't see the vendor's entire inventory is bandwidth, it takes a fair amount of time as it is to download a vendors inventory (for modem uses). However, tradeskillsmen would really LOVE to get those 35 silks that are sitting down on that list. I used to buy crap items from vendors that usually had a lot of things I needed sold to them in attempt to buy the vendor out of that item and see what else they had. Or one time, I accidently sold my Harvester to a vendor after killing specs cause I had a lot of scythes to sell :( I didn't get it back because it was burried too deeply (I bought out everthing except for FS weapons - which cost too much). --- So we might make the number of items downloaded from shopkeeps client-configirable in EMU :)<P>But you are pretty much right on the money Belinar, that's the info we've gotta capture. BTW, you know C or C++? :)<P>Not sure what you mean about zone files tho, unless you are talking about SEQ. In which case, there isn't any relation between the map files for SEQ and the files that the EMU will use as maps for each zone. We will probably use the client side map files (maybe translated to a different format and stripped of things we don't need like texture info, etc) on the EMU server (i.e., for calculating checks on line of site, NPC pathing, etc).<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Belinar</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I am currently learning c++, and am looking for a project to "expand my knowledge" in those fields...Don't know how much I can help, but any info I can think of is yours...<P>My e-mail is Belinar@hotmail.com Just be sure to put Hackersquest or EQ-Emu in the subject as I get a TON of junk mail (one of the drawbacks to using Hotmail, I guess. LOL...) <P>If I can get on the team, even a little bit, I'd be more than happy and willing to try and help.<P>..."Live to play, or get out of the way!!!"...<P>P.S. What I was talking about is having all the spawn info, mob info, etc for specific zones saved to different files for use on the emu...not 1 file with all the spawn info for the entire world...so it'd be easier to get in and edit. "you load East Commons into emu, it finds Ecommons.zne, and loads the values stored in Ecommons.zne." That's all that was about.<p>[This message has been edited by Belinar (edited 06-11-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
