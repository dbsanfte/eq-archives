There are several problems that I see. What about tracking? Are they going to remove it from those classes?<P>What about lag? EQ also has to send at least the data for a fairly large area around you in case the person is lagging. That way they make sure that you will get attacked and die without seeing what attacked you.<P>It seems they always break SEQ around the time that they introduce something to prevent people from finding stuff too quickly.<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">HanzO</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Casualty --<P>--<BR>QUOTE:<BR>---<BR>"I'm guessing that it has something to do with the new engine that they're introducing with SoL.

EverQuest will still tell the graphics engine what to draw, and the engine will determine what is visible based on position, angle of visibility, etc. -- just more efficiently (not taking into account those items hidden from the current plane of view)<P>All I can say is it sucked MAJOR when velious came out and I couldn't see shit!<P>What I remember most was being at work showing off and running through Burning Woods - saying -- oooh ahhhhh and hearing it likewise from co-workers watching.

As one MMORPG dev has said (somewhere, LTM or SND mabye?), "The Client is in the hands of the enemy."<P>1. The alogrythm and key exchange methods can be determined with a combination of reverse enginering and traffic monitoring. This is simply a function of time.<P>2. The decryption key(s), worst case, can be pulled out of the client's memory, if needed. Some experiments with this were done when the encryption was changed last time, though it's degree of 'detectability' is yet to be determined on a wider scale.<P>The issues at work here are somewhat simple:<P>1. Risk/Reward (Money spent, vs. abilities disables)for making, possibly drastic, continued changes to the network code, structure or encryption. A significant encryption increase would undoubtedly require hardware upgrades to the servers, or a re-optimization of the number of players on a physical server at least.<P>2. Acceptable Loss. I presume that the map/GPS feature of SEQ is not on Verant's priority list to disable. Why? It's been working almost non-stop for such a long time. What information loss (to us) is acceptable to Verant to pass the Risk/Reward check above?<P>Anyways, it will be a tug-of-war with Verant as it has alwyas been. They kick us out, we adapt, find more information, they change more stuff, we fix it, etc etc etc...<P>One thing I find surprising is everyone talking about major drastic changes with the new SoL client. Personally I would find it very odd to see all these new changes _just_ with the SoL client, as it would (probibly) require 2 seperate network protocols, OR a major update to the Older clients (Velius/Kunark/Old World) in addition.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">sakshale</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I suspect more and more items will be changed, like hit points, faction and /con to deliver a final number to the client instead of actual values. <P>I also suspect that this is NOT being done because of ShowEQ. (I don't think we are that important.) <P>I believe it is being done to allow them more flexibility at the server end and to place an upward limit on the amount of data that must be sent to the client. Just like the hit points change was done made to allow them to have super-uber mobs and still only send one byte to the client.<P>Sakshale</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hoihoihoi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">there are always good and bad points. <BR>take the con system: they have to send now only one byte to the client, that decreases the amount of data sent to the client, but on the other side they have to translate the raw faction points into the level of the faction. this results less data sent to the client but their servers have to handle more calculations... and also they have killed one useful tool in seq</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">hayesm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">&gt; take the con system: they have to send now only one byte to the client<P>erm, unless they start having critters over lvl 255, they only ever had to send 1 byte to the client to describe level</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">FrozenInTime</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The con system didn't send level.  That was sent to you when you zoned in/mob spawned.  What conning a mob did was have the server send the client the faction level, which ranged from around -3000 to 2000.  The client applied the color (green, blue, white, yellow, red) to the message when it went to disply it since the client already knows what level you are and what level the mob is and what the ranges for each are for you.<P>So, by no longer sending the actual faction, only the relative they are reducing bandwidth needs, but at the cost of server side performance since it is yet another calculation needed to be done.  More than likely this was done to break a feature of SEQ.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Wizzie</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The surrender3d technology uses occlusion RENDERING, not networking. Even if the engine tells the graphics card not to draw something behind a tree, surely the client must know that there is something there, otherwise it would have to re-send lots of packets everytime something moved behind a tree, causing severe lag. The new S3D engine really rulez, the occlusion algoritm makes it ultra fast, even with high polygon scenes.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Acid_Air</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Anyone stop to think that by talking about stuff like this BEFORE SEQ gets borked, we are giving Verant ideas?
