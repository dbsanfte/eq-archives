<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">hey my guess is that you have them in the same folder as your everquest stuff dont you.
here is what you do. if you have the zip unzipp it again.  and then edit everything the way you want but keep it in the unzipped area. and just run them from there. then if you have any more errors i can fix them for you. here i got an idea ill give you a guide that a friend hc aka hawiiancow made for everyone he is a great persion well this will be lengthey but it should take cair of all your errors


From hc aka hawiiancow

Hi all! I must have surfed this board for a few hours after finding out about the EthernalQuest. I must have run in to every single problem there is on this board... oh lucky me =) . At anyrate, I felt really discouraged each wall I ran in to, but I never wanted to give up. I just don't want anyone else to feel the way I did. Soooo... this is what I want to do. I finally got my EthernalQuest to work (and very happy) and I just wanted to leave this post here for all you others to read to save some time surfing these boards...
Before I get in to the good stuff, I just wanted to say that the people at Hackers Quest have put together a great product =) . I believe that I have finally found the best zone trainer on the net. I can finally run around most zones at speed of sow, night vision, and fast swimming speed and not take damage from falling or drowning. The perfect tool for all you newbies out there =) . 
**GOOD STUFF**
To get started, download the EthernalQuest from this link.
http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/downloads/ethernalquest/EthernalQuest.zip 
Heres a good read me file that I wish had came with the zip files...
http://alvec.hypermart.net/SIPandFAQ1.1.doc 
Make an exact duplicate of your current Everquest directory. I named my new EQ directory EthernalQuest. I did some small clean up, get rid of a few opt files and what not... it says in the instructions somewhere. Oh and I hope you have a big hard drive... Each EQ directory takes up about 1GB. After you make this new directory, extract the EthernalQuest.zip to this EthernalQuest directory and overwrite all files. 
I'm not sure why EmuLog was in its own zip file, but unzip that one and put it in the root EthernalQuest directory. 
Great! Now you have your EmuLog to log in to your own server... So you click EmuLog... cannot find server...? DOH! 
Change the IP.ini to your IP address... If you need help finding your IP address, click start, run, and type WINIPCFG and look at what your IP address is, copy that in to IP.ini =) . 
Ok, now I get this funky error that says wrong version of EQ...? But I just clicked on the Everquest.exe and downloaded all the latest patches... whats wrong this time =( ? 
Ok now you need to download a zip file that was custome made for this hack, EthernalQuest. This zip file has the eqmain exe and dll that you need to run EthernalQuest.
http://alvec.hypermart.net/eqfiles.zip 
Ok, now I get EmuLog to work, then I get to the disclaimer and click accept... BONG! A stupid error hits you on the head for 364 points of damage! Your EthernalQuest has been slain by a bad_error_001, LOADING PLEASE WAIT... no no, thats not the error I got... I'm just really bored hehe... I forgot what the error was... I think it was EQmain.dll or something, but I fixed it by getting a new txt file. 
http://razk.netfirms.com/eqtext&zonefix.zip 
Download that zip file and put the text file and the new zone server in your EthernalQuest directory. If your wondering why theres a new zone server in this zip files, tis because the zone server that comes with the original EthernalQuest.zip file seems to lock up while zoning in after creating a character. 
Start your LoginServer, WorldServer, and ZoneServer executables then hit your EmuLog executable and let the fun begin =) . 
OK! I got all my files, everything works great! Now I can get to the character creation screen and make a character and zone in to... South qeynos? How lame... How do I get to the other zones? (Conventional zoning does not work in this emulator) Well, its in the instructions somewhere, I forgot... but read it hehe... 
SIPandFAQ1.1.doc section 3.3
SYNTAX
#zone qeynos2 
Don't know how to zone?
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/002651.html 
#goto x y z (coordinate values) 
Got stuck in a room and cant get out?
http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/Forum6/HTML/000100.html 
So lets say you wanted to check out Veeshan's Peaks. All you have to do is start EthernalQuest, make your character, then type the following... 

#zone veeshan
/q 
remake character
#goto 40 1680 320 
and from there you can explore part of Veeshan's Peak =) 
Some other helpful things I like to do is...
#summonitem 10400
#summonitem 12260
#summonitem 13015 
and those items should help you a bit... Speaking of items, remember to download the latest database from http://www.ethernalquest.org/db/emuitems.cgi 
I'm a student in college and a part time tutor so I like to help people when I finally figure things out =) . So if you ever have any questions, feel free to email me at DONTCALLMEI@yahoo.com ... hehe don't mind the name =P 
Some other side notes to remember is that the developers of this game have not implimented all of the features of the real Everquest. I would say just use it for a zone trainer so you never get lost in your favorite dungeon ever again. Can't really do much else with the emu...
