</FONT><HR>Not related to everquest (for forum-newbies, im well known to post non eq stuff <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"> so please keep flaming to yourself. ) But this is just something a science-type cannot miss. <P>Something of interest, I believe that this would endeed work, but not to the person's expense.<P>So where do we start? Well let us start with one of the greatest triumphs of the human mind, the great theorem of Pythagoras, a true pillar of all mathematics and physics. The theorem, which is applicable to right angled triangles in flat Cartesian (Newtonian) space takes the form of: <P>c^2 = a^2 + b^2 <P>where a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. <P>Next we will jump straight to Einstein's theory of Relativity which states that neither time, length, or indeed mass remain constant additive quantities when approaching the speed of light c. Our simple ideas of time and space come from the fact the we are so used to living in a three dimensional universe. Einstein showed that this was simply not true and in fact all the "foundational" three laws of Newton have to be fudged by the Lorentz factor <P>L_f = (1 - v^2/c^2)^-1/2 <P>There are, however, certain quantities that do remain constant. These constants are related to four-dimensional quantities known as metric tensors. From this Einstein proved that space and time are two aspects of the same thing and that matter and energy are also two aspects of the same thing. From the second of these concepts we get the most famous equation in physics <P>E = mc^2 <P>Now since time and space are aspects of space-time and we wish to travel through time and not build atom bombs we will leave E=mc^2 for the moment. To illustrate this, look at the extension of Pythagorean theorem for the distance, d, between two points in space: <P>d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 <P>where x, y and z are the lengths, or more correctly the difference in the co-ordinates, in each of the three spatial directions. This distance remains constant for fixed displacements of the origin. <P>In Einstein's relativity the same equation is modified to remain constant with respect to displacement (and rotation), but not with respect to motion. For a moving object, at least one of the lengths from which the distance, d, is calculated is contracted relative to a stationary observer. The equation now becomes: <P>d^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 (1-v^2/c^2)^1/2 <P>and this implies that the distances all shrink as one moves faster, so does this mean there are no constant distances left in the universe? The answer is that there are because of Einstein's revolutionary concept of space-time where time is distance and distance is time! So now <P>s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - ct^2 <P>and this new distance s (remember s stands for Space-time) does indeed remain constant for all who are in relative motion. This distance is said to be a Lorentz transformation invariant and has the same value for all inertial observers. Since the equation mixes time and space up we have to always think in terms of this new concept: space-time! <P>Then one runs into the problem of 'outside dating'. Meaning, as the traveler manipulates space-time, the rest of the universe ages normaly. Then we must take inter-dimensional transition into account. Once a hole is ripped into a dimensions fabric, it follows whatever entered the rip. Once the travler enters the new dimension, he commences his engines to reach the c speed (speed of light), and travels through time. The rip on the travelers side will stay in the same geographic location, while traveling through time, while the rip on the new dimension will follow the traveler. Once the desired time is reached, the travelar reenters the rip, and he has effectively traveled through time))  - From the art bell forums.

</FONT><HR>Firgured if you liked this topic,you might like this.. wrote it ALONG time ago... might update it with what I've learned since then.. If I do.. it'll be up tomarrow.<P>"First, lets deal with what time is. <P>Time defined by the webster's dictionary is - The system of those secquential relations that any event has to any other, as past, present, or future; indefinate and continous duration regarded as that in which events succeed one another. <P>This isn't that far from the utter truth. <P>First we have to define time, this is going to be the bulk of this e-mail. <P>I like to use geometry, it seems the easiest to explain how this works. <BR>The 0th dimension is defined as a point. Points exist in our dimension as singularities (commonly refered to as black holes)<BR>The 1st dimension is a line. Exists in our dimension as strings. <BR>The 2nd dimension is a plane. Some believe planes to be dark matter.. but we don't know if they really exist in our dimension yet. <BR>The 3rd dimension is known as space. <BR>The 4th dimension is known as time. <P>A line is made up of infinate points <BR>A plane is made up of infinate lines <BR>A space is made up of infinate planes <BR>So, what is time made of. Well what was between when you started reading my rant and now? Infinate spaces. <P>A time is made up of infinate spaces <P>Those words explain the whole basis of time. Time is made up of infinate spaces... and any "point" in time is a space. I like to think of it as 1 hologram overlapping another and another to the point of infinity. <P>So why do we precieve the third dimension? <BR>I like to look at a line to show this.<BR>A line is made up of infinate points. If you were one of those points and you looked around you would see a point in front of you and a point behind you. <BR>A plane is made up of infinate lines. If you were one of those lines and you looked around you would see another line.. and to the other direction another line. There would be more lines behind it.. but when you look directly on a plane you see a line... (aka the flat side) hence you see lines if you are withing the plane.<BR>A space is made up of infinate planes. If you were a plane within space you would see two adjacent planes. <BR>Time is made up of infinate spaces. If you are one of those spaces (points in time) you would see a space before you.. and a space after. Hence Past, Present, and Future. <P>You are existing in time, but at any 1 point you see a space.. and that is why we always believed we existed in the 3rd dimension. <P>Now you know why we exist in the 4th and not the 3rd, and how we precieve the 3rd but not the fourth. Next I will move on to how nothing else but the 4th dimension experiences time.. and why we are the same thinking person through time.. <P>1 point replicated infinate times is a line... - if you are a point and you are moving infinately long in a straight path you would be a line. <P>1 line replicated infinate times is a plane... - if you are a line that travels infinately in a straight path you are a plane.<P>1 plane replicated infinate times is a space... - if you were a plane that travels infinately in a straight path you are a space. <P>1 space replicated infinate times in time... - if you were a space that traveled in a straight path you are a time. <P>This means by being a space (point in time) and moving in a staight path you are time or making a time. This shows us where we are at. We are a space.. but since we move in a straight path we exist in time. <P>TIME TRAVEL <P>It's came from the movies!!!!! It came from the books!!!! It's the basis for a sub-genre of sc-fi! It's TIME TRAVEL! Now the truth. <P>Time travel it's self if unreliable if not possible. <BR>There are infinate spaces between any points in time, so to try to jump from one point in time to another you've have to jump infinate points in time. To do this should be impossible in it's self.. but if you were to accomplish it, jumping infinate points in time could take you anywhere, since between any 2 points in time is infinate points in time and between another 2 points in time... is infinate points in time. So if you jump back or forward infinate points in time.. you cannot predict when you will end up. <BR>Another problem is what happens if you jump back in time? <BR>1. You jump back in time. <BR>2. You never come back. <P>That is the view from the people who saw you leave. <BR>What truely happened. <P>1. You jump back in time.<BR>2. You create another timeline seperate from the one you existed in. <BR>That has unforseeable consequences. Just by existing in that timeline you create another. It could be as light as changing the atmospheric pressure by your added mass or as horrible as introducing a microbe which kills half the human population... it does matter.. it will change... by your own added existance in the timeline you would split it off. <BR>So even if there were no major consequences you would not be able to go back home. <P>Forward in time is another matter. <BR>1. You jump forward in time. <BR>2. You jump back in time. <BR>3. You jump forward in time.. but it is differen't. <BR>You cannot jump forward to the same future twice... no matter what you will always bring something back that will change the course of your timeline. Wether it is a tought, or a technology, or even a microbe.. your timeline has went to another course. So when you jump in the future.. I might look the same.. but just because you had that thought.. it is differn't... no matter how small. <P>This brings us to another course. <P>The 5th dimension. <P>Now this theory I am about to introduce is not mine, and I first seen it on StarTrek, but it is accepted as true. <BR>This threory is called... well now I don't remember.... Fine, I'll just explain it to you. "By every choice we can make there is a timeline that covers it." <BR>This means that everytime there is any choice... even what you are thinking, there is a timeline split. Like the one in timetravel. <BR>Now where I come in. <BR>Since there are infinate choices there are infinate timelines. <P>By the pattern we established earlier... what can we conclude? <P>1st dimension is made up of infinate 0th's <BR>2nd dimension is made up of infinate 1st's <BR>3rd dimension is made up of infinate 2nd's <BR>4th dimension is made up of infinate 3rd's. <P>Now we have infinate 4th's. <P>so, what is made up of infinate 4th's? <P>The 5th dimension. <BR>We can't yet fathom what the 5th is, or what is the 6th from it. (that I know of) And we cannot yet fathom what is below the 0th.(that I know of)<P>TIMELINE JUMPING <P>This is a theory of jumping timelines. <P>Let's start out with a seniario. 2 time lines are EXACTLY the same.. <P>Execpt in one, you thought Car, banana, CN- <BR>and the other you thought Car, orange, CN- <P>So everything is the same in these 2 timelines except the thought about the fruit. <P>To jump the timelines..you must change your memories. So you thought orange instead of banana. In this example the change isn't big enough to cause the timelines to be to far apart to jump, but the difference between them makes this no great accomplishment.<P>The rules for jumping.<BR>1st - Both timelines must have the same physical properties at time of jump. (meaning that both spaces must be in the exact place with the exact thoughts) <BR>2nd - You must change the memories of all that know of the difference. <P>Let me give you a more powerful example. <P>You choose to ware red one day instead of blue. <BR>In the other you choose to wear blue instead of red. <BR>Other than that everything else is physically the same.. and the color did not change anyones physcial actions. <BR>Then to jump timelines.. you must wait until the everything is physically the same.. then change the memories of everyone who saw you and yourself... this will complete the jump. <P>This can be taken into bigger examples to... if only the memories are differn't you can jump timelines. <P>REBIRTH <P>This is a theory that isn't mine, It is called the closed universe theory.. and this isn't stated with the exact words. <P>The universe expands, then at a point, retracts.. then at a point expands.. and then at a point contracts, etc.. <P>We can tell it does this through the cosmic radiation we monitor. 10^6m wavelength, if I remember right. <P>We assume that is process if neverending. Meaning it has done it infinate times, with infinate differences. <P>This is where I come in. <P>If it expands and contracts an infinate times. Than I've lived this path an infinate times. <P>If it expands infinate times, then there is infinate times it expanded and everything formed up to where I am now. It also formed to any alternate time line I may have lived. <P>Guess what, this means we are immortal.... Doesn't matter much though... Because we can't tell between our existances. I ask you not to dwell on this to much. One man has already went insane with a similar thought. (The man who originally made the closed universe theory thought it happened the same each time.. he thought he had done before what he is doing now.. it drove him insane.)

Every atom would meet up with every other atom in the whole universe at some time for an infinate amount of times. meaning...the earth would be remade with different earths maybe 2 in the same solar system different types of humans..the works. which means you were once a killer a "holy holy" (hehe) and what not so think twice before you judge others! and...and this is a big and...if there was a god and after you died you went somehwere, there would be an infinate amounts of your self of all different races, ages, egos, hair colors to dick size ( ...i donno had to put that in) so don't be a hater. <P>on a side note... The only think i could think good that would come of this is. It really gets you into the "I DONT GIVE A FUCK" adutide. So like if your going to ask someone out you couldn't care less what they say hell you might have some fun and kill them ;x ... I mean this makes me feel like, i could go into the most ghetto part of watts and just start talking shit(would be to get something tho...just not to do it).<P>PS: if there happenes to be errors on my rant ..if you read till now you can tell I don't care  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif">..think of it now why did i spend time doing this if it doesn't matter ;\<P><BR>-Pac0<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>No no no, there is no time, there is no space, nothing like that at all.<P>Here's how it works. We are all one unified consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, there's no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we're the imagination of ourselves.<P>We as a universe (I hate using the term 'we', because it implies multiples of something, when 'we' are all really one being), are the collective experience of one higher being. It's basically as though this being is playing a massive game of Dungeons and Dragons by itself and acting as the DM, and all the players at once.  <P>There are many paralells to this in nature. Cells are one seperate being when they are by themselves. You can suspend a single skin cell in a protein solution to form a whole patch of skin! However, form a group of cells together, and suddenly they all begin working for the higher purpose- the body. The blood cells rush to the skin cells to kill the bacteria, and the brain cells send messages to the skin cells to regenerate themselves, etc.  They are suddenly part of one higher consciousness. Even we as a species do it. Look at the mob mentality. One person by herself is completely capable of independent thought, etc. Put her in the middle of a raging mob, and sooner or later, she gets overwhelmed by the mob mentality and becomes one with the group, one with the unified decision. <P>So now that we have our paralells in the world we live in, I want to go on to describe the nature of our existence. Basically what we live in is a "dream world". The best way to equate this is to when you yourself dream. When you dream, there is a set environment, and set 'rules' such as gravity and friction, etc. You can walk around in this environment, converse with other people, do outlandish things, etc. But you invent the world as you go along, you just don't realize that you are doing so. The exception is when you realize you are dreaming, in which case you can break all the rules and create things whenever you want.<P>So when will we realize that we are dreaming?Noone really knows. It could be after years of trying to become one with the universe, it could come when you die, it could come out of the blue. The documented cases of 'miracle workers' could just be people on our planet who have enough self discipline to shape the world we live in as they see fit. After all, it's not like they're changing anything real. In fact, they're only changing it in their mind, but since we are all one being, it's everyone's mind as well.<P>So how does this relate to time travel? Well, time is just another perceived 'rule' that we set for ourselves in our 'dream', like gravity, to keep things in line. These rules can all be broken. However, to time travel would not be breaking the rules, it would merely be bending them. Which means that you would still have BOUNDARIES. A better alternative to time travel is to simply shape your reality before you to make it SEEM as though you have traveled back to 18th century Japan, or the 40th Millenia. <P>So, time travel? Hah, I scoff at the notion. I say we form our own realities and make our own rules instead of operating under the guidelines we set for ourselves without even knowing it! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I've always wondered, when I think of infinity and the endless possibilities of my life alone, I feel like I'm going to go insane.  Why is such powerful knowledge about infinity makes us lose it?  And for some reason, I wonder how IF there is a God, is he restricted to this "time"?  In the Muslim Holy book Quran (that's right, I'm Muslim), it says God as no beginningnor end and is not bound by time.

</FONT><HR>Ok, excluding that the Lorentz-Fitzgerald equations (like the one you mentioned for length, which are identical for Mass and Time dilations too) make any moving object a singularity at v=c (since you get a zero for the denominator (cause sqr( 1 - ( c^2/v^2)) is 0 when v=c).  In other words, it's a semi-elegant mathematical proof that you cannot travel at the speed of light.  In fact, according to the formulae, nothing can.<P>Feynman and many other quantum-electrodynamicists (and QCD's too) accept that even light never actually travels at light-speed.  Light, as a large population of photons travel at an average of c.  Some guys are faster, some guys are slower, but the BULK average is around c.<P>Next...  distance is never a "constant" if only because space is constantly expanding (time is too, of course, it's attached to space).  The good thing is, that there is no place to get a "standard" from.  You can't go to the XYZ point in the universe and mark off a meter and bring the length with you, because everything you have will change correspondingly.  That's kind of cruel.<P>The LF equations, like Einstein's works, ONLY say that you cannot travel AT light speed.  Not that you can't jump past it.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>When I was in Jr High, I had a though that every instant that goes by has an alternate and infinite number of results.  As mandated by "god", we as humans have free will, and may do anything within our ability.  Our actions have consequences, and being that our actions are spontaneous, so is our future.<BR>A few years ago, a TV show named "Sliders" more closely resembled what I had thought.  However, not so much that "we" as we know ourselves co-exist in another dimention drastically different from what we know it to be, but rather from this point onward our options are replicated in an infinite number of co-dimentions all spawned from the previous instant.<BR>Basically, this is just one of those things that you think about in the back of your mind, yet would like to believe it's reality - such as "I wish I had done this" or "that" - and in that alternate reality, you had made that choice or decision.  (So, don't be discouraged if you failed to meet that super-model when you had the opportunity - just think, that in an alternate reality you wind up living happily ever after with that person - so just be happy for yourself.. hehe  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif">  - j/k<P>With what Gulzin had written - "time is made up with infinite spaces" this is well written - it reinforces the theory that if time travel were possible, one would have to appear at a particular "space" which would for ever remain the same once it has passed, only until the time that individual disturbs it.  This past "space" once visited by someone of a future "space" would only be known to themselves. Likewise, we will always know reality to be the truth - as we would never knw someone had gone back in time and changed the past.  The reprocussions of any action caused by the individual would only be evident to themselves.<P>I have more on my mind, but I've gotta finnish rebuilding 2000 advanced server on a system with bad ram, so it's taking a long time.  (this is also the reason why if any of this seems incoherent.)<P>And what do you mean we can't go back to EQ when rubicite droped in the Lost Temple of Cazic Thule?  hehe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ever think of this? a line itself is infinite and has been proven by modern mathamatics (I'm not a good speller, sorry.)<BR>So if a line if infinite that everything else would ALSO have to be infinite, therefore the universe is infinite and so is time. Time has ALWAYS been there. The tricky part is manipulating time. Lets say your at point a. then you travel negativley to point b. and end up creating a RIP in time/space. You would of course open up a doorway through time doing this......Maybe that's what UFO's are... And btw, scientists have already brought light to a complete stop, so I ask you this. If we can manipulate light, what makes you think we can't manipulate the everlasting fabric of space? hmm? The only bad part about doing this is that you would indeed not return to your original time-line and that you would cause severe damage to space and time in doing so allowing billions of you in other timelines to visit one place... Kinda complicated but think about it and you will understand.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>That was awesome when light was stoped, I remeber a few years ago it was slowed to 47mph, and then recently stoped. And there are examples of it being reversed in space(a black hole)<P>This furthers me to belive that light itself is just another object in time, In no way manipulating or representing or limitations of it.<P>Black holes also interest me, If LIGHT is FAST, then Darkness must be faster. The gravitational pull into the star is so great that light goes into complete reverse, Only thing escaping is darkness.<P>I belive that if darkness itself(whatever it is) is not a traveling simular to light then the star would not exist if you were to lets say.. Fly into it. I belive it does still exist in the time and space that we know of but is masked by the darkness emiting from it.<P>Furthermore, I have recently thought that darkness is really light or part of it, or even maybe its "track". Like a train on a railroad, if you reverse the train(light) the darkness(track)still goes on, This could disprove my belife that darkness moves in our current time and space. Or that it moves much greater, Or is simply a part of light. Powering light, making it as fast as it is.. Creating time itself with everything that moves apon it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I've always been of the opinion that the idea of the speed of light somehow enhancing or changing your perception of the universe, or the aging of your body, is a bit flawed.<P>Here's my view of the subject.  Everyone thought a long time ago that if you hit 55mph, you'd burn up and die.  This was disproven when a machine capable of moving faster than 55mph was created.  They then said that if you hit the speed of sound, you'd burn up and die.  There's jets that can approach 10x the speed of sound, possibly faster today through a technique of 'skipping' off the very wake of air that the jet creates from it's own speed.  In essence, they have a jet that angles upward, the nose end of the plane direct's large amounts of air underneath the plane where the tail end 'skips' off it.  The thrusters are aimed on a level plane (not diagonally up behind the jet, which would force the jet diagonally up, possibly exiting the atmosphere if there was enough thrust), and the angle of the plane is such that the air being forced under it keeps the jet moving in a forward motion, using the air it 'skips' off of to keep altitude, and even *increasing* it's own speed.  The thrust of the engine is no longer all that creates speed for the plane.<P>In space, moving the speed of light just may be possible, but I believe it unlikely to be successfull.<P>On the one hand, you have the commonly held theory that light is matter moving at a high velocity in a wave-like pattern.  If this is true, then the heat generated on the surface of an object by the millions of atoms colliding with it is a result of the friction generated.  This is from *atoms*.  Imagine if you are moving at the speed of light and collide with a pebble in space.  You'll see an explosion with more energy release than a nuclear bomb.<P>Now, if you hold to the commonly held quantum physics theory, light is a vibration along a higher dimension.  Some call it the 4th, the 6th, or label it other dimensions (if you subscribe to superstring theory, you'll probably know what I'm talking about), but the fact still remains, it's felt by many, myself included, to be a vibration along a higher dimension.<P>So then, the question begs, how does a vibration move?  What *is* a vibration?  How does one define it?  Is it it like length, width, and depth in the way that you can measure it by size, or is it the same as vibrations in 3-dimensional space where it's only measureable by the way the object moves in 3d space.<P>The answer I think is both.  An unseen, measureable but not yet perceiveable dimension exists which affects the universe.  It may be the same dimension that creates the 'force' we describe as gravity, and it may be yet another 'force' that we in our 3d minds have not defined yet, and light is simply an effect of vibration along this axis.<P>On this axis, the vibrations of light has literally no resistance, and is only limited by the speed at which it's medium can transfer the vibrations.  When I say no resistance, sound has resistance in that over distance, the medium around it that is not moving in the way that it's vibrations want the medium to move slowly degrade the vibrations until they are more similar in nature.  In a way, similar to how when you pour cool water into a warm bath, the temperature evens out.<P>With light, there is only one dimension that it travels along, and the vibration as it travels is equal no matter the distance.  Why there is zero resistance along this medium, I don't know, but if I'm right then there is more than likely a physical law for it.  The difficult thing here is that if you only have a single dimension, it is defined as having two points in space-time.  A and B.  A start and end point.  Or just two end points, in another manner of speaking.  It may be that light vibrates along two different unseen or hidden dimensions.<P>I think it may have something to do with what causes gravity as well.  According to various quantum phsyicists and theorists, gravity is created by the 'weighing down' in a given area which is caused by a curvature in another dimension.  Kind of like when you sit on your bed, it creates a dent in the bed, and anything nearby has a tendency to slide down into the indent.  If you were to have a 3-dimensional curvature of this sort in space, that is exactly how gravity acts.<P>Since we know that light is affected by gravity, saying that light is at least partially affected by the same dimensions as what creates the effect known as 'gravity' is not far fetched by any means.<P>Sorry if this sounds very rambling in nature, I'm only putting a little thought into this post.  I'm at work, and trying to concentrate on this as well as doing my work =)<P>-Phantal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Forgot to finish my point, sorry ;p<P>Basically what I'm saying is, light is a vibration moving along the part of matter that we can not see without any impediments.<P>A dimension is not some magical rift in space that you travel to.  A dimension is a measureable part of a physical object.  if you look at a cube it has height, width, depth, gravity, temperature; it has other forms of energy inside it, things we label as kinetic energy (which creates friction, and the temperature of the object is a direct result of the friction), it has an electric charge (positive, negative, and maybe neutral, though I believe that 'neutral' is more of a way of saying 'only slightly negative or positive').<P>Attempting to move at the speed of light I believe will prove impossible, due to the fact that though people believe space is 'empty', the very fact that light can travel through space, provided this theory that light travels along another unseen dimension of matter, proves that there *is* something in space, and you *would* find things that would affect your course, be it dust, pebble-size fragments, asteroids, or what have you.  Even if you had a completely unobstructed path in which to do your 'test flights', I believe that the physical structure of matter and the physical laws that matter applies to would prevent you from accelerating to a speed that high. <P>When you say 'rip a hole' and fire up your engines, you are speaking as if you can just kinda slip in a little rabbit hole and come out on the other side of the universe somewhere, when in fact the universe is, at least most likely, defined in such a way that the other 'dimensions' in your world are things that define what you call forces, not other areas of the universe that are unexplored (ie., other 'slices' of reality).  Things you call gravity, temperature, etc, are simply your perceptions of this nth dimensional universe.<P>Though it is extremely fascinating, the science-fiction approach to figuring out what is possible in the universe just seems to get battered down too much by the very theorists that had hoped to discover the means to doing what every sci-fi geak has always wanted to do.<P>-Phantal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Bah.<P>1) There are NOT infinite choices at any point in time.  The universe is, so far, demonstrably deterministic, and not demonstrably random.  Granted, you would seem to need randomness to get the universe in the first place, but not necessarily for the duration thereof.<P>2) You can't fly through a black hole.  Getting close enough will spagettify you due to severe differences in the pull of gravity on one side of your body vs. the other.  Whetever actually happens when you enter the singularity will be singularly uninteresting to you at that point.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Just because something travels faster than light doesn't mean that it arives faster than it left, just that we "preceive" that it arived faster than it left.<P>Anyway, my point is, when you travel the speed of sound, gas acts like a liquid...it becomes fluid, it no longer compresses. What would happen if you tried to travel the speed of sound under water??? They have never done it...I believe because of the density, but my theory would be that it would act like a solid. Water would stop flowing and you'd hit it hard. (Think doing a belly flop from the High Dive). Anyway, what I'm trying to say is what if you take an object and try to travel the speed of light inside of an atmosphere??? When you hit sound, it becomes liquid...when you hit light, it becomes...You guessed it...Solid! <P>To travel faster than light, you have to do it in a vaccum, which everyone knows is not really a vaccum after all...it has many little micro particles. I believe that traveling faster than light in a vaccum would act like traveling inside of an atmosphere, where the particles would be the "air" in space. There was even a book or TV show I saw that showed the design for they're "faster than light" ship, and it had a 2 mile wide cone on the front used to collect hydrogen atoms while traveling at such a high speed, and use them to power a nuclear reactor...infinate (or close enough) energy. Anyway, that's my two cents...<P>1. Traveling sound in liquid = Solid<BR>2. Traveling sound in gas = Liquid<BR>3. Traveling Light in gas = Solid<BR>4. Traveling Light in Vaccum = Gas<P>P.S. Haven't figured out what traveling light in liquid is...must be something more solid than solid.

</FONT><HR>Light is a wave pattern yes...but what is it? it is Heat. A light bulb that gives of yes, light, is nothing but a rod that is heated almost to breaking put and that heat is given off as light...so light is really atoms hitting eachother, almost fission(is that splitting or putting togeather, togeather would seem logical fussion but i always thought it backwards...plus fissure is a earthquake...anyways back to topic) its almost  a nuclear explosion as we would call it, but its not....it is just |--| close from erupting, but since it doesn't erupt it gives off light...but when light hits objects this causes it to slow down...thus the farther you get from a light source, the less heat you feel..and thus the farther you get..the less light you see. We see stars because their is virtually nothing of size to impead its light to get to us.<BR>Also....lightbulbs break after awhile (hologeans only last so long) so this would lead me to belive why stars collapse...atoms of light (or heat) that are not allowed to escape because they are pushed away by other atoms of light (heat, that would reach us or what not) eventually burn out...explode...and if one explodes all the rest of that highly flammable gass (what are stars on average, 70% hydrogen?) it goes kablam... what do you think? Tell me any flaws or what not, I am only 16 but I enjoy chemistry and physics =)(as well as phylosophy)<P>PS. This is all original theory I thoght of while reading this article Sunday June 9th 12:38 PM EST (just incase this is something new...which I doubt).

</FONT><HR>This is constructive.. and very useful, I wish to thank everyone who posted here..<P>The following are not attacks on people.. just points I would like to make.. and I want them to know that if I could go over what they have made me think over.. and how many great points you have all made.. <P>If I had time, I would like to point those all out... I would like to personally thank Phantal for some great ideas.. and everyone else... <P>Grar, I think I sound mean in this post and I didn't mean for this.. So remember.. for everything here I say, If I had time. I could point out 3 great things about your post.<P><BR>Speggitification isn't your worry when you hit a blackhole..<P>the fact time for you stops would be my worry...<P>hehe.. a wormhole is differn't though.. it is not a singluarity..<P>it is 2 singularities joined.. the factor doesn't matter.<P><BR>When you enter a wormhole you get smaller and smaller in porportion to the width of the time around you... but you.. it doesn't matter.. seems like the universe is getting larger and larger. It's relativity. You are not going through abnormal stress and the time variance wont be that signifigant.. it is one of the hopes for breaking the Law of Relativity.<P>Another is Warp, that is - moving the universe around you at faster than the speed of light.. that... We'll have to wait on.<P>Jafo - Enthalpy and Entropy.. look them up.. then come back and say that...<P>TSD - Interesting.. I'm going to wait until it hits the scientific community.. because many things of this nature turn out to be flawed...<P>Gharikk - Law of Conservation of Mass and Energy<P>theExtreme -<P>Actually..<BR>2 things about this.<BR>1st, you'd turn into X-ray.. (Read "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking<BR>Goes into how the matter antimatter collisions at the event horizion of Black Hole obeys the law of conservation of energy and matter as well as killing off the black hole.<BR>2 - Speggification (which has been covered) and the fact time to you would stop at the event horizon. (also in ABHOT...) as you approach c.. time slows until it stops.<P><BR>Everyone - The big bang happens, everything expands at the speed of light.. slows down.. comes back to the big crunch.. (effectively the speed of light when it hit's the crunch)<BR>and the process repeats..<BR>(closed universe theory)<P>a_mage01 - you've been taken care of so I wont say anything<P>Phantal - Heat Energy.. particles moving at the speed of light(squared) that is kentic energy.<P>yeah, it does effect you.. makes you hotter..... light hits you.. you absorb it with black materials.. you get hotter.. etc..<P>Boom.. nothing major happen..<P>Energy is all forms of energy, not just electricity.. So, it happens all the time.. no big boom worse than an atomic bomb.. sorry.<P>Oh yeah, and the dimensions I'm talking about are mathematical.. not the ones that deal with particle vibrations... that has been dwelled enough into for me... They are not the same... as you've been stateing..<P>I am saying connecting 2 singularities.. erm.. but not.. it creates a beautiful tunnel as you would put it.. no magical rift.. just 2 connected 0th dimensional objects which cancel eachother out and when you fall past the event horizion you will end up on the other side's event horizion with the same speed in which you hit the previous one. I would need to Diagram to actually explain it..<P>Think of a singularity as a cone traveling to a point.... <BR>Think of a worm hole being two cones that intersect above the point.. creating a tunnel to travel.<P><BR>Belinar - Actually..<P>gas flows.. solids flow<P>A gas convection current... is flowing gas.<P>flowing is not a property of just a liquid<P>Morphic - Actually, it is radiant energy not heat.. it is easily converted into heat..<P>it takes more than light to cause fusion =)..<P>hehe... on the same topic, what does everyone think of the Tokamak 3?<P>The fire on a sun is constant Fusion.. not rapid oxidation (which is the fire you are thinking about)<P>To burn that much hydrogen you'd need at least half as much Oxygen...<P>Stars implode... Too much He... fall in and kablam.. nova or supernova (not ENTIRELY sure of that... someone explain it better)<P><BR>That's all I have to say.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Gulzin (edited 06-09-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Phantal - A few more points<P>Light does have resistance.<P>The current speed of light is based upon how it travels in Kr.<P>Gravity can warp light (as proven by the law of relativity)<P>Your shirt absorbs light or relflects it offering DIRECT reistance..<P>And gravity is in porportion to mass..<P>The reason the dent is there is because of the HUGE amount of mass in that part of space.<P>The singularity is no mass(and infinate mass at the same time since it cannot be defined by such considering it's orgin).. and hence.. creates the HUGE distubance... Which actually goes as deep as the "dent" can go. If you connect them... you now have a portal where the velocity you travel in is as fast as you travel out<P>v+c1-c2=v<BR>where c1=c2..<P>Simple.<P>You are accelerated to the speed of light, and on the exit, you are pulled back at the speed of light.. well.. since it isn't a singularity... not quite c.. more like .99c..<P>connecting them is what we don't know how to do.<P>as I said in my previous post, this would work primarily because you are not being smashed.. you are just shrunk (and this does not mean more mass or density.. because in relativity.. you don't change)<P>Shoot questions so I can answer this.. it be hard to explain with words..</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>You can't put your thoughts into coherent sentences either, bub.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> Let's see if I can decipher what you just said...<P>Okay, done.<P>You do have a good point, you're just coming from the completely wrong area. Calling a it a black "hole" is a misnomer. It is not a hole so to speak, it is not a rip in any space-time continuum. It is merely an extremely dense piece of matter. <P>Every single thing in this universe has a pull of gravity. If you come close to the sun, the gravity of it will begin to pull you in and you'll be hopelessly evaporated. A black hole simply has such a strong pull of gravity that it even pulls light in, so the surrounding area looks completely dark. You cannot pass "through" a black hole, because it's not really a hole. It's just one point of matter. If you got to the center point, you'd just be squished. Now, whoever said that time would 'stop' in a black hole is actually wrong.<P>Slowing down light does not cause 'time' to slow down for anyone. If that were the case, the scientists who slowed light to 47 miles an hour and then stopped it would be trapped forever in a timeless void. The entire altering of 'time' comes in when an object begins to move at a speed approaching the speed of light.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I remember reading that they put a atomic cloak on a Airplane that went like Mach 5 or more, this is fast but no were near the speed of light, but anyways the point is the cloak was actually milliseconds slower then a clock that was onthe ground.. The point is the faster you go, the slower time is...Time outside of you stayed the same but you slowed down, although to you it seems the same. Also I read, and I know I am vauge on this cause I don't remember the details, is that if you could go the speed of light or close to it...If you where to go 10 light years away. Thats 20 there and back. To you 20 years would have passed, but to the world many would have, don't remember the exact number. Only way I can explain it is it took you 20 years to go the "distance, D" and earth and other matter still has to go that same Distance (not exactly sure why, will reply later really tired) But since they are going many times slower they take longer..so after the distance is done (its like you are doing it at the same time...which is kinda hard to comprehend that you end at the same time yet you spent less time then the other people) years and years have passed on yearth (100s, thousands or what ever) and 20 has only passed to you...so Technichly you went into the future in a sense of it, but you could not go back unless you could go like a negative speed or something....anyways thats my though.<P>Morphic</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002837.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Time+Travel+Formula|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>The only reason you "slow down" when going light speed is because:<P>If you are traveling at light speed, you see what you would see if time stopped. "Time" stops because you arent being updated with what's happening elsewhere. When I say updated I am talking about light reflecting off of something to show you whats happening. If light is stopped, you no longer can see. If light is paused (by traveling at its speed) you see a photograph basically. If you stop going light speed after traveling for a year, light (thus time) will catch up with you. It will never return to the same time both here and on earth, unless you return to earth. <P>Lets pretend the 0 is earth and S is the ship, the 123 between these two is the distance from earth in a period of time, lets say 1 month<P>1. Launch date:<P>01234S<P>You are 4 months away from earth (traveling at light speed). Then you stop<BR>You are 4 months in time away from earth.<P>After one month you are now seeing month 3 of what you would have been seeing if you were on earth 3 months ago.

</FONT><HR>Yes, this whole speed of light/rate of time passing is based purely on perspective (it's not named theory of RELATIVITY for nothing ;)).  Say there's a planet 10 light years away.  If you had a hell of a telescope such that you could see things on the surface of that planet, what you're seeing was happening 10 years ago.  Now say you could go there in one hour.  That would mean you'd have to go 87600 times the speed of light.  When you got there and looked at the planet, it would seem you traveled 10 years plus one hour into the future, but you really didn't, it only seemed like it because you couldn't see what was actually happening when you left; you went one hour into the future.  If you looked back at Earth from that planet, it would seem like you went BACK 10 years though because the light from earth would be just getting there.  If you returned to earth in an hour, you would NOT be 20 years into the future from when you left, you would be 2 hours plus however long you stayed at that theoretical planet.<P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.<p>[This message has been edited by adenine!

But Time Travel is KIND OF impossible if you look at it.<P>Some theory I read once (Stephen Hawking or whatever his name is, the guy who is handicap and has a 200+ iq)<P>Let's say you jump back in time and kill yourself, well you shoot and you happend to miss because a flinch in your shoulder, you hit your shoulder with that shot... Think about that, if in the past you get shot in the shoulder by someone unknown then you shot yourself from the future....<P>And if you happend to go back in time and tell anything to anyone or let anyone see you, some people might not be born, ect... You'd have to wear an 'invisble suit'.<P>Well just my info on Time Travel... I have tons and tons of theorys and math equations....
