<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Guardian, I don't have to try and "swaver" you. I am telling you point blank that you WILL get banned for exploiting. I know this for a fact, because of the way you tell us that you play. 

Just because they have not fixed a bug, in the time that "YOU" feel is appropriate, you think it is ok to exploit it. If something is broken in the game (Monster pathing from South Ro zone to Oasis?) and you exploit it, and they catch you,what are you going to say?

"but it has always been like this!"
"Hey, I bugged it two months ago, that means it is ok to exploit it right?"
"You guys knew about it and didn't fix it, that means I can do anything I want!"

What do you think is going to happen? If you can do anything and get any benifit from it in game (xp or plat) with NO danger whatsoever (I.E. pathing bugs where they can't get to you) it is a bug and exploiting that bug can get you banned. It doesn't matter if you have reported it or /bugged it a million times, or if it has been there for 3 years. I don't really aggree with it, but that is their stance as far as I have seen over the past 3 years.


Nightstalker, you are not keeping up with this thread too well, might want to skim back over it a bit, it has changed topic about 3 times so far =) Quest4reality wanted a reason that anyone would have for reporting someone that was cheating. I thought one up. Doesn't matter to me if you like it or even if you believe it *shrug*

"- okay, this is totally different from what we're talking about. Some person following you around for 10 minutes, /poke-ing you, begging for SoW, clarity, rez, whatever and hiting the monster your fighting is not even closely related with a person stading ontop of a large rock at 3:30am blasting creatures that can't hit them..that's the whole point this DOESN'T MAKE THE GAME LESS ENJOYABLE FOR YOU, it makes the game MORE enjoyable for the person, who obviously likes to do that. If you don't cheat, than don't cheat..that's all there is to it, i respect that, gain your levels however you want, but why let the jealousy get to you enough where your going to report someone because he's doing something you don't "want" to do. I mean really. Now i'm all for reporting someone that's screwing you up while your playing, cuz like you said you can't slap someone in the game (unfortuantly), but unless the guy who is "cheating" is draining his mana from a rock at the spawn site your camping, how is he effecting you in any way? just let him be, and mind your own business."

Could you please reread what I posted, Hell, you even attached it to your post. I'll paraphrase.. 
If you are an ass to me, I will be more likely to be an ass and report you for doing something wrong. It has nothing to do with your cheating hurting my game, at that point, I am doing it purely to get you in trouble because you were already an ass. Got it?
