want to share some of my experience with AO and my strategies.<P>First of all, as earlier mentioned on this board i think was the double-login trick, make note, that this trick IS still usable and can be a good thing to use for leveling faster, getting double xp for 2-3 characters logged into AO at once while you let your main character lead and put the others on follow.<P>I do this all the time, i use one meta, and then i have an agent on follow when i do hunting in teams etc, then on attacks i just tablock or lock with mouse on target and press Q to normal attacks or make some special attack icons on my (Y) shortcut bar, it works fine and i leveld both my highest characters this way up to level 30.<P>To do this things have become a bit more complicated with the new loaderscreen in patch 12.9 and above, now you have to press the AO-icon in a special way to start 2 eula's.<P>1: make sure to have the AO-icon on your Desktop.<P>2: before you could just press the AO-icon twice with 2 doubleclicks (4 clicks or 2 enters on keyboard) not anymore.<P>3: now you have to first start 1 eula, then press accept (with keyboard ENTER) and then quickly press the AO-icon again with your mousepointer and then start another EULA with clicking on the AO-icon on the Desktop with ENTER on keyobard.<P>AO-icon with Enter<P>accept on EULA with enter (while having mouse pointed at AO icon on desktop)<P>AO-icon click once to select again with mouse (real fast)<P>AO-icon with Enter (real fast)<P>accept on EULA again with enter<P>now you have two login-screens.<P>NOTE: if the first gets fullscreened, then<BR>just start one first, make it normal size so you can see the Desktop (double click on the top bar on it like any maxed window) and then close it with the X on the right top, then redo the routine above.<BR>It's tricky the first time, but it's easy when you get the hang of it.<P>NOW you place the 2 loginscreens just above eachother so you can see both login buttons.<BR>then go to the top/first loginscreen, TAB select "login" so you can login the first with pressing enter on keyboard, then hold mouse over the login-button on the loginscreen behind the first, now press enter to login the first and press your mouse to login the second at once, works good this way instead of trying to click both fast enough with your mouse.<P>Now your select one character for the first loginplay screen, and another for the second, make sure both run in WINDOW MODE &lt;- IMPORTANT, then make sure both are a bit lower on grapchics, like low on texture res. and middle on texture quality.<P>Now TABselect the "play" button on the top first playlogin-screen and hold mousepointer over the other behind "play" button on the other playlogin-screen, now press enter and mousebutton at the same time and you should login both into AO fine. i do this all the time.<P>NOTE: you might get a directX error, stating it had some problems initiating directsound and asking wheter it should try next time to use directsound, answer YES on this, so you dont turn of any functions, this is NOT a problem and a fake error message, youre machine CAN handle it, just directx that THINKS it cant.<P>Thats it. now you can play with 2 or more characters, maybe 3 and put them all in same team, level them faster and all of them get xp while in same team so much faster xp for you in total.<BR>Also good for RPG'ing like making scenes, getting attention etc, or good for selling buffs or skilled sercives, you could have a team like a doc, a nt and MP as a team who stands in a city selling buffs of all needs, doing implants etc.<P>Good places for XP.<P>level 8-18 Bronto Oasis NW of newland at<BR>           1100 x 2300<P>level 18-35 Rhino Cockpit just W of Bronto Oasis some 1000 cords. very fast leveling here in team and savepoint at the spot so you would lvl from 18 to 35 there in only a day or two.<P>level 35-50 Lush hills resort. grid to lush hills (resort NOT harrys, go to cave at 900 x 1700 in woods, or 1700 x 900 dont remember. there you have multi-adds coming in 10-20 at the best a minute. just plain powerleveling with full team and a doc and just stand still by caveentrance and slay them in a full team and use cave as safehouse if you're in mortal danger. i leveled from 40-50 here in just 3-4 hours.<P>level 50-60:<P>Majestic bridge, lazy a bit slow xp<P>LB hill outside lush hills OP NW (follow long road from lush resort to outpost then NW to cave some 6-700 cords.<P>Cyborgs at metmedere/mort border, grid to medmedere and zone into mort going through newland desert 1-200 cords.<BR>Usually 20-30 players there banging on cyborgs, give very good xp if you're in a team doing 10-20% of the total dmg on them. their total xp is usually 30-40K xp so in a team when 20-30 players are there u usually get 8-15K each kill.<P>Vultures in greater TIR at 700 x 2700<BR>good place for shades and vultures, vults give 7-12K xp a kill, shades give 4-6K xp each kill. risky though, alot of unseen adds and worms there. make sure to have a STRONG team here, FAST killing is more important than a doc here, so a GOOD tank, 1 or 2 mps with pets, a engiee with a bot and a highlvl NT with nukes is a good team here,bots/pets go in first, then ranged attacks, then at 20-30% life left on vult melee go in and pound it. Usually works good that way<BR>important to stay close in group here, to be very patient and to scout slowly through the desert in this area.<P>Sinc.

How do u solve that proble (how do u join the any team?)?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Destiny</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well lvl 60-70 there are many good areas, im a Meta so there's a lot i can do alone with my pets doing the job for me. I don't have too much experience with other characters with over lvl 60, allthough that in avalon and 20K there are a lot of good spots for 60-80 leveling.<P>reg, teams, yes, 20K are full of highlvls up to 80 treating lower levels like dirt. Im not sure why this is a phenomenon in 20K, maybe because the lvl 40-80 huntinggrounds there have been there all the time since AO started and are known too all the players and are the most washed-out used spots.<P>For that reason i prefer avalon, the cyborgs at camelot outpost, you go whompa from athens to avalon, then follow the road to the OP (road going W left then forward). from the OP you see a huge mountain-fort which is the Cyborg Domain fortress, there yuo go with a full team, 2 teams is best, with a good doc who actually KNOW what healing IS, a good fast high-hp puller and maybe a meta and some engies/nt-nukers. healing is important here as cyborg's often come in adds. If several teams have ONE person take command of both teams with "/s take down %t where i JUMP right now" - this effectively makes sure all in both teams take down the same target as fast as possible.<P>When it comes to teaming, don't wait for a team to turn up, take control, reqruit your own members and take the lead while beeing nice to them, always helps and often you end up with a kickass team who will want to group with you for the next 10-20 levels.<P>Also, greater tir isnt the only place who has scavenger/feuder vultures in great numbers, there is ALOT unseen in avalon desert just south to camelot which most people don't bother to check out, you often find all sorts of mobs for all kinds of levels there nicely grouped in different smaller areas to make hunting easier.<P>Sin.
