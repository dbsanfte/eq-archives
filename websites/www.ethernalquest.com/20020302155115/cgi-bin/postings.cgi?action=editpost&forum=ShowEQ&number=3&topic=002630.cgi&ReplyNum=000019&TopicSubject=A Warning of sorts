<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Sneaky,

You are repeating your mantra to the point of numbness.  It sounds to me like you can't get it working, so you want someone to do it for you, and you are using some wierd FUD tactic to try to get people to do your thinking for you.

It's not working, but you keep repeating it in the vain hope that it will.  Get with the program here.  People who CAN port SEQ to Windows really don't CARE to make a few bucks on Ebay and open themselves up to the whole ugly... and I mean ugly... legal battle that _could_ ensue, both from Verant and other sources.  

The people with the talent to do so, and the gall to sell it most likely ALREADY have high paying jobs in the corporate programming world and/or are too responsible to do so.  Those with the ethics that would allow them to do so are too stupid to do so, hence, it won't be done.  

You are attributing entirely too much intelligence to greedy morons out to make a quick buck.  If you can't set up a Linux version of SEQ, you SURE AS HELL can't port a version to Windows.  If you can port a version to Windows, you SURE AS HELL don't want to waste the time and encumbant problems of selling such a piece of software... which doesn't even get into the support aspect of it.  

Lets say someone did exactly what you proposed and sells 1000 copies, great... at 50 bucks each.  That's 50,000 bucks... quite a lot of money.  Now, a day later, Verant changes some minor stuff in the data stream and flops a few things around... L-SEQ is fixed within a day, the libEQ library is recompiled and redistributed, end of the L-SEQ story.  

Now... you as the $50,000 richer W-SEQ seller now much support 1000 angry people because your piece of shit software doesn't work AND you have to figure out what's changed and reverse engineer libEQ again... time consuming... A few days later, at best, you distribute the ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM at several megabyte each.  I'd say 10 megs BARE minimum for a Windows port.  That's 1 Gigabyte of downloads, bare minimum you'd have to support each time there is a change.  Your free services aren't going to stand for that very long, so you'll have to have a hosted solution... that costs $$.

Verant finds out your a selling this and sends an exploritory cease and desist letter to you... you fail to comply.  A quick court subpeona... IN SAN DIEGO appears a couple months later ... oo a plane ticket to go defend yourself, or hire a lawyer... there's more $$ out of your pocket.  It's eating into your $50,000 and sanity pretty quick.

Ohh, now look, you have 50 pissed off customers (out of 1000) because your program doesn't work, and they paid good money for it...  5 of them decide to sue you.  Now you have to defend yourself against Verant AND 5 pissed off customers, what fun.  Your lawyer is happy, you are not.

Ooo... one of them wins in small claims court, you have to pay them $50 back... AND the court costs... AND your lost time and $$ to appear in court.  

Mmm... where'd that $50,000 go?  it's mostly gone now... and Verant is still breathing down your neck.  You think $50,000 is going to phase Sony?

You WILL stop selling W-SEQ and you WILL NOT ever update it again.  W-SEQ is broken, L-SEQ is fixed ... no more W-SEQ and you are $50,000 poorer or more.

So go ahead... make a W-SEQ and try to sell it.
