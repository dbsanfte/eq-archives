<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Ahh, I see where your misconception of the whole project lies, which is tainting your view of the whole thing ...

You, and other I'm quite sure, are under the mistaken impression that I'm doing it for "others", whoever they may be.  I won't speak for any of the other developers, but personally, I do it for me.  Perhaps that is a bit selfish, but it's a fact, none the less.  I contribute my code and organize others, and keep everything running for my own personal gratification.  If someone else gets use out of it, it's just _THAT_ much better ... but if no one used SEQ, besides the developers, it would go on getting developed.  Perhaps privately, perhaps publically ... but we each build of someone elses work, and we each learn from others.  Centralizing a software repository and making it publically available furthers this goal ... people have ways of looking at a problem, or finding a solution, or just making neat gadgets that one person alone may never think of ... so you have a richer piece of software for it.  

You are not the first person to bring up the "Charge a subscription" for updates concept.  I will never, ever, ever do that.  I will not accept any money, and I would hope none of the other developers would accept money for that.  Now... pizza and perhaps beer... but not money.  Papa Johns is my fav if anyone is reading  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif">

I, of course, do not know you and have to base my crazy opinions on what I do know of you.  When I say you are probably one of the people using, or would use SEQ irresponsibly, I refer to what I have always said, since day one.  SEQ is not a tool for farming, and it most certainly NOT a tool for Ebay farming.  The current SEQ project is intended for navigation as it's primary function, and also to serve as a C3 device.  There are other functions that it can be put to use, and some will use these in an irresponsible manner.  Obviously, I view farming items as a definite no-no.  Grey areas are camping that rare spawn, once.  (Stormfeather anyone?) ... ridiculous camps like that, I believe are acceptable for the most part... if you are doing it just to further yourself along and not take away from others.  Finding corpses / lost people / etc...  Those things don't necessarily hurt anyone, and obviously help some, and argueably add something to the game that already SHOULD be there.

SEQ defintely needs to be used for large scale encounters for organization and control.  EQ was not designed, or poorly designed to handle what the majority of the game actually is to a lot of people, large scale guild raids.  There's no provisions for communication between guilds, or organizing large numbers of people, sending out scouts (and having them be able to report back that information in a meaningful and timely manner), precision strikes ... all things that should, would and could be accomplished in a more robust gaming environment.  

I realize some people will disagree with me on this... suprise!  However, that's the way I see it.  I believe that there are some encounters in the game that would be next to impossible without SEQ, and the only reason they are being done now is specifically BECAUSE SEQ exists.  

I think most people have come to accept the fact that SEQ is not designed for, nor intended for the neophite audience.  To put it plainly, I do not want you using this software if you are unable to setup a Linux system and get it running. All these "how-to" guides are a bad thing (tm) IMHO.  I wish they didn't exist, but they do, and that's fine.  As a general rule of thumb, those that are familiar with linux and able to navigate around within it are going to be far, far more responsible than JoeWindowsUser who installs Linux just to use SEQ, and doesn't know the first thing about any of the processes behind it.  JoeAverageWindowsUser is irresponsible, ignorant, and generally cares nothing for his fellow online gamers.  

You say I'm going and "getting moral" all of a sudden (or you imply this), this is patently not the case.  I have ALWAYS tried to keep SEQ as close to "on the level" as I could, given the nature of the beast.  This latest move is just an extention of that, the only difference is it is more visible and effects more vocal people than anything else.  

Could the situation have been handled better?  You bet.  But, the situation degenerated into what we have here, so I have to deal with the reality of the situation, and not what-if's.  

SEQ will be back, as I've said before, all the co-dependant people that rely on SEQ will have thier fix again soon enough.  It's just a matter of having patients and not needing to screw your fellow gamers over so quickly.  I suspect all those yelling the loudest are the ones that really shouldn't be using SEQ in the first place.
