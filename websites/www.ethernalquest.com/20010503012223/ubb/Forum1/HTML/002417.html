</FONT><HR>While no statement I'm about to make should be construed as suggesting or recommending that any person commit an illegal act of any kind, you should realize that some jaundiced, loathsome misers don't have a clue. Without going into all the gory details, let's just say that it is no exaggeration to say that the theoretical fallacies in Ashran's tirades run deep. And let me tell you, if I seem a bit myopic, it's only because I'm trying to communicate with Ashran on his own level. I may not be perfect, but at least I'm not afraid to say that implying that everything is happy and fine and good is no different from implying that all literature which opposes anarchism was forged by vulgar unstable-types. Both statements are ludicrous. You've never heard Ashran announce that he plans to repeat the mistakes of the past? Well, Ashran has repeatedly enunciated such a plan, but in his typically convoluted way. As someone who is working hard to create a world in which chauvinism, unilateralism, and extremism are all but forgotten, I must point out that he wants to kill the messenger and control the message. Personally, I don't want that. Personally, I prefer freedom. If you also prefer freedom, then you should be working with me to subject his editorials to the rigorous scrutiny they warrant. Surly gnosticism is now and has long been a mainstay of his jokes. Why? That's easy. The fabric of his wisecracks is infused with confused heathenism. Now that's a rather crude and simplistic statement, and, in many cases, it may not even be literally true. But there is a sense in which it is generally true, a sense in which it truly expresses how someone has to be willing to bear witness to the plain, unvarnished truth. Even if it's not polite to do so. Even if it hurts a lot of people's feelings. Even if everyone else is pretending that mediocrity and normalcy are ideal virtues. <P>What conclusion should we draw from Ashran's sound bites? How about that Ashran's values are so inverted, they would make Lewis Carroll blush? Every time Ashran tells his loyalists that he has the mandate of Heaven to implement a treasonous parody of justice called "Ashran-ism", their eyes roll into the backs of their heads as they become mindless receptacles of unsubstantiated information, which they accept without question. Let us now join hands, hearts, and minds to empower the oppressed to control their own lives. Any rational argument must acknowledge this. His uncouth, manipulative sentiments, naturally, do not. <P>To oppose Dadaism, we must oppose immoralism. To oppose anti-intellectualism, we must oppose fetishism. And to oppose Ashran, we must oppose disagreeable mystics. Someone needs to encourage individuals to come out of their cocoons and flourish. Who's going to do it? Ashran? I think not. Take, for example, materialistic New Age recidivists. Now look at Ashran. If you don't believe there's a similarity, then consider that he can't possibly believe that everyone and everything discriminates against him -- including the writing on the bathroom stalls. He's stupid, but he's not that stupid. Finally, this has been a good deal of reading, and honestly difficult reading at that. Still, I hope you walk away from it with the new knowledge that it is a figment of Ashran's imagination that his epithets won't be used for political retribution.<P>Thanks,<BR>str</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002417.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Why+Ashran+sucks...++read+within">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I think I'll confound my critics by devoting this letter not to describing fickle underachievers in general, but ADMstr in particular. I begin with critical semantic clarifications. First, ADMstr keeps saying that he can tour the country promoting treacherous masochism in lectures and radio talk show interviews and get away with it. For some reason, ADMstr's apparatchiks actually believe this nonsense. While I know very little about hateful meatheads, he is living testimony to the grungy attitudes that increase society's cycle of hostility and violence. If you doubt this, just ask around. We don't need to demonize ADMstr; he is already a demon, and furthermore, if he got his way, he'd be able to challenge all I stand for. Brrrr! It sends chills down my spine just thinking about that. <P>Discourteous knuckleheads will always band together to let us know exactly what our attitudes should be towards various types of people and behavior, but, as you know, he wants to use mass organization as a system of integration and control. Who does he think he is? I mean, as long as the beer keeps flowing and the paychecks keep coming, his vassals don't really care that I am tired of hearing or reading that he is the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread. You know that that is simply not true. I believe, way deep down, that a person who wants to get ahead should try to understand the long-range consequences of his/her blanket statements. ADMstr has never had that faculty. He always does what he wants to do at the moment and figures he'll be able to lie himself out of any problems that arise. Is anyone else out there as struck as I am by his utter disregard for morality and humanity? The reason I ask is that his allies have learned their scripts well, and the rhetoric comes gushing forth with little provocation. <P>Although ADMstr babbles on and on about terrorism, he has no more conception of it than most other stinking, unimaginative blood-stained criminals. Have you ever had a bad dream about him trying to bombard us with an endless array of hate literature? Well, I have news for you. That wasn't a dream; it was real. I've tried explaining to his supporters that he wants his cowardice and irresponsibility to be regarded as prudence, but it is clear to me in talking to them that they have no comprehension of what I'm saying. I might as well be talking to creatures from Mars. <P>While ADMstr's artifices may seem blockish, they're in agreement with his twisted fairy tales. To what consequences this leads can be seen from a few simple considerations. First of all, ADMstr's writings are destructive. They're morally destructive, socially destructive -- even intellectually destructive. And, as if that weren't enough, every time ADMstr tells his legatees that the only way to expand one's mind is with drugs -- or maybe even chocolate -- their eyes roll into the backs of their heads as they become mindless receptacles of unsubstantiated information, which they accept without question. <P>Ever since he decided to make a big deal out of nothing, his consistent, unvarying line has been that disorderly, treasonous self-proclaimed arbiters of taste and standards and nit-picky yobbos should rule this country. From a purely technical point of view, if we take ADMstr's dissertations to their logical conclusion, we see that any day now, ADMstr will promote racial superiority doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide. I'm not saying this to be nefarious, but rather to explain that many people respond to his insensitive biases in the same way that they respond to television dramas. They watch them; they talk about them; but they feel no overwhelming compulsion to do anything about them. That's why I insist we challenge the present and enrich the future. <P>It is reasonable to infer that ADMstr labels anyone he doesn't like as "stupid". That might well be a better description of him. I find that I am embarrassed. Embarrassed that some people just don't realize that he has been trying for some time to convince people that no one is smart enough to see through his transparent lies. Don't believe his hype! ADMstr has just been offering that line as a means to seek temporary tactical alliances with irascible purveyors of malice and hatred in order to publish blatantly slatternly rhetoric as "education" for children to learn in school. It's easy for armchair philosophers to theorize about him and about hypothetical solutions to our ADMstr problem. It's an entirely more difficult matter, however, when one considers that he says that the worst classes of tyrannical, deceitful mafia dons there are are all inherently good, sensitive, creative, and inoffensive. This is at best wrong. At worst, it is a lie. His grunts, who are legion, all have serious personal problems. In fact, the way ADMstr keeps them loyal to him is by encouraging and exacerbating these problems rather than by helping to overcome them. <P>The only way that we can fight him, the only way we can beat him, is to break the mold and stray from the path of conventional wisdom. Not that I've come to expect any better from him. Are you prepared to discuss this, ADMstr? He is not just arrogant; he's randy, too. He claims that this is the best of all possible worlds and that he is the best of all possible people. This is a very dastardly and unconstructive view and moreover, is wrong in many ways. Already, some obnoxious ignoramuses have begun to place antisocial psychopaths at the top of the social hierarchy, and with terrifying and tragic results. What ploys will follow from their camp is anyone's guess. <P>ADMstr is not just stupid. He is unbelievably, astronomically stupid. He is thoroughly mistaken if he believes that censorship could benefit us. The truth hurts, doesn't it, ADMstr? Shameless insurrectionists may possess a mass of "knowledge", but their brains are unable to organize and register the material they have taken in. Let me try to put this in perspective: Other grumpy, shallow low-lifes are also consumed with a desire to transform our whole society to suit his own dissolute interests. Think about it, and I'm sure you'll agree with me. <P>Don't get me wrong; ADMstr faces moral disaster in his neighborhood, political disaster in his country, and an impending world catastrophe with a blank and smiling countenance. But ADMstr's threats run contrary to even the most cursory observation of the real world -- and ADMstr knows it. <P>Given his current mind-set, he believes that he can walk on water. Sorry, but I have to call foul on that one. In case you have any doubts, I am intellectually honest enough to admit my own previous ignorance in that matter. I only wish that ADMstr had the same intellectual honesty. This letter has gone on far too long, in my opinion, and probably yours as well. So let me end it by saying merely that ADMstr is capable of going berserk without notice.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002417.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Why+Ashran+sucks...++read+within">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
