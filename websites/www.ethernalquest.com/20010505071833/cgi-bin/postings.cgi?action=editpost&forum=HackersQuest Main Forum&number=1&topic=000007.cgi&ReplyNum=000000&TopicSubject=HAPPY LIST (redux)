<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Akanon:
*It's possible to stand on a ledge near Guide II and blast it with impunity. This is right by the cleric's guild. 
*There are two rooms near the King that allow people to stand in the corner without getting attacked. 
*If you stand in the corner near p 767 n 159 n 54 npcs can't fight back as they don't seem to pass p 757 n 140 n 54 in that room
*In the room next to this, if you stand in the corner at p 800 n 135 n 54 npcs can't reach you (Most of the time) and you can blast and med without fear of harm. 
*If you stand at p 1942 n 340 n 124 (Near Water wheel) you can kill the clockwork at p 1976 n 339 n 123 without them fighting back. 
*There is another safe spot on the other side of the water near the water wheel and the lil gem thingy near p 1992 n 257 n 124 

Befallen 
* Drag a mob or two up to the main courtyard with the rocks in the center and then run back and forth parallel to the stairway on the stairs side of the rocks and the mob will run the long way each time to get to you giving plenty of time to cast and move to the other side. 

Cazic Thule: 
* You can get mobs stuck in the corners in the temple and they can't attack back. 
* You can climb on top of the temple and cast on mobs that spawn on the spires and ground. 
* In the sewers in the last room before the Avatar's you can run out with the mob following and stop and the mob will stop too. 

Crushbone: 
* Behind the slaver's quarters across a pool of water is a cliff that can be climbed right next to a elven slave (you'll see where it's climbable). You can cast on either side of the ledge and attack mobs. You can also use this as a safe spot when running from mobs. 
* It is possible to get on top of the castle at one point and cast down on the mobs below. 
* There's a tree straight ahead from the enterance that's adjacent to the trainer hill.....if you pull mobs to this spot, and climb the tree, they go all the way to the end, jump up on the ledge, and run back. then leap down, rinse repeat. You get the picture. a good ranger or other archery/thrown person can kill a mob this way...or a caster can use this to nuke and avoid damage 

Feeroot
*In Feeroot you can fear spectres into the south west corner and they will get stuck.You can then attack them without them attacking back.

Freeport
*In Freeport at the hogcallers in (the one across form the tree you can climb) Trissa whistlesong is the target. There is a table in back of the room, center of the wall. If you cast from one side, Trissa will runt o the head of the room, then back down other side of the table. Player simply hops or sidesteps over the table, and Trissa runs back to the head of the room, then to the other side of the table. Wash, Rinse,and Repeat. Seen some pretty low lev casters use pets and spells to kill her without getting touched. 

Gorge of King Xorbb: 
* Climb up certain walls and move back and forth and the mob will run up and down the wall and never hit you. 
*Mobs will get stuck on the giant rock near the Runny eye zone if you pull them from behind the rock.

Grobb: 
* You can levitate to the top of one of the spires by the warrior guild and cast on mobs who don't aggro down below. 

Highpass Hold: 
* You can lev on top of some inns and cast on mobs from there with out them attacking you at all.

HighHold Keep: 
* Just as you enter, the main courtyard to your right is a ledge accessable from the balcony to your right against the castle that you can attack mobs from without risk. 
* Also in the prisons with Osargen you can attack him and walk outside behind the guard and against the wall and cast while he is stuck in the doorway.. same with regular prisoners. 
* Like the above you can run to the princesses' room and stand in the back and cast. 
* As you walk down a ramp to the main pickclaw area there is a wooden beam above you. You can bring a mob up there and then run to the beam and cast while it runs in circles. 
* There is a spot in the warrior room where you can get an NPC stuck.. however no one ever does this  <IMG SRC="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/ubb/smile.gif"> 
* You can pull prisoners up to the ledge near Carson McCabe's room and then jump off the ledge and they won't follow or attack. Bards use this to sing them to death but a caster can blast. 
* It is possible (Havn't figured out how) to get all the way on top of the keep and blast from there. (Top of the building when standing in the main courtyard with your back to the zone). 

Lake Rathe: 
* Running an Aviak Guard to the Arena zone and standing in the far corner (directly accross from the zone line) renders you inaccessable.

Lesser Fay:
*There is a small undead camp near the sisters camp in lesser fay. You’ll notice when you go there that if you blast or attack on of the undead if you back up to a certain distance from the camp aftering atacking them they will run away from you. They are in fact taking a different route to get to you..a long loop around. You can move forward to get them to come back to you. The object here is to blast..back up and make them run…wait a sec…move forward again and blast. This makes it so that you will never get hit. You just keep making them run from and away from you while you blast them .

Lower Guk:
* There is a collection of greater minotaurs that all stand around a small rock next to a ledge. Running a mino near that rock get's it stuck. 
* In the mino elder room you can stand right where the room starts to widen and nuke mobs while they are stuck in a loop. 
* On the live side there's the river. Just downstream is an area with a flat on both sides of the river and two boards between them. If you shift from side to side on the smaller isle, the mobs will take the long way around. 
*In Lower Guk in the Savant Room you can stand on one of the pots in the corners and the frogs won't attack you


Mistmoore: 
* In between the stoves in the cooks room is a spot you can jump up to and you are inaccessable. 
* Just before you enter the castle you can climb up the rocks and get on top of the castle. 
*In mistmoore, one can climb ontop of the lamp...and then mountain goat your way up to the roof, and cast on the herbalist (hooded black cloak guy). 

North Freeport
*In North Freeport there is a two story tavern close to the bank. Players can go upstairs and stand on the railing and cast down on the NPC on the far corner without it reacting. 

Oggok: 
* In front of the warriors guilde (I think) you can attack a guard standing back against the wall and they get stuck in a loop walking back and forth. 

Ocean of Tears: 
* A shark occasionally get's stuck near the siren isle on the way to BB. You can cast on it or even melee it if you stand correctly and it won't retaliate. 
* Might be fixed now but you used to be able to get Aviaks stuck in a path and cast on them. I used this exploit before I knew what it was  <IMG SRC="http://www.hackersquest.gomp.ch/ubb/smile.gif">.. but it seems to be fixed now. 

Najena
*It require a good timing but when you enter najena there is a safe spot immediatly at the right in the first room there is a small ledge ...It is not only a safe spot for meditating but also the pathing between the 2 extreme side of that "ledge" is different so casters often use that to blast tentacle terrors ... the time they come in reach they just take a step down and the TT come back running ... 

Qeynos: 
* You can get up a tree near the mages guild and attack certain mages around the round tower without risk to yourself. 

Qeynos Hills:
*When players are camping the Millers near the Surefall Glades entrance, if you run up on the zone wall to the right of the Surefall tunnel - the Mobs can't get to you. 

Sebilis
*In Sebilis you can fear frogs near the zone and they will run into the wall. 

South Ro
*Don't forget the weird pathing bug in S Ro. The dune next to the zone line to Oasis. If you have something aggro on you when you cross the line, it'll start running the long way around. run back across it and it runs back the way it came. 

West Freeport: 
* You can climb a tree in the theater area and get on the walls providing safe attacking from most places. 
* You can attack one of the NPCs in the arena in the back with the split level area and walk down to the bottom. If you move around a bit they will get stuck running around the edges. 
* In the South East corner of the newbie hunting grounds you can pull a guard and cross a line stretching Northwest the guard will forget about you and walk back to the gate. 
*In West Freeport Near the second zone to N Freeport there is an open area where if you stand on the mound you can use a pathing exploit to kill guards. The guard will just keep walking around you. 
*Go to the Monk guild house in West Freeport. There will be a storage like building at the corner against the Monk guild house. Get on the 2nd floor and stand at loc -38.66,-654 You’ll be able to blast anything down there and they won’t come up to get you
