&gt;&gt;Verant is still running a business. Every $10/month they ban is that much less profit and it adds up. More importantly, the time spent to catch someone cheating is time they can't put to more useful purpose.&lt;
&gt;Like what telling someone "Sorry, I can't help you."?

Actually I was thinking like fix the pathing errors and broken quests people are fond of saying they should do.

&gt;&gt;If he can come online and pursued 10% of the people cheating to stop, his 5 minute post saved quite a lot of paperwork in the long run.&lt;

&gt;People who cheat with third party programs can not be "pursueded".
&gt;Banning is all done electronicly and takes all of five minutes to permaban someone. Guides have little else to do and they do it at no cost to SOE.

Guides don't ban people. Guides are rarely able to even catch someone cheating with 3rd party tools unless they happen to see you race by them faster than they can move themselves. At that, all they can really do is say "Hey, GM, this is messed up, check it out". A guide is someone who sits at home with the same client you have, the difference is they have a flag that tirns on the commands like /zone, without a hack.


&gt;&gt;If you want to cheat, go ahead and cheat.&lt;

&gt;I wouldn't call what I do cheating. I just look at things and learn from them. I don't really feel any need to alter my avatar.

Based on this, you also don't fit the profile of most of the people here. You are truely a hacker rather than someone leaching off the work of others. As I said earlier, while I would prefer you didn't do this, I accept that you will, and I accept that efforts Verant takes to prevent it only give you more of a challenge - and more motivation to "play" in this manner.

&gt;&gt;Maybe he'll catch you and maybe he wont.&lt;

&gt;They won't.

&gt;&gt;I'll even say... probably he wont since there's so many of you to try to catch... but he'll catch some of you, and it seems there is no first offence slap on the wrist. Spin the wheel and take your chances.&lt;

&gt;I don't take chances, I take well reasoned risks.

Risks are chances, no matter how much you try to stack the odds in your favor. Consider the game of blackjack at a casino. The average player wins some hands, loses others, and typically leaves the table without having won or lost a lot of money (gambling problems aside). The card counter is able to increase his odds of winning through proper betting strategy and a heightened awareness of momentary probability of a hand being in his favor.

In the game of hacking the computer system of someone looking for that kind of activity, you seem to think your well reasoned risks (aka card counting, in my analogy) immunize you. They will possibly make it harder for you to get caught but over time, you'll find it only takes a single lost "hand" to have the game come to a close.

You say you don't use hacks to alter your avatar. I guess I don't have the vision to understand what else you might be changing. I would imagine though that if you're not altering anything about your avatar, that you're correct in thinking you won't get caught.

I mean no sarcasm when I say I hope you're enjoying yourself as you hack and discover what you can do. Though not in many years, I've been there myself and understand the sense of accomplishment it brings. Don't get caught.


NYGenXer: Sorry to burst your bubble. I'm not Tellaron. I've posted here under a different (long-forgotton password) name perhaps 2 times, but not within the past 9 months minimum. I'm noone you know unless perhaps we've crossed paths on the same server before, and since I prefer to remain anonymous, we won't get much of a chance to find out.
