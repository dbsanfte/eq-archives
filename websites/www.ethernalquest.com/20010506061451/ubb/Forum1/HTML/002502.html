</FONT><HR>Lets start off here on a good note  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif">  It is possible that I might be an Ex-GM of Verant, or maybe not, believe what you will.  I have been reading this board for some time and I wish to make some comments.<P>1. Items do not have serial numbers.  Each item in the game has a number, which is used to create the item, like an index number.  These numbers never change.  Quite simply, if you and your friend have a soulfire each, they are exactly the same, a Gm cannot tell the difference.<P>2. EVERYTHING is tracked. I mean it, litererally everything.  If you drop it, its logged, if you pick it up, its logged, if you put it in a forge, its logged.  you get the picture.  All trades are logged and detailed as to the items traded to whom and from whom.  Your IP address is logged when you login to the game, each time you change your billing and information a record is kept.  Cash is tracked, how much you have and how long you had it, a history is provided.  (Cash is converted to copper, the standard and tracked that way)<P>3. There are cheater logs, 2 that I know of at least.  One tracks players hacking SOW and the client.  If you ever HEXed the client and got booted off, you were logged off as a cheater and logged.  The other file has something to do with zoning and such and was never fully explained to me.<P>4. GM's have a log of those that fell through the world, its called fellworld.txt, they just do not use it and ignore it as its a pain to get out of the game to go check logs.<P>5. There are 8 levels of backup availible to GM's.  Its viewpc 0 thru 7.  Its unclear how the backup is taken, it is supposed to be a roll over, meaning level 0 is today, 1 is yesterday and so forth, but its totally hosed up and its like 2 days then 3 weekly's then a nightly.  But they can see what you had on you yesterday and the day before and thats how you guys are getting caught in your scamming  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><P>6. EQ servers are pathetic, home brew boxes running dual pentium 3's just recently upgraded to 800's  The code is MS C running on NT.  There is one world server and then zone boxes which run multiple zones each.  Forget hacking the servers, I was told there is several layers of firewall and protection, the best there is out there.<P>7. GM's Don't care about you.  You are an avatar, thats it, each GM is instructed to treat each customer as if they are lying and scamming, which is why the CS there is such crap.  The CS dept changes rules about once a week, to fit the whim of upper management.<P>8. Brad Who?  Brad McQuaid may not exist.  In the time I worked there, I never saw him, nor saw an office.  I do not believe he exists  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif">  I do know that Brad does not have an Aradune character on over half the servers, meaning he has never bothered to even log into most of them.<P>9. Abashi is a true A-Hole.  He is now your worst enemy, as he SOMEHOW got put on the actual development team and makes decisions for EQ.  Thats right , the guy that stated you can med without the book at level 32, that guy.  And yes, he hates you intently, takes it as a personal battle with players.  I heard about his comment when VI "fixed" the clerics hate list thing... "So clerics always complain to me they are bored, well, we will just add DEATH to their sit,med,heal, that will fix them"<P>9. COmplain, Complain, Complain...  Thats all you have to do to get what you want.  Spam email the company, write everyone with your twisted tale, in the end you will get whatever you want as they get tired of the BS.  I cannot tell you how many times management has created entire lists of things for players solely based on the fact they never stopped emailing them and they were tired of it.<P>10.  No, VI cannot stop ShowEQ or detect it, Nor could they detect DXwindows, tho they did break it...<P>11.  Favouritism .  Yes, there is tons, but not to players.  (Unless you are a developer, then you can give your buddies whatever you want and no one gives a damn)  GM's routinely assist with VIP's and others who get the red carpet and anythign they want in the game.  <P>12. Yes, the game is geared to the high level Guild players.  Newbies are looked down on while uber guilds are in high regard.  <P>13. The most powerful GM tool is....SNOOPING!  Most of you guessed it, but yes, a GM can see what you type to anyone, entire guildchats can be snooped with an anonymous GM.  Next time you pull off that scam or cheat someone, don't be an idiot and brag to your friends...<P>14. Management cheating...  Yes, they do all the time, they have the D3D at home and use it.  YOu all know Lady Degarmo?  "She" is a he, and a bit rough around the edges, if I may add.  I have heard he playes characters on the ZEK servers and often uses the D3D to wipe out anyone he dislikes.  Talk about a low life scum in my book.<P>Do with this what you will, and believe what you like to.  All the things about logs and how the game works is 100% true, the others are hearsay from other GM's...<P>SkrewVI......</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I agree with everything you said.<P>I have suspected logs like that for quite some time. This is why I dislike sites like WizzyFR's site. People get banned and the email states exactly how many times they have turned on the speed hack LOL.<P>CS is bad in the fact that there is only 1 GM per server. And somtimes take people weeks to even get ahold of the GM, they many times leave 2 hours after they began their shift and leave with a queue packed full of reds many of wich are item poofings and corpse poofings and serious stuff like that.<P>Then the guides are stuck with the task of teling the players that they have to wait another day because the GM ran off and never heard the end of it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>As far as Hacking the SOW speed, if you change the HEX in memory, yes, that is logged as your client is telling the server how fast you are running, thats why it works.  You are logged because the server checks and see's that you never actually cast the spell or that you are running at a speed faster than any spell.<P>Now while it worked, the SpeedHack that messed with the clock settings of DirectX was NOT logged, as it never actually messed with the client, but DirectX itself.  If you got caught using the Speedhack, its because someone witnessed it.  <P>Not to worry much about the cheater logs tho, Most GM's do not even know how to read it, and remember, its a pain to get to the logs as they have to actually exit EQ completely to see them, so they would rather not.<P>Let me clarify here a little, do I think hacking is good or should be done? Not really, it ruins the game and makes life hard on legit players.  But it IS YOUR memory chip that you own and if you want to change an address on it, you do have the legal right to do so.  On the other hand Vi has the right to terminate your account for messing with their game, in fact they reserve the right to cancel your account for any reason, anytime.  Go read the EULA.<P>Myself, I am just pissed at VI cause they are a pack of liars and you, the players really don't know the half of it.  Are you aware that everyone on the programming team now is on other projects and EQ is now being done by half-baked GM's they promoted?  Bet not....   The reason so much of EQ is hosed is because the guys working on it really are not with the program here, they are just kids with no college behind them.<P>Right now, EQ is the only thing worthwhile out there, thats why there are so many players, I fully expect that when real competition comes out that VI will get a HUGE wake up call in the form of half their subscribers...<P>SkrewVI.......<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I totally agree. I must admit, ive come to develop a pretty cold hatred of VI just from dealing with GMs/Guides/CS people. And they were wondering how they got the 'players vs. VI' attitude started... bloody idiots.<P>As for Abashi, that guy needs some counseling, and needs to quit taking constructive criticism as a slap in the face. He has no business being in the position hes in with an attitude like that, and VI staff like him will be the cause of the downfall of EQ.<P>About the bitching enough = getting what you want... hmm... time to cron an email complaining about Raster for every 10 minutes hehehe...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Oh wardaddy horseshit,<BR>    If you dont care so much, why the fuck did you bother to read this post? Sure, it doesn't really effect the game at all (they've been doin things like that since day 1), but it's still entertaining to read.<BR>    Their comps are pieces of trash, he just said that to shut up those people who've been saying 'the emulator will never work, ppl's comps just cant handle it!'. As for the logging, I personally KNOW that they log things like that.<BR>     I have a friend who was the leader of a prominant guild (recently taken over by a hosehead.) The hosehead was able to tell my friend what day he had gotten a certain weapon, how much he paid for it, why he had gotten a special deal on it, and who he had gotten it from. He was ALSo able to say when that guy had originally gotten the item. Scary shit.<BR>     He either accidentally spilled something (check his post. "In the time I worked there, I never saw him..."), or thought to put in a small little nuance. Either way, I don't really care about that part. Most of us Zombies are guides, I would imagine.<BR>     EQ is dead. That's all there is to it. VI may not see it, but they will within the next 6 months, as MMO after MMO are released. Suddenly they will lose most of their population. Most ppl will keep their accounts for a few months after it's released, just in case they dont like it. But then, come november or so, accounts will be mass cancelled.<BR>                     <BR>---------------------------------------------<BR>Thus saith the soothsayer of VI's destruction</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Your right Rowal used to be on the SEQ team. From my understanding, he had a hand in the redesign of the interface (for EQ not SEQ).<P>I personally only dealt with a GM once. There was a bug and I lost an item. The guide confirmed the bug, but couldnt do anything about it. He gave me the email address of the GM since he wasnt on (this was about a year and a half ago). I emailed him, told him what happened and told him what the guide said. I got an email back saying that he could not restore my item and that any further communication must be done in game.<P>I guess I probably got the guide fired huh. I never really thought about it until now. It is ashame because he really did seem to try to help me.<P>I do agree with the CS issues. The guides always seem to say "There is nothing I can do" which is really pretty much true. They have so many damn restrictions on them. Then you get the idiots at the 800-station number. I think they are the worst. Between that ROK cd BS (They never did give me that supposed refund) and the double billing (has happened to me twice in the 2 years I have been there and only got 1 taken off). They treat you like you are the enemy.<P>By the way...spamming them didnt seem to get me anywhere with the ROK refund. I must have sent at least 30 pieces of email to every email address I could find (Including Sony). I only got back something like 2 autogenerated "thank you for your comments, we will review your email shortly" type of email.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree with WarDaddy.  I completely agree with everything he said, except for one comment, which I'd just like to elaborate on.  In the event that Verant generates massive logs of anything and everything in relation to your gameplay, do you honestly think they search each file every single day?  I'd be more convinced that they search those logs weekly for any signs on cheating.  And even so, their search couldn't be 100% accurate what with the amount of data those logs hold.  I used to use the Trainer from WizzyFR's site and I never once was mysteriously booted for cheating or emailed or what have you.  The log files are only as useful as the people who check them, and if ½ of the damn Verant staff are complete morons, I don't think their "security" is very tight.

Not to say that a GM is either great or a dick, but the dicks could have easily confimed my bug, but were too lazy or something, and one of the great GMs actually helped me almost immedietly, another couldn't but did everything he could to try, and even apologized for it. And told me to E-Mail Verant... and it's Verant's fault the e-mail was never replied.  the third checked my logs, found out the the quest NPC stole my items, and apologized, and handed me the quest item i was supposed to get... then summoned me to Halas, where i was headed, to make up for the time spent waiting for him.<P>I've only talked to GMs on bertoxx, but they seem to help alot!<BR> - Icon<BR>---------------------<BR>In memory of MasTerKeyZ</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Sounds all true to me. I had a first hand exp with a GM that was a whore of a uber guild. I was one of the 10 creaters of the Guild "Rebirth" on Tholuxe Paells and well I couldnt stand thier pussy tactics on giving out loot and how they cant take jokes or even joke around. Ok, heres the story. I was in Seb with my necro and off drops a "Staff of the Waterwalker" well seeing I never get loot the group gives it to me. Well, We raided PoG for the first time on the server got crappy drops and whatnot as usuall, every one complained. well we go back the next day, we get in trouble and I aka "Suicide Gnome" die for the 50th time so I say "Damn you bastard clarics heal me :P" well the claric has a fit and ACTUALLY gates from PoG and leaves the guild. Ok, WTF? now my friend Ashek starts talking shit to me, hes the guild leader saying I am on a short string from getting booted from the guild... WTF? yeah, So I tell them to go fuck them selfs and I gate and disban. well I stope dplaying Tholuxe. I log in about a month later and I get this random /tell from a GM named "Valaq" saying I stole a Staff from some one and that I needed to give it to him. OK WTF? he goes on to threaten me with Suspension or banning if I did not give it to him on the bases that I "Cursed" in the game. In the en I give him the fucking staff and toss him the old One Fingured salute and log. well, Valaq suck my dick you dirty bastard!<P>------------------<BR>Give me back my stuff, you slut!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ummm Gm's don't do Shit about talking about the EMU or Hq or Tel0net's site or the Wizzy site...Believe me, I was in chat and mentioned all three, Either the GM was cool with it or somthing. Don't go flaming me. I didn't give a Link so No "3|337 HaXoRz" will be here anytime soon. I mentioned the DX windows program and the Gm actualy Acknowledged me as being right! Didn't get a warning the whole time. So OOC all you want Just make sure its not "THAT" time of the month for female GM's or make sure the Guy GM is in a pretty good mood. They Usualy Won't do shit. I have gotten ONE warning my entire account life, and thats over a 2 year period, IE beta.

</FONT><HR>I agree with you on everything except one tihs Skrew...<P>As  former GM (quit about 3 - 4 months ago due to 6 hours a week being too much time for me) GMs do not have direct access to what you are saying when you are saying it. They have logs though so they can check it later, but not as you are saying it. Also, not all GMs work the same on all servers, different servers run things different ways. Yea, there is some favoritism that i've seen and a lot of other stuff. And on the server I was assigned to they did not tell us to "be your worst enemy." All the GMs that I knew on my server were very helpful and I recieved no complaints from players in my time as a guide. That's about it. <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000036&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ok, a few answers -<P>No, I do not have anything from VI, no D3D, no lists, nada.  Not that any of it would help or assist anyhow, its all game specific stuff.<P>As for the log files, there are tons, most are searchable with a special program, others must be accessed through an internal website.  Like I said, the information is there, but most GM's are too lazy to bother with it.  <P>Just beware that the game is evolving FAST, as soon as something is found out, it is taken care of, like your favourite exploit or hack.  If something is discovered that is that bad, they will get the programmers out of bed on a weekend to fix it.  Will VI make the same mistakes on their next games? I doubt it, they have learned from EQ and will take the lessons to heart.  That, of course, does not mean that they will not create all new mistakes within their 'vision'.  <P>As for moving characters, it is quite easy to do. Its a simple matter of picking up two files, (one is your character and the other your faction table) and moving it to a directory on the server you want to be on.  Its a 10 second job that is done with a few mouseclicks.<P>Don't get me wrong here, I LIKE the game, but am very dis-enchanted with it.  I never realized just how large of a snow-job VI was pulling over you.  The deception and lies are huge, with the end result nothing more than to keep you playing longer and longer....<P><BR>SKrewVI............</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002502.cgi&ReplyNum=000037&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+speak+with+information">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
