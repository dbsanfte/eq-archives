<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Well, to the reply above this one. First, I read many of the posts and replies. From what I've noticed, I probably have more capability getting most programs to run under Linux because I've used it for a decent amount of time. You won't find me asking how to delete a directory structure or how to TAR or GZIP or whatever. Either way I *DID* get the damn thing working. 

To Ratt:
Well, you can be as self-rightious as you wish. You create a trend, support it and you gain recognition for it. Sincere interest grows, then you go and get a moral about what it is you are doing. You could probably even make a decent payback for all your wonderful work if you asked for a "subscription" to receive updates. For those who are serious about the game and the utility, the would HAPPILY donate to your case (if that hasn't already taken place). 

It's my opinion and I REPEAT, *my opinion* that the reasons for not continuing to support this software or helping other to learn how to do it on their own (and I'm NOT sifting through an ungodly amount of posts for those jewels when someone who is truly organized would create an appropriate document for such a feat) and then the burden is lifted from your shoulders. The problem I see here is that this work seems to be SOMEWHAT shrouded in mystery and lame responses to sincere questions. 

If you had any qualms about creating such a piece of work, perhaps you shouldn't have undertaken it. Now, you have followers (or straglers, however you wish to see it) and you've closed the door on them. SURE I think they have a right to be upset. I've known about SEQ for some time and tried to get it working once in the past when it wouldn't even TRACK my own character (properly). And sure, it IS a waste of *MY* time when I take a perfectly working Dell laptop, with Win2K Pro on it, blow away the OS and put RH7.2, then download the software, it doesn't work, so I do the RIGHT thing and read posts so as to not bother the "elite" with idiot questions, then learn that THAT week, the author isn't supporting it any longer. Well CRAP. There are more folks interested in me getting this done then just my own desire to have an edge in the game. 

I'm not saying guilt should lie in your heart or something like that. I just took the time to create a proper environment specifically for your wonderful creation (no sarcastic intent) and then get let down because it looks like you had a change of heart. Folks need to play the game the right way, it's not fair to the rest of the players. 

Well, this isn't a competition against ME and the other players. If they want to play "by the rules" then more power to them. In life, you take all the breaks that come your way, otherwise you waste your precious time..This is a competition between time and myself. I'd like to spend LESS time trying to get somewhere (this probably applies to most people in life about just everything). 

So I took the steps to figure this out and I got SEQ running without asking anyone any questions. 

Ratt: You also replied saying your wasted MY time, if you re-read the significant part, I say you wasted OUR time, the time of the folks who set out to use this tool and can't get it to work because of the hodge-podge of libEQ.a files that will now be floating all over the place while user frantically scramble to try to get it to work. 

I do agree with you, the world doesn't owe me shit. It wasn't my intention to make you think you owe ME anything. I would figure you owe it to your "followers" or "crowd" or whatever you wish to call them. 

If you would, explain this to me though..what do you mean that I am the type of person who would not use SEQ responsibly? What is responsible/irresponsible use of this software? It would be irresponsible of me to shout (or OOC) to others that ShowEQ rules. It would be irresponsible of me to flaunt it in front of EQ. I wish the product to LIVE, and the less Veriant knows about it, the better. Do I use it for an "edge" in the game, well, HELL YES! To I tell anyone I do not know that I am? Hell no...so, what do you mean by implying that I wouldn't use it in a responsible manner?

I like your response, sounds like you are reasonable and mature (except for the cursing../grin).

Anyway, It's time to get in the game. I just wanted to see what replies I got on this post. Apparently there are more supporters of you not supporting SEQ then there are folks who are interested in seeing it live on. Well, whatever..I'm in the wrong crowd then.
