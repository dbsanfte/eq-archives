Just keep on trying to drop something valueless (like fishing grubs) in the general area you are checking out.  If the mob is in front of you and close enough, the "NPC give item" window comes up AND the mob will be targetted.<P>On second thought, try repeatedly dropping a No Drop item.

It would be fun to find out.<P>TSD</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BeefCake!!!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Over the last month, I've used my enchanter to PL a druid.  Got it from 1 to 20 in a little over an hour, then on up to lvl 40 in right about 1 day of PL'ing.  He's now lvl 44 at 40 hrs played.  I have noticed abnormalities on a regular basis, and I'm wondering if anyone might be able to shed some light on what's been happening.  Do GM's have an alert if a player is gaining exp at an excellerated rate?  Here's a list of the things I've been seeing - and I'm wondering if a GM might have been standing near by, witnessing my PL'ing and decided to fuk with me...<BR>1) Pull a cactus with tash, cast ensnare.  Ensnare breaks immediately.  Recast ensnare - breaks immediately.<BR>2) Cast charm on chiken - resist.  Fine.  Cast colorflux - resist.  Cast root - resist. (Mean while, I'm attempting to cast ensnare from the druid with repeated resists).  Cast root - resist.  These have long since been green mobs, and I'd get full resists.  It continues long enough for me to get low on mana and pissed off to the point where I have to zone.<BR>3) Cast a spell with long cast time (I think it might have been a charm), and I got a RESIST message BEFORE my spell was completed.  I have a screenshot of it, but my pic converter app is hosed, so I've gotta get another one.<BR>4) Method of PL was going great for about 90 minutes, then it seemed as though EVERY npc that was within a 1000' radius agro'd me.  Even all the cacti that are normally otherwise indifferent.  It reminded me of the way Cazic calls for his minions - things were swarming to me.  I colorstuned, and hit over 15 creatures.<BR>5) While PL'ing at the lake near Skyfire entrance, I caught "a cliff golem" on tracking.  It alarmed me, because this normally doesn't happen - so I stopped PL'ing to see what it was doing.  It came straight for my druid, past every other NPC in front of it to smack my druid.<BR>-All these have occurred at least once, and on different days.  Some occurring in the same play session.<BR>I average right around 3mil exp through power leveling in the OT - provided the dragoons don't come roaming by, but they have a short agro range so I'm normally ok.  Pulls are consistant enough so that I can get 1 or 2 kills per minute.<P>My question, is whether GM / guides have the ability to screw with players in the ways I've mentioned.  I know VI has a neutral policy against PL'ing, being that they can't stop it by interfering - but if they can't be caught doing it, are they able to?<BR>I remember reading a post where Lady Dagaermo would do things like this, although I don't remember the specifics.  I need to get SEQ working so that I have definite proof that a GM / guide is there.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">adenine!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Guides definitely do not have the ability, GMs I don't think so, but anything's possible.  There have been faster powerlevelings and nothing seemed to go wrong with them so I would strongly doubt it.  I'm not quite sure if you can see invisible Guides or GMs on ShowEQ.  You definitely used to be able to but I'm not sure if it's possible anymore.  You can see any light emitted, hear footsteps, or, if you're underwater, hear the water treading sound of an invisible Guide or GM, so I know the data is still being sent to the client.  However they may have changed the packet format around so it wouldn't work with SEQ without anyone noticing.  If Verant was thinking they would just have the server send down the "remove spawn from zone" packet when a Guide goes invis, but I guess they don't care enough to bother.<P>I've never seen an NPC named Pain and suffering on ShowEQ, I think that's just the way the client puts it when you're getting attacked by something that's not supposed to be there.<P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rahvin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Thanks Narc, I had forgotten about starting a trade with them, that seems to be the best bet.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">D23</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Beefcake, you got chain aggroed. It happens sometimes (handy at lower level power leveling, deadly to a high level group.)<P>The resist before the charm message was just a dropped packet or two.. no biggie. As to the resists in general, you do realize that those castus vary in levels like crazy right? Some may be way green, others just barely green. And the same named thing one one side of the zone may be level 15 but on the other side of the zone it is about lvl 30 or so..<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BeefCake!!!</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hehe well, the cacti are lvl 38 max - My enchanter is 53..  Concievably, by rule of the "minimum resists" theory that I've been hearing about, I shouldn't get more then a few resists on something that's 20 levels lower.  That's all...<BR>Packet loss could be described for having a resist before spell completion, but I'd like to think it's not the case (Ping time is normally 15ms with just about no PL) - I've got 4 hops or so to the log in server.<BR>Thanks for the replies though =)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Gulzin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Terminal Spirit Disease - It only says Pain and Suffering because it has no name and Pain and Suffering is the default name for creatures.. it isn't the same pain and suffering that kills you.<P>this one hits for 120... quads usually</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i found one standing in middle of nife water. i got hit with quad of 320 ( i died really fast since i had just 40 hp that time, a lvl 1 wiz mule ) <P>i gave it a dagger to make it visiable ( turned off drop items so i could click like mad ) dmg was insane. it just come, quad hit me. when i come back it went back to its hidden "palform" in middle of water.<P>name was blank ( when targeted ) but pain and suffering hit me.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">AppleKid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> That's pretty interesting... are there a lot of not visible creatures all around Norrath? It's kinda cool to consider an alternate dimension of beings just standing around watching the creatures of the material plane live day to day.<BR> Any good typical spots to find these things, or is this a toy for ShowEQ folks only?<P> Oh, and, isn't it true GMs can make themselves into NPCs and take the guise of a normal monster in a zone?</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">a_mage01</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The blank NPCs are for quests.

The name of one in kael is "A_bag_of_supplies00"<P>I belive the NPCs with BLANK names are place holders of some sort, Possibly some area where verants spawn system lacks hard code so they use that as a way to do a certian thing..

For example, in North Karana there are like 5-15 of them named You or Your and they're what makes it say "Your head gets stuffy" and that crap when you get near them.  Some of them are used to entertain people with ShowEQ, I think the only ones being the "ShowEQ users are lame" ones in PoH.  There are also some that I have no idea what purpose they serve like in Iceclad there are a few whose names are numbers like 1 and 2.  They all have names the client just doesn't always show them.  Usually they're level 1 or 60.  Your best bet for finding them is ShowEQ obviously, but I don't know why you would want to find them since you will probably either A. not be able to attack them or B. get killed if you are able to.<P>------------------<BR>Behold the power of the search feature.<BR>plz, thx, u, and ur make baby Jesus cry.<p>[This message has been edited by adenine!

I believe a guildie of mine got killed by faydedar in tim. deep by accidentally doing something to his invisible unnamed form before he was triggered.
