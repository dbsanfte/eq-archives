They believe that the shootings would never have happened if it weren't for video games, and the suit is for $5 Billion. Personally I think this is retarded, especially since politicians like Ashcroft and Liberman are jumping on this anti-video game bandwagon.  Anyways if you feel like I do, please go to http://www.petitiononline.com/game/petition.html to voice your opinion.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Rahvin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I don't usually support off topic stuff like this, but I do agree.

Some people are born with psychological problems.<P>And Another_One_Banned, I'm don't have the best morals at all, but come on...

They have no one to blame, if the kids were here that would blame them but seeing as how they went down with their own bullets the parents have to blame media and such. To feel as if they have accomplished somthing in the time that their child has been shot they blame society.<P>Vamp...Man thats just wrong, the whole HL level mod he better not publish the map with his email, the Parent groups would take it as another attack threat ortraining to do sonething like it.<P>Another_one_banned...ok thats just insane, don't do shit like that. some authorities don't think its funny, they take it pretty damn serious.<P>No ones to blame except:<P>1. the shooters not being able to control themselves.<BR>2. the kids mocking their looks and attitude.<P>So I Hold those two catagories responsible. NONE OTHER! Was it the meadia coaxing them to pull the trigger? NO! It was actualy their index finger that did it. No one to blame now not even their parents!<P>Wel I have a test in 30 min on a FUCKING saturday so...<P>------------------<BR>Clerics Don't fear death...We fear the walk AFTER death!<BR><B>Guardian X</B></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Another_one_banned</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">those are just words idiots.

And just like any home-grown Doom map there almost invariably had to be a cyberdemon in it. Mine was in the office.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"><BR> (oh, and, when you boot your computer and it freezes on startup and you hear your hard drive click like a madman, letting it go for several hours is a bad idea... I can't hook an ATX power supply to a power timer, and that's a good thing with this hindsight)<P> The problem is that everyone wants someone to blame. It's an extention of that "it could never happen to me" ... that is, "it could never happen to me so it must be someone else's fault." What really pisses me off is that for every one of these fucked up kids there's at least a dozen million others who play violent games that *shock* don't kill their neighbors. I mean, how many copies of Doom sold? And how many more were pirated?<P> Some people need to learn that bad things happen. Murder is probably the oldest crime in human history, next to theft. Is it the parent's fault? Maybe. Everyone knows that the media spends more time showing footage of Quake and that video of the kid getting hit by a car by Jackass fans than looking into the murderer's life.<P> Hell, if the kid was an accident, how about after the video game company suit they can sue the condom manufacturer.<P>(I'm thinking of a sig---<BR>-----<BR>Leauge of American Citizens that Aren't Complete Idiots)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i always has belived the way the kids is rainsed is the main reason. games MIGHT bring bad traits out but traits is there adready by rainsing. <P>for example i saw one 2 year old kid walking around alone. he walked across streets etc. i almost hit him because he was in shadows and sun was shining at my face. lucky i was traving like 2 mph because of hard to see. ( apartments roads ) wtf where was the parents? <P>i also saw like 5 kids all young age play and fight alone. i didnt see any parent watching. <P><BR>if you has a kid or kids please invest more time. it'll be worth it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Cigarskunk</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm guessing that no-one remembered reading or seeing any of the details and interviews with the kid's parents - the Comlumbine killer's folks weren't even close to finishing in the bottom 10% of the parent of the year contest - those folks were pure losers - I'm betting the law suite is just them exploiting the atrocity committed by their kids as well as trying to shift the blaim off of themselves - "It's not our fault our kids blew away their classmates and teachers because we didn't bother raising them right, it's the game companies."<P>As for the comment that the classmates were partially to blaim for taunting them - what universe did you come from where kids didn't taunt and tease each other?!?!?<P>------------------<BR>Skunks have feelings too.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Vazz</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hey AppleKid I did the same thing, I made of doom map of my school too. And I managed to go through high school without shooting anyone. And Another_one_banned I thought you were kinda funny. I dont know why everyone gets so offensive when people make jokes about these things.<BR>Kids who kill people have problems.

I remember back in highschool working on a half-life map of my school.  I was sitting in the commons one day on my laptop, working on it, when my principal walks up behind me and starts watching (I don't notice).  Instead of suspending me, he starts giving me the actual dimensions of the school so the map can be more realistic!</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
