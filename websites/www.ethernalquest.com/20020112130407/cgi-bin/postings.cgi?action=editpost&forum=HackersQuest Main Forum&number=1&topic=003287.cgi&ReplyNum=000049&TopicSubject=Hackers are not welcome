<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Reading this thread is quite humorous for me, a lurker here. Smed's post seemed to me to be real without the email confirmation. Why? Though it's rather short, it's very direct and to the point. Even if this isn't the real thing (which future posts seem to imply it is), it matches his communication style.

Now, for some of what I find humorous:
Vamp - I doubt this is the real Smed. Did you know it is very illegal to impersonate someone over the internet?

And what law would that be Vamp?

Tux Racer - I'm wondering why your e-mail address isn't @station.sony.com like the others. Nice try pal.

Tux, perhaps you're a tad new to this game. The game was produced by 989 Studios, which one way or another became Verant Interactive, which was purchased by Sony. The verant.com email address is what was in place prior to station.sony.com and, though I thought it was replaced completely, logic dictates that both addresses work to get to the same place. Nice try pal.

Orboe_Lowblow - [useless explitives defining the lack of communication skills removed]. I suggest you leave here Hitler, and take your Verant bullshit with you, there are other ways to deal with this, then banning people, then making the tech support number A TOLL CHARGE, and you cannot cancel your account using eq.exe because when you try it just says your account has been banned, go to hell you bastard and get a life, THANK GOD my eq addiction is over!

Orboe, you flame him for banning cheaters? Clearly you think that instead, he/they should just fix things to make it unhackable. On the assumption that you yourself are not just a leach using others hacks to cheat with, the only reason you would want them to make the game "unhackable" is to provide you further challenge to hack it. Of course, we both know that you can't hack your way out of a glass box given a sledge hammer, so that point is moot. Verant wants the game to be unhackable so that all can be playing the same game. Why do they ban those that cheat? Those that cheat make Verant spend money to fix the problem. This money could rather be spent on new content, like Shadows of Luclin and whatever might come next, if it wasn't a higher priority to stop cheating from happening. Personally, I know you don't care about that so don't waste bandwidth telling me.

Phantal - paraphrased: log hacks, who cares. Make it work in a window.

Here here! Rock on bro.

Another One Banned 2 - LOLROFLMAO Its not hacking you idiot! Its MY memory fool. Go away idot F***r.

It's hacking your memory, fool. More importantly it's altering how your game plays when connected to THEIR server, something you agree to not do each time you start the game. Finally, Assuming "F***r" can be reasonably interpreted to "Fuckr", you're missing an e. Stop hacking your memory so much and these things might not happen.

Valorum - Smedley.. I know your tellin the truth, and I know its you, but I just hope you did it 100% legally cause with so many people being banned, especially with the programming genious's on this board, they're going to pick it all appart.

It isn't difficult to put in checks for what a client is doing, at the server side. In fact, by putting something in the client side (which would be needed to put something that invaded your privacy in), that could be hacked to be turned off. Give Verant more credit than that  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif">

Bio_War - paraphrased "bet only non-uber-guilds got banned, but i might be wrong"

I know you admitted to being wrong, just 2 posts later... but why talk out of your ass in the first place? Trying to get the # posts counter to increase for yourself?

Adioman - Why don't someone just ask em how they did it? They gotta tell us right? If it's legal then they have nothing to worry about.

They don't have to tell you anything about how they did it. They can ban someone for any reason they choose, including not liking the color of armor they place on their character. If you think your privacy has been invaded by this american company, use american law. Prove them guilty, because they're presumed innocent until you do.

Valorum - Whats the big advantage of running a little faster? 

If there's no benefit, why does the AC get KS'd so much? You later ask why it warrents banning. The answer is really simple: it's cheating. More importantly, anyone who cheated to increase their speed KNEW they would get banned if caught. Many simply didn't think they could get caught. To those banned over it... get over this. You tried, you lost. End of story.

Dor! - you know in the first place you aren't susposed to hack, so why bother? they tell you you will be banned, you accpect that you will not hack when you enter EQ, and as you said they make the rules...

In a different thread, Dor! posts something akin to "If you don't like that people cheat here, play somewhere else".

Dor, I can't figure out what side of the fence you're on. Personally, I would prefer people not cheat, and I'm glad Verant takes steps to actively discourage it. I also recognize the joy of hacking something like this as well as the sense of accomplishment. I would prefer those who did this (I know they're not going to be stopped; trying to stop them only makes it more rewarding) had a place they could maturely enjoy their challenge without the massive number of leaches that exist out here -- most of the leaches are recognizable in how they choose their wording (fuck you blah blah my kewl sp34k skillz r better then urs).

il128 - LOL! If you're so good at catching "cheaters" why bother with the threats? Oh, because you suck ass at catching cheaters...

Verant is still running a business. Every $10/month they ban is that much less profit and it adds up. More importantly, the time spent to catch someone cheating is time they can't put to more useful purpose. If he can come online and pursued 10% of the people cheating to stop, his 5 minute post saved quite a lot of paperwork in the long run. If you want to cheat, go ahead and cheat. Maybe he'll catch you and maybe he wont. I'll even say... probably he wont since there's so many of you to try to catch... but he'll catch some of you, and it seems there is no first offence slap on the wrist. Spin the wheel and take your chances.
