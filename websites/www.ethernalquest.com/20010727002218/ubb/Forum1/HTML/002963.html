</FONT><HR>So your a n00b. What a suprise. We all didnt know that from the very beginning. You were right, we are all dumb and fell for your trick. We couldnt tell a gay thirteen year old's page from a professional's. You are right about all this. I apologize from the bottom of my heart for ever attempting to knock some sense into you.<BR>What IS interesting, however, is the fact that I have your ICQ# and your email address, along with other things I dare not disclose. But, because we were all fooled, and we all know more than you, in the matter of computers (and basic English, might I add), aren't you a tad scared? I mean, I understand that you weren't scared before, now that you have cleared that up for us, but how about now. Your cornered by us posting and the other hundreds reading. You can joke about your emulator, I guess I can joke about your personal information? I mean, it is possible to get it through ICQ and AOL, so why not post it here? What is stopping me?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002963.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Truth+about+Quest4reality">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>The thing you did MAKES enemies, which is what you don't seem to understand. Pardon the sarcasm in my last post, but I knew from the very beginning that you had no emulator, because you had nothing to show for it except some edited pictures on a fake webpage. Yeah uh huh, you sure fooled me. Because just like before I say that hacking is not a joke and it should not be joked around with. Verant watches these boards what happens when they get your email address, the same that you used to register in EQ? What then?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002963.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Truth+about+Quest4reality">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">
