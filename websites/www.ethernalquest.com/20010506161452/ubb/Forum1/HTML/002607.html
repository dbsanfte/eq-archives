</FONT><HR>Scruffy was bored... Scruffy made a FAQ about Luclin...<BR>---<BR>FAQ - OVERVIEW<BR>---<BR>Question: WTF is EQ: SoL?<BR>Verant: EverQuest: the Shadows of Luclin is an expansion to the world-renowned game EverQuest. <BR>Translation: It's a way to make more $$ off of EverQuest.<BR>---<BR>Question: What's in Luclin?<BR>Verant: Here is a partial feature list. Please note that this feature set is subject to change prior to release.<BR>Translation: Some of these features may be removed before release. Remember how Velious and Kunark were supposed to be in the original EQ release? This is just like that.<BR>Verant: A massively enhanced 3D graphics engine that makes use of newer technologies allowing us to support higher poly counts and more detailed textures.<BR>Translation: We're putting more graphics into our 6 year old 3D Graphics engine that is still buggy as hell.  We're also integrating new technologies to make more people crash on load.<BR>Verant: Over 25 new zones including a new starting city<BR>Translation: 25 new zones that may or may not make it to release. If they don't it will be downloaded 2 years later (See: Paineel, Hole, Warrens, StoneBrunt). We're also putting in a starting city for that race that should have been in the original EQ release, the Kierrans.<BR>Verant: All new, highly detailed player-character models<BR>Translation: That will not show up and probably break every non Luclin player's client. Plus, watch those framerates because this is bound to slow down even the fastest 3D Card with our uber broken engine.<BR>Verant: An all-new player character race: The Vah Shir (Kerrans)<BR>Translation: Finally, we got around to putting in a race that was supposted to be put in on EverQuest's Release 2 years ago.<BR>Verant: An all-new player character class: The Beastlord<BR>Translation: We're putting in a new class that is a combination of the broken ranger class and the broken shadow knight's pets. <BR>Verant: Additional non-level-based advancement options for those at level 60<BR>Translation: More ubermobs for uberguilds. We couldn't let FoH down, could we?<BR>Verant: New quests, items, NPCs, and more!<BR>Translation: More broken quests, broken items, broken NPCs, and more broken stuff. Of course, we'll fix anything that broke and gives player an advantage, but we'll ignore anything that gives the player a disadvantage.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will I need an ubersystem to play Luclin?<BR>Verant: Yes, Luclin is a very ambitious title. In addition to a rich in-character feature set, Luclin will sport some of the most stunning visuals yet to be seen in online games. In order to achieve this, the minimum system specification for Luclin will roughly coincide with that of games being released today.<BR>Verant: The system specs will be released closer to the expansion's release date.<BR>Translation: We're tinkering with the 6 year old EverQuest engine to put more visual effects into it. Unfortunatly, since our engine sucks, you're going to need a Uber System to play Luclin.<BR>---<BR>Question: When's Luclin going to be relased?<BR>Verant: Luclin will go live in December of this year.<BR>Translation: We're trying to get Luclin released, completed or not, just in time for the Christmas shopping season. We hope that a release during this time will maximize our wallets.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will there be a beta?<BR>Verant: Yes. Luclin will be tested via a closed beta system expected to begin around August. People will be invited individually based upon past demonstrated desire to test and assist in EverQuest's development. As such, people who actively play on the Test server will get priority.<BR>Translation: We're going to do a closed "test" around August. You need not apply though if you aren't a: A) VAK; B) VAK Test Server Player<BR>---<BR>Question: How will I get Luclin? Will it be sold like Velious?<BR>Verant: Yes, Luclin will be sold; however the precise format of sales is still to be determined.<BR>Translation: We're going to sell Luclin like Velious because we got a lot of money from the sale of Velious to all EverQuest players, unlike the Kunark upgrade which you could buy bundled with the original EverQuest package. We're working on ways to maximize profit with this expansion, so we don't know how we're going to sell it exactly yet.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will I need to buy Luclin for each account?<BR>Verant: Yes, you will need to buy a copy of Luclin for each account that you wish to access Luclin content.<BR>Translation: You didn't think you we were going to let you upgrade 4 accounts with one box? Come on, we need to make some $$ from this!!<BR>---<BR>WHINEPLAY/GAMEPLAY<BR>---<BR>Question: Where is Luclin?<BR>Verant: Luclin is the name of the ringed moon that orbits Norrath which currently can only been seen via the Plane of Sky. We expect that Al`Kabor will soon pierce the veil of shadow that hides it from view elsewhere in Norrath. <BR>Translation: The current moon will be magically transformed during a patch by changing the texture from Sky.s3d/Moon.bmp to Sky.s3d/Saturn.bmp<BR>---<BR>Question: What level range will Luclin support?<BR>Verant: Luclin will support players of all levels, much like Kunark.<BR>Translation: Luclin will support players of all levels in theory, but they will have to run through several high level zones to get there. For example, think of the Firiona to Lake of Ill Omen sprint for level 20's.<BR>---<BR>Question: Is there Life after level 60?<BR>Verant: No, but we are planning on including some non-level-based advancement options for those who wish to advance their characters further. The advancement will be measurable but subtle, so-as not to give anyone the feeling that they are required to advance as many felt upon the release of Kunark.<BR>Translation: We're putting more ubermobs with uberloots that HOPEFULLY FoH will not be able to kill. But knowing FoH, they'll be dead 2 weeks after release.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will Luclin Players that weren't suckered into Kunark and Velious be able to reach 60?<BR>Verant: Yes.<BR>Translation: We needed to put in some incentive for people that weren't suckered into Kunark and Velious!!<BR>---<BR>Question: How do you get to Luclin?<BR>Verant: Giant steam-powered gnomish rocketships…<BR>Translation: No way to translate a bad joke... I'll just put it this way: "Who's your daddy?"<BR>Verant: Just kidding. Keep an eye on the Journal of Al`Kabor. Something tells me he may have some idea about how it's accomplished.<BR>Translation: Keep reading our website, sucker. We'll tell you when we're ready to release this thing.<BR>---<BR>THE RACE FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE KERRANS/THE VAH SHIR<BR>---<BR>Question: WTF are the Vah Shir? Is that like Venril Sathir?<BR>Verant: The Vah Shir are a race of noble cat people that were wiped off Odus and deposited on Luclin many years ago in the test of a great weapon by the Erudites. The weapon, aimed at the Vah Shir home city of the same name, flung the entire city and the inhabitants therein through space, leaving what is now known as The Hole. Without their nobility, the remaining cat people, dubbed "Kerrans" by the Erudites, were easily rounded up and segregated to Kerra Isle.<BR>Translation: In our "story", the Kerrans were shot all of the way to the moon by Erudites many years ago (giving a new meaning to the saying: "To the moon!!"). The Erudites basically  transported an entire city to the moon, leaving what is now known as "The Hole" (contrary to the "story" that the hole was created during the civil war between Erudites and the Erudite Necromancers at Paineel (See story below) - What's a few more holes (pun intended) in the EQ "storyline").<BR>A brief history of the Hole: The Hole was created at the end of the Erudin/Heretic war, when the Heretics used their magical powers to punch a hole in the earth deep into the depths of Odus. Within this deep shaft they built their city of Paineel. However, they penetrated too deeply and, unknown to them at first, they had touched upon the Plane of Underfoot itself, which had been cast onto the earth in eons past. In the years after the city was built, they became aware of the enemy below them and attempted to block them in, but with the arrival of the great Master Yael, the elementals and minions of Brell swept through the city on one gruesome night, destroying everything in their path. The Heretics were forced to retreat to their highest outpost, the site of the current city of Paineel. (From EQAtlas.com)<BR>---<BR>Question: Will I need to get Luclin to play the Race Formerly Known as Kerrans?<BR>Verant: Though everyone's client will download the Vah Shir character model in order to allow viewing of those of the Vah Shir race, you will need Luclin in order to play one.<BR>Translation: Even though you'll have almost everything you need to play the Race Formerly Known as Kerrans besides the home zone, you'll not be able to play them unless you buy Luclin. Think of it as another incentive to purchase Luclin.<BR>---<BR>THE BEASTRANGER/THE BEASTLORD<BR>---<BR>Question: What is BeastRangers?<BR>Verant: Beastlords are essentially hybrid class with a heavy reliance upon pets. More information will be available as we finalize the details.<BR>Translation: Beastlords are rangers with pets. More details coming.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will old races be able to be BeastRangers?<BR>Verant: At minimum, the Vah Shir will be able to be Beastlords. It is very likely, though not guaranteed, that we will open the class up to other shamanistic races.<BR>Translation: The Race Formerly Known as Kerrans will definatly be able to be BeastRangers. If we're feeling nice, we'll allow other races to be BeastRangers too.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will you need Luclin to play BeastRanger?<BR>Verant: Yes. Even if we make the Beastlord available to existing races, you will need Luclin in order to play one.<BR>Translation: You need to fork over YOUR cash to play BeastRanger. Did you think you were going to get something free out of this?!?!<BR>---<BR>NEW UBERPOLY CHARACTER MODELS/NEW CHARACTER MODELS<BR>---<BR>Question: Will there be new uberhigh-poly character models?<BR>Verant: Yes. The character models we are building are far more detailed, sporting a much higher polygon count and a greater texture depth. They seem more lifelike.<BR>Translation: We're adding more polyies to make everyone upgrade their computer. But, the nice side effect is that they all look nicer.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will there be new faces, face choices, and is my old character screwed?<BR>Verant: The new models will have a greater number of face options available. For those who already have characters, we will be creating faces for the new models that closely resemble the ones you chose for your old models. We may also allow players with existing characters a one-time choice of a new face for each character, but that's not guaranteed at the moment.<BR>Translation: We're putting in new faces and we're HOPING that the face you get on the new model will be pretty much the same as the old face you choose. But, if they don't come out too well, your old character is pretty much screwed. But, maybe if we're feeling nice, we'll put in a way to change your face one time only.<BR>---<BR>Question: I don't have an ubercomputer!! Tell me that there will be an off switch!!<BR>Verant: While we sincerely doubt that will be the case, we will include an option to continue display of the old models.<BR>Translation: We're going to try to put an off switch in time for release, but it will probably be hard to set (think turning on the Velious textures).<BR>---<BR>Question: Are you redoing all player races?<BR>Verant: We're also planning on making new models for anything that players can become. <BR>Translation: We're planning on making new models for EVERY PC race. We want to make the system requirements as high as possible.<BR>---<BR>Question: Will there be more animations to slow down my CPU?<BR>Verant: Yes, we're doing all new combat and social animations, including differentiating animations based upon what you happen to have in your hands at the given time. In other words, a kick carrying one weapon will look different than a kick while carrying two weapons.<BR>Translation: After 2 years of saying "We can't do that", we did the impossible: We made the slash weapon animation look different than a blunt weapon animation. Think of it as another incentive to buy Luclin. We want your $$!!<BR>Verant: In addition, we're working on another aspect of animation that will simply blow you away. Unfortunately we can't talk about it just yet.<BR>Translation: We're working on an ubersecret project that will be causing EVERYONE to crash to desktop when loading EverQuest. More details to come.<BR>---<BR>THE END<P>------------------<BR>-Scruffy the MEANIE<p>[This message has been edited by Scruffy (edited 04-28-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002607.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Scruffy|APO|s+Verant+EQ:+SoL+FAQ+Translation">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Now I'm no Verant lover by any means, but I have worked a lot with product development, mostly on testing & debugging end of it.<P>Some of your 'translations' seemed somewhat on the money, but most of it sounds more like someone pulling stuff out their ass, to be quite honest.<P>To cite an example, your criticism of Verant's method of distributing Velious.  Let's see here.  After you handle duplication, paying the people who made the artwork, paying for materials for boxes, the manual to be created & actually printing the manuals, paying those who market the product, allowing distributors to have a cut on the sale of the game, shipping costs, taxes, and anything else I've missed ... just how much money do you think Verant actually received from *just* sales?  If you think they saw a single dime, you should pass some of that crack your smoking around to the rest of us, because that's some pretty strong shit.<P>As for who they use for testing, personally if I was a developer, I'd only be interested in having two types of people test my product.  Those who have been voluntarily doing it already for a long time, and people who are known to be the type to find exploits for themselves.  I think your criticism is misplaced and foolish.<P>As for their 3d engine, perhaps you'll disagree, but at least they've been making some minor attempts at improving the current engine lately, even if it was because they were forced into it by the release of DirectX 8 (and it's inability to support any featureset prior to DX7), and even though they only put token effort into it.  What this *did* do, is made them realize just how many problems their 3d engine actually has.  I think before they endeavored to make the game require directx 7, they figured it was just fine, and were literally ignoring requests for improvement and complaints from the userbase.  I'm not condoning that act, I'm simply saying that this probably turned on the light that they were preventing those of us out there complaining from turning on.<P>Your post is riddled with other lame accusations that would only be made, in my opinion, by the same kind of person who thinks elvis is still alive, and it was aliens who captured him to do experiments on him, or something otherwise lame and not very believeable.  They may have a trackrecord for stupidity, but I've seen them repeatedly follow through with promised features in the last little while, which is something uncommon for Verant.  The winds have changed, why don't you stop and smell the breese, instead of continuing to keep that clothes-line pin on your nose?<P>-Phantal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002607.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Scruffy|APO|s+Verant+EQ:+SoL+FAQ+Translation">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I've always thought of Velious as more of a 'raid oriented' expansion.  While you can go there for some items & experience in various zones, it's mostly geared toward high end raids ... and we all know that anything you are aiming for in a large raid always ends up resisting everything ... now they've just made it so the raids take longer &lt;shrug&gt;.<P>They are probably motivated by keeping people busy as long as possible, true, but I don't think that anyone here wouldn't want that.

I'd be more proud of the one that takes years, because then I know that I didn't make it too easy for anyone.<P>Anyway, what I'm hoping to see is a 3d engine that actually has a relatively good particle engine, and something that doesn't handle textures so ... &lt;sarcasm&gt; smoothly &lt;/sarcasm&gt; ;p<P>Almost forgot.  Hate Verant?  No.  I was getting tired of Itemcollector being broken, I wanted to look around the board & see if anyone had posted any info on it.  I'm looking up some info on quest components, the two pieces I need are in the item database, but when you go through the item listing CGI it doesn't show you lore text, which is what I need right now, and Itemcollector shows you that stuff.  Unfortunately, just using 'get itemlist' crashes Itemcollector.<P>-Phantal<p>[This message has been edited by Phantal (edited 04-29-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002607.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Scruffy|APO|s+Verant+EQ:+SoL+FAQ+Translation">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ok. I've decided to answer a few questions.<BR>--<BR>Q: Phantal's First Post<BR>A: It's humor. It's supposed to be funny. Yes, I do agree that Verant did handle Velious distribution better. Yes, the artist, coders, etc need to make a salery. That being said, this expansion seems to be a band-aid fix for the problems that are going to show up when EQ faces real compeition.<BR>--<BR>Q: Jaytan: Wow you cant edit a file using wordpad?<BR>A: Yes, I can edit a file in wordpad. But the question is, can a Joe User who can hardly figure out how to get in to EQ figure out how to get to the EQ directory and get into the file?<BR>--<BR>Q: nanosec: It would however be nice if Verant did an online expansion pack just to give back a little to the players.<BR>A: That would be a good idea. I mean... New Odus Zone X every 1/2 a year just doesn't cut it for free new content.<BR>Q: nanosec: Anyone ever get stuck on the Qeynos Hills zoneline because somebody was standing on the other side?<BR>A: Yes, I have had that happen before. Verant could fix the problem easily with a patch, but they don't want to.<BR>--<BR>Q: Phantal: I've always thought of Velious as more of a 'raid oriented' expansion. While you can go there for some items & experience in various zones, it's mostly geared toward high end raids ... and we all know that anything you are aiming for in a large raid always ends up resisting everything ... now they've just made it so the raids take longer &lt;shrug&gt;.<BR>A: True. But that does show that Verant does make a lot of UberGuild content in their game. I can understand 1-5 zones orentated to UberGuilds, but I can't understand a 20 zone expansion being oriented to the UberGuilds.<BR>Q: Phantal: They are probably motivated by keeping people busy as long as possible, true, but I don't think that anyone here wouldn't want that. Which would you rather have, if you were a developer. People that whiz through your game in a matter of a few months, or make it take them years? I'd be more proud of the one that takes years, because then I know that I didn't make it too easy for anyone.<BR>A: Personally, I'd like to have it take awhile, but not impose artifical downtime in the game. EverQuest has a bunch of artificial downtime. Artificial downtime is when you camp NPCs, run around the world for 3 hours trying to get to somewhere without any adventure involved (it's basically setting your client on cruise control and following a preset path you've done X times), sitting for 2 hours waiting for Health and/or Mana to get to full, or killing things for a week to get back EXP for one death.<BR>--<BR>Anyway, that's all for now.<BR>-Scruffy</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002607.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=Scruffy|APO|s+Verant+EQ:+SoL+FAQ+Translation">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>just some minor nitpicking, <P>in this question and a couple others like it:<P>Verant: A massively enhanced 3D graphics engine that makes use of newer technologies allowing us to support higher poly counts and more detailed textures.<BR>Translation: We're putting more graphics into our 6 year old 3D Graphics engine that is still buggy as hell. We're also integrating new technologies to make more people crash on load.<P><BR>you seem to be missing the point there, (and this is the one reason i'll prob by "Everquest : (you're) SoL", they arent just cramming more intensive models/textures into the existing 3d engine, they are using an entirely new 3d engine that hopefully wont be a pile of crap the current one is.<BR>imho, the screenshots i've seen look nothing like EQ does right now (gamespot article).
