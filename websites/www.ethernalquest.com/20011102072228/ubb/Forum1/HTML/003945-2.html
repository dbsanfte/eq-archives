</FONT><HR>I seriously think that once a week or 2  passes and we all look back at these threads, we'll see that we all are pretty much in agreement on at least 1 thing. Terrorism and the killing of innocents is an abhorable act no matter who is behind it.<P>All the energies we put into attempting to show or tell someone here that we disagree with certain aspects of their belief, could be better spent elsewhere. After a certain point you just realise that we are all horrified by this. No matter how diverse our ideals on the situation are, it has and will affect all of us for a long time to come.<P>There are now acts of what I would consider "homegrown terrorism" on people of Islamic belief in both the US and Canada. This is just as cowardly as tuesdays attacks. You do not attack your fellow americans just because they happen to be Muslim. Most Muslims are just as horrified as anyone else, doubly so when your own countrymen want you dead. That in and of itself is a very sad state of affairs and needs to be addressed.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000040&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>I agree. These attacks upon our fellow countrymen must stop. I don't want to see them rounded up in concentration camps either. They didn't have anything to do with the attack. Those who did deserve to die a traitors death though. Concentrate on them and let the healing begin.

</FONT><HR>I actually agree with Sohn on every issue.<BR>I too consider myself a pacifist who would rather walk away from a fight than have to hurt another human being.<BR>Everytime I hear US citizens talk of revenge I cant avoid thinking back on Hiroshima and Nakasaki.<BR>By the end of 1945 the estimated number of people who died as a direct result of the bomb in hiroshima was 140,000. (according to: http://www.csi.ad.jp/ABOMB/data.html)<BR>How many of those where innocent people? Was it really nesserary to drop those bombs? <BR>What if the Japanese had decided revenge was a better course than peace? To my best of knowleadge the Japanese was on the verge of surrender even before the Hiroshima bomb was dropped. And dropping number 2 over Nagasaki was just plain stupid IMO...<P>Ive also thought about the irony of how much publicity this terror act gets when you compare it to all the other innocent people who dies every day. <P>Nightwalker</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Sohn, A terrorist's life and a civilian's are not equal. Yes, many Americans (and others, since many nations' people died there) want them dead now, but it is a matter of defense. We want them dead to protect ourselves. They want us dead for the sheer pleasure of it. There is the difference, even if you are too thick to see it.<BR>Total pacifism is a nice ideal, but unworkable. If a murderer held your family and would kill them all unless you kill him you tell me that you would turn the other cheek and let him? How noble.<P>Nightwalker_dk the bombs dropped on Japan during the war weren't acts of revenge...they were trying to end the war. Yes, I believe they were necessary. My father was among the first to go into Tokyo harbor when the Japanese surrendered and there were masses of Japanese there who thought that they had won the war and they were seeing captured Americans. The Japanese culture at the time could not allow themselves to believe they could lose. Without those bombs, the war WOULD have dragged on and on and many more would have died on both sides. Yes, they were horrible actions during an even more horrible time, but you can not interpret them using modern day standards.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Ohso (edited 09-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Nightwalker, who told you that the japanese were about to surrender? If they were about to surrender, they would have after Hiroshima. That is why we did Nagasaki, because they still would not surrender after Hiroshima. We were at a stand still, I don't see why the japanese would be ready to surrender, if anyone would surrender at a stand still it would be us. The japanese would have kept throwing themselves at us in the name of honor.<P>------------------<BR>Obey the Giant</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>US foreign policy like any others is easy to judge in hindsight.  The question always remains where the world would be without it.  Maybe it would be better, but in a lot of cases I don't think it would.<P>Much of the progress towards peace in the Middle East was done by the US.  Though in recent years the Scandinavians have been taking a larger role.  Certainly our ideals of protectionism after WWI led to WWII becoming a reality.  Had the US reacted Hitler’s incursion into Czechoslovakia the same way it did to Iraq’s foray into Kuwait countless lives could have been changed.<P>In terms of economic benefit IMF loans and the Federal Reserve has stopped dozens of countries from going insolvent.  Many years ago we were the only ones to prop up others currencies.  Today we see more help from the EU and Japan in doing this.<P>The US does a lot of shitty stuff in the end though I think the good outweighs it and certainly I like to believe the intent to do good is there.  As a people we are passionate about our liberties and freedoms, we wish everyone to be afforded the same opportunities as we are.  <P>Bottom line though irrespective of our past transgressions I don't believe any of them could warrant such a heinous offense.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Ohso, terrorists do not kill Americans for the pleasure of it. There you are sadly mistaken.<P>They kill Amreicans to protect themselves, for the hope of a better future. A misplaced hope, and a misplaced "protection" but a hope nonetheless. <P>Have you ever tried to put yourself in the place of a terrorist? Let me show you:<P>A palestinian terrorists life.<BR>1979: Born<BR>1982: Mother dies in an attack on an unprotected village by "peacekeeping forces".<BR>1984: Father dies at the hands of Isreali troops who want the land your father lives on. He is hot in front of you for speaking up.<BR>1987: The family you live with is evicted from their houses by Isreali troops who want to knock down that community, since the Jews who live next door don't like the palestines.<BR>1990: You live in a camp, a shoody hut.<BR>1991: Recruited into PLO, with a promise that you can strike back at the people who have persecuted you all your life.<BR>1993: Fully trained, you start to defend your people. At the same time, you become a wanted terrorist in almost every country in the world.<P>Doesn't look very nice, does it? Remember, all the people we call terrorists, have had their families, friends, loved ones, every one close to them, killed, wounded, hurt in wars, in attacks, in ambushes. And then they see a monlithic country, a country that *could* help them, if it wanted to.<P>Does it?

</FONT><HR>Sohn I agree with you on a couple things. The Palestinians have been treated horribly and the picture you described is about the way I see it too, but I don't believe the Palestinians had much of a role if any in this. A lot of these terorists it would seem that follow Bin Laden (who has plenty of money certainly) are middle class Saudi's, etc. They have used the plight of the Palestinian's as an excuse to do these things. The Palestinian's are caught in the middle and are suffering even more because of these attacks. While this does not justify Palestinian terrorist attacks on Israel, neither do I believe Israel's attacks on the Palestinians are justified. <BR>It's a huge mess. Basically, no matter what the U.S. does with regard to the Palestinian's a large number of people are going to hate us. We could possibly force a solution, but people already say we try to impose ourselves on everyone. We could ignore it, and end up being hated by both sides, or we could choose sides (we always sided with Israel in the past, but I think that's been starting to change slowly). None of these solutions are good. The only thing we could do (and in fact were trying to do recently) is try to get both sides to talk. What would you do?<p>[This message has been edited by Ohso (edited 09-17-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Every terrorist has had a family.  That's where it all went wrong.  We clearly have some major sociopathic tendencies sliding into MY genepool, and now there are so many that it's clogging the filters, so it's about time we started some cleaning before we put the cover on.<P>First off, Palestinians or not, their greivance is with each other or Israelis NOT the US.  Osama brought it to America (if not Bin Laden and not the AlQueda then it's Palestinians like the Islamic Jihad of the Month club).  Ok, so their lives aren't stellar nor stable.<P>When you volunteer for a violent life, then nobody is going to weep for you.  When you practice hate, then there is no special reward after life.  When an American red-neck Klansman drags a black guy to their death because he thinks blacks wronged him, is there a reason to pity the killer?  People in bad parts of the US (like parts of LA) lose family members to violence and we STILL incarcerate them when they become violent themselves.<P>Some of these morons are fighting for a small piece of land they don't own.  And let's assume for a moment that they "win" it back.  Isreal "won" a lot of it in wars.  Which "wars" were legit?  The US didn't help them win the 6 Days War.<P>All their reasons are bogus, and everyone knows it.  They are fighting because that's all they know.  They have no recent past that doesn't include bloodshed.  Heck, the history of mankind is just dates when blood was spilled.  But they are not fighting for freedom.  Their countries and societies are no longer viable in this new world. <P>They weren't a peaceful people before Israel and weren't peaceful before America!  Their history reeks of a bloodthirsty people whose use of slavery and barbarism makes ancient Rome seem quite civilized.<P>Take the Taliban in Afghanistan.  Why are they so brutal and willing to tolerate Bin Laden?  Because the country has no chance.  They have no real resources and no real infrastructure.  It didn't help that they were in a war for 20 years and had an obscenely brutal famine.  But their own culture and laws stifle what chance for free-markets they have.  Of course they have to blame other people.  It couldn't possibly be that Allah HATES them.<P>Bin Laden gives them a scapegoat.  He says that America is the cause of all your woes.  He's just doing that to get followers.  He knows that America would never have seriously retaliated...  and that he'd be blamed and that would be an attack on Islam.<P>America had nothing to do with the plight or condition of the middle east.  If America disappeared today, then MAYBE Israel would fall.  Then the Palestinians would take the land and you know what would happen?<P>They'd still be fighting.  There's no way for most of the countries to support themselves.  Poverty will still run rampant.<P>The Islamic Jihad and the Al Queda (Bin Ladens bar-buddies) need to be wiped out.  Not because they are worth less, but EVERYONE should agree that if I have to kill 5 people who would try to kill others to save 1000 people who would not have tried to kill anyone, then we kill the 5.  Those two groups represent an immediate and continuing threat to America.  They declared war on us in 1996 (their literal words -- err.. but in Arabic).  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Sohn, you forgot a few lines..<P><BR>1981: Mother is promoted to sniper after getting trained on weapons usage.<BR>1981: Mother sets up mines outside of town near a refugee camp.<BR>1981: Mother talks about killing 7 "peacekeeping forces" while they were trying to clear the land mines.<BR>1982: Mother dies in an attack on an unprotected village by "peacekeeping forces".<BR>Last one could read ....<BR>1982: Mother is killed as she is found sniping military personell while they were trying to deliver humanitarian supplies.<P>While I don't necessarily wish anyone dead for any act (nope, I don't even wish whoever was behind this to die) I do think there should be some form of punishment. If the person is arrested and put in jail for life, then every terrorist still out there would start killing people until the person was released. Would they try and peacefully protest? Nope. <P>The only way out for the people behind what happened is for them to die.

</FONT><HR>Sohn, you bar room politician you! I run into your kind all the time. Over too many beers they decry the evils of "fill-in-the-blank" while bemaoning the fate of "fill-in-the-blank". I fear you too need to be awakened to reality just a bit. That was a nice scenario that you just painted. A fine minister of propaganda you will one day make. It still doesn't give anyone the right to kill uninvolved civilians. I guess that by using your logic, everyone in the world who was oppressed by one group or another throughout time should today strike back and punish their tormentors! What a wonderful world that would be. No more of the virus known as humanity to destroy the world!

</FONT><HR>I'll put it like this for Sohn, because he simply doesn't get it.<P>WE kill for good will, not to harm innocent people. It's not our fault a barbarian like Bin Ladin would fill a bomb target with civilians to make a point.<P>We have been pretty laid back about alot of things, us and other countries. These little children have spent far too many of our lives and patience to be tolerated anymore.<P>What we will and MUST do is provide a very abusive spanking to these adolescent minds.<P>Whatever you try to say, you sound like a moron freind. I grew up in the rough streets all my life, watched people get killed, hell I had to fight everyday because I lived in a black neighborhood. Times where I saw my mother in fist fights with some big ignorant black guy who didn't wanna see us get free lunch. But I'll tell you this much, I love black people, I realize not everyone is perfect and we don't get anywhere with hurting people who were not involved. But you try and sympathize with people who commit the stupidest acts of blatent murder.<P>You might be right, maybe they are missinformed. But as far as I'm concerned, sympathy went out the window when those people died, and now its time to put the mad dogs to sleep.<P>Thats all I got to say about this crazed shit, because as far as I'm concerned you are insane for defending someone like this.<BR>Damn, I suppose by your logic I would have some sympathy from you if I just went around in the ghetto and shot up every black person I saw.

</FONT><HR>READ THIS: This is kick ASS.. and a CANADIAN SAID IT.<P>=====<P>America: The Good Neighbor<P>Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to A remarkable<BR>editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television<BR>commentator. What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as<BR>printed in the Congressional Record: <P>"This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most<BR>generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth. <P>Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of<BR>the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and<BR>forgave other billions in debts. None of these countries is today paying<BR>even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. <P>When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who<BR>propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the<BR>streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. <P>When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in<BR>to help. This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.<BR>Nobody helped. <P>The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars into<BR>discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those countries are writing about<BR>the decadent, warmongering Americans. <P>I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the<BR>erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane. Does any other<BR>country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the<BR>Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10? If so, why don't they fly them? Why<BR>do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes? <P>Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the<BR>moon? <P>You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios. You talk about<BR>German technocracy, and you get automobiles. <BR>You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon - not<BR>once, but several times - and safely home again. <P>You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store<BR>window for everybody to look at. <P>Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our<BR>streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are<BR>getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here. <P>When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking Down through<BR>age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad<BR>and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both<BR>are still broke. <P>I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other<BR>people in trouble. Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to<BR>the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during<BR>the San Francisco earthquake. <P>Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired<BR>of hearing them get kicked around. They will come out of this thing with<BR>their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at<BR>the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is<BR>not one of those." <P>Stand proud, America! </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000054&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Sohn, I agree with you on one point. The Afghan people really have very little to do with this. The Taliban, and their ethnic brethren are the ones who are at fault. The average Afghan is merely a starving suffering person who is currently trying to eke out an existance in a harsh world. Yes, the US IS RESPONSIBLE for the Taliban being in power. They and their allies should be the only ones to suffer for Osama Bin Satan and his cronies crimes. Sadly, I fear that the average Afghan, who has no power to change his government, will suffer more than his/her "fair share" in the upcoming war.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000057&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>People kill for many reasons.  To say that people kill only because or when they are insane rather indicates there is some inherently universally intrinsic value to a life.<P>Like most animals, humans kill for land, for food, for sport (fun), for mates, to establish a hierarchy, etc...  Dolphins kill for sport, birds do too.  Chimpanzees even attempt to deceive others into dangerous situations and away from food and water.  Lions and Gorillas and Bears rip each other apart for mates and territory.<P>Then there are mercy-killings -- like someone has been bitten by a snake and will die in 2 hours but will suffer horribly before then and it will take far longer just to summon any kind of aid.<P>In this case, these people being attacked represent an immediate and ongoing threat.  It's not "will they kill again" -- we've seen example after example of their plans and implementations.  It's just a question of when they will kill again.<P>Something like this has NEVER before been tried.  The Russians haven't tried this, so I don't think those who claim "others have tried and it didn't work"...  We've taken the gloves off and are now targeting entire organizations.  We are naming individual people and organizations.  Assassinations or targetting individuals has not been done as a rule on so large a scale.  Not ever.<P>Is there a good reason to kill?  Of course.  There are many good reasons to kill.  If you know that a person that speaks a totally different language is coming to your school and is heavily armed and has killed hundreds of people at every school they've been to so far and ALL you have a switch that will kill them -- then what do you do.  You COULD try to reason with them.  But remember that people at each of the previous schools tried that (you don't even speak their language).  You could try subduing them, BUT remember, all you have is the switch, and NO other weapons.  You also have only 30 seconds before they start killing.  By the time you've read that entire scenario, it's probably already too late.  Either you pressed the button OR you and your people have just become meaningless numbers on a list that will continue to grow because you did the wrong thing.<P>Ok, sounds drastic, eh?  We've tried negotiations.  They've killed Americans as a result.  We've tried sanctions.  They've killed MORE Americans as a result.<P>To give in to ANY of their demands would not appease them.  And it would inevitably harm the political situation -- since other groups will just resort to terrorism to get their way.<P>We've told the world that anyone that doesn't help us -- anyone that harbors these terrorist is going to be attacked.  That DOES take the "innocent casualty" problem out of our hand.  If the "regular Afghani" doesn't want to be clobbered, then hand him over, or tell us where he is, or actively fight with us.  No help = admission of complicity.<P>Saying that something wouldn't or will not work is easy.  What I'd like to hear is what will work?  I can tell you that I've heard people suggest "compromise"..  didn't work.  Israeli's offered over 97% of the west-bank, and they're still targets of the Islamic Jihad and the Hamas.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>Very well spoken. The Afghani government have shown us how much they support us (remember when their leaders called shortly after the attack to "show sympathy"?). We send them humanitarian aid. If they were invaded by a neighboring country, and needed assistance, I'd bet that we'd be out there to help. Now, all we need from them is ONE MAN who they've already stated that they want out of their country (though they won't force him out), and they refuse. They KNOW the consequences. They've made a calculated decision, and they (and, unfortunately, the citizens of Afghanistan), will pay for the mistake.<P>There is no room for diplomacy. Even the country harboring this person won't listen to basic diplomacy. Instead, they threaten that if the United States invades them, they'll call for an international holy war against us. These people are willing to call out a holy war against the largest superpower in the free world, because they won't release one man to the U.S. justice system for a trial.

</FONT><HR>Here's a clincher.  Ok, it's been commonly known for a LONG time that Saddam H (Iraq's evil dark-elf Boss-MOB) has been making sure that the money that comes INTO Iraq never makes it to their own people in the form of humanitarian goods like medicine or food.  This way, the average guy says "wow.. these sanctions suck.. My life sucks...  it's America's fault"... Saddam has also been giving money to factions of other countries so that UN aid missions are sabotaged (like the ones in Afghanistan).<P>So, now we have this Taliban gov't that can't feed or care for their own people because they have no money right?  But they're going to arm and move 300,000 soldiers?  <P>Ok, ANY logistical officer will tell you how expensive THAT will be.  Just a basic reality check will show that you need about 50,000 bus loads -- maybe 25,000 if you cramp them in.  You're gonna need 600 gallons of fuel for EACH run.  Then you will need 2,000 runs PER WEEK for food and water.  <P>These troops need ammo, repair, clothing, food and water transport (from the offload to the front-lines), medicine.  <P>Now, for 300,000 people a good US estimate would be at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars.<P>If these people had this kind of money, why didn't they buy food?  Even the US was sending money via the UN to these people (up until a couple of weeks ago).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000065&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR> Ya know, what happened on Sept. 11, was horrific and those responsible should pay. But the men that committed that act are not simply "evil" or "cowardly". There was a reason this happened, there is a reason we are a target. It's not simply "envy" or "jealousy" of our american way of life. It's not because we enjoy "porn" or "alcohol" and other "liberties" which these fundamentalists find offensive to their beliefs. It's because of our twisted, evil U.S. foreign policy. Part of the blame for what happened should be carried by our government.<P> Why do they hate us? How about us backing the Israeli's genocidal occupation of Palestinian land? Muslims occupied that land for 1700 years, then at the turn of the last century there was the zionist movement and the British government in an effort to colonize ( gee, they've never done that before ) began establishing jewish settlements. Then under the Balfour Declaration they were able to partition Palestine against the protestations of the Palestinian people. Millions of homes have been razed, millions of refugees made, and countless lives lost all in the interest of establishing a Jewish homeland and securing a protected trade-route for the British. <P> The U.S. has allied itself with Israel. It helped them establish a strong military, and a strong political front to oppose the other Arabic nations who otherwise would've eaten Israel alive. We sold them the goods, trained them to kill, and allow them to deny the same human rights that we pride ourselves on protecting.<P> We armed Iraq, told them we would not interfere if they attacked Kuwait, then we launched a ludicrous campaign against an army that was hardly equipped to fight - many didn't even have shoes let alone ammunition and certainly not the tanks, jets, or laser-guided smart-bombs that we had. We've done this many times in the last 50 years.<P> In Saudi-Arabia ( homeland of Osama Bin Laden who happens to belong to the royal family ), we've hijacked their oil fields and placed U.S. military bases throughout the region for the sole purpose of protecting "our interests". We police the world in this way, not in the righteous, defeat the bad guys so the downtrodden can have the same freedom and democracy that we enjoy here.<P> In many Africa nations, the governmental leaders are not elected by the people who are mostly Muslim, but are placed by the U.S. & the U.N. and they are mostly white, and mostly Christian.<P> If you think our U.S. goverment is as righteous as they'd have you believe then why not ask them why people are dying of disease and famine in Haiti, which in geographic terms is so close to us, and yet they recieve no U.S. aid. They recieve no aid and yet the Cuban government sends relief workers and medical aid! The Cuban government who we've been brainwashed into believing is a corrupt and evil dictatorship. Yet, they've a humanitarian streak we are evidently missing.<P> The truth is there for those who question. Most people are willing to believe whatever our leadership tells us. Our propaganda machine switches into high gear and it becomes all about flag-waving and pride. We don't take an interest in the world unless there's something to be gained by us. The genocide in Rwanda proves that. The plight of the Falun Gong proves that. The exiled Dalai Lama proves that. The list of U.S. incurred injustices to the rest of the world is long.<P> I'm American. I'm proud to be an American, but that does not mean that I have to be proud of a government that is corrupt. I can take pride in knowing that my grandfather fought in WW2 without feeling like I've betrayed that memory by being angered by what we did in Vietnam.<P> I hope we get Osama Bin Laden but not at the expense of peace and not at the expense of the Afghan or other middle-eastern people.<BR>And if we do encroach upon the sovereignty  of those middle-eastern countries because we believe our might gives us right, then we are only gonna be fucking ourselves in the end. All those Muslims who don't agree with Osama Bin Laden now would very likely when they hear that we've bombed innocent villagers in Afghanistan or Pakistan or elsewhere. These people are not "cowards". Unlike us, they are not afraid to die for what they believe in. We will see an exponential increase in homeland attacks if we retaliate in the wrong way. We are the cowards. We are the ones that lob missiles from thousands of miles away, killing innocent people. <P> I only pray, that we revert to covert ops and snipe the fucker. I don't want to see any more needless casualties on either side.<P> For those of yo who believe blindly, now's a good time to open your eyes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR>They "hate" us because they're sheep.  They were programmed to hate us.  It's a heck of a lot easier to blame other people for how much your life sucks than to take some modicum of responsibility and make it actually measurably better.  They (the militant ones) are entire countries of stooges<P>Are Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Somalia, Libya, Indonesia even REMOTELY affected by who occupies Israel?  <P>Of course not.  But it's easy to say that their current situation is because their Muslim brethren are being persecuted and oppressed and displaced unjustly.<P>Isreal isn't a real issue.  Case in point, Isreal offered 97% of the West Bank back, and the offer was rejected.<P>The turmoil over there existed way before the 1900s.  This Zionist propaganda is entirely without merit.  If Israel ceased to exist today, then the militant Muslims would all still be looking for people to blame for their woes.<P>It's as valid as saying "There would be no more poverty or suffering in America if Russia relinquished some Northern Pacific islands"...<P>More importantly, if you want fairness, then the Islam / Arab rights to the area are not supported.  Before the Arabs took control around 630 AD, the Jews were the rightful owners.  Then, say until oh, 1916, the Arabs had rightful ownership.  Why did the Arabs think they had rightful ownership?  Because they battled the previous occupants and won.  Is that fair?  Must be.<P>Ok, so WWI comes around and a state is kind of established DIPLOMATICALLY, but that's not acceptable.  Then the 6-Days War came when the Jews shockingly won MORE land.<P>So, if you think that the land belonged to the Arabs because they won it in battle in the 600s, then you MUST concede it through fair battle to the Jews now for that precise reason.  <P>Otherwise, you must consider the land "occupied" by the Arabs unfairly through the shedding of blood of the previous residents.<P>Now, if you want to talk about "seniority" then you'll lose again.  The Jews had the area since 1300 BC.  From 1300 BC to 600 AD is about 1900 years.  So they not only had it first, they had it longer.  The Arab conquest was since around 600 AD, so from 600 AD to 1900 AD is ONLY 1300 years.<P>Yes, it is true that Iraq was originally told that it was ok to occupy Kuwait (April told them that).  Then, however we told them was told that it was NOT ok.  In fact, it was told that it was NOT ok before it invaded (when troops were amassed before the borders).  Iraq tried to say it was just shoring up it's defenses and conducting desert training exercises.  I mean, DUH!  Think about it.  America calls Mexico one day and asks, "Hey, do you mind if we invade Canada tomorrow?"  Of COURSE it's a bad thing -- what is the thinking process involved even in ASKING!?<P>Yes, it's true that Haiti is dirt-poor.  However, what you seem to have missed is that we've been providing aid to them for many years now.  According to the latest press release it's "U.S. interests in Haiti are to promote democracy, decrease narcotics trafficking to the United States, and reduce the number of illegal migrants reaching U.S. shores. USAID assistance supports these foreign policy objectives by alleviating poverty while reinforcing the foundations for a democratic society. Specifically, the USAID program seeks to increase incomes of the poor, slow environmental degradation, improve educational performance, reduce fertility, infant and child mortality and malnutrition, and to strengthen civil society as the foundation for building democracy in Haiti"  This past year, we gave (in total ) almost 400 million dollars to Haiti (down from a high of almost 600 million in 97).<P>I doubt any of the countries which hate America could boast such an accomplishment, even in kind, if not in amount.<P>America is far from innocent.  But at least the Afghani regime is responsible for MOST of the problem in Somalia (warlords prevent food and supplies from getting to the people, and Afghanistan supplies money, arms, training, personnel and fuel to those warlords).  Iraq (Saddam) is TO THIS DAY withholding money from his people so he can give it to his military and terrorist-related concerns so his people will think that their continuous suffering is because of the sanctions.<P>Why are the middle-eastern countries spending so much on defense?  Not because of a threat from America.  It's because they don't trust each other.  India and Pakistan don't get along.  Iraq has no particular love for Iran (ok, nobody likes Iraq).  Saudi Arabia doesn't like Afghanistan.  Egypt switches sides every week.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000070&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

Heh, you think life in prison is good enough punishment for that person?<BR>"<P>Yes. Life in prison is a worse punishment than death. If he gets life in prison, he suffers every day for the rest of his life for what he did. If he is killed, he suffers maybe for half a second, and then: blissfull oblivion. <BR>Life in prison is a horrible, horrible punishment. It is a psychological torture the majority of humans cannot even comprehend.<BR>And if you are going to start talking about the nice lives they have in prison, the colour TVs, the newspapers they get, well. They are allowed virtually no contact to the outside world other than what they see in TV or read in the newspapers. And a child-rapist/murderer would probably be put in an isolated cell for his own protection. No one to talk to, nothing to do, but think.<BR>Think abouyt the crime he commited.

</FONT><HR>Sohn, yeah "life" in prison would be pretty bad, but "life" in prison isn't really life in prison...  That's another thing that pisses me off..  <P>Also, the person can appeal his case many times, but he cannot be charged for the same crime twice (example: A serial killer is free because of the lack of evidence in his case, but 10 years later they find out about DNA).<P>Sure, I don't want innocent people murdered, but if someone kills someone else (not out of self defense or in a war or anything) they have the same fate..<P>Sohn, please don't take this as a flame, you seem to be a very educated person, and always have good ideas to back up your arguements...

</FONT><HR>Sohn I hate to break it to ya but there are bad people in the world. Bad people do bad things. Bad people do bad things until someone else stops them. For the last 100 years that someone else has been the U.S. and its allies.

Why? Because I believe our government has no right to invade other countries to steal their natural resources? Or maybe it's because I believe our government should leave Israel to clean up it's own messes? Or maybe it's because I don't buy for a second that all Arabic Muslim people need pay for the horrific actions of a minute fraction - Islam afterall is a beautiful religion that is alot more progressive and places much more emphases on equality and tolerance to others than does either Christianity or Judaism ( my parents are Christian and my wife is Jewish so don't even go there ). Or maybe it's because I feel that all life is much too precious to be spent away by the rounds of an assault rifle. Or maybe it's because I feel that war against other nations merely because they don't bend to the whim of our twisted government is self-defeating and self-destructive. <P> If I'm liberal because I take in to account the lifes of others and the wants and freedoms of those beyond my own nose, then hell, I'm liberal.

</FONT><HR>I'm bored.  However, I doubt I could ever be as bored as to the point of trying to defend terrorism or more shamefully, taking a pacifict action at this moment in time.  <P>Many references have been made about America being the 'Sleeping Giant'.  Let me elaborate: At one point in time, we were a shit kicking powerhouse, and we didn't get pushed around.  Fast forward 40 odd years. Defense (and overall military) spending down more than _200%_. 200%. That's a big number.  Even more interesting is that all of these wonderful new technologies we have cost lots of money.  And our 'army' is bigger than it ever has been.  How do we cut all of that money, but continue to grow in military size and strength? <P>I think we got our answer the 11th.  <P>Whats the point of my last paragraph? Simple.  The dismantling of arms, defense budget cuts, etc..  are all examples of pacifism.<P>We have seen what this has done, and yet you would like to see _more_ of this?  Have we not learned that if we do not stand our ground, we will be bullied like the little smart kid at recess?  <P>When did we, as a society stop understanding that stupidy as a habit is a dangerous thing.  We ask "why, why god are those people cheering at our dead". Simple, they have been raised in an area where they grow up in extreme condititons.  I abhor the fact that people can use examples such as 'Well little jimmy had a hard life, so we can only _expect_ him to do this, it is our fault'.  <P>I hate to be the bringer of bad news folks, but people die.  Every day.  Our bodies are designed to extinguish.  I, like my mother and father before me will eventually pass on, hopefully keeping the progeny of my family line going.  However, you can be _damn_ sure that I am going to protect my goals, values, and ideals to ensure my kids DO go on.  <P>My goal as an American is peace.  I doubt you will find many of us who 'want war' (short of Dr. Strangelove).  However, peace is not achieved by planting a garden, and it amazes me to think that you can grasp the idea of pasificism but yet completly and utterly expect everyone to just 'lay down'.  With as many religions, societies, cultures around the word, we have yet to even achieve a universal spoken/written language (read: which is widely accepted).  And you try and offer the notion of peace through pacifism?<P>It is our pacifistic tendancies that cost over 5,000 people their lives.  It is those tendancies that will cost many others theirs also, becauses of the actions of a few.  Yes, many will suffer.  Many already have. We let down our guard, and we were hit.  I would love a peaceful world.  However as long as hostile people remain a threat, it is not-an-option&lt;.<P>If we simply lay down now, say put some diplomatic sanctions and such, we are opening ourselves wide.  When your dog (cat/whatever) ate your *whatever* or pissed in your house, did you look at it and say "Thats a very naughty doggie.  I am going to have to limit the amount of water you drink!" or "I dislike that you ate my shoe. Forgive me for leaving MY belongings in MY house.  In the future, I hope we can come to some pre-shoe-chew phase that will allow us to better communicate our differences".<P>Sorry, when someone takes a piss in my house, I am going for the paper. <P>Edit: Wish I had HTML /c:<P><BR>------------------<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Logos1226 (edited 09-26-2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

</FONT><HR> Yea,..err.. I said nothing of pacifism. I clearly stated that we should get those who have attacked us and make them pay. But Bush, in his infinite wisdom, has decided that any nation that does not help us in achieving that goal will be on our shitlist. I guarantee you, if Russia or China decided not help us then we would do nothing. Why? Because they could kick the shit out of us. But, all those dirt-poor Arabic nations? We could have a field day with. Soldiers could pitch a fucking tent and play horseshoes on their graves. Short of guerrilla warfare, it'd be that easy. Keeping in mind that we have a history of carpet-bombing innocent people to get the few bad guys that've pissed us off ( Vietnam anyone? ).<P> I'm realistic, I know civilian casualties are a simple fact of war, but we have the means to avoid further sensless loss of life. We've taken a sucker-punch and we'll be on our guard now. There isn't a bill that couldn't be passed now if it dealt with the security of our country or our defense. We've already made a $20 billion "downpayment" on our defense. I'm hardly against that. Defense is as important as the Social Security system.<P> The terrorists are few, and they hide in the walls like roaches. If we are patient, we can smoke them out, hunt them down, and squish them like the bugs they are. If we simply invade "nuetral" Arabic nations and wreak havoc on their civilians, all we'll accomplish is to raise the ire of the Muslim people. We'll suffer, our allies will suffer, and it could take decades to regain a semblance of peace. We could find ourselves entrenched in a "holy war" for years. History has shown us, we can't simply ignore the tenacity of these radical people. <P> I don't agree with our government. We should try diplomacy with these terrorists - not for pacifism but to find a long-term solution. They killed our people for a reason, not "just because". We should find out what it is they want, give it ( if we can ), then bring the fuckers to justice. <P> Keep in mind that Arabs make up only %15 of the Muslims in the world. And from what I understand, most of the terrorists in involved with the sept. 11th attack, were Egyptian.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#32cd32" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://www.ethernalquest.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003945.cgi&ReplyNum=000078&forum=HackersQuest+Main+Forum&TopicSubject=I+think+US+must+learn+from+this+story...">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#1f1f1f">

Oh and also that they "they've a humanitarian streak we are evidently missing"<P>* The genocide in Rwanda, the exile of the Dalai Lama, and the plight of the Falun Gong are on the list of U.S. injustices<P>* Contrary to multiple world wars were are  cowards and not willing to die for what we believe in.<P>* Islam is more progessive and believes in more equality than Christianity and Judaism<P>* The U.S. is invading other countries and stealing their resources<P>* Russia and China can kick the Shit out of us<P>* And of course this little gem of wisdom...we should negotiate with the terrorists and find out what they want and give it to them....priceless <P>Eirinjay your I'm right because I care more than you attitude has no basis in reality, but its definately entertaining to watch.
