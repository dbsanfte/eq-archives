[B]The only real problem they would have against it would be rvr I would think. From what I understand the client is only told what is in visual range, and not told about hidden units unless the client can actually see them; assassin classes should be minimally affected. Bow users on the other hand, Open Season, but then they have 80% of the RPs in the game anyway.
I'll worry about what they think when they finish the classes already, if ever. And maybe itemize the dungeons, finish alchemy and high level trade skills, etc.
Eq rangers could track at release, could they not?[/B][/QUOTE]

Do you think they might to try some sort of legal action like Verant threatened at one point in time?  Would they ever be able to get any information from OE to see who is cheating?<BR>Are the sheepeople going to be loud enough for Mythic to really care?<BR>I personally think they will try some scare tactics and possibly at the burden of their paying customers attempt to thwart us OErs.  I also believe that OE will be used by less than 1% of all the people in the game if not less than .01% really.  Most people that play games on Windows can't figure out what a command line is. <BR>With that said I think posting some numbers of the usage of OE might be in OEs interest.  If not to cure my curiosity.  I may even get into an IRC channel to chat with you Slicer. <BR>I used ShowEQ for at least 18 months (I think) and I was very reluctant to ever even post here out of fear of Verant tracking me down.  <BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Maltz3</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The only real problem they would have against it would be rvr I would think.

Actually, it probably is in the packets since my old path finding program could always locate the mobs and items (as long as there wasn't a concave object in the way).<P>- Edit -<P>Just saw that post about mythic on OE and visual range.

Standard intimidation tactics. Some of the traffic on the various boards has got to be posted by Mythic personnel in an effort to add to the confusion and make people even more paranoid about using OE because of Big Brother.<P>As I stated in an earlier post, all I want OE for is to help me find my way - I hate dungeons because they all go in different directions and within seconds I'm hopelessly lost for the next half hour or so. I want it so I can get from one location to another in the shortest time possible or to find a mob that I've spent the last week trying to locate to finish that stupid quest. What's wrong if I use a map in RvR? My guy is a 100-lb weakling in RvR and 2 hits will take me down, but I don't care - I just want to know where I am.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Viron_X</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">--"Eq rangers could track at release, could they not?"--<P>This is not EQ. This is DAoC, and think of all the shit that was wrong with EQ. EQ still isnt as good as DAoC in a lot of ways. like how many dungeons drop keys and stuff that dont go to anything? How many quests are there where they say "Tell Bob [Goober] sent you." and when you talk to bob he doesnt say a thing because they rushed the release and never finished the quest? You people need to stop flaming Mythic. They are doing a great job if you ask me. DAoC has been one of the smoothest MMORPG releases ever. Hell look at AO, that still sucks ass. and EQ still has bi-weekly patches that are ETAd at 3 hours and take 15.<BR>  But Mythic also has some policys that get ridiculous, like them taking a stand against voice-com programs like Roger Wilco. They say it gives players an unfair advantage, well it does, but then again what doesnt. You mouse, monitor, keyboard, processor, chair, and how much friggin shit is going on in your house affect your game play. If your guild gets ass-raped in RvR because you dont use voice-com stuff then that is your problem, not mythics as they seem to think. Thats like discouraging printing out maps. Not everyone has maps, and those that do have an advanage over those who dont, but those who dont are at fault. no one is stopping them from buying a $10.00 mic and DLing Roger Wilco and going on to DAAtlas and getting maps. ok well now that you all have listened to the rantings of a rambling lunatic who goes around in circles for hours with no real point, you can say im a moron and go back to your lives</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">11001100</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">stealth classes are not existant on odins eye after they stealth, they are only visible as you walk into range of one, and if they restealth after that, you lose them for good.<P>Odins eye effectively has no use at all.<P>Objects directly behind you are not updated so you can't see whats behind you, and in front of you, if you can see it anyways, why use odins eye?<P>Mythics server design is good enough to where they need not worry about programs like odins eye to begin with.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">fodder</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yes I agree whole heartedly.
