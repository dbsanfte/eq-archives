<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">"Lets see... like 40 servers? somewhere around 2000 people per? whats that, around 80,000? Tracking everything thats dropped or traded or sold (or duped) every second of everyday? And logging it to a text file? You think that those files might get a little large? You didn't mention the mainframe in the broom closet."
This is true. It is absolutely true.
I once got a shield in a trade and I did not have room and it droped to the ground.
Two days later(yes 2, it was for another character) I petitioned saying I have a shield missing from inventory. The gm asked what shield. I replied, "I dont remember the name". Three minutes later hes was it a Marrs Promise Shield?(yes its a shitty shield but he want 50pp for it and I was making anew char) I said, "I think so, what happened to it". He said, "It appears you dropped it on the ground, items droped on the ground are considered lost". I replied, "Can you tell me what happened to it after I droped it". He said, "Yes, Kappo picked it up". I asked, "Does he still have it?" He said, "yes". Later that day I caught up to Kappo and sure enough he did have it but he told me too fuck off when I asked for it back  :(.

7. GM's Don't care about you. You are an avatar, thats it, each GM is instructed to treat each customer as if they are lying and scamming, which is why the CS there is such crap. The CS dept changes rules about once a week, to fit the whim of upper management.

This is so true. I once got a warning for shooting arrows at someone while in town on rallos. WTF.

6. EQ servers are pathetic, home brew boxes running dual pentium 3's just recently upgraded to 800's The code is MS C running on NT. There is one world server and then zone boxes which run multiple zones each. Forget hacking the servers, I was told there is several layers of firewall and protection, the best there is out there.

Druzzil Ro has crashed at least 7 times in the last 5 days.

9. Abashi is a true A-Hole.

Can anyone even argue against that?

9. COmplain, Complain, Complain... 

When I first started playing I saved up my money to buy a halbred and it feel to ground in a space where I couldnt get it because of the geometry. Initially the GMs told me to bad. After emailing,calling,telling,petitioning, etc for a week the lead gm gave me a halbred:P.

4. GM's have a log of those that fell through the world, its called fellworld.txt, they just do not use it and ignore it as its a pain to get out of the game to go check logs.

Who knows? I can vouch that they dont checkit though. On rallos where you dont lose exp if you die from falling, I got 3 reses by pulling my corpse to the zone and saying I fell for 10k.

13. The most powerful GM tool is....SNOOPING! 

Entirely possible. Me and some friends discovered an untrackable bug that gave amazing rewards and exploited it massively, sadly the next patch eliminated it. BTW, the bug was not created from a previous patch, because we tested it a a month earlier to see if it worked and it did but we didnt get the guts to use it on our mains until last week. I know it was untrackable because I didnt get banned :). It may have just been a coincidence but we did talk about it online so who knows.
