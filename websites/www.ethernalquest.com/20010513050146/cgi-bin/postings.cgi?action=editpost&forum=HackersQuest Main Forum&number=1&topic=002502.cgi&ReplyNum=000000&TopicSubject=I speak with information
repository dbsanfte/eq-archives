<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Lets start off here on a good note  :)  It is possible that I might be an Ex-GM of Verant, or maybe not, believe what you will.  I have been reading this board for some time and I wish to make some comments.

1. Items do not have serial numbers.  Each item in the game has a number, which is used to create the item, like an index number.  These numbers never change.  Quite simply, if you and your friend have a soulfire each, they are exactly the same, a Gm cannot tell the difference.

2. EVERYTHING is tracked. I mean it, litererally everything.  If you drop it, its logged, if you pick it up, its logged, if you put it in a forge, its logged.  you get the picture.  All trades are logged and detailed as to the items traded to whom and from whom.  Your IP address is logged when you login to the game, each time you change your billing and information a record is kept.  Cash is tracked, how much you have and how long you had it, a history is provided.  (Cash is converted to copper, the standard and tracked that way)

3. There are cheater logs, 2 that I know of at least.  One tracks players hacking SOW and the client.  If you ever HEXed the client and got booted off, you were logged off as a cheater and logged.  The other file has something to do with zoning and such and was never fully explained to me.

4. GM's have a log of those that fell through the world, its called fellworld.txt, they just do not use it and ignore it as its a pain to get out of the game to go check logs.

5. There are 8 levels of backup availible to GM's.  Its viewpc 0 thru 7.  Its unclear how the backup is taken, it is supposed to be a roll over, meaning level 0 is today, 1 is yesterday and so forth, but its totally hosed up and its like 2 days then 3 weekly's then a nightly.  But they can see what you had on you yesterday and the day before and thats how you guys are getting caught in your scamming  :)

6. EQ servers are pathetic, home brew boxes running dual pentium 3's just recently upgraded to 800's  The code is MS C running on NT.  There is one world server and then zone boxes which run multiple zones each.  Forget hacking the servers, I was told there is several layers of firewall and protection, the best there is out there.

7. GM's Don't care about you.  You are an avatar, thats it, each GM is instructed to treat each customer as if they are lying and scamming, which is why the CS there is such crap.  The CS dept changes rules about once a week, to fit the whim of upper management.

8. Brad Who?  Brad McQuaid may not exist.  In the time I worked there, I never saw him, nor saw an office.  I do not believe he exists  :)  I do know that Brad does not have an Aradune character on over half the servers, meaning he has never bothered to even log into most of them.

9. Abashi is a true A-Hole.  He is now your worst enemy, as he SOMEHOW got put on the actual development team and makes decisions for EQ.  Thats right , the guy that stated you can med without the book at level 32, that guy.  And yes, he hates you intently, takes it as a personal battle with players.  I heard about his comment when VI "fixed" the clerics hate list thing... "So clerics always complain to me they are bored, well, we will just add DEATH to their sit,med,heal, that will fix them"

9. COmplain, Complain, Complain...  Thats all you have to do to get what you want.  Spam email the company, write everyone with your twisted tale, in the end you will get whatever you want as they get tired of the BS.  I cannot tell you how many times management has created entire lists of things for players solely based on the fact they never stopped emailing them and they were tired of it.

10.  No, VI cannot stop ShowEQ or detect it, Nor could they detect DXwindows, tho they did break it...

11.  Favouritism .  Yes, there is tons, but not to players.  (Unless you are a developer, then you can give your buddies whatever you want and no one gives a damn)  GM's routinely assist with VIP's and others who get the red carpet and anythign they want in the game.  

12. Yes, the game is geared to the high level Guild players.  Newbies are looked down on while uber guilds are in high regard.  

13. The most powerful GM tool is....SNOOPING!  Most of you guessed it, but yes, a GM can see what you type to anyone, entire guildchats can be snooped with an anonymous GM.  Next time you pull off that scam or cheat someone, don't be an idiot and brag to your friends...

14. Management cheating...  Yes, they do all the time, they have the D3D at home and use it.  YOu all know Lady Degarmo?  "She" is a he, and a bit rough around the edges, if I may add.  I have heard he playes characters on the ZEK servers and often uses the D3D to wipe out anyone he dislikes.  Talk about a low life scum in my book.

Do with this what you will, and believe what you like to.  All the things about logs and how the game works is 100% true, the others are hearsay from other GM's...
