If they think it's a good idea, then I'll release my code to the public.  If not I'd rather keep the number of bots low so they don't bother making a fuss.<P>What I would love is for Funcom to sanction this sort of thing, and even publish open APIs for extra-game tools. Then we can have some good competition for who can write better tools.<P>Next on my list is to look at that mission thingy and see if I can find any improvements to make.  Sorry folks, ideas for stuff aren't my strong suit, just making other people's ideas better.  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> <P>I do give credit where credit is due however.<P>MKaath<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">seniordingdong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">i disagree, i still believe it is funcom. the reason it says "trying to stay under radar" is because its just playing along with the game.. i mean comeon, theres more then 1000 arks and gms and omnibot announces its existance every minute or so.. trust me, its funcom.. i mean, if it was a non-ao author, he would reply, but ao and its surrounding people have a tendcy to suck at replying.. i e-mailed them my AO loader and told them all about it many times via e-mail before i decided to make it public.. i got not a 1 responce from them. btw sorry if i am ranting, i am high.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MKaath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well, we'll see how they take to mine...<P>Should be working(ish) in the next couple of days, although I'll be on vacation from Christmas until the 5th, so probably won't have anything running reasonably until after then.<P>MKaath</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">seniordingdong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">please tell me your not going to use Winpcap.. just hook winsock if you need to send msgs.

I do however have some ideas if anyone is working on a similar thing.<P>First, this could be made external, no? Seeing as most people will use this while occupied with something else, the messages will get lost in lets say battle spam. A little interface in the background could be a lot more userfriendly, where you could get incoming hits on the things you look for, see a log of this (instead of having to look for it through tons and tons of unrelated messages), a list of your current requests and so on.<P>If anyone is thinking along the same line, drop me a note if you need any help with interface design.<P>Cheers.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">MKaath</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I'm working on it right now.<P>There are a couple problems with making it an external app.<P>To do that would require either<P>A) Some computer somewhere that runs the watcher and everyone who wants to use it connects to it outside of AO.  It would work, but my home computer just ain't up to it.<P>B) Make it self contained, each person would have their own.  The problem with this is that each person would also have to have dummy chars logged out in the areas they want to watch channels for.<P>C) Have a small app that sniffs the packet stream for tells from the bot.  That would just keep you from losing the tells in spam.<P>Right now I'm not sure which direction I'm going to go.  I think option A is right out, B is probably what I'll do for testing, C or no external app is most likely what will end up being out there.<P>MKaath<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">seniordingdong</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">sounds cool bro..<BR>im working on a wsock32.dll hook (my dll is built, just not functioning right) that will hopefully open some doors to coding in AO packet stuff, etc.. i will let you know how it goes. im thinking about releasing the sourcecode very soon so that someone with some essential winsock/dll proxy knowledge can help me (its c++ btw)</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Former GM Zereliquis</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Just wanted to mention..

This file is replaced by the client each time it is started, but by commenting out the lines in DimensionServer (same dir.), it won't find it and use the old one.<P>Stats for the loginhandler and playfield protocols I've bothered to find is:<BR>* Message length is an unsigned 16 bit integer in byte 5 and 6, but unlike the chat protocol, this is not the real length of the message - it is always padded to have a length of some divisible of 4. I.e. if the reported length is 14, real length is 16.<BR>* Message ID is at bytes 10 and 11. <P>I haven't bothered decrypting many messages, only enough to have my program intercept and change incoming ip-adresses. These are:<BR>* Logon from loginhandler: Message id 23, ip address as bytes 16-19, port at 20-21.<BR>* Playshift (zoning) in playfield: Message id 60, ip address at bytes 12-15, port at 20-21. <P>Currently, my small prog. only recognize these messages, change ip addresses to localhost and spawn a new "spy process" between client and server whenever such a message is recieved.<P>I don't really know if this method is preferably in any way to hooking the winsock. Didn't think of it at the time, so I didn't look into it.<P>I would, however, be very interested to see how I could access information from the resource database. If someone could forward me the code to do that, I can think of several useful apps to look at  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"> .
