<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Oky dokey. To The Cru:

                  You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As 
                  they
                  say in Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with
                  instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. 
                  I
                  would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.

                  You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little 
                  worm
                  deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, 
                  a
                  weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a
                  revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

                  You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared
                  richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth
                  into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody,
                  abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and
                  then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.

                  I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same 
                  species
                  as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very
                  thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid 
                  you.
                  You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, 
                  the
                  dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?

                  Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to
                  impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop
                  will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it
                  more rapidly.

                  You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive
                  its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to
                  fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink 
                  shame
                  of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea
                  of your own trite, foolish beliefs.

                  You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, 
                  nasty
                  and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.
                  Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are
                  unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that
                  reality forgot.

                  And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important 
                  statements
                  of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do 
                  you
                  hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have 
                  more
                  weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle,
                  waiting for the bite of the snake?

                  You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and
                  obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living
                  emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a 
                  disease,
                  you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.

                  On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are 
                  deficient
                  in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You
                  are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source 
                  of
                  all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

                  You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock.
                  You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted 
                  boggish
                  foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless
                  crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You
                  cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup 
                  pratting
                  naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
                  fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.

                  You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are 
                  degenerate,
                  noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I 
                  despise
                  everything about you, and I wish you would go away.

                  I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard 
                  stupid.
                  Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond
                  the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are
                  trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far
                  that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no
                  intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on
                  Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire
                  galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll.
                  Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some
                  primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure
                  essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
                  the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is
                  an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me 
                  again
                  for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant
                  questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of
                  the rest of this drivel. Duh.

                  The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped
                  away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say
                  anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful.
                  I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of
                  babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have
                  learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.
                  True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take
                  for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we 
                  sometimes
                  forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these
                  things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I
                  would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right".
                  Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck
                  in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a
                  demand on you.

                  would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right".
                  Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck
                  in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a
                  demand on you.


                  P.S.:
                  You are hypocritical, greedy, violent, malevolent, vengeful, cowardly,
                  deadly, mendacious, meretricious, loathsome, despicable, belligerent,

                  socially-retarded, puerile, clueless, and generally Not Good.Oky dokey. To The Cru:

                  You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As 
                  they
                  say in Texas. I'll bet you couldn't pour piss out of a boot with
                  instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won't go away. 
                  I
                  would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.

                  You're a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little 
                  worm
                  deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, 
                  a
                  weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a
                  revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.

                  You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared
                  richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth
                  into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody,
                  abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and
                  then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.

                  I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same 
                  species
                  as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very
                  thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid 
                  you.
                  You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, 
                  the
                  dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?

                  Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to
                  impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop
                  will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it
                  more rapidly.

                  You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive
                  its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to
                  fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink 
                  shame
                  of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea
                  of your own trite, foolish beliefs.

                  You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, 
                  nasty
                  and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You're a fool, an ignoramus.
                  Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won't have sex with you. You are
                  unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that
                  reality forgot.

                  And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important 
                  statements
                  of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do 
                  you
                  hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have 
                  more
                  weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle,
                  waiting for the bite of the snake?

                  You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and
                  obnoxious. You are the moral equivalent of a leech. You are a living
                  emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a 
                  disease,
                  you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.

                  On a good day you're a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are 
                  deficient
                  in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You
                  are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source 
                  of
                  all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.

                  You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock.
                  You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted 
                  boggish
                  foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless
                  crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You
                  cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup 
                  pratting
                  naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
                  fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.

                  You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are 
                  degenerate,
                  noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I 
                  despise
                  everything about you, and I wish you would go away.

                  I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard 
                  stupid.
                  Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond
                  the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are
                  trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far
                  that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no
                  intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on
                  Mercury stupid. You emit more stupid in one second than our entire
                  galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll.
                  Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some
                  primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure
                  essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
                  the laws of physics that we know. I'm sorry. I can't go on. This is
                  an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me 
                  again
                  for a while. I don't have enough strength left to deride your ignorant
                  questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of
                  the rest of this drivel. Duh.

                  The only thing worse than your logic is your manners. I have snipped
                  away most of what you wrote, because, well... it didn't really say
                  anything. Your attempt at constructing a creative flame was pitiful.
                  I mean, really, stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of
                  babbling was hardly effective... Maybe later in life, after you have
                  learned to read, write, spell, and count, you will have more success.
                  True, these are rudimentary skills that many of us "normal" people take
                  for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering. But we 
                  sometimes
                  forget that there are "challenged" persons in this world who find these
                  things more difficult. If I had known that this was your case then I
                  would have never read your post. It just wouldn't have been "right".
                  Sort of like parking in a handicap space. I wish you the best of luck
                  in the emotional, and social struggles that seem to be placing such a
                  demand on you.
