<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Personally I don't see why everyone is leaping down Smedley's throat and accusing him of being the one at fault here. When you start the game, you accept the End User License Agreement. By that, you agree that 

1) Your account can be banned for any reason at Verant's discression and that
2) third party programs, cheating, and exploitation are not allowed

Thats your warning, and its been shown consistently throughout the past that verant __agressively__ defends their policies. Sure, not everyone gets caught for everything. At present Verant's CS staff is HUGE(last i heard it was at least 10x the size of the largest game CS staff ever) but they also have a large number of servers to attend to as well - not every incident can be resolved. This game was a vision, and creation from Verant. They say it in their website (its their world) - they say it in the EULA (they control what goes on). Its never been a democracy in how the game is made, and never will be. Your trying to classify cheating into different levels of severity, when it is really "modification of the game." That isn't classified, and thats serious - its attempting to change what you promise not to change, its attempting to distort their vision of the game.

It takes alot of time and devotion to attain anything in this world, nothing is just "handed out" by verant. Every action you take has an effect, and the results of your mistakes have severe repercussions, as they do in life. Verants position isn't so much to make this a "fun game" but rather a perceptive reality.
And with this, they also realize players will want to gain an advantage over each other. In a world where class envy is central, where strength and status are essential, where the single individual has very little power - everyone will want to gain more, and granted people will try for the quicker and easier way.
You really have no one but yourselves to blame if you are banned, the second you activate a memory hack, or the second you break that EULA you are risking action as severe as banning. From what i've seen there are only a few things that will result in an instant ban for players with no warnings on their accounts - extreme racism and attempting to cheat/exploit/hack the servers or the client.

Everyone seems to think Verant owes them, and should feel sorry that you are gone. Why would they want someone so opposed to their views that they take radical action that violates the agreement they accept in order to __CHEAT__ in their world? They would much rather maintain the purity of their vision - and they never let the playerbase stand in the way of that.

If you dislike verant's methods, game, and world so much - drop the game, forget about it. If you hate it, it shouldn't matter to you what the company does or what goes on in the game. If your whining about what happened - you do care, you didn't want to get banned, and you made a bad choice in trying to hack the client. Verant punished you for it,and now you either move on or get a new account. Your responsible for your actions, it IS a world.. if you want to screw around and not get in trouble go play a mindless shooter, and stay away from the people who really want a flourishing world where the only advantage comes through one's own ingame actions and work.

EverQuest strives to be a reality, it strives to be the best game by rewarding hard work, giving players advantage by working hard as well, by combining excitement with boredom, happiness with sorrow, excitement with frustration. All together - it becomes what it sets out to be. I don't know about you, but in a world where there was only excitement and action, and no long term rewards for putting up with a variety of emotions and experiences, as well as reward for hard work, and gains were instant or short term only - I would rather not be in it. And once more, if you don't want to be in a fantasy world that lets us live another reality in addition to our own - go elsewhere.</TEXTAREA>
