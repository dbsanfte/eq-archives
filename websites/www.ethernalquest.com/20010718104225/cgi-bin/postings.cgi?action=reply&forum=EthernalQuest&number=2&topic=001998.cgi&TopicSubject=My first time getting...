Anyway, it's been a month since Ashran caught that nasty fever, and it's nearing the 1 year anniversary of the Emu!  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> And still, no updates. It's been 1 month 24 days since the projected "end of March" deadline Ashran made, and 25 days since the "End of April" deadline. Good job, and keep up the good work, Ash. <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Midnight Essence</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">The more you remind Ash that he hasn't updated, the more reluctant he may become at releasing the next version. Even if that takes another year.<P>He has no obligations, legal, moral or otherwise to complete this project. It's just that, his personal project. He may have opted to publicize his project for differing reasons, and again opted to give an estimation regarding the next update through pressure, but neither are grounds for an obligation of any sort. <BR>He isn't getting paid for this, so if you were to conveniently walk away due to his failure to bring you a working product, it's not likely to impact Ashran in any negative fashion.<P>Read:<BR>'6.2 :: When will the emulator be released?<BR>We don't really want to dedicate to a time. It should be soon.<P>6.2.1 :: No really. Tell me, damnit.<BR>Possibly towards the end of March or mid-April a working copy will be released.<P>6.2.2 :: Are you going to hold to that date or be like all those other companies?<BR>We're not a company. We didn't want to dedicate to a time. If it doesn't come out when we hope it will, don't blame us.'<P>People will annoy Ashran to the point that he will *say* a release date merely to placate them. This will save him time and effort, from at least limiting the number of people who constantly waste his time asking when the damn thing will be released!<P>I'm happy to wait, and if i get overly tired of waiting, i'll move on with my life, without bothering Ashran about it.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Snuh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Even though I respect Ash and his work he has done thus far, I must interject on this subject. I agree with TSD's earlier statements about, that if ash say's hes gonna do it, he had sure better do it. TRUE, he does not have any obligations to release the emulator, legal, moral, or otherwise. Then, why tell us lies about when its going to be released? If hes not going to release a new version, he should say "I am not going to release a new version", or not say anything at all. Ashran doesnt owe anyone anything, but the least he can do is have some consistancy between what he tells us and what he does =/</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Midnight Essence</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">'Then, why tell us lies about when its going to be released? If hes not going to release a new version, he should say "I am not going to release a new version", or not say anything at all.'<P>When a program is publicized, many people will begin to ask questions to the developers regarding when their program will be released. Many times, the developers will not even have a valid approximation, and will give a rough date merely because of the constant pressure from external sources such as the public. <P>Ashran stated that it will 'possibly' be released, this is not the same as 'definitely' or even 'most likely'. As also contained within my previous post, Ashran went on to state;<P>'We didn't want to dedicate to a time. If it doesn't come out when we hope it will, don't blame us.'<P>People will always find something to complain about, they'll complain if he doesn't give *any* release date, then they'll complain when it isn't released to a schedule that was only 'possibly' accurate.<P>I don't believe Ashran has lied, and unless he gives an exact date to which he swears and promises, using exactly those terms, i'll continue to believe he hasn't lied.<P>If you are unhappy with what you believe Ashran has or has not done. Then you should simply leave. A protest will only create an aura of apathy and force the project to expend time and resources that could be put to much better use.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Snuh</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">"If you are unhappy with what you believe Ashran has or has not done. Then you should simply leave."<P>Point taken, but I never said I was unhappy with how the project was turning out. I'm simply saying that Ashran should do what he says he's going to do. If he said "I'm going to get the next version out when I damn sure feel like it", I would be fine with that. <P>I have no problem with how its going. I can wait for the next release. I think very highly of the emulator. I just believe, again, that there should be some consistancy between what ashran says hes gonna do, and what he actually does. <P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Terminal Spirit Disease</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Keep in mind that FAQ is referring to last year's March/April...<P>But, he did state in a number of e-mails that the new version would first be released by the end of march, and now it's by the end of April. <P>As for telling us lies to placate us... Well, then he's got a moral obligation. Lying is immoral, obviously, so by mere logic, he's got a moral obligation to fufill the statement that he made. And like Snuh said, if Ashran said "I'll do it whenever the Hell I want to do it!" then I'd be perfectly fine. But he's given us release dates, which he is morally obligated to fufill. And he hasn't.

It was all based around a 'possibly', which generally just means conjecture.<P>'But, he did state in a number of e-mails that the new version would first be released by the end of march, and now it's by the end of April.'<P>Personally, i haven't received or seen these emails, so i can't provide a comment upon them directly.<BR>However, from my viewpoint i have yet to see a definite promise regarding a release date. Granted, his scheduling does appear somewhat inconsistent, but we should still be thankful for the opportunity he has given many people even if the project shouldn't happen to evolve further.<P>'As for telling us lies to placate us... Well, then he's got a moral obligation. Lying is immoral, obviously, so by mere logic, he's got a moral obligation to fufill the statement that he made.' <P>Again, i haven't seen direct evidence that shows Ashran making an absolute deadline to which he will be held accountable. His release dates are approximations, and from what i have seen, he states that quite clearly. With that being said, i can't see the lie in not releasing an update to a schedule to which he openly admits maybe inaccurate.<BR>If you can direct me to /quotes he has made proving otherwise, i'll gladly reconsider my opinion.<P>Edit: Misplaced words.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Midnight Essence (edited 05-23-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Terminal Spirit Disease</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">What are you talking about, Fraust?
