<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">Did you read the winxp post tux; it turned into an argument too, with people saying xp sucked more than people saying it was good.  Besides that, the reason I will never attack someone for saying windows is better is because I don’t want that person using unix/linux.  Think about it, do we really want linux to become the most popular operating system.  

Before we get started on why a popular linux is a bad ideal, let me say this.  I also always thought that the people on this board saying winxp is the best don’t know about linux, or weren’t comparing it to linux.  If they want to say winxp is better than previous windows then I can not argue with that since I don’t yet own winxp and probably wont because I have an extremely horrible taste in my mouth every time I think about registering with microshaft.  Also tux, if you read my posts I have never once said windows is better than linux period.  Nor have I said linux is better than windows period.  The whole crutch of my arguments are that both are necessary and better at certain things.  I know it is hard to swallow your pride and admit there are a few things windows is better for than linux, but it is true.  And again, I will never tell a windows user to switch to linux and now I will explain why.

First, if linux became popular it would go commercial.  The open source folks are currently preventing that from happening (you may only sell the CD it is on, support and the manuals and must provide the source code) but imagine how fast things can change.  If linux got popular bill gates would want to get in on the action, and somehow he would because he always does.  Plus people would want to see there stupid apps and features that linux is currently blessed to not have.  Sooner or later linux will become bloated and riddled with bugs the same way windows is.  Then were would we turn?  Think about what you wish for before you wish.

Second, the more people we have using linux the less stable it gets.  At home linux is great, because you and maybe your close friends/relatives are the only one that touch it.  Imagine if you had secretaries with linux desktops.  Head secretaries will want root privileges as soon as they find out what it is, and so will every manager, supervisor, or person who thinks he is in charge of another person.  None of them will know what root is they will just want it because they know just enough to know that it is for the people in charge.  And what is worse many of them will log onto it to do their regular computing activities.  Now let me tell you about secretaries as I have dealt with them a lot.  I once walked through the kitchen of a business where I was the computer contractor, or as they called me “the on call computer guy”, and a secretary was washing her keyboard in the sink.  I asked her what she was doing and her reply was “I spilled some coke on it and it was sticky, it happens all the time” I tried not to laugh in front of her and went home and ordered a new keyboard.  Sure enough two days later I got a call saying that secretaries computer would not respond to anything they did.  By the way I don’t do that anymore, I handed all my contracts over to my brother and got a job where I am just a high paid employee.  I got another call were a head secretary said nobody in the office could figure out why their new laser printer I installed a week earlier wasn’t working and there must be something wrong with it.  When I got there I opened the paper drawer and it was empty, I asked if anybody thought of checking to see if it had paper and I swear to you I had eight people looking at me with blank faces of stupidity.  About a week later a got a call from a different head secretary at a different company, this time I asked if it had paper and they assured me it did.  I also asked if it was turned on and plugged in since they indicated that the lights weren’t blinking anymore.  They assured me they tried to turn it on several times and that it was plugged in.  When I got there the head secretary said to me “see I hit the on button and nothing happens” as she pressed the on-line button.  Sure enough on the side in clear view and clearly labeled was an on/off switch.  So I ask you, should these people be on linux machines?  If you say yes you are a fool and completely blinded with ignorance.  Most businesses don’t even know what linux is, and they are better off that way.  Because most businesses use the computers in their office for mundane tasks that windows does well, like checking email writing up documents or reports, getting on the internet, making spread sheets, playing solitaire when the boss isn’t looking, generating newsletters, and perhaps the most advanced thing they do is maintain one or two simple databases.  In large businesses that need large complex databases or file servers they hire someone who does know about linux to make the decisions on what sort of servers would be best for them, and run the servers.  But they don’t put every Shmoe in the joint on a linux machine because that is just plain stupid.  In computer related industries things are different.  Many computer related industries either give linux machines to those who need them or provide a way to remotely log into one.  But where I work, the secretaries are not allowed to access the linux machines.  

Now seriously consider this tux, digital, ghost, and any other linux rules switch to linux people out there.  If there were as many machines running linux out there as windows then this would be a very dangerous and scary place to live.  Not only that but linux would quickly be perverted and ruined, and we would all be sitting around saying “man I wish we still had red hate release 7.1 and no one knew about it like back at the turn of the century, man those were the days.”  So stop your silly crusades and treat linux more like a treasure to be guarded and admired.  It may require swallowing a little pride, but in the long run it is for the best.

Oh and tux, mentioning the benefits of microsoft on the wallet was not part of the argument, just some side advice.  Oh, and I have never once tried to belittle you for your saying linux is the best, because you present your ideals in a clear way with facts to back it up.  You just use the same facts over and over again, but that isn’t your fault because most of the members here don’t take time to read or don’t understand the facts.  The main reason these two needed to be deflated is they were very arrogant and hotheaded.  You post with a cool calm sort of demeanor.  Somehow I thought you and I reached an agreement on the linux windows issue about a month or so back when we decided that windows is good for playing on and linux is good for working on.
