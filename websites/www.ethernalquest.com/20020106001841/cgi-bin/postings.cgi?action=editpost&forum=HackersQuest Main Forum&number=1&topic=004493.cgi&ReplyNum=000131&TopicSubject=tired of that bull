<TEXTAREA NAME="EditedMessage" ROWS=10 COLS=45 WRAP="VIRTUAL">"Also tux, if you read my posts I have never once said windows is better than linux period. Nor have I said linux is better than windows period."
I didn't mean to imply that /you/ do that. I was refering to the people that do.

"The whole crutch of my arguments are that both are necessary and better at certain things."
Yes, I am aware of your arguement and I have yet to disagree with it.

"I know it is hard to swallow your pride and admit there are a few things windows is better for than linux, but it is true."
There is no pride that is needed to be swallowed. I'm not Linus, it isn't my creation. I simply let people know some of the great advantages of Linux. However as I have said before, Windows does have a purpose, that is playing games (for the most part). Because 99% of Windows programs (not games) run on Linux nativly (without emus) or have clones which are just as good or better, not to metion compatible with the orginal. I'm not going to get into the more detailed reasons I believe that because I feel we already see eye to eye on that.

"First, if linux became popular it would go commercial. The open source folks are currently preventing that from happening (you may only sell the CD it is on, support and the manuals and must provide the source code) but imagine how fast things can change."
The Linux kernel and almost all programs for it are GPLed. At least all existing versions must and will stay open source. Even if Linus went crazy and decided to make it closed source and made you pay, there are plenty of people who would tell him to shuv it and work on the source where he left off providing it open source and free always (You know, all that "communist bastards" that go out of their way to provide great programs for free and give away the knowlege for others to learn, yah, them)

"If linux got popular bill gates would want to get in on the action,"
Per reasons listed above it wouldn't really matter who got into the action.

"Second, the more people we have using linux the less stable it gets. At home linux is great, because you and maybe your close friends/relatives are the only one that touch it."
That makes no sense at all. Just because the OS was popular would not mean that you would lose control over who can use your computer. Nor does it mean everyone would have root access to everyone else's computer suddendly because it is free. Maybe on /their/ computers they might mess stuff up being logged in as root, but that doesn't mean the actual OS would become more unstable.

As for all of that stuff with the secretaries. Just don't give them root access to the desktops. Also like I said before, even if they got root access, just because they messed up their computer doing stuff wrong under root would not mean that the OS is suddenly more unstable.

"Because most businesses use the computers in their office for mundane tasks that windows does well, like checking email writing up documents or reports, getting on the internet, making spread sheets, playing solitaire when the boss isn?t looking, generating newsletters, and perhaps the most advanced thing they do is maintain one or two simple databases."
Actually they usually get suckered into subscription based liscense "deals" with Microsoft that pretty much locks them into an all Windows work environment. (On a side note, Linux does all of those things quite well  :))

"Now seriously consider this tux, digital, ghost, and any other linux rules switch to linux people out there. If there were as many machines running linux out there as windows then this would be a very dangerous and scary place..."
Read above as I covered this.
