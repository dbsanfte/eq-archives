'lurking' even. I recently quit EQ and also a short time before that quit working for the Guide Program.<P>I am seriously pissed at the program itself and how they treat both players and guides alike. I dunno if anyone has posted this in the past, but I thought I might give anyone thats interested a peak at what all the GM/Guide equipment does. This is directly out of the CS manual:<P>	2.3 Customer Service Tools<BR>	<BR>	<BR>	2.3.1 The following Tools are available to all Guides of Apprentice level and up:<BR>	<BR>	Staff of Guidance – Creates a gate effect when used, returning the CS Representative to their bind point.<BR>	<BR>	<BR>	2.3.2 The following Tools are available to all full Guides and up.  Unless otherwise noted in this document, all of these tools are to be used on CS Representatives only, not on customers.  CS armor comes in three varieties:  Armor of the Righteous, Armor of the Malign, and Verdant Armor.  Except for appearance and name, there is no difference between the three types of CS armor.<BR>	<BR>·	Robes of Guidance and Breastplates - This armor has the Guide Health effect, allowing Guides to regen health faster and to breathe underwater. This armor only needs to be worn for its effect. <BR>·	Helm - When activated it clears the memory of the targeted MOB making it forget at what or whom it is angry. <BR>·	Earring of Shifting Sight - Allows the CS Rep to see approximately what another PC or NPC is seeing. To activate the CS Representative should first target the PC or NPC and then right click on it. The item does have a spell effect, therefore the CS Representative will become visible at the time of activation. An anomaly can occur that will lock-up the view. The workaround is for the CS Representative to [TAB] to target themselves, cast it on themselves, move and then re-cast it. This tool also causes the user's stamina to drain. <BR>·	Ring of Escape - Will make you impervious to all attacks for 1 minute of real time, though no attacks are possible during this minute. Used primarily for fire and lava exploration. <BR>·	Ring of Banishing - Casts Cancel Magic (at 2x power), Cure Poison and Cure Disease. <BR>·	Earring of Life - Boosts the CS Representative's resistances considerably. Also will emit light when equipped (even when the CS Representative is invisible). <BR>·	Guide Telescope - Allows a CS Representative to zoom in approximately 20 feet. Also will emit light while equipped (even when the CS Representative is invisible). <BR>·	Collar - Casts shrink. The CS Representative must be in a dungeon zone for the item to cast successfully. <BR>·	Guise - While equipped the CS Representative will have Avatar Sight giving them ultra-vision and see invisible. <BR>·	Vambraces - While equipped the CS Representative will be under the influence of Troll's Essence, boosting strength, stamina, and health regen, but reducing intelligence. <BR>·	Gauntlets - Casts the spell ResurrectionGM. Currently there is a 3-hour limit on all resurrect spells, making it impossible for a corpse to be resurrected after 3 hours. <BR>·	Cape - Casts Bind Affinity on the targeted PC. <BR>·	Belt - Creates a gate effect when used, returning the CS Representative to their bind point. <BR>·	Greaves - Casts Spirit of Norrath on Self only. This provides a significant increase in movement speed. <BR>·	Boots - Casts Levitation on Self only. Allowing CS Representatives to safely travel on treacherous landscapes. <BR>·	Ceremonial Gown - A cosmetic piece without function. <BR>·	Words of Ceremony - A cosmetic piece without function<P>So theres that, im not sure how its going to show up on this post cause I just cut it from the manual they sent me.<P>*shrugs* was bored, hope someone enjoyed it.<BR><P>------------------<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">AppleKid</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> I got a question: as a guide, were you running itemcollector and looted yourself? It would be cool if those sort of items become usable in the emulator...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fraust</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Nah, I was guiding before I even looked at the HackersQuest website. I do believe however *almost* a complete set of those items are actually in the database. <P>Though of course none of the effects work on the armor/weapons inside the emulator; so basically its just for looks.<P>~~~~~~~~~<BR>-Fraust<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fraust</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">A few people e-mailed me and asked for me to post the entire CS Guide manual. While I wouldn't mind doing that... well the entire manual is 50 some odd pages long. Most of it is bland stuff anyway, mainly what you can and cannot do, how to deal with situations ect. <P>I will post the GM/guide commands; its a pretty small list. I know its not a complete list but this is straight out of the manual.<P>	2.2   Customer Service Commands<BR>	<BR>	<BR>2.2.1	The following commands are available to all Apprentice Guides:<P>	/searchcorpse &lt;playername&gt; - Used to verify the existence of a corpse and to discover the zone in which it is located.  Caution should be taken when using this command as it has proved unreliable when multiple corpses exist. Apprentices using this command should escalate to a full Guide if there is any doubt.<P><BR>	2.2   Customer Service Commands<BR>	<BR>	<BR>2.2.1	The following commands are available to all Apprentice Guides:<P>	/searchcorpse &lt;playername&gt; - Used to verify the existence of a corpse and to discover the zone in which it is located.  Caution should be taken when using this command as it has proved unreliable when multiple corpses exist. Apprentices using this command should escalate to a full Guide if there is any doubt.<P><BR>2.2.2	The following commands are available to all full Guides:<BR>	<BR>	/find &lt;playername&gt; or &lt;NPCfirstname_ NPClastname##&gt; or &lt;playername&gt;’s corpse&lt;#&gt; - Used to find the location of a player, player’s corpse or NPC. Intra-zone command.<BR>	<BR>	G - Brings up the GM menu/Queuing Tool.<BR>	<BR>	/goto &lt;playername&gt; or &lt;NPCfirstname_ NPClastname##&gt; - Used to go to a player or NPC. Inter-zone/Intra-zone command.  If the parameters are left out, /goto will take the Guide to the targeted PC/NPC/corpse.<BR>	<BR>	/hideme –the GM version of hide.  Used for investigations.  It will synchronize your /anonymous status with your visibility state. Note: you must target yourself to use this command. The command does not work on anyone but yourself, even though you will receive messages saying that it did.  You will no longer be hidden upon zoning, as well.  There have been reported anomalies with Area of Effect spells and tracking.<BR>	<BR>	/kill - kills the targeted NPC, leaving no corpse.  Only used to clear out stuck/broken NPCs, and only after attempting all other avenues of resolution (i.e. Wand of Memory, etc.)<BR>	<BR>	/private  - used to speak on the private channel<BR>	<BR>	/servers – This will show the availability of all zones on a server.  The list is ordered with the most recently available zones on top.<BR>	<BR>	/summon &lt;playername&gt; - Used to bring a player to you.  Inter-zone command.  /Summon without a parameter summons the player or corpse currently targeted.<BR>	<BR>	/summon &lt;playername&gt;’s Corpse&lt;#&gt; - Used to summon a player’s corpse.  Intra-zone command.  Always use the summoning procedures when using this tool.<BR>	<BR>	/toggle &lt;on/off&gt; Used to toggle your availability to receive /tells on and off at the server .<BR>	<BR>	/zone &lt;zonename&gt; – see Appendix B&gt; - Used to go to any zone.  Takes you to a “safe point” in the zone.  Always use the summoning procedures when using this tool.<BR>	<BR>	<BR>	2.2.3   The following commands are available to all Senior and Elder Guides:<BR>	<BR>	/becomenpc &lt;race#&gt; [&lt;gender=M, F, N&gt; &lt;body armor#&gt; &lt;head armor#&gt; &lt;face type#&gt; &lt;height#&gt; &lt;max level#&gt;] - Change the form of the targeted PC or NPC, converting them into an NPC (full PvP). Not all &lt;race#&gt; are available in every zone.  Some are “global”, such as the PC races, and others are local and only appear in some zones.  Used discretely, never in front of players, and usually in conjunction with Quest preparations.  This command may be abbreviated as /be<BR>	<BR>	/broadcast &lt;message&gt;  Will send that notice message to all players who are online on that server.<BR>	<BR>	/height &lt;#&gt; -used to change the height of the target PC or NPC.  /height 0 returns the targeted player to the default height for the player’s current race.  DO NOT EXCEED /height 98, as that will corrupt the character’s file and require external repairs before the character can log back in again.<BR>	<BR>	/kick - used to kick a player from the game and send them back to the server selection screen. This is only used to remove players that are stuck in-game and unable to log in or players who are deemed to be asleep (see Section 7.2.3).<BR>	<BR>	/name &lt;oldname&gt; &lt;newname&gt; [b] -  Used to change player’s names.  The b is optional and will dump the original name to the name filter when used.  This command cannot be used to add last names or titles.  Always follow the naming procedures in using this tool.<BR>	<BR>	/lastname - used to grant last names to players who have reached 20th level<P><BR>Enjoy.<P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~<BR>-Fraust</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Pooly</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Guides have gotten some new tools recently, it seems. They can now, for example, group translocate, and charm NPCs. Resetting a stuck NPC now means group, translocate, disband instead of the old memblur or attack, memblur method.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">kaotix14</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Hmm could you *Ahem*  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/wink.gif"> "mail" me a copy of the guide tools and tell me how to update them</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fraust</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Not sure if this is what you were implying Pooly... but you cannot (to my knowledge) group with NPC's. GM's however do have the ability to send *players* back to there bind point via some sort of translocation without grouping.<P>I was not aware they could do that with NPC's however.<P>~~~~~~~~~<BR>-Fraust<P>[This message has been edited by Fraust (edited 04-23-2001).]<p>[This message has been edited by Fraust (edited 04-23-2001).]</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SkrewVI</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ahhhh, yes you CAN group with any NPC in the game.  Now this ability may have been taken away from Guides recently, but try it out if you are a guide, I know GM's can do it easy.<P>1. Walk up to any NPC in the game, get in conversation range and target them<P>2. just say 'group' to them. (NOT /group, this is not a command, just say it like you were talking to them.<P>3. The NPC will respond with something like "Grouping with Ashran"<P>4. You may now treat it like a pet, with all pet commands.<P>5. The only way to ungroup with them is to zone, if you go invis, it will attack you.<P>Often I would be strolling around with my pet Orc, making players look on, was great fun!  Once you have a npc grouped, the GM can GMgate the npc back to its bind point (spell 797)<P>SkrewVI........<BR></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Fraust</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">That's really cool. Wish I was made aware of that while I was guiding. I honestly think being a GM would have been alot more fun then being a Guide was. On the server I was on we were given a STRICT set of rules we had to follow. <P>If Verant let Guides and GM's give players the benefit of the doubt more often then not, it would be more enjoyable for guides and players alike. IMO of course.<P>------------------<BR>~~~~~~~~~<BR>-Fraust</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>
