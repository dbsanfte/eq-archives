It doesn't really look as if the complicity is really required as there doesn't seem to be much benifit given the work you must do to install and make the new SEQ 4 work. To this end I have a strong feeling that rather than trying to work through the bugs, many people will be pushing hard for a simple WINSEQ version fully functional, windows friendly that will bypass all the downloading and reconfiguring/recompiling of the latest SEQ. <P>The only way I can see to somewhat avoid this is if someone would write and post a very consice installation guide like the very nice one we had for 3.1.2 <P>I have been trying for a few days to configure 4.0 to run, but I have 3.1.2 running on another PC so I have time to learn and make this work, many will not have that luxury.....<P>Just a thought, thanks.<P>PS  the guide that is posted on SEQ message board is really still too technical to follow...it needs to be made clearer for linux noobs to follow...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">FrozenInTime</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I think it's good that SEQ actually requires some thought when it comes to installing.  Just learning to install it can teach others about an OS other than WinBlows and get them away from the point-and-click world.<P>If you can't work through the steps to install SEQ, then maybe you shouldn't be using it.  Ratt seems to like think that this is the way it should be, and in this regard I would have to agree with him.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I could'nt agree more, therein lies my point. If they can't get it to work, SOMEONE WILL port a working version to WINSEQ for the lazy people who won't work to get SEQ 4 running. It is only a matter of time. And then all the work that everyone has done to get SEQ4 will be meaningless because VI will change the encryption every week or more like they did when WINSEQ exsisted before.<P>Mark my words, it is only a matter of time. We can buy time or even prevent it totally by making SEQ somewhat easier to install....</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ratt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">You are being totally contradictory in your thinking.<P>First off, if someone is technically inclined enough to port SEQ to Windows, they can obviously get it running with ease on a Linux machine.  <P>Additionally, what would the point be to make SEQ as easy to install was a Windows port... if it's just as easy to install, you might as well HAVE a Windows port, no?  So what would the point be?<P>Contrary to popular belief, the move to the newer libs and compiler was not done to make it more difficult to install SEQ.  In fact, I really am _very_ suprised so many people are having so many problems.  I honestly did not foresee this issue (I don't think it would have affected the decision, regardless) ...  I was able to update all my boxes, even my test rigs in a couple hours each.  Some of the slower ones obviously took a long time to bootstrap GCC and then recompile QT, but it was not difficult to do.<P>I think that perhaps some of the problems are stemming from the RPMs though... I never use RPMs, so I never tested against any RPMs.  I always download source and compile it for my specific machines.  I've never been a big fan of RPMs and probably never will be.  I like to know exactly what's going into my machine, when and where... RPMs are creepy.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I really don't think someone with the knowledge to port SEQ to a WIN application would have problems installing it on linux BUT I do think there are those out there, ESPECIALLY those who think they can turn a profit from it, would do EXACTLY that. <P>Someone will do it simply because with the complexity of the new SEQ there is now a market for an application such as WINSEQ. even if 1% of all EQ users use SEQ (and in my world its closer to 5%) thats 4000 or so users even if only 20% were to buy it for say $20 thats still a tidy sum. Hey I don't want it to happen, I just think by making the install complicated you are forcing others to look elsewhere. Its just typical capitalism. I sure am not going to do it, but someone willing to make as much as several thousand dollars sure would...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ratt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If that were the case, it would have happened already.<P>The fact of the matter is, the ones wanting to make money off of it are too technically inept to do much but follow Adenine's guide to installing SEQ.<P>SEQ v4.x or even 3.x are NOT hard to install for the moderately competent person, the current rash of "it's too hard" will die down once everything gets into place and an established protocol for updating your system is devised.<P>If anything, it prevents the cocksuckers selling SEQ on Ebay from doing so, which is a good thing.<P>In fact, there should be a message that comes up with SEQ stating that if you paid for SEQ in any way, you got ripped off...<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BlueAdept</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">If another public version of WSEQ comes out, I believe that Verant will kill it quickly by changing the encryption.<P>Then EVERYONE will be SOL. <P>If someone ports seq to windows, for the love of God, keep it to yourself so you dont screw us all.<P>As for it being difficult to install....so what...the new version is worth the trouble. Im sure that there is some reason why they used the new qt and compiler. If people cant figure it out then they shouldnt be using it. There are many step by step messages on seq.sourceforge.net which really makes it stupid simple.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ratt I hope you are wrong, But neccesity is the mother of invention. It only takes one person with a hole in their heart to screw it up for everyone. <P>By making SEQ4 beyond the ability of those unwilling to try, or those unable to do, you have opened a market for WINSEQ. I hope it never happens but unforutnate as it is,  the need (in those losers eyes) is now there bigger than it ever was.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">sub_neowin</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I dont understand why VI didnt change the encryption when SOL came out. I honestly think they cant do much more. I think the only way to stop ShowEQ for good, is to build EQ from scratch again. And well, VI is too lazy for that.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Povarian</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial"> This is exactly what I said a month ago in these threads and in sourceforge. WINSEQ will raise the user percentage of SEQ from about 2% (if that) to about 30% or more. This will turn heads. and its easy for them to change some of the decyrptions on a weekly basis. Are they fixable? yes. But usually takes a week to get them down. Now the devs will have to chase their tail to keep up with the new opcodes and whatnot. VI isn't at war with SEQ and probably could care less because of the small percentage that have it working and use it. What I am hoping for is that after a few changes the people who developed WINSEQ won't have the patience to keep up with the updates and it will fail. If this happens I for one will be smiling. Ratt and the others at sourceforge made something nice and available without crossing the line.<P>And a note to the WINSEQ people here and in Sourceforge, Please get your own MB. This is not a place for you to debate. This is a Linux SEQ support forum.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BlueAdept</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Well if WSEQ ever does make a re-appearance, Verant will put an end to it quickly by changing the encryption...unfortunately it will also break SEQ.<P>If that happened and if I was the one who wrote libEQ.a, I might not release it to the public. Only give out to trustworthy people and tell them to keep it to themselves. Then no one would have to worry about WSEQ rearing its ugly head again. <P>I bet your glad that I didnt write libEQ.a  <IMG SRC="http://www.ethernalquest.com/ubb/smile.gif"></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Monchichi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Did I miss the "free crack cocaine" line somewhere?  This version of SEQ is no more difficult to get working than any other, the simple FACT is that most people running it (the ones complaining) are doing so on a box with the SOLE purpose of running SEQ.  Why then, with multiple distributions of linux easily available, is it so extremely difficult to get the latest and start from the beginning?  Obviously there are people out there looking for an "easy way" to get SEQ 4.0 running and its already been painted out for them in a handful of posts, yet the complaints continue...  I don't understand.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Ancient_Cyclops_001</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Actually, I've recently come across what appears to be WinShowEQ on an obscure website. Won't post the link here out of deference to popular opinion - but the file was about 733kb in size, zipped. No binary was included - it appears to be a lump of source. I haven't compiled it as of yet, but I thought it was an interesting find.<P>I may play with it a bit later just to see if it's worth a damn...<P>-AC</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">NDT</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">On the money side of things...if someone came out with WSEQ...they would definately have the patience to update it since they would more tan likely charge a monthly fee. And this program would probably make many willing to pay more then they do to play EQ itself per month. I haven't used ShowEQ in awhile so I can't say anything about it getting any harder to install but I know a few versions back it was a joke to install and I am not even that knowledgable on linux like many of you.<BR>I can say that yeah you know someone will make a WSEQ...actually I am sure someone probably has already...they just haven't let it out. Thos emaking the SEQ are not going to care if it destroys our little world we have here either. Especially if it will end up turning a profit. I would rather not see WSEQ either...but somewhere it will probably show up.<P>BTW...heh I haven't been back here in a long time..where is the SEQ4 just CVS it like normal? And there a post saying if there is a difference and if it contains the luclin zones?<P>Later,<BR>NDT</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Of all the people I know that run SEQ (about 30) only ONE uses their linux box for something else. By making SEQ more complicated to install (and it is VASTLY more complex because none of the Linux Distros come complete with all the RPMs. I could load a new load of redhat 7.0 AND SEQ from scratch in about 90 minutes. I have tried 5 times to get version 4 working and always I have errors. I don;t know if it is something I am doing OR bugs in the CVS version or bugs in the RPMs or what. People are getting frustrated. Even though many people have posted guides and tips on this and the new SEQ message boards, they are confusing or incomplete. Some of them even contradict themselves. <P>By maiking statements like "if you can't get it running, you shouldn't be using it" you are playing right into the hands of the WINSEQ developers. They WILL make a WINSEQ and it WILL impact SEQ<P>All someone has to do is post a CONCISE guide on how to make it work, (adding steps for redhat and mandrake) and the problem would be virtually eliminated. If you think for a minute that you are preventing something by making the install complicated and time consuming you are only going to destroy SEQ. <P>OR you could write a guide to making the 3.1.2 distro fully functional for those who dont care about CPU useage...</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Monchichi</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Yeah right dude, go back to your can of paint chips.  There alreadu *IS* a concise guide to installing SEQ 4 from at least a Redhat 7.1 / 7.2 distro, and honestly.. if someone is so slow they can't follow those instructions to get SEQ running on a fresh installation of SEQ they should check into quitting EQ alltogether if they can't play without the crutches.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">BlueAdept</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">I use my linux box as a firewall, web server, email services, seti server, and a few other things.<P>Been thinking of moving my web services and users to another server but havent built it yet.<P>If you know people who ONLY use thier linux box for SEQ, then they need serious help.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Monchichi<P>this attitude is EXACTLY why SEQ is in danger of being destroyed.

It sounds to me like you can't get it working, so you want someone to do it for you, and you are using some wierd FUD tactic to try to get people to do your thinking for you.<P>It's not working, but you keep repeating it in the vain hope that it will.  Get with the program here.  People who CAN port SEQ to Windows really don't CARE to make a few bucks on Ebay and open themselves up to the whole ugly... and I mean ugly... legal battle that _could_ ensue, both from Verant and other sources.  <P>The people with the talent to do so, and the gall to sell it most likely ALREADY have high paying jobs in the corporate programming world and/or are too responsible to do so.  Those with the ethics that would allow them to do so are too stupid to do so, hence, it won't be done.  <P>You are attributing entirely too much intelligence to greedy morons out to make a quick buck.  If you can't set up a Linux version of SEQ, you SURE AS HELL can't port a version to Windows.  If you can port a version to Windows, you SURE AS HELL don't want to waste the time and encumbant problems of selling such a piece of software... which doesn't even get into the support aspect of it.  <P>Lets say someone did exactly what you proposed and sells 1000 copies, great... at 50 bucks each.  That's 50,000 bucks... quite a lot of money.  Now, a day later, Verant changes some minor stuff in the data stream and flops a few things around... L-SEQ is fixed within a day, the libEQ library is recompiled and redistributed, end of the L-SEQ story.  <P>Now... you as the $50,000 richer W-SEQ seller now much support 1000 angry people because your piece of shit software doesn't work AND you have to figure out what's changed and reverse engineer libEQ again... time consuming... A few days later, at best, you distribute the ENTIRELY NEW PROGRAM at several megabyte each.  I'd say 10 megs BARE minimum for a Windows port.  That's 1 Gigabyte of downloads, bare minimum you'd have to support each time there is a change.  Your free services aren't going to stand for that very long, so you'll have to have a hosted solution... that costs $$.<P>Verant finds out your a selling this and sends an exploritory cease and desist letter to you... you fail to comply.  A quick court subpeona... IN SAN DIEGO appears a couple months later ... oo a plane ticket to go defend yourself, or hire a lawyer... there's more $$ out of your pocket.  It's eating into your $50,000 and sanity pretty quick.<P>Ohh, now look, you have 50 pissed off customers (out of 1000) because your program doesn't work, and they paid good money for it...  5 of them decide to sue you.  Now you have to defend yourself against Verant AND 5 pissed off customers, what fun.  Your lawyer is happy, you are not.<P>Ooo... one of them wins in small claims court, you have to pay them $50 back... AND the court costs... AND your lost time and $$ to appear in court.  <P>Mmm... where'd that $50,000 go?  it's mostly gone now... and Verant is still breathing down your neck.  You think $50,000 is going to phase Sony?<P>You WILL stop selling W-SEQ and you WILL NOT ever update it again.  W-SEQ is broken, L-SEQ is fixed ... no more W-SEQ and you are $50,000 poorer or more.<P>So go ahead... make a W-SEQ and try to sell it.<P></FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">dkflt</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">Besides, there's a lot of gratification when you spend a lot of time working on building and finally get it working.</FONT></TD></TR><TR bgcolor="#1f1f1f"><TD valign=top><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">SNEAKY</FONT></TD><TD><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Verdana, Arial">OK Ratt you are correct on one point, I am having trouble getting it to work.
