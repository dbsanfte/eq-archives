Well I have good news and bad news.<br>
<br>
The good news is we've continued progressing through GoD, we have been doing Ikk trials sporadically and all has been going well in that regards.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I also have some sad news...<br>
<br>
We recently lost a warrior who we have all grown <br>
very close to. He was a warrior like no other, and<br>
we had our misgivings about him. He is a darkie<br>
which always made people pause at the time he was<br>
invited, and he had a background no one was too<br>
sure about. But he took a spot in our hearts and<br>
will not be soon forgotten. His absense leaves a<br>
hole in defiant hearts that no other I think will<br>
be able to fill. We will honor his memory, and <br>
cherish the experiences we shared with him and <br>
hold them close to us as we continue our EQ <br>
journey.<br>
<br>
To him I'd like to dedicate this update, and tell<br>
him that because he transferred to Kane Bayle, he<br>
has not been forgotten.<br>
<br>
We will remember you always and forever.<br>
<br>
It seems like just yesterday you entered our ranks<br>
asked for every piece of loot that dropped and<br>
left us. <br>
<br>
We will be cycling some grief concillors around<br>
during raids to help our members cope with this.<br>
<br>
Also Bonuzz's whorehouse will be having a special<br>
on transvestite gnome hookers, which are a<br>
favorite of many defiants.<br>
<br>
Its all about healing the pain<br>

Also lost is the unidentified caster that was lodged in his ass, who had to transfer since we were unable to remove him. Trolls have a colon like cement unfortunately.<br>
<br>
<br>
SWEETDREAM is back too! Which is important because Sweet is supernifty and was terribly missed and we are thrilled to see him again. <br>
<br>
Other than that not much new, just lootwhorin, drama and people AE TLin from us. I had a funny screenshot of: <br>
"Rubiness Runnin to PoEb" <br>
"Rubiness healed and zoning back" <br>
"Rubiness LOW!" <br>
"Rubiness zoning to PoEb!"<br>
"Rubiness sliced in PoEb! damn zoned"<br>
"Rubiness low in PoEA!"<br>
"Zoned to PoEb!"<br>
<br>
etc but somehow I lost it, which is a shame cause it was really kinda funny =/

We are looking for a few to add to our ranks. If you are considering applying, send me tell in game or PM me on this board and do it now. We will most likely close most app's soon.<br>
<br>
Do not bother sending me a tell (kerupt) if you dont play a minimum of 5 days a week, during our raiding hours.<br>
<br>
We are looking for <br>
<br>
Clerics - 3-5<br>
Beastlords - 2<br>
Bard - 2<br>
Druid - 2<br>
Enchanter - 1<br>
Monk - 1<br>
Rogue - 1<br>
Warrior - 2<br>
Wizard - 2<br>
<br>
<a href="http://pub122.ezboard.com/fdefiantvzfrm22.showMessage?topicID=419.topic">A link to guild app infoz</a><br>
<br>
If you class was not mentioned, you can still send Kerupt a tell ingame. We are looking for exceptional players who are committed to the game and their guild<br>
<br>
If you just wanna chat and get to know a few members, talking to Lurkolicious will give you a worst case scenario<br>
