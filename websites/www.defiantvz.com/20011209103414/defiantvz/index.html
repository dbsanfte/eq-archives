One Evening on Mithaniel Marr...err Vallon Zek.<br>
<br>
Yesterday we had to flee err leave the Temple of Veeshan hastily. We had upset a mean old Dragon named Lord Vyemm. In our haste to leave we left behind one dead gnome (Kelidimari), One halfling foot comb (Zegelmorph's) and Cuchulainn's favorite mix tape. The tape was important because it contained all of cuch's favorite songs like the one creed song he's always talking about.<br>
<br>
So back we went.<br>
Zegelmorph passed on an inspiring messages from Deputy Budo himself.<br>
<br>

<br>
Buoyed by this we engaged Lord Vyemm.<br>
<br>

<br>
We then napped in the pleasantly cool shade of his wing.<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/Psimorph/fullsize/bigdragon.jpg" alt="Relax."></center><br>
<br>
Unfortunately we were robbed of shade by the following people who looted his corpse =(.<br>
Daelron plucked Vyemms right or left eye.<br>
Slaede ninja'd a Silver bracelet of rage i think.<br>
Dragon Rib bone thingy went to hardolmer.<br>
<br>
Only Vulak Aerr remained alive in the temple.<br>
HOwever we did not think we could kill him with 42 people we decided to set up for him anyway.<br>
Luckily for us Dagmar showed up with friends.<br>
<br>

<br>
Using a pair of Weezer tickets we lured Vulak into the back of the temple  and mugged  him.<br>

<br>
Yakatizma's Shield of Crafting to Xerxus.<br>
Crystasia's Crystal Ring to Emron.<br>
Gharn's Rock of Smashing to Benel.<br>
<br>
Good work to all who came.<br>
<br>
Here is the happy gang in all their glory.<br>
<br>
