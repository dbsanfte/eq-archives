Evening Folks.<br>
<br>
Little Quick update here.<br>
<br>
A little Luclin adventuring Resulting in dead snakes. Those suckers can move.<br>
<br>
We had never killed king Tormax because Those Icy Mushrooms were the best thing since the Slower metabolism abilty. Banquet sized meals + Metabolism = never shopping again !.<br>
<br>
But the other day mushrooms were out of stock Tormax had taken them all =(. We had only one avenue of action availible to us !<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/frenziedsales/tormax.jpg" alt="HE did'nt have any mushrooms either. Gotta trek all the way to fungus grove now."></center><br>
<br>
Boots(Head) to Peoni.<br>
Gloves to Ridge.<br>
Boots to....I forget.<br>
Axe of the Kromzek kings to some lucky ED who was on the way to the Arena.<br>
Oh and monk wrist to Sirdet.<br>
<br>
Whack Thought horror Overfiend which was a  very very very exciting Fight. Unfortunately i missed it because i took a wrong turn and fell 10,000 feet into The Deep. He dropped nothing but spells. luckily 2 of them happened to be decent.<br>
<br>
After that Killed Vyemm who dropped A weak Sk only sword which went to a twink.<br>
Onyx Gloves to Abou however ! One of the few non suck Vyemms in a while.<br>
<br>
Of course with Vyemm dead. We had to take a swing at Mr. Pinata himself !<br>
<br>
Vulak the Mighty !<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/frenziedsales/vulakx.jpg" alt="Gravy ! all Gravy !"></center><br>
<br>
Well Vulak is usually Gravy. HE always drops good stuff. We were getting a little tired of the rings however. Luckily as you can see he Dropped some most excellent stuff this time.<br>
<br>
Mylokar's Dagger to  Zegelmorph.<br>
Valtrons Necklace of Wonder to Macie.<br>
Pimp Belt of haste to Korthaf.<br>
<br>
After Vulak we were still hungry for Dragons so off we went to Skyshrine to visit Yelinak. I wanted some Tea he did'nt have any so we killed him.<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/frenziedsales/yelinak2.jpg" alt="3 ? Wtf ? Verant sucks. Upgrade his shit already."></"></center><br>
<br>
Yelinak Dropped Dragonskin mask i think which went to.. A hamster i think or a pet.<br>
<br>
His head, which went to skaag.<br>
<br>
And Not one. Not two..<br>
<br>
BUT 3 ! THREE SOUL DEFILERS ! <br>
<br>
Hooray for sk only weapons.<br>
<br>
Neshma Rezen and another Lucky SK twink got them.<br>
<br>
Now this update's quotes. Find the Ranger...you win a prize ! <br>

Morning Folks,<br>
<br>
Well people have been annoying me to update, i offered to let them update but they were gone  to Orono, Maine where there is no internet or even electricity (But there are rumors of some type of higher education facility). So i have to do it. <br>
<br>
Ok here it is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://edit.store.yahoo.com/lib/frenziedsales/pissoff.jpg" alt="Look Boring Dead Dragons"></center> <br>
<br>
Look Dead dragons, now piss off.<br>
<br>
Vulaks and Snakemen and Giants and of course the very important Lodizals have all been dying repeatedly.<br>
<br>
In between dead dragons i get to log into conversations like this.<br>
<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/aob.jpg" alt="Won't you take the information super highway to my heart ?"></left><br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/aob2.jpg" alt="Won't you take the information super highway to my heart ?"></left><br>
<br>
Well people do get bored wiating for Vulak to pop and do silly things...like become retarded.<br>
<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/concussion.jpg" alt="He's grouped with dagmar"></left><br>
<br>
I grouped him with Dagmar.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Dagmar, here's a photo of him dead. It's just filler since i don't feel like thinking too hard about what i'm typing.<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/dagmardead.jpg" alt="Dead pecks you can't get enough"></center><br>
<br>
So where was I, yeah for some reason Vulak did'nt want to pop and since nothing else of interest was alive we decided to stay in there and try and lure him out with bait. Nothing worked exceot for the Classic gnome in a pot.<br>
<br>
now it was supposed to be a highly entertaining Animated gif involving a  gnome and a pot and some other funny stuff. But As always My imagination wrote checks that i did'nt feel like cashing..or walking to the bank and cashing or something, an allegory..analogy..something anyway i'm lazy and here's a jpg of a gnome in a pot.<br>
<br>
<center> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/tasty.jpg" alt="This would have be been pimp if i was'nt so lazy and or clueless"></center><br>
<br>
It also would have been helpful had I any inkling of how to make an animated gif.<br>
<br>
After that Vulak Came out and we killed him.<br>
Bloodstone Eyepatch to Gungho.<br>
Akkirus Mask of Warfare to Duhara.<br>
Abashi's rod of Disempowerment to Sirdet.<br>
Crystassia's Crystal Ring to myself.<br>
Carmilia's Bracelet of Invigor to Azhen.<br>
Solist's Earring of something or other to Hardalek.<br>
Another Ring to Daelron.<br>
<br>
There were other Vulaks but i forgot who got what.<br>
<br>
And now for random screenshots, Hooray.<br>
<br>

<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/shhhh.jpg" alt="Oh shit woolfer just dove off another cliff."></left><br>
<br>
Soulburner Came back again !<br>
Previously Kunark had come out And Soulburner made it to Trakanon's teeth and had logged off there. Then Came Velious he logged in and got all the way to the Cobalt Scar before becoming lost and Charmed by a siren . He camped out for a year again and Came back to help fight the good fight in Luclin with his Guise,Orobe 25 Mr and 2 fists of fury he was ready to be root dotted by any number of halfling druids.<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/oldfriend.jpg" alt="Yes we do."></left><br>
<br>
Here on Vallon Zek we do sometimes run into the annoyance of pvp. You never know when some cleric is gonna run up and sic a Hammer on your ass. Shegs never saw it coming.<br>
<br>
Shegs was fighting for his life against several enemies and his guildmate Plagoo comes along...does plagoo heal him ?<br>
<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/clericpet.jpg" alt="Plagoo you evil bastard."></left><br>
<br>
Plagoo breaks out Kabtik and sends shegs packing.<br>
<br>
Yet more ! <br>
<br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/dagtv1.jpg" alt="Ouch"></left><br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/dagtv2.jpg" alt="Ouch"></left><br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/dagtv3.jpg" alt="Ouch"></left><br>
<left> <img src="http://www.strike9.com/eq/image.aspx?path=/Psimorph/fullsize/dagtv4.jpg" alt="Ouch"></left><br>
<br>

<br>
now fuck off and leave me alone for a week.<br>
