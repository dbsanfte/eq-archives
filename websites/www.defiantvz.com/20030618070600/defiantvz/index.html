<h3>HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE A WOMAN SCORNED....</h3><br>
<br>
What do you do when you get <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/many_sacrifice.JPG">bitch-uh-slapped</A>?<br>
<br>
Well I'm sure most of you maggots run for cover, but we rolled with the blow (wenches hit hard yo~) and <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/donkeypunch.JPG">donkey punched</A> that wench so hard she won't be coming back for like whatever her spawn cycle is.<br>
<br>
Grats to Parsalian (seriously, a mage?  Cmon now...) and Nukalavee on these Tizmak vest look a likes (JOKES ON YOU).<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/vest_phoenix.JPG"><br>
<br>
Anyway here are some 15 minutes of fame for the other people who sorta helped make this possible.  Apparently this is the first red server kill of Xegony as well as this servers first kill so, yeah.  Three cheers for us fat kids in mom's basement with our sacks of White Castle burgers.<br>
<br>
Congratulations guys.  The hare wins this race.<br>
<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/group.JPG"><br>
<br>
Fennin and Bertoxx down also but like who gives a day old ass log.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Here's a little <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/pron.JPG">pron</A> for you fellas who read all the way to the end of my updates.<br>
<br>
I probably should try roleplaying, I'm going to get in trouble for this I know it =[<br>

It's good to be the Defiant Minister of Information.  It just is, you get all the <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/jeb_reip.JPG">chicks</A>.  And sometimes <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/ybom_rub.JPG">more</A>.  I just thoughtyou all should know that.<br>
<br>
Anyway, so I wanted to do this yesterday, but Locale, who I need to send the pics to to host them,  wasn't available.  One can only guess what he was <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/locale_velk.JPG">doing</A>.<br>
<br>
Oh and one last thing before I start the news, I have to give credit to the people who take <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/wife_gone.JPG">time out of their lives</A> and make <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/danger_ss.JPG">sacrifices</A> to get me screenshots.<br>
<br>
SO!  We started off our week by taking advantage of the fact we now have a Xegony key.  We figured, like any guild that <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/heal_mt.JPG">invents their own strats</A>, we should go up there.  So we did.<br>
<br>
We went up to see what we could <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/see_xeg.JPG">see</A>, and learn what we could <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/learn_xeg.JPG">learn</A>.<br>
<br>
All I really need to show you about this encounter though is what Xegony and her play friends <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/many_sacrifice.JPG">dropped</A>.<br>
<br>
We didn't go away empty handed though we learned a lot and with our <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/caliel_bad.JPG">dedicated players</A> she will be dying soon.  Soon being whenever we feel like going back.<br>
<br>
The next day we decided to go have some rest and relaxtion.  We wen't to a quiet place we call "the picnic tables" and had an <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/orgy.JPG">orgy</A>.  Well lo and behold, right in the middle of our orgy, the guy from south park the movie <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/bust_up_orgy.JPG">jumps in</A> all uninvited and gives it to Psi so bad he died (see screenshot!).<br>
<br>
With our leader dead, and his loving <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/rocket_psi.JPG">words</A> fresh in our minds, we gave all our attention and <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/aord_owned.JPG">respect</A> to Sweetdream to conquer the plane of <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/blazz_dead.JPG">Mini Bosses from Hell</A> and the <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/fennin_dead.JPG">Gimp</A> who rules them.<br>
<br>
After killing mini bosses that can kill EP gods, we decided to do some Plane of Earth as well as some Seru.<br>
<br>
I will post the <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/loot_decision.JPG">loot decisions</A> in uno momento but first I want to post a PvP pic.<br>

Hi, I was planning on a different update but it's 8:23 AM and my old <A Href="http://auto.consumerguide.com/auto/used/reviews/photos/index.cfm/id/1995/img/93121211990505.htm">car</A> just got towed to the junkyard cause I was too cheap to buy a new master cylinder for it.  So sad.  I'm gonna miss my leet hulking piece of shit.  It was so crappy I could cut anyone off on the road because everyone knew their car was more expensive then mine and with the car I was driving I obviously had nothing to lose.  Oh well out with the old, in with the semi <A HREF="http://www.internetautoguide.com/reviews/1999/1999_Toyota_Camry.html">new</A><br>
<br>
Viva la Buick Century!<br>
<br>
So anyway.  Everquest.  I'm playing Everquest again.  I sold out for the second time for those of you keeping track.  I've gone and joined Defiant for the lewtz.  Yes the LEWTZ!  But we will get to that later.<br>
<br>
Defiant.  A guild on EQ.  A place for <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/nairek_adven.JPG">fun</A>.  The home of leet <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/leet_strat.jpg">PvE</A>, and even leeter <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/leet_pvp.jpg">PvP</A>.  A guild of pure <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/brob_advice.JPG">love</A> and <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/nibe_log.JPG">caring</A>.<br>
<br>
At first I wondered how people would receive <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/love_reipin.JPG">me</A>, but it turned out A-OK!  I figured us 4 teamers would have trouble <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/joe.jpg">blending in</A> but I realized we are all just <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/pharg_coke.JPG">everyday people</A>.<br>
<br>
So with my fears <A HREF="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=assuage&r=2">assuaged (click for definition for stupid people)</A> I bring you the lewtz that no one ever posts but I guess I will when I am feeling up to hitting the screenshot button.  I missed a whole lot of lewt screenshotting but here s some fo it, I promise to try and do a better job!<br>
<br>
Allye got this~<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/allye_mask.jpg"><br>
<br>
Saladinn has new underwear~<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/salad_leg.jpg"><br>
<br>
Vixie got a strap on~<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/vix_stab.jpg"><br>
<br>
Vexed got a new range slot~<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/vex_range.jpg"><br>
<br>
Jebeker got this~<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/dunno_shield.jpg"><br>
<br>
Dreckis got something to cover his manly hairy chest with<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/dreck_chest.jpg"><br>
<br>
This got destroyed but I didn't screenshot much loot so it's getting in the update!<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/dest_loot.jpg"><br>
<br>
Smallcast has a less abrasive pair of gauntlets (less chafing~)<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/small_gaunts.jpg"><br>
<br>
As Vixie told you, the guild received this as a whole (teh key to Zee go ney~)<br>
<img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/xeg_key.JPG"><br>
<br>
And FINALLY but NOT LEAST, when Locale finishes this <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/locale_quest.JPG">quest</A> we will be sure to immediately update for you!<br>
<br>
P.S.  I am not funny.  I have not done a webpae in like 5 years.  There are/will be mistakes and broken links.  I am no Ciliz.  Ciliz come back!  ANy kinda fool can seeeeeeeeee........
