<p><br>
'Nuff Said.  Good job guys.  Loots were three Flayed Barbarian Hide Masks (myself, Zegelmorph, and Rayvenn) and those neat monk pants which Baroose ninjalooted to teach us all a lesson about what terrible loot whores we are.  <br>
Then he sued us.<br>
<br>
We also took a trip to The Deep to play on the invisible bridge.<br>
<br>
We decided to PK the Burrower Parasite while we were there.<br>
<br>
He didn't appreciate it very much.<br>
<br>

<br>
Loots were two Shards of Unfathomable Depths which went to Gueska and Peoni.  Malherim received an Ancient Burrower Flesh Cap.

<br>
