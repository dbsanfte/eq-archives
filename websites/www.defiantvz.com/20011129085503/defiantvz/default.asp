A short update here.<br>
<br>
Went to St<br>
Killed some warders.<br>
HAd shitty drops for the most part.<br>
Gnomes masks and stuff primal 2hb which went to Kalue,Peoni and Hikek... go priestly melee.<br>

Killed Klandicar afterwards for a Sleepers key to Korthaf.<br>
<br>
Then killed Eashan for a Cloak of the sky for Erekouse. Onyx Chain clees for Senelron and twisted steel gloves for Fairshadow.<br>
<br>
Sunday we wanted to finish Klistants bard epic. But just as we got to the reets..real trak spawned..annoyed by this we killed him in about 10 seconds...I started to cast malo on him..and Malo landed on a corpse. Anyway we'll have to go back some other day to finish the epic. Trak Redeemed himself somewhat by dropping a mana robe which will come in handy and a Donals BP which may or may not come in handy. Well after that waste of time we went to the Temple of Veeshan and killed Sevalak Cekonar and Lady Mirabella.<br>
Drops were Blackstar for Cadane.<br>
2 Spears of Dawn for Atlhon and Neshma.<br>
Mithril Gauntlets to Yandor and Orb of the Crimson Bull for Xerxus.<br>
<br>
Afterwards we decided to take another crack at Zlexak and well would'nt you know it..<br>
we killed the annoying son of a bitch.<br>
<br>

<br>
Grats to Vroom on his Shield of Wurms.<br>
