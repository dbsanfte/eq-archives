In other news rangers are still complaining they are underpowered, rogues are still the backbone of everquest existance, and I got a new Horsie (her name is buttons!)<br>
<br>
Thats all for now!

Solusek Ro down on vallon, it was a tuff fight, 3 hours long, and involved strategies that defiant had never even heard of that were created as the battle went on. And, once it was over, and the attackers (Elite Legends and White dragons of norrath) had died, Solusek Ro choked on some squid and died, and !Team Defiant! zoned in to hail the flag mob. Nice work team =)<br>
