I was sitting at home the other day, lifting weights and being active and stuff, having mad sex with 7 women at once, when my Defiant Alarm went off.  <br>
<br>
I quickly threw the seven supermodels off my enormous rod ( let's just say it's bigger then yours ok? ) and rushed to my computer.<br>
<br>
I saw the Defiant logo scrolling across my screensaver and I knew it could mean only one thing, an urgent message board post was now up.  Something was afoot, and I had to see.<br>
<br>
As per usual I was correct.  I got it like that being a Defiant and all, unlike you pathetic clowns.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/slay.JPG"></CENTER><br>
<br>
I knew I had to log on and help out my guild, seeing as how we are harm touch impaired (I'd do a little trademark thing here but fuck that I'd rather type all this useless bullshit telling you I'd rather type this useless bullshit)<br>
<br>
First we killed 12 midgets, but they all came back as one to form the Avatar of Earth (I was watching transformers today, AERIALBOTS MERGE TO FORM...yeah screw you, you know you used to watch it).  Lo and behold here he is.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><img src="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/rathe_fight.JPG"></CENTER><br>
<br>
That didn't last long though, because my guild dropped him with our rightfully deserved super egos, we are carefree immortals afterall.  Long live teh Defaint.<br>

God damn it. God damn it multiple times.<br>
<br>
I hate Midnight Haven.  I hate <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/nairek_raid.JPG">anyone</a> that makes me re-raid and re-flag.<br>
<br>
Speaking of re-raiding and re-flagging, it has forced me to do another update.  So I know we are just a week removed from our last cool update of Coirnav dying for the first time, but hey, I work for the <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/reipsong.JPG">people</A>, and so I must update.<br>
<br>
Ok so usually I give away our <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/reetstrat1.JPG">no joke strategies</A> to the public in each of my updates.  You know, to help you all out (that no joke strategy isn't for any of these mobs though).  That's going to have to <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/ixnay.JPG">stop</A> though.  You know who to send hatemail to. God damn <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/psi_happy.JPG">hater</A>.<br>
<br>
Anyway we dropped Fennin for the billionth god damn time.  We got two earrings that I could care less about screenshotting and linking.  All I know is <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/lootwhore.JPG">Jebeker</A> got an earring and so did someone else, Ryziggy I think.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/fennin_happy.JPG"></CENTER><br>
<br>
Next we moved on to Xegony.  We killed her.  Keeping in tradition with our last Xegony kill I present you sickos with necrophiliatic (is that even a god damn word?) porn.  Just check those bazookas.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/xeg_tit.JPG"></CENTER><br>
<br>
Seeing Xegony like that got a troll quite excited<br>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/mistaveryhappy.JPG"></CENTER><br>
<br>
Locale got <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/xeg_mantle.JPG">this</A> and Alibuda got <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/vest_phoenix.JPG">that</A> and parsalian got Mage EP leggings.<br>
<br>
Next big fish we fried (GET IT COIRNAV?  FISH? FRIED? HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA) was Coirnav.  Standard stuff.  People peed in the water.  Stuff died.  Loot was gotten.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/coir_down2.jpg"></CENTER><br>
<br>
Sniiper got <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/coir_vest.JPG">this</A> and NinTALLten got <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/Coir_ear.JPG">that</A> and Guladan got EP ranger leggings, find your own damn links, bandwidth isnt free.<br>
<br>
So anyway after this week we now have a whole shitload of people that still aren't EP flagged nad yet somehow, are one flag away from bein gflagged for Plane of Time.  For the record if you apply after this update you get a no vote from me.  Seriously.<br>
<br>
Also kicked this has been in the face for old times sake.<br>
<br>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/RZ_down.JPG"</A></CENTER><br>
<br>
Seriously don't care about the loot.<br>

Usually I have a plan for these updates, but this time I don't.  I mean it's been a really long time since we updated.  Long enough ago that the previous update was before the new <A Href="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/new_ani.JPG">run animations</a> came out.  Long enough ago that <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/purist.JPG">purists and roleplayers</a> ran rampant.<br>
<br>
Thankfully though, they have all but been wiped off the server as of this update.  Well not really, but one can hope right?<br>
<br>
So anyway since Xegony got wham bam thank you ma'amed, other stuff has <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/guildmotd.JPG">died</A> but I'm just too damn lazy to care or update about it.<br>
<br>
Kill something once, yay, kill somehting twice, joy!  Kill something three times, that's the last time you should post that and that's pushing it.<br>
<br>
Enter Plane of Water, where a whole new batch of <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/prawned.JPG">jokes</A> and <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/pars_drown.JPG">fun</A> and <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/psi_mom.JPG">games</A> awaited us.  I don't have a screenshot of the best joke about peeing in the water.  Trust me though, it was so funny that I just couldn't bear to put it up here.<br>
<br>
So anyway we got down to Coirnav and came up with a totally leet strat <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/leet_strat2.JPG">Defiant style</A>, listened to our heroic guildleader give an <A HREF="http://defiant.turboflux.net/images/time.JPG">inspirational speech</A> and got down to business.<br>

<br>
Grats to talerwen on teh hammer, Benel on the Cord, and Mfwolf on Sylvans leggings of something or other, also known as Elemental Leather legging pattern.<br>
<br>
Anyway so one step closer to Plane of Time.  Just need to drop that dirtbag Rathe.<br>
