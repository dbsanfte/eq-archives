<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hail and well met fellow adventurers! I am Dracillion
of Qeynos the official historian of the Blind Guardians. What I am going to attempt to do
here is give you a brief history of the Blind Guardians so that you have a better idea of
where we come from and what we stand for.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's start with a little history of Norrath itself. As we all know the
omnipotent being know as the Nameless created our world. Some time later, the various gods
started to stake claim to Norrath and populated it with their creations. This of course
led to much strife and conflict. (Please see the history of Norrath for details) Well, the
Nameless saw all this and was not pleased. He thought long and hard about what could be
done to preserve the balance and peace of our world without his direct intervention.
(direct intervention by various gods is what has caused much of the trouble in the first
place) He finally came to the conclusion that certain individuals would be his Guardians.
They would work subtly, behind the scenes if you will, in order to preserve the peace and
harmony of Norrath. And so the Blind Guardians were born. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now you may ask yourself why we call ourselves Blind Guardians? Let me
get into a bit of a philosophical discussion. Many think that there is a fine line between
good and evil. They are more often then not wrong. Is a group of &quot;good Paladins&quot;
who wipe out an Ogre village, women and children included, really good? Is the
&quot;evil&quot; dark elf that sacrifices his life so that his comrades can survive really
evil? Does the end justify the means? The answer is no, it does not. Very often throughout
history many ideas and actions have started off with very good intentions and wound up
with very evil results. The reason that we are called blind is to symbolize that we do not
see things in terms of good and evil, since these lines can so easily be blurred, but
instead we see them in terms of preserving a balance. This is also why we do not
discriminate against any races or classes in our order. All have the ability and serve a
purpose in preserving the balance on Norrath.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for some actual history. The first Blind Guardian that we know of
was named Akara Swiftwolf. We know of Akara because she was the one who formed the
organization as it is today. Because of this we have much documentation on her. There had
been other Blind Guardians before her but she is the first that we know of.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akara lived during the time that the first Human clans had broken off
from their Barbarian ancestors. This was a time right before the rise of the powerful
Human Combine Empire. She realized her calling at a very young age and knew she was
different. She chose to follow the ways of a Ranger and became quite skilled. She gained a
reputation with her people as not only a skilled fighter but as a woman very wise beyond
her years.<br>
<br>
When Akara was 21 winters old her clan entered into a bitter trade dispute with another
clan. The dispute eventually escalated to the brink of war. Akara knew the bloodshed and
loss that war would bring and she was determined to do everything in her power to stop it.
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a last ditch effort to stop all out war the two clans agreed to send
emissaries to meet and try to come up with a resolution. Akara's clan was convinced this
was a trap and instead of sending an emissary they intended to send an armed contingent of
soldiers. Akara begged and pleaded with her elders to not do this and to have trust in the
other clan so that war could be prevented. Despite her reputation among her people Akara
was not listened to. So she set out to stop the soldiers as best she could.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now as I stated earlier Akara was a very skilled Ranger and she also
had many friends among the Ranger's and Druids of Tunaria. She recruited her friends to
stall the soldiers from her clan so that she could warn the opposing clan's emissary of
their approach. She hoped that this act of good faith would avert war and lead to
negotiation. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Akara approached the opposing clan's camp she saw that they too had
sent warriors instead of a negotiator! It appears that they distrusted Akara's clan just
as her clan distrusted them. This was a very serious situation indeed. If she did not act
swiftly all out war was about to break out. She decided that she must stay on her original
course of action and meet with the opposing clan's leaders and warn them of the
approaching soldiers. If she could do this she felt that she still might avert bloodshed.
As Akara went to sneak into the enemy's camp she was confronted by one of their soldiers.
This man was an officer by his dress and seemed to be a very skilled warrior. Determined
on her course of action Akara engaged the soldier and slew him. In his dying breaths, and
too her horror, he revealed to her that he too followed the Guardians of the Nameless and
that he was on his way to meet with her clan and avert the war just as she was. Despite
all her efforts this soldier died in her arms. She did not even learn his name. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Akara eventually managed to get into the enemies' camp and convince
them of her good intentions. She then made her way back to her clan's soldiers and
persuaded them to stop as well. Emissaries were eventually sent and war was averted.<br>
<br>
This did little to ease Akara's mind. She was horrified and shocked by what had happened.
She was not even aware that there were others who followed her calling. How could she have
killed someone trying to preserve the balance just as she? How could she have not known
about him? And what could she do to prevent this from happening in the future. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To find inspiration Akara journeyed into the wilds of Tunaria to seek
solitude and guidance from the deity who had giver her the calling. (It was still called
Tunaria at the time, today we know it as Antonica.) One night in a dream, a vision, she
realized what she had to do. She was to seek out individuals like herself that had been
called to preserve the balance and form an organization. Through this organization all
Guardians could work together for similar aims and support each other in times of need.
With strength in numbers it would be much easier to preserve the balance than to all be
working independently. This is how the Blind Guardians were formed.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rest as they say is history. Akara went on to recruit many
individuals of all races and classes into our guild and since this time we have worked to
preserve the balance and peace of all Antonica. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well friends I hope this gives you some idea of where we come from. The
Blind Guardians are always there to help others and work for the good of all peoples. We
will continue to strive to be everything our founders envisioned us to be. I bid you all
farewell and wish you safe and good hunting!<br>
