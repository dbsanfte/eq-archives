<p align="center"><strong><big>BLIND HYPOSTASIS</big></strong></p>

<p><font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">1. The Basics </font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>1 ) Blind Guardians ( BG ) is a neutral good guild. That means guild members tend to
help other people when the situation arises.</p>

<p>2 ) Inside the guild however, all members have to help and support each other.
Declining a guild member's help request without acceptable reasons is inadmissible. This
issue is detailed in Rules of Help Request section.</p>

<p>3 ) All race and class combinations at all levels are welcomed to the guild in case
they accord the guild's laws. Recruiting issue is detailed in Rules of Enrollment section.
</p>

<p>4 ) BG is governed by the guild Leader, AKA Blind Lord. However guild Leader is
counseled by Blind Conclave. For detailed information on management, please refer to
Executive System section. </p>

<p>5 ) BG has an objective of being a powerful organization. The Objective section gives
information about the motives behind guild's formation. </p>

<p>6 ) Currently there are six affiliation circles. All the information about these
circles can be found at Affiliation Circles section. </p>

<p>7 ) Though an undesired procedure, any guild member might be removed from the guild. To
learn what causes removal, please consult to Rules of Removal section. </p>

<p>8 ) The amount of guild officers is determined by guild Leader. For promotion and
demotion matters, please refer to Rules of Promotion &amp; Demotion section. </p>

<p>9 ) To encourage cooperation within guild, a member-support system is established.
Reliquary System section contains information about the system. </p>

<p>10 ) Guild raids will be planned to increase cooperation within guild. Details can be
found at Guild Raids section. </p>

<p>11 ) Without having valid reasons, staying anonymous is forbidden. /Roleplay command
must be preferred instead of/Anonymous when privacy is needed. </p>

<p>12 ) All guild members must care for BG. Our motto is &quot; Ask not what BG has done
for you, ask what you have done for BG &quot; A better guild offers better chances to her
members.</p>

<p>13 ) Blind Hypostasis can evolve with the times. </p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">2. The Objective</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>All organizations have to own an objective to continue its existence. An organization
without a valid target is subjected to gradual weakening and dissolving into nothingness
at the end. The ultimate aim of BG is to be a powerful guild throughout Norrath. Being a
powerful guild's member offers the individual some certain advantages such as,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to feel more comfortable when facing a
problem</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to learn more about Norrath in relatively
shorter time</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to level more quickly</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to get help while questing</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to plan raids to some high and ultrahigh
level dungeons in group form, which is impossible to solo</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to enjoy many kind of gatherings held by
guild</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to prevent boredom caused by routine
hack'n slash style of gameplay by providing rich role-play resources, etc. </p>

<p>However, being a very powerful guild at once is practically impossible. Thus, some
certain stages are devised to reach the ultimate objective. These stages are called as
sub-targets. The first sub-target is to have 20 guild members. Second sub-target will be
started when first sub-target is accomplished. Sub-targets are decided in Blind-Assemblies
and approved by guild Leader.</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">3. Executive System</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>BG is governed by guild Leader, AKA Blind Lord. Guild Leader is counseled by Blind
Conclave, which is formed by four chairs: The VP, Lord of Treasury, Lord of Diplomacy and
Lord of Recreation. Below are the definitions; </p>

<p>Guild Leader, AKA Blind Lord is responsible for the health of guild. Leader decides
promotions and demotions, assigns The VP, approves other Conclave chairs, sub-targets,
removals and guild raids, assigns members to help-request cases and directs guild
reliquary. Leader shapes diplomacy with other guilds, leads Blind-Assemblies and other
guild meetings. Leader obeys Blind Hypostasis and is counseled by Blind Conclave. </p>

<p>The Veep represents guild Leader while Leader is not on. He is the second man
responsible for the guild. Leader may delegate some of his authority to The Veep before
possible intervals. </p>

<p>Lord of Treasury is assigned to decide about the items collected in reliquary. He
receives magic item requests from reliquary and keeps all the records related to
reliquary. He is responsible of counseling the Leader about all the economical aspects of
BG. </p>

<p>Lord of Diplomacy is assigned to counsel Leader about affairs with other guilds. He
analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of other guilds, devises plans to increase BG's
popularity, counsel the Leader about war and peace decisions etc. He may be assigned as
herald in some certain cases. </p>

<p>Lord of Recreation manages guild meetings and guild raids. Weddings, parties, guild
raids, all kind of guild celebrations, etc., are planned by Lord of Recreation. His main
duty is to keep the spirits of BG high. </p>

<p>New chairs can be added to Blind Conclave if needed. This decision can be taken at
Blind-Assembly. The election process is discussed at Promotions and Demotions section. </p>

<p>All Blind Conclave members are also officers. </p>

<p>Guild Leader and Blind Conclave gathers at regular intervals. Current and following
sub-targets, removals, guild's economical situation, new projects, politics and many other
important subjects are considered in these gatherings. These gatherings are called as
Blind-Assembly. </p>

<p>Guild Leader can request Elites to attend Blind-Assembly.</p>

<p>Officers sometimes may be called attend Blind-Assemblies as well.</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">4. Affiliation Circles</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Currently there are six affiliation circles in BG. These are as follows; </p>

<p>Initiate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Levels 01
- 10</p>

<p>Disciple&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Levels 11 - 20</p>

<p>Associate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Levels 21 - 30</p>

<p>Acolyte&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Levels 31 - 40</p>

<p>Dedicated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Levels 41 - 50</p>

<p>Elite
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
: Levels 51 - 60</p>

<p>Affiliation circles affect some of the guild mechanics including promotions, reliquary
system, executive system etc. </p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">5. Rules of Enrollment</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Currently there is no level limitation to join the guild and, Leader and the officers
can invite anyone to BG they desire but the candidates must be matching to guild's
structure. A candidate must be a kind, helpful, smart, active, energetic, keen character.
A new member should learn about BG before or after enrollment and decide if he still
wishes to be a member. If he does not, he can remove himself from the guild as stated in
Rules of Removal section. </p>

<p>A new member can learn about the guild by reading Blind Hypostasis, asking questions to
members, living within guild, joining guild raids etc. </p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">6. Rules of Removal</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Removal process can be considered in two ways; member can remove himself from the guild
voluntarily or he can be removed by Blind-Assembly decision. A member can always remove
himself from the guild, he might not find all the aspects of the guild matching to his
character, so he is free to act as he desires. But in this case, he has to ; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * write a message to guild Leader and tell
why he decides leaving BG.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * give the items and money given to him from
reliquary and guild fund and recorded by Lord of Treasury back to BG. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * not backbite BG after removal. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * know that his chance of rejoining to BG is
minimal</p>

<p>If he goes with these conditions, he can still have a good reputation with BG.
Violating any of the above conditions results in having a horrible reputation with BG and
probably some other certain measures are taken by Leader and Consistory. </p>

<p>Any member can be removed from BG under certain conditions. These kind of removals are
decided at Blind-Assemblies and approved by Leader or whom Leader delegates his authority.
Below are some of the conditions which lead to involuntary removal ; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * violating Blind Hypostasis</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * having been reported to killsteal. When a
member is reported as KS, Blind-Assembly listens to his side of story and decides upcoming
procedures</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * treating people badly</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * cheating people</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * any other action which is not approved by
Leader and Blind Conclave</p>

<p>After member's removal is approved, he is removed from BG by Leader or whom he
delegates his authority. </p>

<p>A removed character returns all the money and items given to him by BG back to BG. If
he does not, he has a horrible reputation with BG and probably some other certain measures
are taken by Leader and Consistory.</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">7. Rules of Help Request</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Help requests are not limited with certain rules, at least for the time being.
Following statements may guide members; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Requesting money from another guild member
does not have to be answered positively. Providing the money, however, is considered to
improve cooperation within guild.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Help requests to a guild member who is at a
far zone might not be always carried.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Help requests which are impossible are not
even to be named. </p>

<p>Golden word about the help requests issue is &quot;goodwill” All guild members must
be sensitive about help requests.</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">8. Rules of Promotion &amp; Demotion</font></strong><font
SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Promotion and demotion can be considered in two sections ; officers and Blind Conclave
chairs.</p>

<p>Total number of officers is determined by guild Leader. New officers will possibly be
needed when the population of guild increases or in case of officer demotions and
removals. According with these situations, guild Leader assigns new officers.</p>

<p>If an officer wishes to resign his office, he can be demoted provided submitting a
valid reason. An officer can be demoted if he is not active enough to be an officer. Guild
Leader warns the officer and if he is still inactive, he is demoted by guild Leader. </p>

<p>All officer promotions and demotions are decided by guild Leader. </p>

<p>Blind Conclave is currently formed by four members. These are decided when the guild is
founded. If a chair is opened by any reason, or a new chair is added, new election process
begins. </p>

<p>If The Veep chair is open, guild Leader himself decides the new Veep.</p>

<p>If any other chair is open, or a new chair is added, all Blind-Assembly members
nominate a candidate each and a ballot is held within Blind-Assembly. The winner is
assigned to open chair. </p>

<p>A Consistory member may be deposed if Blind-Assembly decides. In this kind of
decisions, the Lord who is considered to be deposed cannot vote.</p>

<p></font><strong><font size="3">9. Reliquary System</font></strong><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Reliquary system is founded to encourage cooperation within guild. Reliquary is a pool
where magic items are collected for some certain reasons. Lord of Treasury holds reliquary
and he is responsible for keeping records of what item is added to reliquary and which
member is given what item etc. </p>

<p>Magic items are added to reliquary via different ways;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Every level + 40 member (41 - 60 ) has to
add a magic item to reliquary once a month. This item cannot be a simple one such as +2
STR or +2 DEX rings, etc.,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Magic items acquired through guild raids
can be added to reliquary</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Members can donate magic items to
reliquary</p>

<p>Magic items gathered in reliquary are utilized in many ways. They can be,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * given as gift in weddings, celebrations,
etc.,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * given as reward to members who are who are
asked to accomplish a task</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * given as reward to winners of guild events</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * given as charity to members, etc.</p>

<p>To get an item from reliquary as either gift and reward or charity, the member has to
gain at least 5 levels after joining the guild. Guild Leader gives all the decisions
concerning reliquary. Initiates cannot get items from reliquary. In some rare occasions
though, Blind-Assembly may decide positively to give items to Initiates. </p>

<p></font><font size="3"><strong>10. Guild Raids</strong></font><font SIZE="2"></p>

<p>Guild raids are planned ; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to add items to reliquary</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to help younger members have magic items</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to explore zones or dungeons </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to get items from high level dungeons or
zones, which is impossible to solo</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to help members get quest items or finish
their quests</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * to increase cooperation within guild</p>

<p>Lord of Recreation plans and offers to arrange a guild raid and this plan is approved
by guild Leader. So, guild raid requests must be done to Lord of Recreation. </p>

<p>All the members invited to guild raids have to join unless having valid reasons which
prevents him doing so.</p>

<p>All affiliation circles can join guild raids, but Initiates cannot request guild raids.
They can join the raids already planned. </p>

<p>Guild Leader can specify limitations including affiliation circles, number of raid
party, etc.</p>

<p>All guild raids have a raid-leader. Guild Leader may lead a raid as raid-leader himself
or he assigns a raid-leader to the group.</p>

<p>Other than full-scaled guild raids, members can organize this kind of raids by
themselves. A group of guild members can plan a raid for any reason. No permission has to
be taken for such an event.</font></p>
