<p align="left"><big><big><big><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;&nbsp; » </font></big></big><font
color="#000000">As you might already know after a period of quick improvement, our guild
faced some recession. Some of our high level members left the guild with various reasons
and this crippled our hopes of forming balanced high level groups, thus planning more
serious action. Due to those seperations plus some uneasiness within guild, guild officers
and some other high level members would leave the guild in some close past too. But after
that much time within BG, all those friendships, memories both good and bad and
still-burning determination to struggle for better days kept us from leaving. But we also
decided to take some certain actions like strictly applying Blind Hypostasis, improving
some of the rules and adding some guides to prevent corruption within guild and make us a
better guild. Either this had to be done else BG would never make the guild we once set
out for. So, the guide will begin with telling what our guild aim is and go on with some
new rules plus revised rules. All members say they are fond of BG and like to be a part of
it. So please show this with actions too; actions prove while words suspend in the air.
And this is the time to make actions. There are many ways to show actions and going along
with the rules and auxiliary guides is a good way of acting, a very good one indeed. </font></big></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guild Aim</big></big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp; Our general aim is to be a good
guild. This includes many aspects and might vary according to each player's thoughts. So
here we make it clear what our understanding from a good guild definition is. We want to
be one of the best guilds of server , doing serious action like planar raids, other high
level zone raids and epics&nbsp; etc. So we set out for our best. While doing those we
always aim to have fun too but we shall never forget that discipline and seriousness will
always accompany our aim as well.</big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#ff0000"><big><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Issues</big></big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To achieve our aims, we need
to be more organized, disciplinized and our members should apply al the rules. This means
we will be more strict with rules and any member contradicts with the rules will be
removed immediately. Please read <a href="file://D:\Dev--5\EverQuest\Blind/chart.htm"><u><strong>Blind
Hypostasis</strong></u></a>, which you can find at that site. It contains the general
guidelines of our guild. </big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to know the email
addresses of all the guild members. Please send me an email unless you have not done so up
to now and I will keep a DB. You can create a new account at one of the widely-used free
email account provider sites if you want to keep your own email address privite. You can
find my email address at <a href="file://D:\Dev--5\EverQuest\Blind/contact.htm"><u><strong>contact
page.</strong></u></a></big></font></p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#000000"><big>All members should have a means of
knowing EST time at any time given. We will be doing all our plans with EST time. You can
know EST time with many ways and buying a simple and cheap clock and setting it to EST
time can be the easiest way. </big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our current level limit for
recruitement is now level 35. First lets explain why we need to set a level limit and then
why it is 35 now. Having a wide level range creates some serious problems between level
blocks. Being unable to join guild raids with higher level members, lacking the items
higher levels members have and being unable to group and hunt with high level members
disturb lower level members. And requests that are almost impossible to fulfil from lower
level members frustrates higher level members. Everyone begins his/her career at level one
and passes through all steps untill reaching his/her current level.So we all know what
each level means to person. We neither scowl at lower level players nor despise them. But
to keep balance within guild we have to determine a level limit for recruitements. Level
35 seems fine , although a lvl 35 member will unlikely join raids, untill he/she reaches
the level needed , he/she can learn more about BG and improve his/her friendship with
guildmates.</big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This level limit will also
affect the existing guild members. All guild members who are below level 35 are expected
to reach lvl 35 as soon as they can manage it. At least they have to show the endevour. </big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruitements will be more
strict from now on. The candidates will be asked a group of questions and there will be a
period of knowing the candidate. The candidate will be recruited only after he/she groups
with guildmates , preferably guild officers. We may devise an application form for our new
recruitements. </big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All guildmates should group
with each other. This improves friendship within guild and gives a great chance to see
what other players's strong and weak points are. High level raids require precise
coordination between raid members and this can be achieved by grouping with guildmates.</big></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000"><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reliquary system will be put
into use in a different style. In almost every raid, at least one of the items that are
looted will be put into reliquary and this will certainly be a serious item. Donations
from members , both money and item, are welcomed and this shows member's attitude towards
BG. Speaking of items and loots, all members are expected to be humble when it comes to
looting and sharing. All members should remember that this game is more fun only when you
share. So, when raid leader informs the party that&nbsp; &quot;this item&quot;&nbsp; will
be put into Reliquary, there must not be any objections. We even hope to reach a point
when and where raid leader will announce who will get the item just looted without any
rolls at all. This will certainy improve the relations within the guild and lead members
to trust each other more and more. Items gathered in Reliquary can be given to the members
, or they can be used in other ways. They can be used to gain &quot;very important
things&quot; for the guild. A very important spell that will apparently be very helpful to
guild , a critical item that will improve the damage output of a tank, exepnditures for
raids, giftd for marrying members etc. can all be provided with that fund. Lets say
someone sells a very good haste item at market. We can try buying it with our funds for a
worthy guild member tank. Level limit to have acces to Reliquary is currently level 40.
This limit is put to encourage members to reach high levels and it is obvious that 40 +
members will be adding to Reliquary more. All requests to use Reliquary will be made to
Dracillion , Lord of Treasury. Requests will be discussed and decided by officers. All the
information about Reliquary will always be available at our website with precise data.</big></font></p>
