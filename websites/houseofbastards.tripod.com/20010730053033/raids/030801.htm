<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
by Wildride<br>
<br>
Great night all! I think we had one death in each group but overall I think everyone 
received net positive experience for the night. <br>
<br>
Group 1 was unable to locate the King but laid waste to his court all night. We also met 
some very nice people, including a Lvl 25 Iksar Monk named SSaul. He was a solid addition 
to our team and if you ever see him looking for a group I would recommend inviting.<br>
<br>
We also explored some uncharted areas in Sol A, found a strange force field that kept us 
from advancing down one hallway and finally let Faan take a lava bath (phew and did he 
need one!)<br>
<br>
Loot was not spectacular for Group 1 (about 30pp per person) <em>[ed. note: though no special
items, the loot was spectacular -- best total per/char ever!]</em> but we had fun, adventured 
like it was meant to be done, meet nice people along the way and charted new territory 
for HoB.<br>

<b>RECOUNT</B><br>

<br>
Nothing stinks like sulfur, except maybe sulfur mixed with the fetid stench of an age old 
goblin lair. That is a smell so foul it is nearly unbearable to even the staunchest of 
men. Yet back into that very stench HoB crawled again. One last time into the hot reeking 
hole of Solusek eye One last time to rip the putrid heart from the goblins of Norrath.<br>
<br>
At the entrance they assembled as two groups. As a unit they plunged into the rank depths 
like a hot dagger leaving a wake of dead like Hansle and Grettle's bread crumbs. HoB struck 
so fast and hard they did not even bother to loot the dead.<br>
<br>
In ten minutes they were crouched in a small room they had dubbed the gatehouse. As the 
teams organized Wildride began dragging goblins from the depths. This proved to be a bit 
of a mistake. A band of goblins stormed the small room and became attracted to Guadzilla 
horrid smell. In typical weird goblin fashion they showed appreciation for his rank smell 
by slashing and clawing him to death.<br>
<br>
After collecting themselves, recovering Zilla's corpse and adding some new members they 
split into two teams. Team one charged off in the direction of the king. Team two headed 
to the bar.<br>
<br>
In a slight fit of madness team two alternated pullers between Gorron and Ziff. For 
almost two hours team two ruled their half of the dungeon. They wandered to new territory 
with little worry leaving corpses and stone slick with the blood of their foes.<br>
<br>
As they carved their way to new territory, Ziff found a place on the map that was oddly 
blank. There was a door on the faded map he carried but beyond that door was only a skull 
and crossbones. Lacking any fear, (and some would say brains) the team sought out the 
door and charged through. On the other side they met two Solusek goblins, some of the 
most powerful goblins in Solusek eye. Like their brethren they were dispatched quickly. 
Team two took a short rest and charged through the next door. There they met three 
Solusek goblins. This was a nasty battle but again team two proved victorious. Now 
standing in a huge entryway containing two massive wooden doors HoB prepared for its next 
battle. After a brief rest they threw open the doors to see a giant staircase leading down 
to a massive chamber. Through the smoke and haze could be seen this outline of two Solusek 
goblins. Ziff gave a shout and cast a spell to make one more vulnerable to Ziff's magic's. 
As the two angry goblins charged up the staircase the side door burst open and three more 
goblins charged the room. To make matters worse, all of these were Solusek goblins. One 
was even a wizard and another was a shaman. Team two was in trouble.<br>
<br>
A panicked organization took place. Ziff worked desperately to control the beasts. Slowly 
the tide was turning in their favor but not before Lan was cut down. As the haze cleared 
team two stood gasping for breath badly wounded and fully depleted of mana.<br>
<br>
They chopped their way back to the barroom, dragging Lan's bloody corpse behind. The plan 
was to make a stand in the barroom until Lan could return. The goblins had other plans.<br>
<br>
In minutes team two was up to their necks in the weaker monsters. They fought desperately 
but the goblins were numerous. When the battle was done team two stood battered, bloody,
and spent, but victorious. Sadly, during the combat they had once again taken a liking to 
Guadzilla's stench and rewarded him with a gruesome death.<br>
<br>
Team two collected the corpses of their possessions and headed home. To celebrate a 
solemn and sobering victory.</font></p>
