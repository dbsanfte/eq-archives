<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
by Ziff<br>
<br>
Some nights go better than others. Last night HoB met some new milestones and learned 
some valuable lessons. But, as far as experience and loot go, the raid was less than 
successful.<br>
<br>
<em>Bad News:</em><br>
Numerous deaths. So many in fact that I am unsure of who all died and so I wont try to 
list them. But we mourn every loss.<br>
<br>
Loot was poor. No magical treasure and the plat is still being totaled but not expected 
to break 150.<br>
<br>
Poor organization and cooperation led to confusion, increased risk and less fun for 
everyone.<br>
<br>
Most of the night was spent either fighting greens, running, zoning, or preparing for the 
next fight. Aside from greens we killed less than 20 mobs all night.<br>
<br>
The elusive Nightfall Giant never showed.<br>
<br>
<em>Good News:</em><br>
This was the biggest turn out in HoB history. 16 members showed. Due to message board 
problems and the openness of the fighting grounds it was decided not to enforce the 12 
player limit.<br>
<br>
Hob took out its first Hill Giant. Through the night 5 of them fell to our might and 
although there were several tense moments no HoB member fell to a giant all night.<br>
<br>
Massive revenge was had on Kizdin Gix. The paladins killed him at least 3 times through 
the night resting revenge for the numerous deaths we all suffered at his hands in our <br>
youth.<br>
<br>
Numerous spider silks and pelts were obtained to help Lan with his tailoring. This 
included a high quality bear skin which has been made into a 10 slot backpack. This and 
the archeologists pack Ziff recently bought will be given to primary looters on raid 
night to make looting a little easier.<br>
<br>
<em>What We Learned:</em><br>
We need to stick to groups of 12 at the most. More than that creates too much confusion. 
Maybe later as we get better with 2 full groups we will be able to expand, but for now we 
need to focus on teamwork with 2 groups.<br>
<br>
Kithicor is a bit too ugly for HoB. Lately HoB has been pushing boundaries, going places 
that others dare not tread. Although this is a common routine for us, we have been 
pushing a little to hard as of late. As a result, experience, treasure and fun go down. 
So, for a while we will be sticking to some lower level, "safer" places. (Although still 
semi insane by many peoples standards) Please note though. There are very few places to 
hunt in our current level range that are not overcrowded. When HoB gains a few levels 
there are tons of places to go, but for a little while our choices are limited.<br>
<br>
So, some day we will be back to Kithicor. HoB will send the undead back to their rotting 
graves. For now we travel on, battered, beaten and a little wiser.<br>
