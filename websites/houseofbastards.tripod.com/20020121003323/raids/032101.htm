<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
by Ziff<br>
<br>
There is something very intimidating about fighting a foe who is twice your height and 
wielding a brutally huge sword. HoB had landed on the new continent only to discover that 
the surrounding country side was plagued with giants. The outpost they had established in 
Warsilk woods was ancient and well fortified. This was an established foothold the 
citizens would simply have to learn to live with. But in the heart of the frontier 
mountains they were busy constructing a new outpost. This must be destroyed.<br>
<br>
So weary from the long boat ride hob set out to smash a hole in the giants plans. They 
couldn't tear down the fort but they could harry the giants and reduce their numbers. The 
plan was to attack the fort and make stab into the giant mines. Hopefully they could 
destroy a significant number of their leaders to make an assault by Feronia vie feasible.<br>
<br>
Hob stormed the fort and quickly established a foothold inside the fort. Then they began 
clearing the entrance to the mines. This was all done with hobs usual proficiency and 
daring. Giants fell like redwoods before a mighty axe. Early in the fight hob even took 
on a brae and three tumps with little trouble. True new tactics were necessary as the 
massive brutes were immune to stuns and Ziff's mind games. Still they adjusted admirably.<br>
<br>
And so they pushed deeper into the mines into uncharted territory. They soon discovered 
why this section remained unmapped. Here in the depths of the giant mines were the elite 
giants. Not one hillock or tump roamed these corridors. Only braes and the incredibly 
powerful Craigs. In fact it was mostly Craigs.<br>
<br>
The first time HoB met two Craigs a small disaster occurred that lead to the death of 
Galadriel. This began a slow and deadly rock slide. Next to fall was Dicerman as another 
Brae joined the fight. After the combat as the newly resurrected party members were 
resting and colleting their things a Craig stormed around the corner catching the group 
by surprise and killing Ziff. And the rocks kept tumbling.<br>
<br>
With his new found gifts from his god Faan resurrected Ziff as well. HoB was regrouping 
and resting when they were assaulted by two more Craigs. With many still weak from the 
resurrections and the previous battles this battle proved to be too much. The rock slide 
was in full force now. In minutes the battle turned ugly. Dicerman Shum and others fell 
quickly to the monstrous blows. With less than half of the party still standing Wildride 
called for the group to flee. Exiting the mines brought five more giants into the combat 
and lead to the death of at least two more members. In the aftermath HoB regrouped inside 
the fort. Bravely Kodman began extracting the corpses from the depths of the mines caring 
nothing for his own life. As proof of this fact near the end of his retrievals he emerged 
from the mines with Dicerman's corpse trailing six giants. HoB foolishly tried to assist him 
which led to yet more deaths. The rock slide just kept coming.<br>
<br>
After quite some time HoB was gathered again in the fort. Rested and prepared to make one 
last assault on the mines.<br>
<br>
This time HoB had little trouble. Within thirty minutes HoB had cleared the mines and 
battled their ay to the bottom. Their they found two giants of immense age and 
experience. Amazingly they were not bent on the destruction of HoB. So, with the hour 
getting late, HoB retreated from the mines having dealt a vicious blow to the giants and 
having gained valuable information that could be turned into the outpost officials, their 
mission was complete.
