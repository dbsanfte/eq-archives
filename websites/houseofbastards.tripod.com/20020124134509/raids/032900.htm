OK, this raid was a "disaster" to put it mildly.  With only 4 members showing.  
(The drunken druid was apparently too wasted to make it again) we got handed out 
asses repeatedly by the bandits.  We tried a number of things but were continually 
thrashed by the evil brethren.  We effectively cleared a local outpost, but the 
camp itself was too much for the four of us to handle.<br>
<br>
Next week, if there are enough people we will again attempt the camps.  If not, we 
will continue east into North Karanas and start fighting bugs and such.  After all, 
the goal is to get to Freeport and to do that, we must keep moving East.<br>
<br>
Of note.  Later Wednesday night a high level Cleric by the name of Zoft was spotted 
near the camps demolishing bandits.  I suspect we will see him again soon as he 
appears to have some more gifts for Ziff.  Seems he found a crude stein that gives 
+15 charisma.  Similar effect to the "full stein" in real life.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I petitioned a GM this weekend about creating a guild.  I was asking if the 
guild name "House of Bastards" would be acceptable.  I was told it might be but he 
wasn't sure.  He understood the nuances but said it may be denied simply because 
someone might find it offensive.  We will need 10 characters from different 
accounts before we can actually form a guild (currently we have 7 at best) so I am 
not sure this is something we can do right away.  But, if we would like to form a 
guild, I would be open to any other guild name suggestions.
