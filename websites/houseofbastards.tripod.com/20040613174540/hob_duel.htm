			Only a few weeks ago Nikar and Wildride sparred each other in Greater Faydark 
			just to hone their fighting skills and pass the time.  It was then that Wildride 
			received his first experience in fighting a Magician of the skill and cunning of 
			a true HoB member.  With two full levels separating them (Wildride the senior) 
			Nikar proceeded to display his mastery of the earthen elements.  Just before 
			Wildride took his last breath, Nikar showed mercy on his foe and allowed him to 
			escape.  Although this was not an official duel for the HoB crown and both 
			combatants held their most leathal skills at bay, it was nevertheless a wakeup 
			call for the current champion that there were members of the HoB clan that were 
			growing strong and that the crown would not be held long without a serious challenge.<br>
 			<br>
			Last night Nikar formally challenged Wildride for the crown.  Having worked 
			long and hard over the past few weeks, Nikar closed the gap forbetween the two to 
			only one level and with a new complement of pets to command, he felt he was ready  
			the task.  Immediatly after the HoB raid on the Estate of Unrest, Nikar, Wildride 
			and Ziff (ever the referee and guild photographer) proceeded to the high ridge 
			overlooking the lake in Dagnor's Cauldron and prepared for battle.  Nikar summoned 
			the elements to form some earthen abomination.  He then equiped the pet with two 
			Gnoll Hide Larriats and proceeded to layer magic shields on them both.  Wildride 
			doned what little magic shields he had and they were ready.  Both faced each other 
			and wished each other good luck, for they both felt confident that their opponent 
			would need it for them to emerge victorious.  Ziff counted down and the battle was 
			on.<br>
 			<br>
			Immediatly Wildride rooted Nikar's pet and went after the little Gnome with 						
			steel swinging.  Wildride was able to land a few significant blows before 
			the earthen abomination broke loose from Wildride's magic and began to root 
			Wildride instead.  With some distance between them Nikar then prepared his 
			magic.  Wave after wave of fire and magic hit Wildride while he was helpless 
			to defend himself, rooted securly to the scarred stone that was the ledge of 
			Dagnor's Cauldron.  Then as Wildride was down to his last bits of health and 
			he saw Nikar's hands again glowing with the force of magic that had so devastated 
			him so far, Wildride called upon his god, Rochet Nife, to deliver a healing 
			hand to his faithful follower.  Rochet Nife did not fail him and restored Wildride 
			to fighting condition.  Still rooted, as he would be for the majority of the 
			battle, Wildride was being whipped by Nikar's the duel wielding earthen pet but 
			also began to fire arrows at Nikar from a distance.  Although not causing as much 
			damage as would his sword, the constant barrage of arrows kept Nikar from 
			concentrating on his next spell casting.  With Nikar's pet slowly killing Wildride 
			and Wildride switching between swings at the pet and arrows at Nikar, both saw the 
			battle at a turning pont.  Wildride was close to killing the pet and Nikar realized 
			that without the pet, he would surely die.  So Nikar dove into the melee to assist 
			his pet and hoped to slay his foe before the pet met its end.  Wildride then had 
			to decide whether he should hit Nikar or finish off the pet and break free of its 
			incessant rooting.  Choosing to turn his attention to the little Gnome stabbing his 
			backside, Nikar took some tremendous damage from Wildride's blade.  When Nikar backed 
			off, Wildride turned back to the pet.  With the pet, Nikar and Wildride down to their 
			last few breaths, the break that Wildride was looking for came.  Wildride's rooted 
			feet came free and Nikar, slowed from his failing health, was unable to doge the 
			last few deadly blows from Wildrie's Ghoulbane and Mistmoore Shield.  Nikar fell to 
			the ground and the earthen pet turned back to dust.<br>
 			<br>
			As close a duel as we have had to date and one that demonstrated that the HoB 
			members truly are masters of their professions.<br>

		<i>Wildrides account:</i><br>
		<br>
		The trash talking before this latest duel for the crown of the HoB was fierce.  
		Ziff claiming certain victory and the imminent surprises that Wildride would 
		experience.  Wildride describing the method of decapitation that would be employed 
		to help Ziff with his day-after-Halloween costume (the headless horseman).<br>
		<br>
		Wildride and Ziff met in an empty clearing not far from the goblin mines that had 		
		just recently been claimed the rightful property of the HoB.  Each buffed themselves 
		and wished good luck to the other before the battle began.  Wildride scored the first 
		blow with an arrow to the midsection of Ziff but his magical armor deflected its 
		damage.  Then Ziff cast a nasty long spell on Wild that rendered him incapable of 
		action.  While Wild stood enthralled, Ziff prepared his surprise.  He wandered deep 
		into the Goblin infested mines and charmed a Goblin warlord to fight at his side.  
		When Wildride regained his faculties, he was faced not with the expected feeble enchanter 
		pet, but a full fledged Goblin Warlord salivating to rip Wildride apart.  What 
		trickery is this?  Had Ziff made a secret pact with the goblins of the Lake of Ill 
		Omen against the HoB?,  thought Wildride.  The Goblin attacked Wildride and inflicted 
		considerable damage before Wild was able to use his new root spell.  Once the goblins 
		feet were firmly rooted to the ground, Wild approached Ziff and began to give him a 
		beating suitable of a enemy of the HoB.  When the goblin broke the root spell Wild 
		again turned his attention to the goblin, rooted him and then back to Ziff.  But this 
		time Ziff stayed close to his new vile protector so that any attack on Ziff would be 
		followed closely by a counter attack by the goblin.  Then Wild had an idea.  He waited 
		until Ziff was a fair distance from the goblin pet and then rooted Ziff as well making 
		him more easily attacked.  About that time Wild discovered that Ziff had not turned 
		his back on the HoB but had only charmed the one goblin.  The goblin protector shook 
		off the charm spell and turned viciously on Ziff.  Now Wildride had an ally in the 
		duel and watched as the once pet turned to foe and brought goblin friends to help.  
		The Warlords made quick work of Ziff and even after relenting in the duel, Wildride 
		was unable to taunt the goblins off of Ziff in time.  Ziff died at their hands and 
		lost some experience in the process.<br>
		<br> 
		As strange of a duel as he had ever had, Wildride remained champion of the HoB.<br>
 		<br>
		One reason why Norrath  is not like the real world. In the real world they say keep 
		your friends close and your enemies even closer.  Ziff now knows this does not work 
		too well in Norrath.<br>
		<p>
		<i>Ziff's retort:</i><br>
		<br>
		Ziff brought out a Goblin Warrior, I'm not foolish enough to bring a Warlord.  The 
		Warrior was 22nd level. The Goblin Warrior never turned on me for more than 2-3 
		blows.  As my trusted pet, he was of little consequence and quickly corrected his 
		wrongful ways when striking me.<br>
		<br>
		The Warlord was an entirely different matter.  He wandered in and began POUNDING 
		me just after Wildride had rooted my trusty pet again.  This became a SERIOUS 
		problem very fast.  Wildride was very noble in his attempts to save me, but alas, 
		the Warlord was too powerful.<br>
 		<br>
		Wildride, I will tell you.  The battle was only 1/2 over when we received outside 
		interference.  I had revealed but a small portion of my new surprises.  The tables 
		were about to turn most horribly for you when the Warlord arrived and if it were 
		anyone of less noble spirit I would suspect unfair play.<br>
 		<br>
		Be warned, I will be back.  My bag of tricks is deep and as you learned last time 
		you were defeated, as an enchanter I will wear you down, slowly, surely and 
		horribly till you face your ultimate doom.  You will have time to savor the fear 
		of death.<br>
		<br>
 		In the meantime I will say it was a very interesting fight, well fought by a 
		worthy adversary who deserves the crown on his head.  For now...<br>
		<p>
		<i>more from Wildride:</i><br>
		<br>
		I look forward to another test from my worthy opponent.  It was not a fair test of 
		skills and though I will retain the crown and wear it proudly, I will only receive 
		full satisfaction for the duel when I can wrest your last breath with my own hands.

		Another duel for the crown and glory of the House of Bastards was witnessed in 
		Lake of Ill Omen last night. The longtime comrades Luifang and Wildride stood in 
		a shallow valley sizing each other up. Though Wild and Lui had fought together 
		against common foes recently, it had been the cold caverns of Permafrost in the 
		far north many seasons ago that they last tested their skill and courage against 
		each other. In that battle Wildride was fortunate to retain his title. Since that 
		last meeting much has transpired and this time Wildride was standing before 
		Luifang, as a challenger instead of the defending champion.<br>
		<br>
		Both of the 23rd level, this battle would prove to truly be a test of skill and 
		cunning for both combatants. A crowd assembled around, and the low murmuring of 
		the onlookers' speculations and wagers could be heard as the first strike of steel 
		against flesh and fists against body broke through the din. Luifang started the 
		fight with a furious barrage of flying kicks, and punches. The speed at which she 
		moved and hit shocked Wildride and before he was aware he had been reduced to half 
		his health. Trying to regain his composure he ran from the battle unsure of his 
		ability to defeat Luifang who had obviously grown in strength and skill since 
		their last meeting. Sufficiently far from the battle where none of the assembled 
		crowd could view, Wildride took a deep breath, better prepared himself for the 
		now expected fury and rushed back into the battle where Luifang was still waiting. 
		This time Wildride was able to inflict some significant damage to Luifang and 
		surprised Luifang with his new abilities to affix Lui's deadly feet to the ground.
		While rooted, Wild took his available moments to heal himself enough for the next 
		wave. Eventually Lui's superior capacity to inflict damage brought Wildride to the 
		brink of defeat where he called on his immortal master Rochet Nife to help him 
		summon the will to continue. Rochet Nife smiled down on Wild and revived his loyal 
		follower. Reinvigorated, Wild slung blade and magic against the still furious fists 
		and kicks of Luifang till the final blow was dealt by Wildride's magical harpoon. 
		Luifang lay limp on the ground as the crowd cheered and the champion's belt was 
		awarded to the new HoB Champion.

			Ziff, even without his spiffy new
			colorshift spell, wore down the seasoned champion with a barrage pets, and
			hurling whirls.  Utilizing every trick in the book including walking on
			water far out of the reach of Wild's Deepwater Harpoon and magic arrows and
			magically entwining Wild's legs so as to make him completely immobile.<br>
			<br>
			Even with the Ziff's pranks, Wild was able to stay in the fight for the
			longest duel to date, slaying pet after pet and getting a few good licks in
			on the sly one himself.  But in the end, Wild was slowly being worn down
			without being able to inflict enough damage on anybody but Ziff's pets.  In
			the exhaustion of battle, Wild mistakenly summoned the will of Rochet Nife
			to heal Ziff's Jabner, no doubt another trick, and once Wild came to his
			senses, realized the battle had been lost and that the only chance to escape
			alive was to make a sprint for the zone.  With a refreshed Jabner and an
			Undertow Skeleton joining the chase, Wild reached the zone with only the
			slightest life remaining.</font>

			Lorsua and Wildride had an impromptu duel Saturday night, which started
			off a little rocky.  As Wildride began to shoot arrows at Lorsua, a 
			Kelethin guard took a dislike to him (Wildride) for some reason and he 
			was dead in 2 seconds.<br>  
			<br>
			After picking up his corpse, they again challenged each other at the

			is not a good idea as Wildride has discovered.  All the little woodland
