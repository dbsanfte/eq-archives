Ziff was a bit late arriving at the island last night.  (Sorry folks)  But a healthy 
gang of 6 devastated the Wisp population for 2 solid hours.  Spiders, madmen, 
zombies and skeletons all fell prey to the House of Bastards.  At no point were we 
ever in serious trouble.  Experience was reasonably good.  Phoole reached 10th level 
and most got about 2 bubbles worth.<br>
<br>
But the goal was cash, and we did pretty well.  We collected over 15 platinum and 
5 Greater Light Stones.  When all is said and done for the evening total profit 
will come to at least 65 Plat.  Not bad for 2 hours worth of work.<br>
<br>
A problem we did experience was Ziff was having LOTS of trouble selecting wisps 
for crowd control.  As a result, a valuable lesson was learned and a new tactic 
was developed for 2-3 creature fights.  Burn creature 1 to the ground as fast as 
possible.  Many creatures did not survive more than 3 rounds, but this is a very 
mana expensive tactic and not one he will regularly use.  (sort of a minor role 
for enchanters, not what they are designed to do.)<br>
<br>
So, we also need to decide how to spend our new found wealth.  My original thoughts 
were to make sure everyone had the ability to hit magically (with a weapon).  To 
do that it looks like we will need:<br>
<br>
* netted, mesh or magical gloves for Raaj<br>
* a combine or otherwise magical Scimitar for Fibben<br>
* a combine sword or otherwise magical weapon for Wildride<br> 
* a combine or otherwise magical weapon for Purgatori<br>
<br>
I was thinking we could put the remaining money into helping us increase our much 
needed skills and/or setting aside money for our next levels spells.  (Those may 
cost people as much as 100 plat per caster and Ziff gets his next set at 12.) 
Problem is, the above items could run us as much as 200 plat. If we want, we can 
just divide up the money like we have been doing.  I am open to any ideas people 
have.
