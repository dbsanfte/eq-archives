	</b>
</p>
<br>
<p><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<font color="yellow"><b>Charter</b></font><br>
<br>
Dusk Eternal is a guild of wandering, outcasts who have banded together to prove their 
might to the world of Norrath. We form groups of highly organized adventurers to 
complete specific quests and missions. The groups meet regularly with new raids and new 
objectives. Dusk Eternal will protect the citizens of Norath through cooperation and 
organization, demonstrating to everyone that true friends are more important than 
bloodlines.<br>
<br>
Code of Conduct:<br>
1 - The group comes first.<br>
2 - Treat others with respect.<br>
3 - Take full responsibility for all of your actions.<br>
4 - Be completely truthful at all times.<br>
5 - Protect the just and honorable.<br>
6 - Obey the rules of the land at all times.<br>
7 - Avenge the innocent. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Member Levels</b></font><br>
<br>
We have no level limits. Since no one can get an invite until they have worked with 
current members, their primary character levels will match those of current members.<br>
<br>
As for alts, once you are a member of the guild, all of your alts are welcome as well, 
no matter the level. We are trying to promote a family atmosphere here and the more 
people can be in touch, the better.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Guidelines</b></font><br>
<br>
The following is a list of proposed guidelines. These are not so much things that would 
be considered punishable offenses, but common behaviors we recommend and encourage others 
to follow.<br>
<br>
Again, this is not a "complete" list. In fact, this set of guidelines is probably expected 
to be a living document that will forever be changing and growing.<br>
<br>
Your vote/thoughts/comments would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
Dude Speak is not permitted. Anachronisms, common vernacular and roleplaying are encouraged.
However, Dude speak is not any of those things and is an inappropriate representation of the 
guild.<br>
<br>
Raids.<br>
<br>
During guild raids and events the raid leaders will assign looters. Only the looters 
should loot corpses unless otherwise instructed by the raid leader. Should the designated 
looter by AFK or LD a new one will be temporarily assigned.<br>
<br>
How loot is divided for a Raid is decided by the Raid leader. In the event the Raid 
leader is AFK or LD, guild leaders and officers will determine the division of loot.<br>
<br>
It is important that you listen and are fully cooperative at all times during a raid. If 
someone has a designated responsibility you should follow their instructions and make no 
attempt to override or interfere with instructions. This includes things like staying in 
the fight until the designated "RUN" caller declares it is time to run. It also includes 
staying put until the puller gives the "OK" to move. There are many detailed aspects of 
a well planned raid and it is important that you understand what role you play and what 
roles everyone else plays. It is important that you follow the instructions of those 
assigned duties and responsibilities and do not interfere with them. Failure to do so 
will often result in the deaths of multiple party members.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Violations</b></font><br>
<br>
The following are a list of Violations that would be considered requiring warnings or
further action from the guild.<br>
<br>
Again, these are the ideas the officers came up with. Please vote and make any comments 
you feel necessary. Please also keep in mind that this is not a "complete" list by any 
means. It establishes an intent and flavor for the guild though.<br>
<br>
Violation of any portion of the charter.<br>
<br>
Using excessive profanity in guild chat or on the Dusk Eternal Message Board.<br>
<br>
Using profanity or sexually explicit terms, in public message systems within EQ (Tells, 
Shouts, Says, Auctions etc.) or a message board such as the Cazic-Thule Corner.<br>
<br>
Engaging in a verbal attacks, threats or otherwise harassing another person in game or 
on the message board.<br>
<br>
Abuse or misuse of Guild funds or items.<br>
<br>
Purposely kill stealing or ninja looting.<br>
<br>
Begging. Begging is the act of asking favors, including but not limited to money, 
equipment, buffs, teleports and resurrections, without making a reasonable offer of 
compensation. As a guild member, we will often do favors for other members and ask 
nothing in return, but should you ask for that favor it will always be expected that 
you will offer something in return. Weather or not the person doing the favor accepts 
the compensation is entirely up to them.<br>
<br>
Going anonymous. No guild member should go anonymous. If you feel it is necessary to 
hide your class or race, please use the /Roleplay command. If you feel you need to hide 
your guild tag then you should either seriously consider why you are in Dusk Eternal or 
seriously consider the actions you are about to take.<br>
<br>
Responding to threads on CTC or any other message boards or that contain flames about 
Dusk Eternal or any of it's factions. In the event of excessive flames or abuses directed 
at the Guild, please inform an officer and it will be handled appropriately.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Enforcement</b></font><br>
<br>
I am proposing a simple enforcement procedure for guild violations. Please vote to let us 
know your opinion of this procedure and supply any comments you feel necessary.<br>
<br>
Yes, this is a bit tedious and long, but this is VERY important to the structure of the 
guild. How we enforce the rules of the guild can result in a serious impact to the guild. 
Please think carefully about what is written here. Our objective was to come up with 
something that was fair, democratic and not too cumbersome.<br>
<br>
First offense - Warning #1 - These are assigned to the individuals over-all account and 
thus applicable to any character the user plays.<br>
<br>
Second Offense - Warning #2 - These are also assigned to the individuals account and 
apply to all characters played. After a second warning is issued, the player will not be 
allowed to guild additional alts for 1 month.<br>
<br>
Third Offense - The Character in violation is removed from the guild. Alts are allowed to 
stay in the guild. After a third warning, the player may not add alts to the guild for 6 
months.<br>
<br>
Additional Offenses - Removal of other characters and potentially (if all officers are in 
agreement) complete removal from the guild.<br>
<br>
Any officer can issue a warning to any character at any time. Full details of why the 
warning was assigned to the player will need to be posted in the officers forum. Should 
the other two officers feel the warning is unwarranted, it can be removed. However, this 
will be an EXTREMELY rare case. The guild leader is the only person who can issue a 
warning to an officer. The officers, if in agreement with each other, can issue a warning 
to the guild leader. Once a warning has been assigned to a player, the offending player will 
receive an e-mail explaining the exact details of why the warning is being issued and the 
implications of that warning.<br>
<br>
Warnings will NOT be discussed with other players unless the player receiving the warning 
requests it.<br>
<br>
Warnings last for 6 months. If no additional warnings are received during a 6 month 
period then the warning is removed.<br>
<br>
There may be occasions where individuals would require immediate dismissal from the 
guild. This is an extreme situation and should not be taken lightly. Should this become 
necessary the individual will first be asked to log out and to not log in a guild tagged 
EQ player for 24 hours while the matter is being decided by the officers. If the player 
refuses to cooperate, they will be temporarily removed from the guild to prevent further 
problems being associated with the guild name until the matter is decided. The officer in 
question should gather all of the information necessary and post it to the officers forum 
and contact the officers. A vote on the matter should be had immediately, weather that be 
via phone, web, e-mail or otherwise. If all officers agree, the offending player will be 
removed from the guild. A post will be placed in the members section explaining in detail 
why the action was taken. Comments and suggestions from the guild in general will be 
taken for 1 week. During this time the offending player will still be allowed to post and 
defend themselves via the message board. If after 1 week the officers see no need to 
change the ruling, the player in question will be permanently removed from the guild and 
all access to the message board be revoked. If compelling reasons can be put forth that 
sway the officers to change the ruling, they will decide the level and severity of the 
punishment.<br>
<br>
Removal from the guild due to warnings and violation is permanent. Players removed in 
this manner will not be allowed reentry to the guild, ever. <br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Addition to Enforcement</b></font><br>
<br>
I want to add something to the "enforcement" section that I feel should involve a 
separate vote. This is bound to be a bit controversial, so if necessary, add replies 
before voting. I put this up once, but the wording for the rule was hard to understand. 
Hopefully this is clearer.<br>
<br>
For purposes of enforcement and violations, no distinctions will be made between who is 
playing the account at any given time. In other words, if two or more people share an 
account, violations on that account will be issued to the character, regardless of who 
was playing them. We will make no attempt to distinguish between who was playing the account. 
The only exception to this rule will be cases where it can be proven that the account was 
used by someone other than the original owner without their permission.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Jill plays Krugar the Killer fine. When she is playing Krugar the Killer he is a 
wonderful character and a great addition to the guild. However, her dad Bob plays Krugar 
the Killer sometimes too. When Bob plays Krugar the Killer he is disruptive, offensive 
and does not follow guild rules. How should we treat this?<br>
<br>
The proposal is, do not try to separate out who is playing the character. Issue warnings 
and disciplinary action to the character and let those who are playing him sort it out. 
(That would be a YES vote)<br>
<br>
Or, separate out who was playing the character and issue warnings to the person who is 
causing the disruption. (That would be a NO vote)<br>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"><b>Keep Roster Updated</b></font><br>
<br>
All guilded characters should be listed in the Roster section. The Roster information 
should be kept timely and members will be required to keep it up to date as characters 
progress in level. Guild members are NOT required to list non guilded alts. Listing them 
is entirely optional.<br>
