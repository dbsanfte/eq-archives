<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
by Ziff<br>
<br>
Mistmoore castle has a reputation among the adventurers of Norrath. Its called the butcher 
grounds. This castle is so well protected that few ever breach its portcullis and of those 
that do almost none survive. HoB was going to take that challenge. They had been there 
before with the Hawk Lords. That was a scene of chaos, carnage and confusion. Now they 
were back to assault the castle HoB style; with cooperation, coordination and cunning.<br>
<br>
And so as a single unit, HoB began its assault. Within minutes the flow for the evening 
was established. Only 100 yards through the grounds Garall turned the corner with 10 or 
more Mistmoore residents in tow. Before a succinct rally could be formed several members 
were already dead. The decision was made to flee in order to preserve those that still 
lived.<br>
<br>
After a brief reorganization HoB struck again and the pendulum swung back in HoBs favor. 
This time they reached the graveyard and were mounting an assault on the area known as the 
pit when the pendulum swung back again. This time HoB stood its ground and would not 
submit to the assault. They emerged victorious but at the loss of two lives.<br>
<br>
After reorganizing and reviving they pushed into the pit and forced the pendulum back in 
their favor. Soon they held the pit and were moving up the dangerous and steep path to 
the castle gates. At the top they gathered and surveyed the enemy. Only two could be seen 
and so, after a brief discussion, an arrow flew and the fight was on. Immediately HoB 
could feel the pendulum swing back against them. With horns blaring the castle guards 
charged. Those horns brought a host of enemies. The pendulum swung back and smashed HoB 
with deadly fury. Before retreat could be called for one third of hob had been slaughtered. 
Another third were cut down as they attempted to retreat, either falling victim to claw 
and swords or falling to their death as they attempted to flee down the steep and 
treacherous path.<br>
<br>
It was time for HoB to push back. Gathering two Dusk Eternal members of higher experience 
into their ranks they prepared to give as good as they just got. <br>
<br>
Again they carved a bloody path to the castle doors, even stopping to kill Entryti. They 
hit a few stumbling blocks along the way but by the time they HoB again arrived at the 
castle gates they were a solid unit; two full teams acting as one.<br>
<br>
With glorious precision the guards at the gate were obliterated along with any assistance 
they brought. It was HoBs turn now.<br>
<br>
Garall dove into the castle proper and retrieved wave after wave of Mistmoore denizens. 
Each wave crashed and broke on the HoB offensive. The pendulum was now bearing its full 
weight on Mistmoore's inhabitants.<br>
<br>
HoB should have been wise at this point. Fate had already fed HoB two cruel lessons but 
apparently that was not enough. What happened next will be etched in HoB's mind for a 
long time. Garall emerged through the castle doors with a small host in tow. Right behind 
them was another collection of evil. Together these would pose a serious challenge to the 
group. Ziff could feel the pendulum coming back with relentless viciousness. As if on cue 
more than ten additional denizens burst from the castle. HoB now faced the largest enemy 
force they had ever fought at once, and each one of them was focused on killing Garall. 
Ziff shouted "RUN!" as soon as he saw the enemy force. Garall took one more step and was 
incinerated. HoB turned to flee and before hardly a step could be taken almost half of 
the raiding party was annihilated.<br>
<br>
Again little more than a third of the group lived. The hour was getting late and the group 
decided one more ride on the pendulum of fate was more than they felt like risking. They 
resurrected their dead, collected their loot, left the butcher grounds behind and headed 
off to Feronia Vie to nurse their wounds and find new enemies.<br>
