The raid on upper Guk was successful, but a mostly a good learning experience 
for upcoming raids. With the party numbering 5, we entered the caverns. We were 
expecting or sixth, Luifang, to arrive soon. She had a lot of traveling to do 
to reach us because she was still In North Karanas as the 8PM hour arrived. We 
proceeded to sneak past several lower level frog guardians who regarded us 
indifferently. Little did they know the coming doom we would bring to their 
clan. We waded through the water and entered a series of caverns filled with 
heart spiders. After some quick discussion we sent our trusty Paladin, Wildride 
into the spider caves to bring us some prey. For about 30 minutes we killed 
spiders, even taking on and killing a large Heart spider of level 18. Once the 
spiders were slaughtered we reorganized and moved deeper in. Having recently 
been joined by our second monk, Luifang, we were feeling confident that we 
could establish a base and beginning an assault on the Scryer room.<br>
<br>
Faan and Fibben, our cleric and druid, buffed everyone up along with some help 
from Ziff. We decided to have Luifang pull the ugly frogs to us and Fibben 
volunteered to take runner patrol.<br>
<br>
Luifang proceeded to pull Frogs in groups of 2-4. Frogs proceeded to die 
quickly and violently. We had some confusion in the beginning with deciding 
who to assist and getting everyone fighting the same thing, but this was 
quickly resolved. Luifang brought Frog patrol after patrol into our camp and 
each met with a fast and furious death. Highpoints include taking out a 19+ 
level frog commander and a giant heart spider that was at least 20th level. As 
the night progressed Luifang entered the room panting and bleeding, stating 
that she got ambushed by a large group of frogs. Almost immediately, 8 or more 
angry frogs came charging into the room. Efforts were made to control the 
chaos but it became obvious very quickly we were outmatched. Ziff was assaulted 
by 4 of them when they discovered, and resisted, his mesmerizing personality. 
As a result, he fell dead at their feet before Faan could even begin to heal 
him. A hasty retreat was called for but few made it out alive. Krug, our other 
monk, Ziff, Faan and Wildride fell to the hands of the frogs.<br>
<br>
Angered and frustrated the group gathered together, collected their equipment 
their corpses and reorganized. It was decided at this point that we should 
make a careful assault and attempt to move in to the Scryer's room. We 
carefully and systematically took out the outer guards and began to move in. 
Everything was going like systemized clockwork until a pull including 2 guards 
and 2 shaman. A bit of a communication error lead Fibben to believe that the 
guard we were attacking was rooted securely to the ground. This was not the 
case and, staring his inevitable death in the eye, he ran shouting for help. 
Wildride pursued him to try and cut him down, but it was too late. He died 
as his cries for help could be heard throughout the caverns. A hoard of Frogs 
came rushing to assist their comrades and we were quickly overrun. This 
mishap resulted in nearly everyone dying.<br>
<br>
We again, reorganized and retrieved our bodies and, seeing as how it was late, 
stayed back in the area with the heart spiders. Several members had to leave 
so we made smaller, more careful pulls for a short amount of time and called 
it a night.<br>
<br>
Over all we did pretty well. Everyone made about 2 bubbles of experience but 
we only made about 3 plat in profits. As a first day into the territory, it 
went about as well as can be expected. We did learn a lot about the area, as 
well as learned from a few mistakes. We are have all agreed that Guk seems to 
be a good place to be so we will be returning next week to reap our revenge 
on the frogs. With our newly gained experiences we expect that we will be a 
force to be reckoned with and we will exact our revenge from deep in the frog 
empire.
