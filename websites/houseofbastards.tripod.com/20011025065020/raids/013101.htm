<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
by Zoft<br>
<br>
Darkness fell across the barren frozen wastelands of Everfrost. In a darkening cavern the 
host of HoB and their friends gathered and organized. They stood at the edge of Permafrost 
Keep, a place well known to many members. A foul place filled with goblins and crueler beasts, 
rumored to be the home of the dragon Vox. In the chill of the coming night HoB began, later 
than they wanted, frustrated by technical issues and a long duel they were incensed with an 
edgy anticipation. Anxious to begin the slaughter the final assembly entered the Keep and 
charged flag room. In moments the flag room was simply a heap of goblin corpses. Garall and 
Wildride then harried the ones cowering in deeper caverns, bringing hoards of goblins down 
on HoB. Steel rang, spells blazed smell of death lay heavy in the air. The Flag Room, once a 
sight of HoB demise now was a wash of goblin blood, bones and bodies, HoB shouted challenges 
and warnings to the remaining goblin hoards. Fear and silence hung thick in the air and HoB 
charged the kings chambers with renewed vigor, bloodlust and vengeance coursing through their 
veins. The gates flew open and HoB charged the top of the kings chambers. Wizards, guards and 
other elite goblins fell fast to the organized might of this veteran crew. Less than 2 
minutes transpired before the top of the cavern was heaped with the dead.<br>
<br>
The King and his minions could be heard below, growling and sputtering. They were angry and 
they wanted vengeance.<br>
<br>
HoB reorganized, renewed their magical protections and hatched a plan. The main force would 
take out the Priest Zaharn while the smaller older crew would attack the sage. Once those were 
finished off they would fall upon the King with combined force and, after his death, would split 
up again to finish of the remaining goblins.<br>
<br>
Luppis snuck down to the edge of the pit and reported back, there were 6 of them total. This 
was bound to be a challenge.<br>
<br>
Garall climbed down the ledges, inched his way across the icy floor and, spotting the sage, let 
an arrow fly.<br>
<br>
The Goblins came flying up the slopes at an incredible pace filled with rage and spite. They 
screamed shouts of anger as they assaulted Garall with spells. Garall clambered over the top 
with less than half his life remaining. Around the corner at the same time came the goblins. The 
battle was on.<br>
<br>
Things got sticky very fast. The cavern was filled with not 6, but 9 goblins. They kept themselves 
packed close together, making it hard to single out the proper targets. Zoritsa made a valiant 
effort to control the mob but those that resisted charged her headlong. Zoft worked quickly to 
root her foes and give her back the upper hand, but the battle was falling into chaos. The 
caverns echoed with the spells and screams of both goblin and HoB. Blood ran freely down the walls 
and puddled on the floor. Soon the priest fell to the HoB alliance, but the sage still stood. The 
price was great as well. The casters were below 50% mana and there were still 8 goblins in the 
room. As a team they fell upon the sage in hopes of turning the tide through fast and furious 
deaths, but the remaining goblins had caused too much confusion. They had split up and mounted 
their own assaults on the HoB priests with some added attacks to Zoritsa for good measure. As 
Zoft began to weaken Garall called upon the blessings of his gods to help him. This saved his 
life but did not turn the tide. Zoft's mana was too depleted to be of much assistance and every 
time he sat to med he was accosted by another goblin. Faan was beaten down just as badly and, 
lacking the power of a Paladin god, fell to the Goblins at almost the same time the sage dropped.<br>
<br>
The remaining HoB members did not stray, they stuck to the plan, valiant or foolish. But Zoft, 
under massive assault, was soon to be dead. Before he succumbed to the blades of the goblins he 
gave a cry, "Flee for your lives!".<br>
<br>
HoB turned to run, but was swarmed by goblins. Many never reached the iron portcullis leading 
out of the King's chambers. Zoritsa reached the edge of the keep before being chopped down and 
the only survivor from the ordeal was Purgatori who was found bleeding and gasping for life at 
the doorway to the keep.<br>
<br>
HoB had suffered it's worst disaster since Najena.<br>
<br>
After almost 1 hour of corpse retrieval, revives and rebuffs, they decided to try the room again, 
with a new tactic. They would not be defeated.<br>
<br>
The plan was to assault the kings chambers again, killing every goblin in the path between HoB and 
the king. Then HoB would retreat to the entrance of the keep and Luppis would charge in and bring 
the king in tow. The plan was to take down the sage first, then any priests and follow it up with 
an assault on the King. After the leaders were dead the plan was again to split up and assault the 
remaining goblins in two groups, making quick work of the smaller minions.<br>
<br>
Hot with revenge, HoB charged into the Keep, working fast and furious. They knew that this time, 
they had to act fast. The goblins they killed along the way would be replaced by new troops soon and 
they had to complete the assault before the replacements arrived.<br>
<br>
The clock ticked by and after 15 minutes HoB had cleared the path. As one they ran back to the 
entrance and then gave a cry to Luppis - BRING THE KING!<br>
<br>
Echoes could be heard throughout the hallway. Echoes of Goblin curses and spells crashing into Luppis's 
body. As he rounded the corner Zoft gave him a quick heal as he was already below 1/2 of his health. 
Following right behind him was 5 goblins.<br>
<br>
HoB demonstrated the precision and teamwork they have become known for. In less than 5 minutes all 
goblins were dead. All HoB members were at full health and more than 50% mana. But the king was not 
among the corpses.<br>
<br>
Seeing this, Luppis ran back into the depths of Permafrost, hurrying to get the king again.<br>
<br>
HoB sat nursing wounds, meditating and waiting for the King.<br>
<br>
Luppis could be heard screaming in frustration from deep in the caverns. As he rounded the corner, 
behind him cam the King, the target of HoB frustration, followed by a hoard of goblins. The new guards 
had reached their posts while Luppis was deep in the keep. As the King ran past them to slaughter 
Luppis he called upon them for assistance and they came in droves. At initial count, there were more 
than 10 of them.<br>
<br>
With precision and grace HoB began an assault on the King, ignoring the swords and claws of his battalion. 
Younger Dusk Eternal members who were at the entrance to Perma stepped up and swung their blades as well. 
Even their old friend Calaran arrived to help. In moments, the King lay in a bloody heap on the floor. But 
a horrible cost had been paid. Most of HoB was at 1/2 health, most were low on mana and there were still 
a room full of goblins to defeat. Valiantly HoB tried to make a stand, but they were swarmed by the Goblins 
and one by one they were forced to flee. Surely, they took down another 3-4 of the hated beasts before every 
exited the Keep but in the end, they were forced to run. Tasslehof, risking everything, was one of the last 
to leave and sadly, his life was taken as he exited the keep. His crumpled body fell lifeless to the floor 
at HoB's feet.<br>
<br>
This was not a good night for HoB over all. They met the goblin hoards and did not come out on top, they 
were not defeated, they simply came out. Across the board it was a net experience loss for the 
group members. The loot was small (platinum has not yet been counted) and the magical loot 
was limited. Only a coronet from Zaharn's head and a Symbol of Loyalty to Vox.<br>
<br>
Still, we stuck it out and avoided the in-fighting that sometimes happens when night with this 
much frustration happen. Of that, we should all be proud. <br>
