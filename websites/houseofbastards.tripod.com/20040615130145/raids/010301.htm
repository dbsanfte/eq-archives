Great raid everyone! Though we did not see a runed bone fork or have a chance to kill 
the Froglok Shin Lord, we again showed the froggies who's boss.

Had he not been camped, we could have taken the Lord down easily with the well oiled 
machine that was Group 1. Everyone in the group got over a bubble of experience and will 
split 150pp between them.

<b>RECOUNT</b><br>
by Ziff<br>
<br>
The lower level party did had a rough start but a solid finish. The raid for the lower <br>
levels was more about coordinating everyone and beginning to lay down some basic group <br>
tactics and strategies. For the first hour or so things were4 pretty rough as people <br>
were getting used to some new tactics and processes. Things got extremely tricky when <br>
a frog, wounded and scared went screaming for the ladder. Soon, disorganized and <br>
disoriented, group 2 was overwhelmed.<br>
<br>
Seeing the trouble, Ziff called for a run. Many members made it to the exist alive, but <br>
two got lost in the depths of Guk and were hacked down by Frogs.<br>
<br>
Zoft arrived, dragged the bodies to the zone and revived them. The group reorganized <br>
again and headed back in.<br>
<br>
Soon, Purgatori joined the group and the slaughter began anew.<br>
<br>
At one point our puller, Nekko, got rooted to the floor deep in Guk. Lacking the ability <br>
to move or defend himself he was overwhelmed. The rest of the group ran to save him, but <br>
to no avail. What proceeded was a pitched battle. Group 2, lacking one of 2 tanks, began <br>
to lay into 9 frogs. This was a shining moment. Wounded, disoriented and lacking their <br>
primary assist person group 2 pulled together and took out every Frog in the room. When <br>
done, we were all low on health and OOM, but we were victorious. Proof that many <br>
beginning lessons had been learned.<br>
<br>
Soon Nekko returned with a small train in tow. Group 2 was still weak, but we rose to <br>
the occasion. We were still disorganized for a while and that proved to nearly be our <br>
downfall, but in the end we were victorious.<br>
<br>
Then night was a great success for what it was intended for. We looted 2 collars of <br>
undead protection and 15 plat. We all received about 1 bubble of experience. So, in <br>
those regards, the night was a bust. But much was learned. The group who entered Guk was <br>
not the group that left. The group that left had learned a great deal and had formed a <br>
foundation for their growth as a group and use of team tactics.<br>
<br>
Special mention goes to Guadzilla and Nekko. Guadzilla did an excellent job of healing <br>
the party and keeping everyone up to date on mana status. Since this was the first time <br>
he has had to fill that role, this was especially impressive. Nekko did a great job of <br>
pulling and selecting targets for his first time with the group and in Guk. Great <br>
promise is shown there my friend. <br>
