The evening began with the group trying to work out some technical difficulties.
The headsets were not working quite right and after 45 minutes we finally gave 
up on fixing them and instead, worked out an alternate plan within the confines 
of the problems.<br>
<br>
So, at almost 9:00 PM CST we began our assault.  We brought in Xanthalus, a 14th 
level wizard as an experiment as well.<br>
<br>
We moved into the first hallway and, being eager to begin the slaughter, 
assaulted a hapless frog guard.  This turned out to be a bad idea because he 
was young and week.  As soon as he was hit he ran screaming down the hall 
bringing hoards of his friends.  We had no time to snare him.  Soon, we realized 
we had 8 frogs in the room who were quite upset.  Ziff also realized he did 
not have his AE mez memorized.  In general, we rushed it and now we were in 
trouble.  Ziff quickly memed the spell and began mezzing bathes of frogs.  After 
2 casts he had effected all 8, but 3 resisted and one cam under attack.  A 
hasty retreat was called and before it could be performed, Faan fell dead to 
the floor. We escaped, loosing only 1 other member, Fibben.<br> 
<br>
We reorganized, retrieved the corpses and began another assault when a Troll 
Shaman and a Bard came storming into the room.  They began pulling and fighting 
Frogs, paying no heed to runners or the number of Frogs they were fighting.  In 
seconds the room was swarmed with Frogs.  The Bards songs were causing mez to 
break, the Troll was hitting things seemingly at random.  HoB was falling under 
a heavy wave of assaults and we needed to escape.  This happened so fast that 
before "Run" could even be called, more than half the party was slaughtered.<br>
<br>
We returned to the scene to recover our corpses.  Frustrated, as we had not 
even broken into the ante room yet and had two very bad experiences.  Ziff had 
a conversation with the Troll about his tactics and the problem they caused us.  
He was obstinate at first, but after a brief demonstration of what he was 
causing to happen, he became apologetic.  He hung around the party for the next 
30 minutes or so, trying to help out to repay us for his sins.  In the end, it 
became about a wash because he did not understand the dynamics of how the group
works and fights.  But, his apology was accepted.<br>
<br>
So, reorganized, buffed and rested we began again.  This time systematically 
destroying Frogs.  We worked our way down to the ante room and then started 
pulling from the stage.  The first pull was a little hairy, but we managed it 
without too much risk.  Our new Wizard friend proved to the party the value 
of an incinerator, sending frogs from a little under half health to a smoking 
ruin in seconds.<br>
<br>
We then set up our now familiar camp on the stage and began waiting for the 
Scryer. We would have our revenge.<br> 
<br>
12 minutes later, we had our chance. The stage began to spawn and we began to 
clear it. The last spawn was the Scryer. The HoB swarmed all over him. Spells 
flew, blades dug deep and fists and feet crashed in with the assistance of 
quickness. Then something happened which no one expected. Krug, our fiendishly 
devastating monk turned on our new wizard friend and started pounding on him!  
Wildride, the Paladin soon turned on Faan. Krug soon decided Ziff was a better 
target and moved to Ziff, but Fibben turned on our wizard. We were in a lot of 
trouble. The party was being charmed and the Scryer was still at 1/2 health.<br>
<br>
A retreat was called for and those that could, ran. Ziff, Faan and Krug made it 
out. The rest of the party died horribly. What is worse, Wildride died, deep in 
the bowels of Guk. The Scryer died at the zone edge. Killed by another dungeon 
delver.<br>
<br>
Ziff spent 30 minutes invisible and nervous sneaking into Guk getting Wildrides 
corpse and we began again. We had new tactics and now that we knew what we were 
up against, we were determined to kill him. Our wizard friend left us for the 
evening, deciding that Luifang's deadly fists would be more useful against the 
Scryer. We again cleared the ante room, cleared the stage and took it.<br>
<br>
We held it through 2 full spawns. We were keeping the stage and the surrounding 
rooms cleared and controlled. Frogs were dying everywhere. This must have been 
passed up to the Scryer, because he showed up to teach us a lesson again. Man 
was he in for a surprise.<br>
<br>
Again, we fell upon him with furious vigor. He began charming part members and 
we began attempting to control the charmed individuals. Suddenly, we discovered 
our charmed friends could not be mezzed, rooted or otherwise controlled. Our 
tactics were down to "attempting to remove the spell". This did not look good. 
But, the party persevered. Several members were charmed and we managed to break 
most of them free. The Scryer was getting wounded and getting desperate. With 
only 1 party member still charmed we turned on him at full fury and, staring 
HoB and his inevitable death in the eye he ran screaming. Four more frogs from 
the ante room came to his assistance. But, to no avail. He fell dead in 
seconds. Wounded, disorganized and low on mana we began to assault the helpers.  
Things were very tough for a minute as Ziff was out of mana and 3 frogs were 
still running loose. But, the HoB tactics and organization prevailed and we 
soon slaughtered all four frogs. We were victorious! We looted the Scryers 
rotting corpse and discovered a Bracelet of woven grass Ac 1 + 3 Int +12 HP.<br>
<br>
We healed ourselves up and continued slaughtering frogs for another hour or so.  
As we were getting ready to call it a night Luifang brought in too many frogs. 
Eight angry and powerful frogs swarmed the stage. A hasty retreat was called for 
and all but Faan escaped.<br>
<br>
Over all it was a good night. (Faan being the exception to that rule, dying 
4 times.) It did not go as well as hoped, but everyone agreed that killing 
the Scryer (level 21 - 23 enchanter) was a definite high point. We came out 
with 3.4 platinum as regular loot and the bracelet.  Everyone made between 
1 and 2 bubbles of experience and we learned a lot about new tactics and 
being charmed. Ziff only mezzed himself once the whole night and everyone 
seemed very impressed with the new wizard. In fact, it was funny that 
everyone was very glad to be surprised by the charm effect, even though 
it killed many of us.  It shows the adventurous spirit of the group.<br>
<br>
So, next week we return to Guk. But we may take a different area this time to 
mix it up a bit. Look out Squire! HoB has drawn your name from the hat! Wake up, 
it's time to die!
