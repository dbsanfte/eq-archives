<b>RECOUNT</b><br>
<br>
Our bravest and most successful raid to date! Great job everyone.<br>
<br>
Luifang:<br>
I want to congratulate everyone who attended Paw raid last night, we shined as 
a group. Everyone could feel the tension and difficulty of each fight, so I though I 
would give you an idea of what we were fighting.<br>
<br>
Wildride:<br>
I did not need to see that a Tesch Val Gnoll was a tough bugger. He whacked me senseless 
last night. Purgatori and I noted to each other that he was the toughest we had faced.<br>
<br>
Congratulations all, this was a fantastic display of teamwork and organization. I did not 
think we could/would dive so far into the depths of Paw. I would love to return to the 
lair again to see what other mischief we can find.<br>
<br>
Ziff:<br>
Howls, growling and barking echoed up from the depths. This place known as Split Paw Lair 
stank. It stank with the fetid smell of blood, death and dog. HoB was no stranger to the 
rank beasts within this hole. HoB had fought many a gnoll before in the depths of Blackburrow.
That lair was where HoB first hunted and began honing their skills and tactics. Over a 
year later they were anxious to demonstrate all they had learned to a more seasoned more 
viscous clan of gnolls.<br>
<br>
At the top of the hole, 12 veterans of the depths of Norrath assembled. Protective magic's 
were cast, armor was donned, tactics were discussed and lots of chest thumping and shield 
bashing could be heard in answer to the growls and howling. Excited, and pumped full of 
adrenaline HoB charged the hallways like a wave of death.<br>
<br>
That wave nearly crashed upon the rocky shores of the gnoll stronghold. Their first enemies, 
a pair of semi seasoned gnolls, reduced the party to less than 1/3 mana and posed some 
serious problems to the group as a whole. But HoB would not be stopped. They quickly 
reorganized, made small adjustments in tactics and began anew. HoB's honed skills and 
flexibility proved to be the bane of many a gnoll that night.<br>
<br>
With a revised approach Luifang began delving the depths of the lair, pulling gnolls out 
in groups of two and three. HoB fell upon their prey with a reckless precision. In less 
than 1/2 of an hour Luifang had cleared a pathway deep into the heart of the gnoll 
tunnels and HoB charged across the broken and butchered corpses to make a stand deep in 
their lair, leaving behind a large group of veteran adventurers, some more than twice HoB's 
level, cowering in the doorway HoB had charged through.<br>
<br>
Whispers could be heard from the veterans. "Madness. They are simply crazy. They are all 
going to die."<br>
<br>
HoB would have none of it. They established a foothold in a small ante room and Luifang 
began harrying gnolls from deeper in the lair. The gnolls were getting stronger, trickier 
and more deadly. HoB simply buckled down and attacked with organized patience, wearing 
down the warriors till they fell to gleaming blades and spells and harassing the casters 
till they could no longer concentrate on their magic's. In less than 30 minutes Luifang 
again announced that a pathway had been cleared to a landing overlooking a cavernous lake.<br>
<br>
HoB stormed the landing and set up shop. Luifang again brought gnolls from still deeper in 
the lair. These proved to be an even greater challenge, but one HoB met with a mad blood 
lusting fever. A fever that would not be quenched by these dogs.<br>
<br>
As the group was preparing to move even deeper within the caverns, Calaran experienced a 
strange magical calling and was suddenly whisked away. HoB at first moved deeper into the 
caverns but then, deciding they were too far from where Calaran would return, moved back. 
Gladly, Calaran returned shortly afterwards and so HoB moved to the other side of the 
cavern and cleared an area for battle. This was as deep as they would go, nearly 3/4 of 
the way into the lair of the gnolls HoB had fought with bravery and intelligence. Not a 
single member had fallen victim the gnolls magic's, claws or blades. They would make their 
stand here and Luifang would attempt to draw out Rosch Val L'Vlor. A gnoll who carried a 
tome of great power and magic.<br>
<br>
For more than an hour Luifang combed the depths of the Split Paw clan searching for this 
gnoll. She brought gnolls out who were casters, rogues, clerics, necromancers, enchanters, 
shaman and more. Each one fell to the brutally organized teamwork of HoB. She even brought 
several of their leaders, Mal and Val gnolls. Some proved to be great adversaries, taking 
5 minutes or more to kill. Others fell so fast they barely had time to wine. At several 
points HoB was overwhelmed with gnolls and things looked bleak. But, the group stood 
strong and each time came out bloodied, battered and victorious. The corpses piled higher 
and higher and still no sign of Rosch Val L'Vlor.<br>
<br>
The evening began to come to a close. The named gnoll had not shown his ugly face and HoB 
was ready to leave the lair of Split Paw. Like an organized swat team Luifang led a 
retreat from the depths of Split Paw that was never hurried, never dangerous and always 
precise. In less than 15 minutes the entire raiding party emerged into the morning light, 
battered, bloody, and tired, but most of all victorious. The gnolls had been dealt a 
savage blow. HoB would be back in a week to deal them another.<br>
<br>
First and foremost - INCREDIBLE JOB EVERYONE! I mean that. HoB has been together for more 
than a year now. We have run numerous raids in varying levels of success. The loot from 
last night was nothing to get too excited about, but the teamwork was top notch. The 
communication was excellent, everyone stuck to their roles and kept their heads. We had a 
few mistakes here and there but we banded together and recovered from them like a solid 
team. Special "hats off" to the Kodman, Galadriel and Dicerman. This was their first time 
working with us and they did a top notch job, even in critical roles like healing and 
snaring. I can honestly say that this was our most dangerous raid EVER and yet I felt like 
we were in more control of the situation the entire night than we have been on most other 
raids. I hope everyone had as much fun as I did.<br>
<br>
Experience for the night was very solid. First - no deaths. Guadzilla leveled (congrats) the 
rest of us got between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 bubbles of experience. The new tactic of attacking 
multiple mobs seemed to spread the experience out a little more evenly without so much 
work and distraction.<br>
<br>
Loot was mediocre. We looted 13 plat 4 gold each. (See Ziff before the next raid to get 
your split or if you want it donated to the guild let me know) We also looted the following 
things that were not sold yet. Those who were on the raid who can use them, let me know. 
Otherwise (other than research items) the rest of it will be sold off and the loot split 
amongst those who participated. (some of this came from Perma last week, but I'm lumping it 
together)<br>
