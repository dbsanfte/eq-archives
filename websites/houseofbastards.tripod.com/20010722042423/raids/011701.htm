<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
HoB has met 3 Lizard Zealots in their history. The first one meant whole scale slaughter 
for the group. Last night HoB went back for revenge.<br>
<br>
A band of 6 gathered outside the entrance to Cazic Thule. It was a ragged band. Guadzilla, 
being only of 22 seasons but a seasoned long time HoB member, was there to make his first 
reappearance as an HoB member. Zoritsa and Ziff exchanged ideas on how they would work, 
knowing that with only 6 two enchanters were a less than perfect solution, but after some 
time the group was ready and dove into the temple in search of fresh lizards.<br>
<br>
HoB first took to the underground water ways with the intent of slaughtering alligators for 
a while. Unfortunately, when they arose from the watery tunnels they found another group 
huddled at the waters edge searching for gators. This was not going to be a good place to 
begin an attack. So, while deciding where to go next they attacked a few alligators and 
practiced some new tactics with the party.<br>
<br>
It was decided they would head to the pyramid. A temple built for the god Cazic Thule. HoB 
would storm the temple and crush the lizards, proving to Cazic Thule that HoB had no fear 
of his minions.<br>
<br>
HoB assembled in the courtyard and decided to have Luifang pull lizards from the maze for 
a while. This would give HoB a chance to practice the new tactics necessary for this mish 
mashed group. This was a good thing.<br>
<br>
Luifang brought a small enclave of lizards out to the courtyard. HoB fell upon them with 
lust and abandon. HoB had failed to discuss one tactic though, runner control. Within 
moments the first lizards when screaming in absolute terror through the maze. This brought 
no less than 9 friends charging to it's rescue. In minutes the courtyard was swarming with 
lizards all seeking blood.<br>
<br>
Zoritsa tried hard to control the mass of scaly demons. Soon she was overwhelmed with them. 
Ziff stepped in to assist her and they turned upon him. Being frail and only dressed in a 
green robe, the lizards made short work of him. He ran for the door, leaving a nasty trail 
of blood and gore but failed to make it. The lizards cut him down and instead of feasting 
on his corpse returned to the rest of HoB in hopes of killing everyone. HoB called for a 
retreat and everyone fled. Fortunately, Ziff was the only casualty.<br>
<br>
So, HoB reorganize again and gathered in the courtyard. After deciding on a runner control 
tactic Luifang began pulling lizards again. This led to about 45 minutes of mass death for 
the scaly critters. Nikar even joined in the fray and HoB was piling lizard hides deep in 
the courtyard.<br>
<br>
So, a discussion was had and it was decided that HoB would begin it's assault on the pyramid.
Luifang led the group into the maze. Twisting, turning and soon becoming lost HoB slaughtered 
lizards as they went. They may never find the pyramid, but they would forever be a thorn in 
the lizards side. Then Ziff found a tattered map of the maze and after some study, determined 
where they were. Sure enough, in moments they emerged from the maze to stand at the base of 
a giant pyramid. A pyramid protected by dozens of lizards.<br>
<br>
HoB then began a careful assault. They attacked the lizards in small groups. Like a surgical 
team they slaughtered guarding lizards and them moved further up the sloping steps of the 
pyramid. Up and up they climbed, taking more than an hour to come close to the peak. But, after 
that hour they stood high above where the air was thin, the wind whistled in their ears and the 
stench of lizard was almost naught. Luifang returned to report that they had cleared the peak, 
every lizard had charged down in the last battle and HoB was victorious. So, excited and 
flushed HoB climbed the last steps. At the top they saw a hole in the pyramid and inside was 
a long walkway leading to a dais. A dais that overlooked the giant hollow of the pyramid. This 
was a place of great beauty and much danger. While HoB observed the place they conquered and 
prepared to chisel their name in the stone as a reminder to the lizards a loud screeching 
could be heard. Ziff turned to see a giant lizard bearing down on the group...<br>
<br>
A Zealot!<br>
<br>
Quickly HoB regrouped and fell upon the lizard. Blades dug deep, spells echoed off the stone 
and after several minutes all that was left was 6 embattled friends and a hacked and bloody 
lizard corpse. HoB had defeated the Zealot.<br>
<br>
HoB decided to move a little ways down the pyramid and wait in ambush for the next set of 
lizards. They set up a small camp, buffed all of the party members and sat waiting for 
Luifang to bring back the new victims. Soon, Luifang did as she was charged.<br>
<br>
Around the corner came a Protector, a Justicator and another Zealot. Luifang ran them to a 
corner and then faked her own death. The Zealot and the Protector stood over her corpse 
licking their chops. The Justicator began wandering away, towards the HoB camp. This was 
trouble. Luifang had no idea what was happening.<br>
<br>
As Luifang stood the Justicator spied HoB and charged in full force. HoB fell upon the 
Justicator and the Zealot and the protector, hearing the battle, came tearing down the 
hall seeking vengeance. In moments the battle fell to Chaos. With HoB focused on the 
justicator the Zealot ran amok dealing heavy blows to the group. Ziff brought the 
protector under control, but the Zealot was impossible to stop. As Luifang began to 
succumb to her injuries Faan cast a greater heal on her. This so enraged the Zealot that 
it turned on Faan with all it's fury. In the blink of en eye Faan was reduced to a bloody 
heap. HoB took a moment to try and regroup but it was clear that without Faan they were 
all going to die. Retreat was called for. Then casters gated, Luifang feigned. Wildride 
ran as far as he could but he knew from the moment the run command was given he would not 
escape with his life. True to the fact, he was beaten down by a hoard of lizards.<br>
<br>
Since this disaster occurred so late in the evening it was decided that HoB would perform 
a deep corpse recovery and call it a night. Nikar and Ziff went back to the pyramid and 
helped Luifang escape. They dragged Wildride and Faan's corpse to the zone edge where a 
kind cleric named Hoevo resurrected them both. After a short spat of killing Wildride 
regained the level he had just lost and HoB broke up for the night.<br>
<br>
Barring deaths, most people received around 2 bubbles of experience. The loot was poor, 
11 plat each and nothing special or magical. Still it was a successful night over all. The 
deaths that occurred were mostly due to communication issues. One was a simple mistake, the 
other was almost impossible to have gotten around. In the end we proved to the lizards who 
was boss. Next week, we celebrate ion the Arena. Nikar and Zoritsa will be planning it. 
Come one, come all! <br>

<b>DE KIDS TABLE</B><br>
Lanorolen - bard (18)<br>
</font></p>
<p><FONT face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">
<b>RECOUNT</B><br>
Seeing that the kiddies table was woefully undermanned last night (I was the only junior 
member present), and having exhausted my supply of spider silk hat afternoon making cured 
silk armor, I decided to try my steel against the Heart Spiders of Guk, rather than facing 
the horrors of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
As I entered the dank, dripping depths of Guk, I shouted out to see if any would join me 
against the spiders. None responded but, confident in my skills, I decided to attempt the 
assault anyway.<br>
<br>
Though they outmassed me many times over, I knew that single spiders would be no match for 
my steel. I planned to sing a melancholy dirge, until most of the spiders were so 
despondent that they did not even notice what was happening about them. Then I would be 
able to pull them out of the depths one at a time, and slaughter them at my leisure.<br>
<br>
This plan worked at first, but it was not long until the spiders caught on to my 
intentions, and attacked as soon as I began to play. Outnumbered three to one, I changed 
tactics and tried to sing them to sleep, but they were having none of it. Finally, I called 
upon the power of Selo's to make my escape. It was then I discovered the true error of my 
ways. Selo's was meant to be sung in wide open spaces, and the echoes off the walls 
interfered with the magic of the song. Unable to run, I was quickly cut down.<br>
<br>
When I rematerialized at the outskirts of Freeport, I realized that I would not be able to 
safely tackle these foes alone. As I began the long journey back to Guk, I called out as I 
travelled, asking if anybody would join me on my quest. It wasn't long until a seasoned 
enchanter offered to join me. He had achieved the 20th trick, and I knew he would be able 
to hold the excess spiders at bay while slayed their bretheren.<br>
<br>
My companion and I entered Guk, and had a brief discussion of tactics. He had never been there 
before, so I described the habits of out foe. Once we had our plan clearly in place, I 
enterred the caverns in search of my prey. I was quickly rewarded by the sight of two 
spiders, just waiting to test my steel.<br>
<br>
After a few initial skirmishes, we decided to try our skills against the master of the 
lair. This beast was taller than any troll I have seen, and large enough to fill one of 
the bedrooms at my favorite inn. My gut told me that he would not be an easy opponent, but 
my companion assured me that together we would be able to take him down. Thus, is was with 
a small measure of doubt that I began the fight.<br>
<br>
Initially, things went well. However, like my fellows in Cazic Thule, I had neglected to 
plan for runners. When the giant beast ran, my companions familiar and I gave chase, but 
he made it to another chamber filled with his smaller cousins. Though we quickly laid him 
to rest, the damage had been done. We now faced 5 spiders, no the two we had expected to 
have to finish off.<br>
<br>
The familiar and I layed about ourselves, and the spiders could not seem to touch us. Very 
soon, however, I heard screams of pain from the next room, and not all of them originated 
from the arachnids. I realized that my companion had not joined us, but was trying to take 
on two of the spiders himself. Leaving the familiar to it's fate, I ran to my companions 
aid.<br>
<br>
I arrived to see him pressed up against the wall, harrassed to the point where he could 
not even get a spell off. Fortunately, the spiders prefferred the taste of bard (as so many 
beasties do), and I was able to pull them off of him. From that point on, their fate was 
sealed.<br>
<br>
I was just finishing those spiders, when more burst in upon me. Apparently the familiar had 
finally gone down, having taken one spider with him and sorely wounded another. Unfortuately, 
this left two, who summoned yet another room full of friends. I found myself badly outnumbered 
once again, but this time I had a companion, and that made all the difference. Laying about 
ourselves with song, spell, and steel, we quickly sent all five of our opponents to their 
final resting places.<br>
<br>
Exhausted but alive, we retreated a bit and sat down to tend to our wounds. Both of us were 
sorely wounded, and poisoned to boot, and the enchanter had used every last drop of his 
magical energy. <br>
<br>
I was strumming a quiet hymn while we rested, when we heard a shout from the depths -- "TRAIN!"
Somebody had gotten in over their heads, and now they were intent only upon escape. My 
companion has maintained good relations with the frogs, but due to our recent raid I seem 
to be on their most wanted list. I suspect that this scenario would have ended badly for 
both of us had my companion not acted quickly, casting invisibility upon me so that the frogs 
passed us by.<br>
<br>
The rest of the evening went fairly smoothly. Having learned from our mistakes, we were 
much more careful to dispatch the would-be runners in place. This was accomplished with a 
combination of rooting on my companion's part, and bellowing on mine. My companion also 
cut back the frequency with which he cast his most powerful damage spells, so as not to 
wear himself out so quickly.<br>
<br>
In the end, experience was minimal -- I only barely made up what I lost when I died. Loot 
was quite nice, however. In particular, I picked up over a stack of silk swatches during 
the evening. All in all, this is a location I plan to return to as time permits.<br>
