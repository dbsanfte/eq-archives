<b>RECOUNT</B><br>

<br>
First and foremost, I want to tell everyone that although the night went badly, I still 
logged off proud to be a member of this guild and of the fighting force known as HoB. We 
were faced with a lot of bad luck last night. Massive lag for many players, Link Deaths, 
pulls gone awry, bad mob combinations and just plain unlucky "rolls" lead to an uphill 
battle for the entire night. Many people commented "doesn't this seem harder than last 
week?" and indeed it was. But as a team we stood our ground. We forged ahead. We stood 
back to back, neck deep in gnolls, blood and chaos and no one flinched. No one backed 
down. I saw tanks standing, swinging and taking blows in combats with less than 20% health 
knowing full well their healer was either dead or unable to assist them. I saw healers 
chain casting onto tanks to keep them alive knowing that the Gnolls would soon turn on 
them in pure hatred and pound them to bloody ruins. I saw casters wade into combat and 
make valiant attempts to interrupt or damage an enemy even though they knew that enemy 
would soon turn on their practically naked body to pummel abuse. I saw a team that stayed 
focused, even when the chips were down. To a man no one flinched, no one lost sight of 
what their role was. We stood, fought and died as a team. The end may not have been pretty, 
but it made me no less proud.<br>
<br>
HoB rocks. Pure and simple.<br>
<br>
The story...<br>
<br>
For a solid week various members had harried the gnolls. They invaded their dank hole and 
chopped down their brethren. They sneaked into their lair and slaughtered their minions 
shouting insults and warnings. After 6 days of such abuse they mounted a miniature 
assault and, with a crew of merely 6 members, ripped the teeth from the gnoll brotherhood 
and tossed them on the floor like used gum. HoB had devastated the gnolls the previous 
week and they were keeping them on their furry heels all week with a constant battering 
of assaults.<br>
<br>
Now, 8 days after the first highly touted raid, HoB was back in full force. Excitement 
spread through the gathering throng as they prepared their assault. The goal was again to 
cut a deep wound into the gnoll lair and attempt to take out the gnoll leaders to a bloody 
grave. The tale of their exploits had spread through the land and they were ready to meet 
the challenge.<br>
<br>
10 members began the assault. HoB worked their way to the feared "double doors" with ease 
and precision. Gnolls fell with nary a scratch being dealt to the team of heroes. The 
assault on the double doors proved a bit troublesome, but HoB again prevailed and charged 
deeper into the lair.<br>
<br>
Soon they set up a defensive camp in the ante room. Here they were joined by their old friend 
Awzz. They cleared the ante room and Luifang began bringing gnolls from farther down the 
hallway. But it was soon becoming clear that this night was different. The gnolls were 
somehow stronger. With each fight HoB became weaker. HoB stayed focused, stayed solid but 
their enemy was bringing them closer and closer to death with each combat.<br>
<br>
Then the gnolls struck. While mired in a combat with 2 large gnolls 2 more charged the 
room. Chaos ensued. Spells flew, blades rang out against blades but the gnolls had a 
target of their own. In moments they had taken down both druids and reduced the HoB force 
to a very weakened state. The surprise attack by the gnolls had proven a deadly one and 
hushed whispers could be heard from the ranks.<br>
<br>
HoB regrouped and shook off the devastating attack. With renewed strength they pushed on. 
Soon they were back at the stone bridge with the waterfall. The assaults from the gnolls 
kept coming, fast and furious. It was a constant struggle for HoB to stay on top but they 
fought bravely, tooth and nail. They butchered their way across the bridge and charged the 
landing and set up a barricaded camp. They would make their stand here. It had taken them 
almost 1 1/2 hours to get here and they would likely not try to go any deeper. They all 
knew they were in as far as they could go.<br>
<br>
Luifang began retrieving gnolls from the depths attempting to reach some of the named leaders.
Suddenly, a pull went very wrong. Luifang could not shake the gnolls from her and as she 
entered the group they remained focused on killing her. Her reputation had spread through 
the dogs ranks and these ones were bound for revenge. The team fell upon the gnolls but 
not before she was destroyed by powerful magic's. Soon after the gnolls again turned on 
Lorsua and as a focused attack forces, cut him in two and left his bloody corpse to rot 
on the stone. Panic could be felt welling in the throats of HoB. But, strong to their 
name they buckled down and went to work. With anger and precision they assaulted the enemy 
and soon, bloodied, battered and nearly spent of life and magic they stood victorious.<br>
<br>
Luifang and Lorsua returned to the group. HoB decided to reorganize a bit in hopes of 
having a better balance to handle the gnolls. They cleaned their weapons and donned 
protective magic's and soon were fully prepared for the next assault.<br>
<br>
What they did not know is that the gnolls had set a deadly trap for the team.<br>
<br>
Luifang was assaulted by a Nich Val Gnoll, of about 37 seasons and two Nisch Mal Gnolls. 
One of the deadliest killers in the entire lair backed with two of the most powerful 
clerics. The trap had been sprung.<br>
<br>
HoB met the trap with the force and teamwork that has made them legends. They turned 
their backs on the deadly Val and attacked the healers knowing that if they were not 
killed, they would never prevail. The deviousness of the trap then began to reveal 
itself. The Val ran freely through the ranks of HoB like an assassin. He dealt blow 
after blow to various members, crippling them and confusing them. The clerics focused 
on healing each other and, without an effective means for interrupting them they would 
soon go from nearly dead to full health. HoB brought the clerics to deaths door 7 times 
each before the battle would be done. Each time the clerics healed themselves back to 
life while the Val ran amuck in the ranks. This trap proved deadly for the group. The Val 
slaughtered Luifang and Faan in short order. Then it went to work on the druids and tanks, 
sharing damage destruction amongst all of them. The mounting tide had to be turned. If 
the clerics could be killed HoB could still prevail. But, seeing all three of his warriors 
at below 50% health, Ziff called for a retreat. Too late. The gnolls cut down the HoB crew 
like wheat, barking howls of revenge. Zoritsa and Ziff barely escaped with their lives. The 
rest of the crew was slaughtered where they stood.<br>
<br>
HoB had been smashed by a devious gnoll trap. The most difficult and deadly one they had 
faced to date.<br>
<br>
Outside in the tunnel they regathered. With the help of a friendly cleric they were resurrected 
from the dead and, seeing as it was late, decided to call it a night. Discouraged and defeated 
they packed their treasure and prepared a cold camp for the night.<br>
<br>
Loot for the night was 12 plat 5 gold each. We have a bunch of tunics, belts, masks and other 
goodies to sell. When we do, we will split the cash for those as well. I think we also have 
enough scrolls for 2 or more of the quests to be completed. This will be a nice reward for 2 
evenings of minimal treasure.<br>
<br>
Expereince was about 1 bubble for those that only died once and got resurected. Those that 
had a more difficult night did not fare as well. On the good side, Ziff and Wildride did 
level.<br>
<br>
Again, the night ended on a bad note, but we still stood strong. We will come back to Paw 
after we all gain a level or 2 and we will finish this assault and go even deeper. The 
gnolls have not heard the last of us!
