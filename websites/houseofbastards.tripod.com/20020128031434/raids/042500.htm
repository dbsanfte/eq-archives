The sands were stained red with the blood of dervish cutthroats!<br>
<br>
A rip roaring good time was had tonight.  4 of us met and headed off to 
"Derv Camp 2".  For those of you who don't know this site spawns 6 dervish 
cutthroats at an incredible pace.  This camp is often left alone because it is 
so difficult to clear and control.  When we arrived the camp was cleared and 
there was another group who were willing to share.  Shortly after, they left 
the site.  Unfortunately, we let the spawn get ahead of us and suddenly there 
were 3 dervs waiting to kill us.  We attempted to clear the camp and while 
pulling 2 more spawned, including a caster.  We attempted to run but half the 
party was cut down as we fled across the desert.  Not to be outdone we regrouped 
and returned to the camp.  For the next 2 1/2 hours we slaughtered dervs.  It 
was a bit hairy at times and Ziff had some trouble with his new charm spell, 
but we managed to stay alive for the entire time.  It was decided that with a 
5th member we could have been a little safer, but with 4 we were rarely in 
serious danger.<br>
<br>
The night was a rousing success for money and experience as well.  We looted 13 
or more derv rings.  (I think there is a quest for these now), 7.2 platinum each 
and netted around 2.5 bubbles of experience for everyone.  No one leveled but 
most are now within 1 bubble of doing so.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also important news:  Zoft's guild has asked if we, as a group, would like to join.
I am not positive we will be able to because they normally restrict guild members 
to 20th level but it has been suggested to me by several guild members.  I need to 
know what people think about this idea.<br>
<br>
The Guild is Oracle of Virtue. It is a small guild largely high level characters.  
(We have 5-6 50+) It is a very friendly and helpful guild, but they will not give 
away items.  They will help us get them, as long as they are not way out of our 
reach.  (I.e. no 1000 platinum headgear will be "given" away to low level 
characters.)<br>
<br>
There are a number of guild members who have other lower level characters we could 
group with. We would also potentially be able to recruit new members to the guild 
if we start grouping with others and find they are worthy.<br>
<br>
There is no monthly "fee" or any other requirements the guild places on people.  No 
required guild meeting attendance etc.<br>
<br>
Basically, I see this as a way for us to communicate better, have consistent larger 
groups and have assistance getting some of those hard earned quest items.<br>
