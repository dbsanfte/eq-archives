<b>What is HoB?</B><br>
HoB is a small splinter group of characters, formerly members of the guild Oracle of
Virtue while on the Cazic-Thule server and now members of the guild Dusk Eternal on the 
Ayonae Ro server.  HoB was originally formed as a way for some
long time friends to gather together and game every week.  The fun soon
caused this group to grow into a larger group of new friends.  Through the
months the roster has changed a bit, but the core players remain.  HoB has
grown from a small group of friends exploring Norrath to a large group of
organized, highly effective comrades who perform weekly raids on Norrath's
dungeons and wildernesses.  OoV occasionally sent HoB on dangerous and
exciting missions as well.  As a team we work to take on the challenges the
wilds of Norrath have to offer.  We fight foes many our level would cower
from.  We avoid most spoiler sights, generally remain "untwinked" and strive
to live closer to Verrants "vision" of EQ by crawling dungeons, cleansing
outdoor areas and playing for fun more than profit.  The result is immense
fun, some great loot, fantastic experience and stories galore!<br>
<br>
<b>How can I join HoB?</B><br>
Ziff Harbinger is generally the organizer of these
raids and all information regarding upcoming ones can be found here or on the OoV
site.  If you care to join our weekly raids, the invitation is open to
everyone, as long as your levels are not too far away from ours.  If we find
you fighting in our ranks often enough and work well with the team, we may
extend an invitation for you to permanently join the ranks of our elite
fighting force and wear the HoB badge with honor.<br>
<br>
<b>What does HoB stand for?</B><br>
House of Bastards.  We know, it may offend
some, so we use the initials instead of the full name.  Be warned, this
site does contain liberal use of the word Bastard though.  However, we do
hope you can see the humor in the name.  We are a group of fatherless
individuals who lack guidance.  We are an unruly bunch who do tend to wander
off, do our own thing and have ruined many a Goblins day.  But alas, some
will be offended by the liberal use of the word.  So, if you find you are
one of those individuals, please proceed no further.  One thing we can
promise though.  We do make an effort to avoid any other offensive language
on this site.  So, you need not worry that other words considered far more
profane are in use here.  We may be bastards, but we are not uncouth.  Well,
except for maybe Fibben...<br>
