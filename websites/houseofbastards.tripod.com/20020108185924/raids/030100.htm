Frozen Death<br>
<br>
The raiding party was smaller than expected last night.  Raaj, Luifang and Fibben 
(all scheduled to appear) were no where to be found.  But a brave party of four 
assaulted the plains of Everfrost with rousing success.  There were a few bad 
incidents.  We were overrun by mountaineers and shaman at one point and when it 
came time to run, many went in the wrong direction.  Well, in the confusion I 
don't think anyone went in the right direction at first.<br>
<br>
There was also a nasty incident where Faan sat to close to a spawn point for an 
Icy Orc.  (Level 20-23 MOB) and when it appeared it killed Faan in 2 or 3 blows.  
But all in all it was a successful learning experience.  We have proven that we 
can stand toe to toe with the beasts of the Everfrost plains and successfully 
walk away from it.  With a full party we would have been very devastating.  We 
gained between 1 and 2 bubbles of exp and made 1.5 plat each.  Not a great night 
for either category but again, a solid learning experience that brought confidence 
to the troops.
