<b>RECOUNT</b><br>
by Ziff<br>
<br>
Dusk Eternal Gathered at the entrance to Cazic Thule. There is nothing quite like the <br>
stench of lizard. It is a dry, foul small and it permeated our nostrils. After the dank <br>
rotting stink of Guk, this was a welcomed change, but not a pleasant one.<br>
<br>
So, in preparation for the night we split into two groups, HoB and "the kids table". HoB <br>
assembled in the yard as many lizards stared at them in confusion. Rumors had spread of '<br>
HoB's power and destruction and none dared assault the group as they gathered. Lizards <br>
are a cowardly bunch and alone they felt they would fare better to stand and hiss than <br>
hairy the group.<br>
<br>
So, HoB dove into the temple of Cazic Thule, the god of Fear. After a short jaunt they <br>
arrived at the lower throne room. They cleared the dust from a corner, set the torches <br>
alight and sent Wildride into the temple to fetch a few scaly victims.<br>
<br>
In minutes HoB was neck deep in angry lizards. Since the full force of HoB had not <br>
assembled yet, it was a harried battle to start with, but one HoB came out on top of. <br>
Soon Faan arrived and the tactics changed. Luppis would be luring out the lizards. <br>
Wildride would be selecting targets for the group and the rust of us would be performing <br>
our group magic.<br>
<br>
Everything started off well until Tinea accidentally sent her pet in a little early. <br>
Wildride still had something deep in the temple targeted and when she told her pet at <br>
assist Wildride her pet charged off into the depths of the temple. In moments it was dead <br>
and the new adversaries burst from the throne room and made a bee line for Tinea. Ziff <br>
struggled to get the new adversaries under control, but could not provide help fast <br>
enough. Immersed in combat as it was, the group had no way to help her and she was hewn <br>
down in moments. HoB rallied around Tinea's new fallen corpse and took down the onslaught, <br>
but mourned the loss of their friend.<br>
<br>
From that moment on the team worked virtually flawlessly. Lizards of 30 or more years<br>
were lined up and mowed down like fields of wheat. Some points were hairy when five or 6 <br>
lizards would join the fray, but HoB proved to be their match every time. With new macros <br>
programmed the communications were tight and clean.<br>
<br>
After some time Nikar arrived to assist the group. After a few moments of getting him <br>
integrated into the group structure and tactics for the evening, Luppis ran into the <br>
temple to get more lizards. Soon he was bringing out a temple leader. The Tae Ew Templer <br>
came charging out with 4 of his minions. His life was worth no more than any other lizard <br>
and HoB hacked him down like the rest. No worshiper of Cazic Thule would survive the HoB <br>
onslaught, no matter how strong. Upon his scaly hide was found a cloak which was awarded <br>
to Garall for bravery in battle. Garall, in keeping with the true Paladin spirit <br>
immediately gave it up to Faan and Faan now wears it proudly.<br>
<br>
As the night wore on the and sun began to set a cry was heard from deep in the temple. <br>
The sounds of battle could be heard and the yells of pain and fear. Someone else was in <br>
the temple and was in trouble. HoB was in the midst of a battle and could not provide <br>
assistance. However, injured and staggering, one of the other party members came running <br>
to the group and then immediately gated out to safety. This caused the entire onslaught <br>
of lizards they were running from to spot HoB and the battle we were engaging with their <br>
comrades. This lead to 4 or more high powered lizards assaulting the group.<br>
<br>
Ziff struggled to control the band and quickly found he could not. They were too strong. <br>
He attempted to control the weaker ones but was under furious assault by the enraged <br>
stronger wizards. Faan and Luppis were madly healing Ziff but to no avail. He fell to the <br>
blade of a Zealot. Within moments the zealot and friends turned on Luppis and Nikar. <br>
Wildride shouted for the group to run but Nikar and Luppis were cut down before they <br>
could reach the door.<br>
<br>
As it was getting late, the group decided to gather their bodies, collect their loot and <br>
call it a night. As we were wrapping up from the evening a small lizard attacked the <br>
group and somehow, Faan learned enough from killing this one lizard to gain another level.<br>
We all rejoiced as this meant Faan would soon have access to greater healing. A new and <br>
powerful spell healing spell.<br>
<br>
Over all it was a good night for the HoB crew. We gained between 1 1/2 and 2 bubbles of <br>
experience and about 17 plat each. The loot was not incredibly great, but the cloak was a <br>
nice bonus. Still, it was one of our most productive experience nights in a while and we <br>
believe we have found a location where we can set up two teams t work independently, but <br>
still help each other out. Since we also did not get much of the quest loot we were <br>
seeking, I suspect we will be returning next week to the depths of Cazic Thule. We are <br>
not afraid Lizards.<br>
