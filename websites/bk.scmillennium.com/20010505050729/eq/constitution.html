   &nbsp;Order Constitution



</FONT>
<HR>
			<DIV class="maintext"><B>Mission Statement of the Order</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Order of the Blood Knights is a fraternocracy,
in which unity and brotherhood are encouraged as to ensure better enjoyment
(and survival) of our adventures in the lands of Norrath. We shall do all
that is in our power to uphold high standards of enjoyment and friendliness
on the Rodcet Nife server, and increase the sense of community tying its
users. We hold honor, valor and sacrifice as the highest virtues, and show
of these virtues will be greatly rewarded. We do not condone mindless killing
of innocents, and will do everything in our power to promote good relations
between users of this role-playing world.
<P><B>Donations</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guild members are encouraged to donate equipment,
either unfitting to their characters or not advantageous enough, to the
guild leaders for redistribution to weaker, newer members and characters.
Donation of equipment is a good showing of your sense of sacrifice, and
is thus highly regarded.
<P><B>Policy On Behavior</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If ever a complaint is received by an outsider towards
one of our members for what can be considered anti-social behavior (insults,
racism, other harmful actions made out of character), the Council will
review the case and the afflicted member can be convicted and stricken
of all his honors. If ever that member is once again accused and convicted
of such behavior, he will be reduced to the rank of apprentice and will
have to go through apprenticehood all over again. If a third complaint
is proven true, then the member in question is automatically banned from
the Order and considered an outcast by all of our allies of Rodcet Nife.
<P><B>Joining the Order</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To become a member of our Order, you must first file
an application (by going through the form on our site). Once your application
has been filed, you will be considered as an apprentice. Apprentices have
do not have the right to vote and exist only in hope to become a full ranked
knight. An apprentice must choose a master from the current knight roll
which will accompany and evaluate him through his apprenticehood. After
a minimum of two weeks of &quot;probation&quot;, the master can report to the Council
and ask that his apprentice be made a full ranked knight. Once accepted
by a majority vote of the council, the apprentice becomes a knight with
all the privileges and responsibilities that it carries. If the Council
refuses to make you knight, you can always ask at a later time. You may
have only been refused because the Council thought that you had not showed
enough implication yet. Don't worry. You can also change masters if your
current one has a conflicting schedule and cannot accompany and evaluate
you. Since the whole knight roll is responsible for your promotion, it
is a good idea to get to know and show your virtue to as many of our members
as possible. Uphold the virtues, and you will be rewarded.
<P><B>The Council</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once a week, at a set time and location, every member
of the Order (be them knight or apprentice) must gather, discuss guild
issues and vote on policies. Every knight holds one vote, and only the
leader can veto a majority vote (which should only happen when the vote
is almost evenly split and the issue could create problems for the Order).
Apprentices cannot vote, but they can observe and discuss issues freely.
Council attendance is considered to be the most important involvement and
participation is one of the critical conditions to becoming a knight. The
Council holds every power within the Order, although it cannot go outside
of the constitution.
<P><B>The Constitution</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This document is the core of the Order. It contains
every policy, every law that make our guild. It can be modified by a majority
vote of the Council, but cannot be arbitrarily modified by the leader.
If a member goes outside of our constitution, or plainly violates it, then
severe sanctions will be applied, from a simple demotion of honors, to
a complete ban. The constitution is what defines us and binds us together.
<P><B>Leadership</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The leader of the Order is Redcloak. He handles guild
internal and external affairs. He does not hold any power over other knights
except for his Council veto and the ability to award knights with Honors.
If, at a latter time, the internal and external affairs of the guild become
too time-consuming solely for the leader, then the Council will elect a
lieutenant who will answer directly to the leader and assist him with guild
affairs. There should not be more than one lieutenant for every ten knights
in the order at any given time. Being a lieutenant is a symbol of devotion
and sacrifice. A lieutenant is no more than a manager helping the leader,
he does not hold additional power over other knights.
<P><B>Tithing</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Members must pay, as often as possible, an undefined
amount of money to the leader or a lieutenant. Although being a voluntary
measure, all knights who consider themselves honorful should show sacrifice
and donate their ownings for the better of the guild. Giving large amounts
of money (proportional to your level and money gathering power) will result
in high regards and possible award of honors. Tithes are used to purchase
replace equipment for members, fund special events and, in the future,
purchase real estate.
<P><B>Honors</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no ranks within the Order. Every knight
is equal to every other knight. Instead, knights can be awarded honors.
And honor can be awarded for many deeds. Completing a guild quest can earn
you an honor. Being helpful to helpless strangers can award you an honor.
Doing something which results in a large amount of good public attention
to our guild can reward you with an honor. Donating large sums in money,
equipment or time can result in a honor. The process for receiving an honor
is simple; a knight other than you will submit a demand for award of honor
to the Council, and a majority vote will be required. If the vote passes,
you will be given your honor before all members and used as an example
of devotion and involvement. After that, your honor will be recorded by
the Loremaster and inscribed into our webpage. If, in the future, you commit
an act that goes against the constitution, you can lose an honor (being
awarded a &quot;dishonor&quot;) that will also be recorded by the Loremaster. Going
against the constitution is automatic and does not require a majority vote,
it must simply be acted on by the leader or lieutenant.
<P><B>Involvement</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commitment of time is the most important aspect of
being a Blood Knight. If you can only be online two or three hours every
week, forget about being a part of us. We hold high standards and require
that everyone be deeply involved in guild affairs. Missing a Council is
not a tragedy (as long as it is justified), but missing several Councils
will result in removal and ban, unless you yourself come forward and resign.
<P><B>What we strive to achieve</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EverQuest is role-playing game, and thus we encourage
role-playing. It is not required for you to speak in foreign tongues, but
you should at any given time try to act in character. Talking about the
latest Baseball scores while fighting orcs is not a very good idea. Good
role-playing will be rewarded by having your stories recorded and published
on the website. Exemplary role-playing could result in the awarding of an
honor.
<P><B>Racial Issue</B>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any race and any class can become a Blood Knight,
as long as you choose to pledge loyalty to your brothers and not to your
race. Because we are a fraternocracy, no racial disputes will be tolerated
within the Order (okay so we may be a little lax on that, racial disputes
are good role-playing fun), and our members are encouraged to help <B>solve</B> racial disputes outside of the guild.</P>
