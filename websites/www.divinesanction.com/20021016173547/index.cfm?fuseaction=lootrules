				<B><U>Divine Sanction Raid and Loot Rules</B></U> <BR>
<BR>
-<B><I>Group Leaders</B></I> will be designated or will designate a group member as <B><I>Master Looters</B></I> for each group in the raid. <B>NO ONE</B> but the Master Looters will loot <B>ANYTHING</B>. <BR>
<BR>
-<B><I>Loot Masters</B></I> will have the <B><I>Split Loot</B></I> option <B>OFF</B> at all times. <BR>
<BR>
-<B><I>Loot Masters</B></I> will announce any <B><I>No Drop</B></I> items in <B><I>raid chat</B></I>. These items will be rolled upon immediately unless it will interfere with the raid progress. In the event that the <B><I>No Drop</B></I> item was <B><I>Called Loot</B></I> the designated person will loot the item at that time. <BR>
<BR>
-If an item is not <B><I>Called Loot</B></I> and is <B>NEEDED</B> by a guild member's character that is in attendance (or by multiple members in attendance) those in <B>NEED</B> would roll on the item first. <BR>
<BR>
-<B><I>Called Loot</B></I> and <B><I>NBG/CAWU</B></I> rolls are limited to <B>Divine Sanction members</B> only; no <B>Guests</B> may roll on them. <BR>
<BR>
-If no Divine Sanction member’s character that is in attendance <B>NEEDS</B> the item it will go to an <B><I>Open Roll</B></I> for all attendees including Guests. <BR>
<BR>
-It is up to the members to know ahead of time what <B><I>No Drop</B></I> items they can use from the raid zone; this includes any items needed for quests that character may be doing. Time will <B>NOT</B> be spent in explaining what an item is for on the raid...if <BR>
it is that important to you then you will have known that prior to the raid. <BR>
<BR>
-There will be <B><I>'Loot Times'</B></I> designated during the raid when the loot gained to that point would be split/rolled upon. If a raid member leaves prior to one of these appointed times the raid will <B>NOT</B> be put on hold to split the loot at that time. <BR>
<BR>
-Non-guild members <B>CAN/WILL</B> be allowed to attend guild raids. <B>HOWEVER</B>, when it comes time for <B><I>Open Roll</B></I> loot to be rolled on the guild will roll <B><I>/Random 103-333</B></I> and the non-members will roll <B><I>/Random 3-333</B></I>. This applies to non-guilded alts of members as well. <BR>
<BR>
-A <B><I>sign-up sheet</B></I> will be available for each raid for <B><I>CALLED LOOT</B></I> items. These items can be equipment upgrades for the character in attendance or quest pieces for quests the character in attendance is doing. <B>Examples:</B> Hilt from Mistmoore. If more than 1 Paladin signs up for it then it will be designated in a <B><I>standard loot roll</B></I> beforehand as to who receives the first hilt and so on. Guests, including non-guilded alts of members can not sign up for loot. <BR>
<BR>
-Raid attendees who win an <B><I>Open Roll</B></I> may not roll on any other item until each member of the raid has won an item. After all attendees (DS Members <U>and</U> Guests) have won an item the <B><I>roll cycle</B></I> begins again. <BR>
<BR>
-Loot will be rolled upon by category <B><I>(priest/melee/hybrid/caster/etc.)</B></I>. The raid member must declare their category at the beginning of the raid by playing the character in that category <B>for at least 1.5 hours</B> of the raid's duration. <B>Only</B> the character they play <BR>
at the beginning of the raid will be eligible for rolls. This prevents confusion if the member changes characters in the middle of the raid. <BR>
<BR>
-<B>ALL</B> jewels looted on <B>ANY</B> guild raid will go either to the <B>Cleric(s)</B> in attendance to cover the cost of <B><I>spell components</B></I> or into the <B><I>guild bank</B></I> to cover the expense of spell components on future raids. <BR>
<BR>
-The <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> may designate a person(s) to loot items such as <B><I>Words, Pages and Runes</B></I> to be put in the <B><I>guild bank</B></I> for our <B>Spell Researcher's</B> needs. A special <B><I>Gem looter</B></I> may also be designated. <BR>
<BR>
-In zones where a <B>coffin</B> is required it is the responsibility of each raid attendee to purchase and bring their own. It will be noted on the <B><I>Raid Form</B></I> if this is required. <BR>
<BR>
-It is the responsibility of each raid attendee to arrive on time and prepared (food and drink, spell components, empty backpacks, etc.). The raid will <B>NOT</B> be put on hold to go and fetch a late member or to escort one who is leaving early out of the zone and mana will not be wasted to summon food or drink, etc. for a member who has come unprepared. <BR>
<BR>
-If you want to bring a <B>guest</B> to a guild raid you must get permission from the <B><I>Raid</B></I> <B><I>Leader</B></I> and the <B>guest</B> must be familiar with and agree to the raid and loot rules. If a <BR>
<B>guest</B> breaks the rules on a raid they can/will be asked to leave the raid. Depending on the severity of the offence they may be banned from future guild raids. <BR>
