<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Earning Points</P>
</B></U>
<P>&#9;There are many ways to earn raid points. Raid points can only be earned on <B><I>guild-sponsored events and raids</B></I>. Any member may hold an event or raid and have it sponsored by the guild providing it meets the requirements of organization, rules and is deemed a feasible endeavor. Each <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> is responsible for keeping track of the points earned and spent on the raid by each <B><I>attendee</B></I> and to report those points via the <B><I>Post Raid Form</B></I>. Points will be awarded <B>PER ACCOUNT</B> not per character on the account.</P>

<B><P>Attendance Points:</B> 5 points will be awarded to each member for every <B>1-hour</B> they spend in attendance at the raid. <B>There will be a stated start and finish time for raids</B> and anyone who wishes to continue longer does so of their own choice and will not ear additional raid points.</P>

<P>An additional 5 points will be awarded to those attending the raid from the set starting time to the set ending time. </P>

<B><P>Hosting Points:</B> <B><I>Raid Hosts</B></I> will receive 5 points, this is in recognition of the time and effort that goes into planning the event or raid for his/her fellow guildmates to enjoy.</P>

<B><I><P>**Points will also be earned for guild-sponsored Scavenger Hunts, Fishing Derbies, Archery Contests, etc. Points will not be awarded for attending Guild Meetings.</P>
</B></I>
<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Spending Points</P>
</B></U>
<P>Points can be spent on raids in the following ways:</P>

<B><P>Called Loot:</B> <B><I>Called loot</B></I> is the<B><I> No Drop or Rare Drop</B></I> items in the zone being raided. There will be a <B><I>Sign Up Sheet</B></I> posted for each raid, if you wish to reserve rights to an item you sign up ahead of time. In the event that more than 1 person signs up for an item those who signed up for the same item will roll <B><I>/random 3 333</B></I> prior to the raid actually starting. In this manner an order will be decided as to who gets the first drop of that loot and who gets each successive drop if it drops more than once. If there is a person who doesn’t get the drop they signed up for on that raid they will automatically be moved <B>in the same order</B> (if more than 1 person misses out on the drop) to the next raid to that zone. If the member(s) who missed the drop on the first raid are not in attendance on the next raid to that zone the list is reset and they can re-sign up at a future raid. <B>Only Divine</B> <B>Sanction members can sign up for loot</B>. Upon receiving the loot that you signed up for you will have <B><I>15 points</B></I> removed from your <B><I>raid points account</B></I>.</P>

<B><P>NBG/CAWU Loot:</B> This is <B><I>Need Before Greed/Can And Will Use</B></I> gear that was not signed up for. The criteria for being allowed to roll on this loot is as follows. It <B>must</B> be an upgrade of equipment that will be used by and for the character whom you declared for at the start of the raid by playing for a significant portion of the raid (see Raid and Loot Rules for further clarification). <B>You may not roll for an alt that is not in attendance</B>. This loot is <B>not</B> to be rolled on to be sold for profit. The roll will be <B><I>/Random 3 333</B></I> and may only be rolled on by <B><I>Divine Sanction members</B></I>. Upon winning a <B><I>NBG/CAWU</B></I> roll item you will have <B><I>10 points</B></I> removed from your <B><I>raid points account</B></I>.</P>

<B><P>Open Loot:</B> This is any item that was neither signed up for <B><I>(Called Loot)</B></I> or a <B><I>CAWU</B></I> item for a <B><I>Divine Sanction member</B></I>. <B>All</B> raid attendees may roll on this loot including <B><I>Guests</B></I>. <B><I>Divine Sanction members</B></I> will roll <B><I>/Random 103 333</B></I> and <B><I>Guests</B></I> will roll <B><I>/Random 3 333</B></I>, membership does have its privileges. The <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> will have an additional roll on these items for the <B><I>Guild Bank</B></I>. <B>No raid points are spent on Open Loot rolls.</P>
</B>
<B><P>Other Loot:</B> As outlined in the <B><I>Raid and Loot Rules</B></I> all <B>Gems</B> looted will be given to casters such as the <B>Clerics</B> who’s <B><I>spell components</B></I> can be quite costly. <B>Words, Pages and Runes </B>may be looted for the <B><I>Guild Bank</B></I> as well by a designated looter. </P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Raid Points and Epics</P>
</B></U>
<P>It will be each member’s responsibility to keep their <B><I>Epic Tracker</B></I> (coming soon) up to date. This will tell us who has completed their <B><I>Epic</B></I> to what degree. <B><I>Epic pieces</B></I> will come under a sub-heading of <B><I>Called Loot</B></I> in some cases. An Example of this is the Hilt from Xicotl in Castle Mistmoore, which it is possible to obtain more than once within a single raid. In this case, upon receiving the <B><I>Epic Piece</B></I>, <B><I>15 points</B></I> will be removed from your <B><I>raid points account</B></I>. In other cases it is a <B>single encounter</B> due to the mob’s spawn time. An example of this is Sir Lucan D’Lere of West Freeport who has a 12-hour spawn cycle. In a case such as this, the first thing considered will be which member <B>IN ATTENDANCE</B> has completed the steps of their <B><I>Epic</B></I> to that point, in the event of 2 or more members in attendance and equally far along in their <B><I>Epic completion</B></I> they will roll <B><I>/Random 3 333</B></I> to decide who will receive the <B><I>Epic Piece</B></I>. As with <B><I>Called Loot</B></I> the others will move to the top of the list for the next raid(s) in the order they rolled. If they are not able to attend the next raid they will be removed from the order and can re-roll at the next raid they are able to attend for that piece. Upon receiving an <B><I>Epic Piece</B></I> from a single encounter raid <B><I>25 points</B></I> will be removed from your <B><I>raid point account</B></I>.</P>

<P>This system may seem unfair to <B>Suzy</B> who is unable to attend as many <B><I>raids/events</B></I> as <B>Tommy</B>, but if <B>Tommy</B> is spending all his <B><I>raid points</B></I> on rolls at the raids he attends and <B>Suzy</B> saves hers up for something she really wants when it comes time to roll on that item or get that <B><I>Epic piece</B></I> <B>Tommy</B> may not have the <B><I>raid points</B></I> to be able to afford it.</P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Losing Raid Points</P>
</B></U>
<B><I><P>Raid points</B></I> may be taken from a member’s account as a punishment for breaking the <B><I>Guild Rules</B></I> if so decreed by the <B><I>Senate</B></I> after a fair trial. The amount of points removed will be dependent upon the severity of the case.</P>

<B><U><P ALIGN="CENTER">Raid Leader Responsibilities</P>
</B></U>
<P>It is the responsibility of the <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> to know, at the beginning of the raid, who has <B><I>Called</B></I> which loot and to have the appropriate rolls performed and noted. The <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> should have a printout of the <B>current raid points</B> as they stand directly prior to the raid and add the points earned on the raid to ensure that members have the points to roll with. It is the responsibility of the <B><I>Raid Leader</B></I> or <B><I>Host</B></I> to keep track of the points <B>earned and spent</B> during his/her raid/event and to note this on the <B><I>Post Raid Form</B></I> after the raid.</P>
