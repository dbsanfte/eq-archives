December, 2002<br>
Clawdio, Editor<br>
<br><br>
For those of you who are new to the guild, this is a monthly mail out that can also be viewed under the Newsletter link on the website at 
www.divinesanction.com; Any member may submit an article, list items they have for sale or want in the classifieds, etc. Until we get out website 
submissions in place for your convenience, all Newsletter submissions should be e-mailed to Lassra at hopespryngs@hotmail.com. The deadline for 
newsletter submissions is the 3rd of each month, this is to enable us to have it formatted and mailed out by the 5th of each month. I encourage 
you all to take advantage of this feature and look forward to receiving your submissions.
<br><br>
State of the Guild
<br><br>
After nine months in existence, the guild now consists of 62 main characters and 121 alternates, for a total membership of 183.  However, with 
the results of November&#8217;s mandatory membership survey, the number of mains is still subject to revision. Of the more than 70 members 
listed as mains at the beginning of last month, only 35 chose to respond to the survey.  As noted, this survey was mandatory, not optional, and 
was intended not only to gather information on the desires of our membership, but also to determine which of our members were actually willing to 
participate as members.  As it turns out, many of those who failed to respond were also those who never seemed to be around 
anyway&#8230;who did not visit the website, did not attend raids&#8230;basically, were not contributors to anything other than padding out our 
membership list.  As we are able to confirm their lack of interest in participating, we are culling these individuals from the membership.  The result 
eventually will be a membership list that more accurately reflects the real makeup of the guild: those who proudly wear their DS tag and work with 
their fellows as teammates.
<br><br>
Website
<br><br>
Most of the intended regular features of the website are now functioning, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our webmaster, Reganna. As 
always, though, check your own spellings and if you are applying an alt, make sure you enter the race, class and level properly&#8230;or your 
level 16 dwarf rogue will be identified as a level 0 barbarian bard!  
<br><br>
Several alts are still shown on our to be tagged list.  If one of these is yours, please contact an officer for tagging when you are in game: Talf, 
Talfarin, Zsaz, Porteus, Gnahrl
<br><br>
In addition, the following main is still on the to be tagged list&#8230;if you see him in-game, remind him to contact an officer if he still wishes to 
be tagged by Divine Sanction: Pallydun.
<br><br>

Legions
<br><br>
Some Legion based activity has now begun, particularly with Legion 4, as members step forward to take leadership roles.  If you have a project or 
a raid in mind, you can call on members of your legion to help or join in.   The Legions are arranged such that members of each can always 
successfully join with their fellow legionaries and gain experience.
<br><br>
New Citizens
<br><br>
To our new friends, welcome!  The following new mains have joined our ranks in the month of November:
<br><br>
Kenitz (return to DS after a short absence), Sorori, and Meeyows.
<br><br>
Plus, we have the following new alts among us:
<br><br>
Lorem, Geapper, Tieurown, Jakovitz, and Snarf.
<br><br>
Departures
<br><br>
Paque, Iadoreme, Stonehart, Raisen and Gairo have removed their characters from the Guild roster.  Alts McKor, Tomarr, and Shadowsteeth have 
also been dropped.
<br><br>
Events
<br><br>
Fishing Derby
<br><br>
Liddle sponsored a fishing derby in Oasis, which was well attended by a variety of mains and alts.  Prizes for most fish and for most 
&#8220;junk&#8221; fished out of the oasis lake consisted of a variety of gnome-crafted fireworks.  All in all, a great fun event.
<br><br>

DS Corner
<br><br>
Arganon hosted a &#8220;return to DS corner&#8221; to begin the month.  For those of you unfamiliar with this, DS corner is the nickname we 
selected for the southwest corner of the Overthere, where we have had very successful guild experience grinding groups on several occasions.  
This gathering was no exception; it is possible (proven once again) for characters, especially those in mid-30&#8217;s range, to gain a full level in 
an evening.
<br><br>
Swap Meet
<br><br>
Thanks to all who came out to the old bank in G'fay and did the 'social hour or so' I hope you all had as much fun as I did. I was able to clear out 
a few things, and find new homes for some other stuff by transfering to my alts. Thanks so much for your support.
Attending tonight were Kenitz/Jakovitz; Tazra/Golddi; Clawdio/Mmipp/Tomarr; Fueien/Geapper/Llian; Snarf; Meowzah; Stron/Tieurown and my 
family was there as well, Aemladara/Faenie /Uanila and myself.
<br><br>
If I have overlooked anyone please forgive me and mark it to the lateness of the hour.
<br><br>
I always have fun in the presence of my DS family
<br><br>
Glenali<br><br>
Round 2<br>
The experience in OT was enough fun that we decided to do it yet again, once more claiming ownership of DS corner and laying general waste to 
the rhinos, cockatrices, sabertooths and other critters who sacrificed themselves on the altars of Divine Sanction.
<br><br>
Hopper Hunt
<br><br>
Velvett called for a raid on the rockhoppers of Dawnshroud Peaks, and DS answered.  By the end of the evening we had scored some 10 flawless 
and 2 superb hopper hides, with no major overpulls and no deaths.  A success by any standard.
