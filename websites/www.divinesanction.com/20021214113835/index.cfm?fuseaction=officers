<LI>Each Officer has a role to fill in the Guild’s structure and you are expected to do so. In the event that real life issues prevent you from serving fully for a time please notify the Guild Leader so that arrangements can be made to share your duties among the other Officers until you are able to serve again fully.</LI>

<LI>Officer’s Meetings will be held on a regular basis to discuss issues and ideas, you are expected to attempt to attend as many of these as you can.

<LI>Only the registered owner of the account may play the Officer’s character(s). This is Verant’s policy for one and for another the Members expect to encounter the same personality every time they speak to that Officer.

Violators will have their Officer status suspended for a first offence and removed for a repeated offence.</LI>
