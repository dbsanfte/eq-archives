<br> February, 2003
<br> Clawdio, Editor
<br>
<br> For those of you who are new to the guild, this is a monthly mail out that
can also be viewed under the Newsletter link on the website at
www.divinesanction.com; Any member may submit an article, list items they
have for sale or want in the classifieds, etc. Until we get out website
submissions in place for your convenience, all Newsletter submissions should
be e-mailed to Clawdio at gplice@ameritech.net. The deadline for newsletter
submissions is the 3rd of each month, this is to enable us to have it
formatted and mailed out by the 5th of each month. We encourage you all to
take advantage of this feature and look forward to receiving your
submissions.
<br>
<br> State of the Guild
<br>
<br> Our guild has now been in existence for 11 months.  As of this writing, we
have 59 characters listed as &#8220;Mains&#8221;, and 105 alts, for a total
membership if 164.  January saw several departures from the guild, but we
wish the membership to be assured that the guild remains in good health.  We
now have more members in Legion 4 than ever before, and with some now
reaching 55+, we have implemented a new Legion 5.  There has been a
significant increase in the number and attendance of planned events, and
Stron has volunteered to take on the job of pushing forward full
implementation of the Legion System.  Be proud of your Divine Sanction tag.
Great times are ahead!
<br>
<br> Website
<br>
<br>
<br>  As always, though, check your own spellings and if you are applying an
alt, make sure you enter the race, class and level properly&#8230;or your
level 16 dwarf rogue will be identified as a level 0 barbarian bard!  Also,
please take the time to update your characters&#8217; level status, as this
automatically moves people to the correct Legions for planning purposes.
<br>
<br> Several alts are still shown on our to be tagged list.  If one of these is
yours, please contact an officer for tagging when you are in-game:  Talf,
Talfarin, Zsaz, Porteus, Rayeve, Lexatrillis, and Menelnar.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> Legions
<br>
<br> Stron has agreed to take on the role of Legion organizer.  If you have a
project or a raid in mind, you can call on members of your legion to help or
join in.   The Legions are arranged such that members of each can always
successfully join with their fellow legionaries and gain experience.
<br>
<br> New Citizens
<br>
<br> To our new friends, welcome!  The following new mains have joined our
ranks in the month of November:
<br>
<br> Sekai
<br>
<br> Plus, we have the following new alts among us:
<br>
<br> Cairhien, Windd, Fueier, Bozley, Myskitts, Soff, and Gnahrl
<br> Departures
<br>
<br> Kenitz, citing health concerns, chose to resign his officership and leave
the guild, along with his various alts.  Bakamur  and Nuanthees also chose
to end their membership, together with all their many alts.  We wish them
all the best, and still consider them to be friends of Divine Sanction
wherever their gaming paths take them.
<br>
<br> Reganna, who continues her outstanding work on the website, has resigned
her position as Consul, while remaining a regular member of the guild.   She
has also changed her designated Main to Velvett.
<br>
<br> Events
<br>
<br> Carnage in Karnor&#8217;s Castle
<br>
<br> The event was cut short by an hour when the servers all came down. I
granted full-event credit to those that were present at the start of the
raid and stayed until the server outage notice came.
<br>
<br>
<br> Raid Points:
<br> Fueien (Rheise) 15 + 5 (full event) + 5 (leader)
<br> Kenitz 15 + 5 (full event)
<br> Meowzah 15 + 5
<br> Glenali 15 + 5
<br> Tazra (Razadazel) 15 + 5 - 10 (NBG/CAWU Jarsath Scale Gauntlets) - 10
(NBG/CAWU Greyish Bone Chips) - 10 (NBG/CAWU Jarsath Scale Wrist Guards)
<br> Reganna (Velvett) 15 + 5
<br> Celvalious 15 + 5
<br> Hord 15 + 5
<br> Bruegor 15 + 5
<br> Sekai 15 + 5
<br> Clawdio 10
<br> Harhar 10
<br> Keeyah 5
<br> Nuanthees 5
<br> Fueien
<br>
<br> Continued Carnage in Karnage Castle
<br>
<br> The first raid on KC went so well that we decided to do it again.  Took
over the Hand room, got some more xp, and generally had a great time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> Special Thanks To:
<br>
<br> I would like to offer special thanks first of all to the officers who have
worked very hard over this past month to bring you events, brainstorm new
ideas for guild improvement, and agreeing to take on tasks like Legion
implementation. Thank you to Reganna for continuing to operate the website
for us all and for the new improvements and additions to it. I would also
like to issue a huge thank you to the members who kept level heads amidst
the turmoil of the past month instead of fanning flames, this is why we are
a family and not just another guild.
