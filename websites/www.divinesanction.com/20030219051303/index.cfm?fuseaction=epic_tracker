Scout Husman asks you for 6 people of about his level. To wipe out a grimling camp nearby. 
Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start the quest. 

The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. 

Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than the Grimlings). Kill him to recieve a medallion from Scout Husman. 

You Must keep Scout Husman alive in order to finish the quest. 

Suggested force is about 6 level 40s or 2 or 3 high level 50s. As a 57 enchanter, the officer proved annoying since he could not be mermerized. 

Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal and would please like another and he gives you another.

He speaks of a magic-user that is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent.

Reulting Text:

Elder Animist Dumul says 'I have received word from several of our scouts indicating your impending arrival. We are all very pleased that you were able to release all of the spirits before any true harm could manifest itself. Your efforts have not only restored balance to the spirit realm, they seem to have also acted to hinder any other plans our antagonist may have had... for the time being. '


Elder Animist Dumul says 'Our Taruun scouts have discovered Draz Nurakk's location. A scout has returned from a set of islands on the Old World. The islands are in a place called Timorous. The Taruun returned while leaving a scout behind to insure that the foul Animist does not evade us any further. You will need to find the island on which our scout has set up camp. The island has a great statue on it. Hopefully, he will still be in that location. Show him this seal and he will know that I sent you to assist. '

He's been staying in a ruined building on that island over there. I'm sure you can see it from here. You should be able to surprise him with little trouble. Just take care to avoid any traps he may have set. He's proven to be a very capable magic-user. '

Scout Sihmoj says 'When you finish with him, please bring any evidence of his being dispatched back to me in this bag. I'll direct you from there. Good luck... I'll watch from here. '

I am not surprised that he was able to deceive us in this manner. I thank the spirits that you were able to evade harm in your completion of this task. '


Elder Animist Dumul says 'Take this note to Arms Historian Qua. He has been researching a means of circumventing any protective magic that Draz Nurakk may have in place. When you meet him next, you will be well equipped to complete the restoration of balance to the spirit realm. Make your way to Qua and do as he says. '

Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Hail friend, are you a new recruit or have you been at it for a bit? '
Your Location is -105.99, -540.14, -258.75
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'You are just the time. The weapon that Elder Dumul requested has almost been completed. We need you to gather a few items in order to complete the weapon. These items will not require much effort to acquire, but I will need to tell you where to look. Place all of the items that I request in this box and return it to me as quickly as possible. '
Weapons Master Rahoul says 'Now, seek out a large chunk of perfect acrylia ore, two Gems of the Void, and chunk of dense fungal padding. Once I have those items, I can finish the weapon that you will need to use to kill the dark animist. ' 


Weapons Master Rahoul says 'The ore that I require is often used to create living rock formations. These collections of rocks and boulders will often leave a trail of energy that causes other rocks to collect and come to life. Our scouts have seen these formations in a variety of areas. Take care when you attempt to gather this ore. '


Weapons Master Rahoul says 'If you look in the Maiden's Eye, you will find entities that are the embodiment of darkness. Their twisted spirits are not allowed to escape the form that they inhabit. They have no hope of escape, unless they are released during the destruction of their material form. There are some occasions when the power that is used to keep them in this realm will turn upon itself during this period of destruction. This process is what produces the Gems of the Void. '


Weapons Master Rahoul says 'When traversing the Deep, you will run across a shrieking fungus. Those creatures are much more durable and dangerous than the other fungi that you may encounter in the caverns of Luclin. It is for this reason that we use their flesh as padding. Take care when hunting them, for they will provide a good challenge. '

They should work to neutralize the magical field that protects the dark animist and allow you to tear his scaly flesh from his frame. Remember that all of this is theoretical. Those claws are an original creation. You will be the first to prove their effectiveness in combat. '

You have a great challenge ahead of you, for we have determined that only these claws will work to harm this dark animist, this corrupter of spirits. You will need the support of your people; but in the end, only the strength of your will can save us. '

Elder Animist Dumul says 'Our scouts have tracked Draz Nurakk to an abandoned village in the Fungus Grove. We learned of his intent to track you down. I take it that he did not appreciate your willingness to assist us. He knows who you are, so it will be best for us to get him before he can conjure up any more surprises.

Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start the quest. 

The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. 

Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than the Grimlings). Kill him to recieve a medallion from Scout Husman.

Hail historian Sharar and she gives you some long text about taking a book to Elder Animist Dumul. Just answer [yes] to this and she hands you the book. Now the key here is to notice the last line of text. She states that the Khati Sha are disturbed as of late.

Hand him the book and he says something to the effect of not trusting you or something. He asks how much you know. This is where you use the text from Sharar. You state you know the Khati Sha are disturbed about the spiritual realm. I believe the trigger here is the word spirit/spiritual. He then states basically you are a nosy little punk but he likes that and you might be the person they are looking for. He asks you to bring him back the Copper Medal of War. He says it can be retrieved by helping the scouts in the Grimling Forest.

Scout Husman asks you for 6 people of about his level. To wipe out a grimling camp nearby. 
Purchase a polished Acrylia Sphere from the nearby shopkeeper to start the quest. 

The scout will march straight out and assault a camp of grimlings. It's your job to keep him alive during the initial camp take and the follow up waves of grimlings. There are about 5 Grimlings in the camp, and the waves consist of 4 or 5 grimlings a piece. 

Eventually a Grimling officer will appear (who is much stronger than the Grimlings). Kill him to recieve a medallion from Scout Husman. 

You Must keep Scout Husman alive in order to finish the quest. 

Suggested force is about 6 level 40s or 2 or 3 high level 50s. As a 57 enchanter, the officer proved annoying since he could not be mermerized. 

Once you have the Copper Medal of War in hand, run back to Elder Animist Dumul. When you hand it in, he hands you an Official Seal of the Khati Sha and a Carved Wooden Crate. The crate is a 6 slot container that has a combine button and the Seal (haven't id'ed it yet) seems to look like those ancient coins you get. He states that if you lose the seal at any point to return to him and state that you have lost the seal and would please like another and he gives you another. He also says to stash those two items and return to him in a bit when you are ready to be briefed. I stashed the two items in my bank, ran back over there and stated [I was ready to be briefed]. He speaks of a magic-user that is using wooden totems to siphon the power of elder spirits using [new magic]. He is using this power to summon entities of malign intent. He then states that through further research, they (the Khati Sha) have discovered the name of the magic-user
