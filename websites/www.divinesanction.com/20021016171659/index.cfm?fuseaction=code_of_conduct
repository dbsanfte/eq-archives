<b>GENERAL RULES:</b>
<br>
<br>


1. Guild members should be proud to be a guild therefore we ask that any 
member wishing to be race/class anonymous do so by use of the /Roleplay 
option rather than the /anonymous option.
<br>
<br>

2. Conduct yourself honorably and respectfully towards other players of 
the game, in guild and in general.
<br>
<br>
3. Begging behavior is strongly discouraged, this includes repeated 
requests for platinum pieces, free equipment, transportation and power 
leveling, etc.
<br>
<br>
4. No kill stealing,intentional mob training, ninja-looting, stealing of 
camps or items, or cheating will be allowed. This guild will do its very 
best to adhere to Verant's play-nice-policy.
<br>
<br>
5. The guild will not tolerate foul language, immature behavior, 
harassment or discussion of sensitive issues (racism, sexism, adult only 
content) in any public chat channel including guild chat, /ooc, shout, 
auction and group chat.
<br>
<br>
6.Public chat channels (guild chat, /ooc, shout, auction) are not for  use 
for your arguments with any other player. Take it to tells.
<br>
<br>
7. There is no requirement for those in guild to provide  their services 
at a time that is not convenient to them to another guild member. This 
includes transportation by druids and wizards, trade skills by trades 
people. We do ask that you are polite in the asking and polite in the 
refusal where appropriate and that in cases where a fellow member is in 
real trouble you try to offer what assistance you are able.(Real trouble 
defines as an almost impossible corpse run type of situation, use your 
best judgment)
<br>
<br>
8. Please notify an officer online if you choose to leave the guild and 
please post your decision and if you wish your reason for leaving on the 
guild's website message board.
<br>
<br>
9. If you are at any time reprimanded for an action by an officer you are 
to immediately desist in your actions. You may explain your actions to the 
officer and if the officer feels the offence was strong enough to merit 
further disciplinary action it will be taken before the council of Senior 
Officers. The council has the commitment to deal with any disputes/ 
disciplinary actions within 3 days of the issue/offence occurring.
<br>
<br>
10. The guild promotes an equal opportunity to all members and none are 
above or below the rules, if any member has a complaint to lodge they may 
do so with any officer or the guild leader either in tells online or via 
email.
<br>
<br>
11. Use the guild website, it is there to keep you informed and to create 
a close-knit guild family.
<br>
<br>

<b>POLICY ON ALTERNATE CHARACTERS:</b>
<br>
<br>
Many guild members have alternate characters including officers. It is 
your right as a member to have your alternates in our guild or in another 
guild if you wish. For those new to The Guild alternate characters will 
not be invited to the guild until after your trial period of 1 week real 
life time has elapsed, this is to ensure that you are happy with the guild 
and the guild is happy with you as a member. During this trial period you 
are expected to be actively playing, (by this we mean not on vacation, 
etc.)if you are unable to actively play during that week the trial period 
will be continued when you are able to play.
<br>
<br>
<b>APPLICATION & NEW MEMBERSHIP:</b>
<br>
<br>
Application Process: Prospective new members will be referred to our 
website application form BY AN OFFICER. This officer is responsible for 
getting to know the applicant prior to making the referral and the 
applicant must put this officer's name on  his/her application form. The 
applications will be reviewed daily by senior officers and the referring 
officer will be spoken to regarding the applicant. Upon approval of the 
application officers will be notified and they may guild invite the player 
at their earliest convenience. The officer who invites the applicant is 
then responsible for 1. introducing the applicant over the guild chat 
channel in game and 2. posting his invitation of the new member on the 
Guild Invites & Removals message board on the website.
<br>
<br>
New Membership: This status lasts for a period of 1 real time week. During 
this period the New Member has all the rights and responsibilities of a 
Regular Member of Divine Sanction with the exception that his/her alternate 
characters may not be invited until the end of the trial period. The 
purpose of the trial period is for the New Member to be certain that Divine Sanction 
 is the right guild for him/her. The New Member is expected to 
actively play during this trial period, the trial can be extended at the 
discretion of Senior Officers in the event the New Member is unable to play 
enough during that week.

<OL>

<LI>As officers you are expected to follow, uphold and enforce the Code of Conduct for the Guild. Failure to do so may result in temporary or permanent loss of Officership depending upon the severity of the failure.</LI>

<LI>Each Officer has a role to fill in the Guild’s structure and you are expected to do so. In the event that real life issues prevent you from serving fully for a time please notify the Guild Leader so that arrangements can be made to share your duties among the other Officers until you are able to serve again fully.</LI>

<LI>Officer’s Meetings will be held on a regular basis to discuss issues and ideas, you are expected to attempt to attend as many of these as you can. We do understand the constraints of differing Time Zones and will attempt to plan meetings at varying times so that you can attend at least some of them.</LI>

<LI>Only the registered owner of the account may play the Officer’s character(s). This is Verant’s policy for one and for another the Members expect to encounter the same personality every time they speak to that Officer.

Violators will have their Officer status suspended for a first offence and removed for a repeated offence.</LI>

apply here as well. No foul language, immature behavior, arguments or 
sensitive issues.
<br>
<br>

other player will be locked by the first officer that sees it. If you have 
an issue or dispute with another player take it to the officers or guild 
leader.

<br>
3. In the event of a punishment being decided on in a trial heard by Senior 
Officers where both sides present their cases (including chat logs) that 
punishment will be posted on a closed thread of the message boards. In the

also be posted by an officer along with the reasons why in both the 
Disciplinary Actions and Guild Invites & Removals message boards.
