<br>
Let me state first that I do know and have known some very decent druids who played their class well and were welcome in my groups.<br>
<br>
But the trend I've seen recently, is almost every druid I've grouped/duoed with in the past 2 weeks is a complete utter moron when it comes to playing their class.  This is just my opinion remember, others might not see such a big deal with my grypes.  But in my opinion its just pure idiocy.<br>
<br>
Issue #1: When a druid decides to go pull a mob, why do they run on top of the mob so they get hit, THEN try to cast snare on it ? Wouldn't the logical solution be to just snare from max range and run back ? I think I've seen about 20 druids in the past week pull this way.<br>
<br>
Issue #2: Mob is back at camp spot, druid insists on running on top of the mob in order to root/ cast snare on it.  Snare has large aggro, and as a result of being on top of the mob, the druid gets pounded. Said druid then proceeds to complain about how they get so much aggro.  I witnessed 5 different druids in the past week do just this.<br>
<br>
Issue #3: I don't think I have ever seen a class die as much as druids, well at least lately in my opinion.  I die in groups and solo on average once a week. I am a mage, i have ZERO defense.  Yet I see druids soloing and dying left and right, and dying with me while duoing.  How the hell is that possible ???<br>
<br>
Druids have snare, always have sow up, and now with SOE have lev up usually all the time, I could see &quot;maybe&quot; if someone dropped 20 mobs on them and they got hit all at once they would die.  But how in the world can a druid die while soloing one mob ?? I mean if you go oom and root breaks, just run moron.  If you get an add, just run.  I mean come on, are these people retarded ?<br>
<br>
I played a friends level 56 druid for awhile once to farm supplies and had the most fun of my life and can't even imagine how a druid can die so easily soloing.  I was in scarlett desert tracking named to the middle of the zone with mobs all over, breaking invis, snaring it, dotting it, then just reinvising and sitting in the middle of the zone watching it die.  If an add ever came, I just ran a bit, snared it, rooted it etc... I mean its not rocket science, or maybe it is ???<br>
<br>
Issue #4 Druids in POD thinking its smart to fight mobs in the middle of mob infested areas.  Case in point, most people solo/duo or group along the left wall by pulling mobs TO the wall.  I was soloing the other day and saw this druid out in the middle of the area killing a goo with her charmed rat while mobs were all around.  Then I saw 2 mobs aggro her (duh) and her die.  Are you really that stupid ?<br>
<br>
Issue #5 Druids and charm.  Druids can charm animals and they can also give their pets commands, pet back off, pet attack, pet follow me, pet guard here.  Why is it that druids will sit right next to their pet while medding ??? If it was DC'd I could understand.  But you have a regular charmed mob that charm could break on at any moment, and you decide to sit right next to it to med ?? I've witnessed 5 druid deaths in the past week due to this idiocy.<br>
<br>
Even after telling druids hey tell your pet to guard here, then just move a good distance away from it in case charm breaks.  They still sit right on top of it, arghhh.<br>
<br>
Also, duoing at a camp with druid, charm breaks, druid runs to get distance to snare/charm.  Instead of running along the wall of the zone, I've seen so many druids run right out into the mob infested area to try and get away from their charmed mob, and 90% of the time, they get aggro from a new mob and die.  Are they that stupid ???<br>
<br>
Also I know how to aggro kite, and when I do, I get hit every now and then when mob is chasing me and i stop to get a nuke off before it catches up to me, it happens.  But what I've seen lately is it seems like druids simply have no concept of distance, and casting time.  For instance charm breaks, druid runs 10 feet out into middle of mob infested area stops, turns around and tries to snare.  THe druid takes like 10 steps, the second he stops, the mob is on him beating him like crazy, yet he still tries to snare.  He gets interupted usually, then tries it again, 10 steps, stop tuirn around, snare. Dead druid...<br>
<br>
I mean what in the world is so hard about running and getting a good distance on a mob before you stop and try to cast ? Its not that difficult.  <br>
<br>
Issue #6: Duoing in POD with druid, he goes out to find a rat.  Diseased seem to be the best from my experience because charm holds good it seems.  Pestillent always seemed to high of level to charm.  Anway druid knows this info.  <br>
<br>
Druid: BRB getting a rat<br>
Mage: ok np COH memmed if you run into trouble<br>
Druid: got one, crap charm not holding <br>
Mage: what kind is it<br>
Druid: Pestillent<br>
Mage: yeah, remember you tried 5 times yesterday to charm one and it was too high level ? It's probably still too high level today.<br>
Druid: ya I remember but I thought maybe they changed<br>
Mage: idiot<br>
Druid: crap got adds ! inc a few rats<br>
Mage: huh ? Um just zone man I can't take a few rats<br>
(druid runs to camp with 3 rats on him)<br>
Druid: ok kill them while I run this around around that I have huge aggro on because charm didn't hold.<br>
Mage: uh not sure what crack you're smoking but I can't exactly take 2 rats solo bub, gating<br>
<br>
I mean wtf ?? One, you're stupid for trying to charm something you knew you couldn't yesterday.  Two snare the damn rats and run your ass to zone. OR snare the rats, run to camp, root 2 away, let one come to camp and I'll kill it.  Keep the other 2 rooted and I'll get them once I've recovered.  <br>
<br>
I mean is it just me or should this be common frickin sense ????<br>
<br>
Issue #7  I could be totally off here on this one, and if I am I apologize, but for the life of me I had no frickin idea what this druid was talking about... Can't get in group in POD so decide to start soloing.  Notice big spiders open, so start looking for a 60+ druid to duo them with.  Send tell to druid LFG.<br>
<br>
Me: Hey you wanna duo large spiders with me ? 61 mage<br>
Druid: Sure !! OMW !!<br>
Me: great, just get a rat on your way here, take your time no hurry<br>
Druid: I can't charm mobs here<br>
Me: uh yeah you can, my friend is a druid and does it all the time, and actually I'm pretty sure if you run down left wall you will see at least 1 or 2 druids soloing with charmed pets.<br>
Druid: Yes I know that, but &quot;I&quot; can't charm mobs here <br>
Me: what do you mean ?<br>
Druid: I don't have good enough &quot;charm gear&quot; yet so I can't charm the mobs it breaks too fast.<br>
Me: Charm gear ? I've never heard of charm gear, trust me just charm a diseased rat with your highest level charm and you'll be fine<br>
Druid: Ok I'll try<br>
Druid: Ok got one<br>
(2 seconds elapse)<br>
Druid: Crap charm broke<br>
(druids health drops to like 40%)<br>
Druid: Ok got him again<br>
(30 seconds goes by, druid now at camp with rat, and heals herself)<br>
Mage: see told you it be ok<br>
(druid sits to med right next to charmed rat, 10 seconds go by)<br>
Druid: Crap charm broke<br>
(rat beats druid to a pulp, druid dies)<br>
Mage: you know its not very smart to sit next to a charmed pet to med, sorry you died though, I'll get you a rez.<br>
Druid: It's ok, but I told you my charm gear wasn't good enough, I really need to get some money so I can go to the bazaar and buy some good charm gear, then I can charm all day !!!<br>
Mage: Sigh, &lt;disband&gt; &lt;log&gt;<br>
<br>
Anyway sorry for the novel, and actually I&quot;m sure i have about 50 more stories of druids lately, but I&quot;m at work and need to get back to doing it lol..<br>
<br>
But in conclusion, is it just me, or are the majority of druids really just that frickin stupid ??<br>

However from early on they are only used to practice very few of them, so if it comes to test really, they have to fail.<br>
<br>
Fact is, all that druids do through most of their career (unless they love to group) is solo, using snare-kite or root-dot strategies. Very few practice charming in their early levels.<br>
<br>
Also let me tell you (from own experience) that the many safety belts that druids have can give them a false sense of security. I have a druid, and have often died because I ran too late (&quot;Ack, my snare faded and SoW just ran out!&quot;). You have to learn your tools.<br>
<br>
A well played druid can be a great group member, but if they rushed through the levels they miss a lot of knowledge usually. Give them some credit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I play a lvl 41 druid so don't bash druids. More then likely those people are ebayed. I play on the drinal server don't have much ebayed noobs that play high lvl chars. but anyways. Lets say i'm in RM right, and a HG pops i see it.. I snare dot rot, dot , dot, root, med. wash rinse and repeat. I have had run into the trouble because the ensare is resisted but that doesn't happen often. That sucks that you think druids have gotten stupider. Some have and I won't lie. But i'm not stupid. I find every way possible not to die, but from what you tell me these druids are @#%$ morons. But please don't bash druids.<br>

<br>
2) Had this been slow I could understand since you want that to stick as early as possible and then standing next to the mt removes the problem with mobs doing a bit of ping pong but for something like snare vs normal mobs there isn't alot of reason for this<br>
<br>
3) Dying is easy and alot of the times (in my case) simply comes from getting overconfident (like a paladin with LoH up) and thinking things like &quot;I can clean this up, 2 extra lightcrawlers aren't that much of a problem&quot;. This is usually right before both of them get stuck in the terrain and warp on top of me delivering 357*2 hits and an 800 point ht each.<br>
<br>
I have died a few times from mobs catching me after the gate spell has fired but before the char has cleared the zone, its usually one of those times when banging your head on a keyboard feels like a good idea. Truly love exodus though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I would honestly be happier if more people either gated out or simply took their death instead of training everything and the kitchen sink every time they screw up, but that's just me...<br>
<br>
4 &amp; 5) There are some people that are this stupid and then there are those that are even worse. Simple consider their antics to be comic relief and move on.<br>
<br>
6) Both pestilent and swamp rats can be charmed just not everyone of them so its a toss of the dice most of the time but well worth it if you get one that can be charmed. As for the druid and his behavior, well some people are just crappy players, nothing more, nothing less.<br>
<br>
7) I would guess he is talking about cha gear, something I have never found any use for and I have charmed for just about all my exp since I got my hands on CoK. As for the charm breaking like that, either he just had some bad luck or the mobs mr wasnt debuff and that makes a world of differance even if its just the druids own GoT.<br>

No idea why a Druid would do this. One of the things that keeps us alive and kicking is our ability to &quot;engage&quot; a mob before it sees us, and by the time it knows we want it, it's hobbled by the snare. Esp in Planes, if you &quot;pull&quot; like this, the only thing you'll end up pulling is your own corpse. <br>
<br>
2. All you need is one early snare and a good pounding and you learn when it's safe to snare without getting too high on the hate list. Some, however, never learn- Pavlov is rolling over in his grave. <br>
<br>
<br>
3. Those Druids die because they don't think. They don't think ahead, they don't know all the options available to them if they get into hot water. They truly don't know how close to indestructible they can be-they don't pay attention to their surroundings, they don't look at pathing, other people, etc etc. And unfortunately, tho they die and die and die, they are still powerful enough to somehow get into their 50's without knowing more than a few dimensions of their class. <br>
<br>
As a Druid, I have snare, root, sow, harmony, self healing, hp buffs, gate, invis, self mana regen, illusions, dots, nukes, stuns, blind, and let's not even go into what we can do to animals. The only reason I should die is because I wasn't paying attention or someone else wasn't- that goes for solo and groups. <br>
<br>
<br>
4. Impatience. Doesn't want to actually examine the zone, the mobs, the pathing, the spawn spots, the wanderers, and the agro ranges. There's a *reason* that certain locations in new zones become &quot;camps&quot; or get little names - because players learn that there's spots to pull *to*. They'd rather jump right in and start getting exp than take ten minutes to see if maybe something's going to pop right under their behind.<br>
<br>
5. There are more words typed on eqdruids regarding charming than there are druid corpses at the GY <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This isn't quadding wyverns folks. This is trying to keep control of something that will hate your guts every few minutes at totally random intervals and cause you to have not one but two things to deal with. And deal with ON THE RUN. And you have to know your surroundings so well that when you do have to run to recharm, you don't agro anything else. I still see Druids medding next to their pets. This isn't Booboo for pete's sake.  I see them run up and loot the mob with the pet sitting there.  I see them recharm without resnaring. I see them dragging their failures over other camps. If you're sitting with a charmed raven and someone calls train, move yourself AND your pet out of that path. More often than not that train is going to get tangled up with Birdy and then you're really done for.<br>
<br>
6. Again, not thinking on your toes. You get that message that you can't charm the mob then dammit root it and take that mage up on the COH. <br>
<br>
7. hahahahha- the only &quot;gear' you need to charm is the gear sitting between your ears. I'll admit I put on my Lucky CHA Hat when I charm but there's times I've had charm last the length of the snare, and times its broken so many times in 1 minute that I get mad and kill the damn bird in frustration. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
For the record I don't think your post is bashing Druids at all. I see the very same things you do over and over and rather than making me angry it makes me sad. With a little patience, experimentation, and exploration, they could be having so much more fun with their class. And I think that when Druids get given information on what they could or should be doing, they don't realise that many times it's not coming from a mindset of &quot;I'm telling you what to do&quot; - it's coming from another class that doesn't have some of the available abilities that a Druid has and they wonder why on earth that potential isn't being realised. Unfortunately it's a cycle: Druids who don't perform well in groups will sour people on having them in groups and then they never get a chance to see their role in relation to everyone else.   <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Baroness Necriself Azrayel</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>

<br>
the bad ones haven't gotten dumber so much as the results of their stupidity have increased dramatically.  in old world stuff like running up to a kos mob to snare it, or medding next to a charm pet weren't instantly fatal like they are in PoP.<br>
<br>
they're not stupider, it's just that the standard level of stupidity now yeilds greater results. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gnomeone>gnomeone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 10:36:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> very well put stab <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pissed1vi2soe@themagicianstower>Pissed1VI2SOE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 538<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 4:25:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   re</span><hr size=1> hmmmmmm<br>
<br>
I started as a druid, by lvl 35 he was charming even cons and sicking them on even cons, charm break, big deal they are both snared anyway.  It was apparent to me that charming was the way to go when there was an animal available.  I took this character to 60, got epic'ed and realized I wanted to be a mage.<br>
<br>
So I can speak from personal experience here...<br>
<br>
YES druids are mostly morons, by design.<br>
<br>
Sow/snare have/had the same icon, if I had a plat for everytime I snared myself uggggggggggggggggg.  Whats worse is your healing yourself and root breaks, so without thought you cast root, ooooops rooted druid ermmmmmm.<br>
<br>
Then again I always fought with cancel magic up, and would cancel my self snare/self root.  As a mage I still keep cancel magic up, I seem to run into self snareing and self rooting druids alot, and I consider it a public service to cancel their buffs to help them die faster, I mean there is no sence in them taking that 2-3 more hits when they are rooted, if I manage to axe their root ohh well, I know they will get pummeled when they run 5 feet and try to root mob.<br>
<br>
druid says damn it I rooted myself again<br>
<br>
/cast 7<br>
a druid feels dispelled<br>
druid says WTF you canceled my sow and skin....now I am gonna die....<br>
You say, you were gonna die anyway<br>
/pet attack<br>
you say now walk out of agro range<br>
druid says WTF thats my mob leave it alone<br>
druid dies<br>
<br>
you say, hmmmmmmmm<br>
<br>
Sadly I used to be..........a........treehugger........ <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showPrevMessage?topicID=390.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showNextMessage?topicID=390.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=390.topic&index=8><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.threadControl?topicID=390.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=390.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=390.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants>Rants !</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
