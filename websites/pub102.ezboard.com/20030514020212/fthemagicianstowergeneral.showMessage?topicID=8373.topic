But I hope that maybe somebody can show me a perspective ,-)<br>
<br>
I'm a well -but by no means uber- equipped Mage.<br>
I'm currently lvl 61 with very little AA (I started playing EQ pretty late).<br>
I can't play very many hours at once usually. Most often I can play 2-3 hour and then have to logout.<br>
I play in a guild that most of you would probably call rather small and we do raid quite a lot. (about 30 active members, almost all lvl 60-62)<br>
I got most important lvl 61 spells (Pet, Blade, belt, dmg bracer,....) and will have all the lvl 61/62 somewhat soon.<br>
<br>
Now...currently I'm falling a bit in a &quot;hole&quot; because I have no clue what to do with my mage beside raiding, which still leaves 80% of my online time uncovered.<br>
Until 60 I could solo just fine and for whatever time I had available.<br>
But now?<br>
<br>
Soloing is no viable choice anymore really.<br>
I'm also so bored of PoD/PoN. I lost roll after roll after roll for parchments (got 61 Air by some trade), now my guild is helping me quite a lot with the spells.<br>
I hardly ever find a group because most often there are already sitting a few mages in the zone.<br>
and even when I'm grouped I'm so bored of getting a AA in 5 or 6 hours when I see people in PoV getting it in 2-3 hours.<br>
<br>
So...I was looking forward to getting flagged for PoV.<br>
Had quite a lot bad luck here (people screwing up, people going LD, failed on endfight ,...). But sometime I will get flaged, no doubt.<br>
And then? In the last days I did a few &quot;/who all Mag lfg&quot; and never ever saw less than 3 Mages /lfg in PoV, among them most often lvl 64/65 Mages.<br>
<br>
So...I will get flaged and then...still won't get exp because I hardly will find a group. Guild groups just happen too seldom. Since we arent too big there are usually some key classes missing (cleric for instance) or people want to do something else or whatever. So most often I have to look for pickup groups....<br>
<br>
Right now I don't even feel like loging my mage and instead play my lowish wizzie.<br>
<br>
It's just too frustrating not finding a group, not knowing what to do...BLAH!<br>
And worst is....as I see it no matter what I do this situation won't ever change. <br>
<br>
I liked my Mage, it was my very first char and I never regretted playing a Mage...until now. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_new2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sleethr>Sleethr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#333333>(1/7/03 1:27:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8373.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No clue what to look forward to...</span><hr size=1> Just some suggestions in no particular order...<br>
<br>
* Join a bigger guild<br>
* Recruit more people into your guild<br>
* Wizards have it pretty rough too. At least, my guild's wizards seemed to always claim that they had a real hard time finding groups until a raid came up.<br>
* If your guild is always short on clerics, try playing a cleric.<br>
* Play a class that always seems to be needed.  Healer or enchanter seems to get snapped up pretty fast.  They also seem to get pushed thru the trials pretty fast too.<br>
* Get flagged.  I was about ready to quit EQ myself.  Thru bad luck and real life distractions, it took me almost 2 months to get flagged.   It's amazing how much funnier the game has become again by just getting 2 more zones enabled.<br>
* Do the CoD Key quest in PoD.  Decay is a nice zone and it's a Tier 2 zone, so great exp.<br>
* And my personal favorite, try a bard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Kitty and STA important.<br>

It is just a thing two of my guildies did to find joy in EQ again.<br>
<br>
One was 61, the other 62. Both of them &quot;complained&quot; about the same thing as you. One day they logged on and deleveled back to 60, went 100% AA and started adventuring in all the &quot;old&quot; zones again.<br>
<br>
They still fight on occasion in tier 1 PoP zones, but mostly they're hanging out in old world places (Kunark and Velious) mixed with a bit of Luclin.<br>
<br>
I'm happy to report that both of them are once more enjoying EQ.<br>
<br>
This might not be the solution for you, but it helped them.<br>
<br>
I had no idea dinging 61 had such a profound impact on where and how you play. Almost makes me glad I'm only 51 - still lots to do for me in Norrath. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jayteebushwacker>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Summoner Da'FoH</span><br>  Posts: 1390<br> <font color=#333333>(1/7/03 1:34:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8373.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No clue what to look forward to...</span><hr size=1> I know its tough, cant really solo like we did at 60, old spots going light blue/green, and the general gimpiness of our PoP pets in relation to the PoP MOBs.  All I can suggest is the following:<br>
<br>
Join a bigger/more expereienced guild<br>
<br>
Just trudge along getting to 65<br>
<br>
Try and find a duo/trio that have similar play times and are on regularly - make a pre-set XP group (I did this back in Kunark)<br>
<br>
If it gets to be to much play an alt or delevel to 60 or go work on quests. (If you dont have the epic stay 61 because the FoT and 61 pet own level 60 counterparts) <p><hr>

IMHO if you are 61 and don't have either the epic pet or 61 pet then you need to delevel back to 60 til you get one of the other, not flaming, simply making a suggestion. But with PoP, sebilis might have 10-15 peeps on at most times, 6 of those will be in the NG camp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so its a good chance the bar or chef is open.

<br>
As for the guilds, well it is a pretty nice guild and the ONLY guild on my whole server that allows me to raid regulary.<br>
They have the perfect raid-schedule for me and they even accept me with my handicap that I almost always have to leave the raid for 30 minutes. I doubt many active raiding guilds would accept that and especially always help me to find ways to get out of the raid and back when I return.<br>
So leaving the guild isn't an option because it would most likely mean leaving EQ (couldn't go back to an EQ-life without any raiding ;-) )<br>
<br>
As for PoP...I just feel cursed ;-)<br>
13 parchment drops...lost<br>
won a parchment<br>
15 more drops...lost<br>
won a parchment<br>
since then probably 10 more lost rolls ,-)<br>
<br>
trials...<br>
Pickup groups just aren't worth it.<br>
Usually they fail at 1st or 2nd wave.<br>
had exactly one (pickup) group that made it to 4th wave...but then a Monk decided that with 2 Mobs left assisting the MT is boring and that tanking his own target might be more interesting....<br>
<br>
Yesterday we had a guildgroup going which tried to get me and an epic Ranger through the trials....<br>
1st attempt....4 waves...no problem....1 lagged heal while fighting exe ....MT dead....<br>
2nd attempt....MT LD through 2nd wave...<br>
3rd attempt...4 stones at 1st wave...MT died.<br>
<br>
Anyway...will get flagged sooner or later...and then I will have the joy of competing with 3+ other higher lvled mages for those rare spots ;-)<br>
<br>
as for duo'ing. I KNOW I could do it with Shaman or Enc.<br>
&quot;Hi there shaman9612, wanna group in PoD? spiders camp is free&quot;<br>
&quot;sure, what other classes do you have?&quot;<br>
&quot;well....it's only me, but my Pet can easily tank them if you slow the targets&quot;<br>
&quot;sorry, am looking for a full group for better exp.&quot;<br>
(or add another senseless reason here...)<br>
<br>
It's just that nobody on my whole server wants to duo/trio with a Mage ,-)<br>
No matter how many clerics/Shamans/encs I asked they all only wanted into a full group.<br>
and well...why should they take any risk? All they have to do is to wait 5 minutes until somebody shouts &quot;lf Slower/cleric&quot;<br>
<br>
Blah ;-)<br>
<br>
So I'm playing my wizzie a bit, just because I could twink him cheaply with all the stuff my Mage doesnt need anymore ;-)<br>
<br>
And building up another class. I'm sure most people will do that quickly. But since I don't want and won't dual-box it's not that easy. Took me almost a year to get my Mage to 60 and I think it would take another half year at least until I had another char at 60. <br>
<br>
And worst of all....I was indeed looking forward to group more.<br>
I was sooooooo incredible sick of soloing for 99% of my chareer as a Mage.<br>
I know I could also get a AA in about 5 hours in FG now at 61, but after trying that for an hour I just can't take it anymore to stand there alone and pull-sic pet-nuke-pull-sic pet - ....<br>

<br>
Thats your problem, you didnt make any friends while leveling up.<br>
<br>
Word of advice, dont solo with your wizzie so much. <br>
<br>
Communicate, make/get groups and make friends. Friends are pretty much nessessary at higher levels or you expirence exactly what your talking about.<br>
<br>
I have several high lvl mage friends that have no trouble at all getting in a group. Hell, they get picked up faster then rogues/clerics/enc's<br>
<br>
Its all about the pool of friends you aquire during your adventures, not the class. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=euphorion>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 232<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 9:18:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8373.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No clue what to look forward to...</span><hr size=1> Hehe :-)<br>

Btw...got flagged yesterday...so let's see how PoV/PoS turns out ;-) <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_new2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kilmir123>Kilmir123</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lowlandelites.net/vb/avatar.php?userid=13&dateline=1034772585" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 9:38:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8373.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No clue what to look forward to...</span><hr size=1> When I see a couple of mages and other petclasses lfg I'll just wrap them up and make a petgroup. Any beastie is a bonus for the slow and if you can find a healer or slower that's ok too, but you really don't need them.<br>
<br>
3+ 61/epic pets can easely get a mob to ~20% without much healing needed in PoS/PoV. Make sure you have about 3 nukers starting to blast on about 20% health so you skip the enrage.<br>
<br>
You can either chain-pet or go for fully armored pets if you have a beastie or priest in the group.<br>
<br>
As long as you have 3 or more decent pets in the group you can exp. Don't take my word for it, just do it.<br>
<br>
Oh and if you're bored. Go to PoS and solo the wanton trees there. Not much exp, but they go down fast with chain-nukes and you can run out of range of their dots/nukes while your FoT still hits <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <p>Arch Convoker Rhand Drago'Magica<br>
