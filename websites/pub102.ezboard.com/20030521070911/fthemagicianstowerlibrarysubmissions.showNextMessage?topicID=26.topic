What I told my guild on pets</span><hr size=1> Okay I really need to cover this issue, but I do not want to get off on a rant here. These issues have been learned over 54 levels as a paladin, 45 levels as a druid, 52 levels as a mage and a 100 gimpy levels. Also I used Citra who is one of the top three enchanters in the game as an info resource. <br>
<br>
Da' Facts on Pets<br>
<br>
1. 99% of all problems caused by pets are DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE IGNORANCE OF THE MAGE not to pets in general.<br>
This includes but is not limited to;<br>
 A. Mages that do not know what /pet guard here is for, if you see a mage pet in a camp and it is doing anything other than standing in one spot, rotating to face the nearest enemy, then you have a dumbass Mage. Pets that are not put into guard or sit will roam, and when the mage moves to a spot in the area that has pathing issues, the pet can run off.<br>
 B. Mages that have not learned what summon companion is yet, If you have a mage that does not have it memorized in tight and or areas with bad pathing, you have a dumbass mage.<br>
 C. Mages that do not realize that they have a built in Memblur spell called /pet back off and /pet as you were. If the pet is on a mob, and the mage gets hit by another, the mage SHOULD immediately /pet back off and then reassist. If the mage fails to do so, then the pet will jump the mob that hit the mage immediately after the first is dead. If this happens, you have a dumbass mage. (One exception is sometimes, you want this chain to occur)<br>
 D. Mages that do not have a hotkey that has 6 lines of /pet back off are dumbasses, simply because a single line hit is not enough.<br>
 E. Mages that do not know how to work with enchanters because all they have ever done is solo are dumbasses, because a well timed spam of pet back off combined with an enchanter possessing a clue ( stun, dazzle etc) will prevent 99% of all pet incidents. <br>
 F. If you have 10 unmezzed mobs running around hitting everything, and the mage is sitting then you have a dumbass mage ( really this applies to all casters)<br>
<br>
2. The other 1% is because of 1 factor.<br>
 A. Poor enchanters only make it harder on mages. If you have the mob mezzed, and it breaks mez and starts casting on my pet, then the last thing a enchanter should be doing is screaming about the pet. They need to STFU and stun the mob, so the mage can get their pet off then remez it long term. If your mage is not paying attention, then you need to ask him to stop eating Fruit Loops and pay attention or find another group.<br>
<br>
Okay so you ask, what does this all mean?? Well let me tell you. Stripping pet classes of their pets (minus crazy enchanter pets that even they do not like) is like asking the clerics not to heal, the shamans not to buff, the wizards not to nuke, the warriors not to dual wield, etc. The only place pets should be banned is in the first 20 minutes of a Hate/Fear break type situation where things are so hectic that breathing is not permitted, but even then I question the logic unless the previously mentioned dumbass mage problem is occuring. <br>
<br>
Right now we do not allow mage pets on Trak attacks, do you realize that even the level 49 water pet can double and triple hit for 56 damage. Has a PR that no player can match, and is utterly expendable? Mages should be running up the path, then casting a water pet and sending it in. Anytime that you are dealing with a single mob situation there is no excuse for not sending pets at the mob.  <p>Kailere Drowsbane of Veeshan -Paladin of 55 summers<BR>

Yes pets are problems, but very rarely in my case<br>
1) In Kael the pet, for no reason!! Went for a distant giant, wans't fighting,, wasn't ordered, really weird.<br>
2) In the Hole in a chaotic fight because pathing was bad and /assist was screwing up and I admit I was learning (first time in there). <br>

I mostly agree with you.  Most pet problems are bad mages.  If you're in a guild, and they tell you not to use a pet, find out why first.  Perhaps a high level mage knows that pets are pointless because of the aweful pathing or something else (e.g. going to King in OS, you don't summon pet until in jail, then you kill it, then you summon again at king).<br>
<br>
I have no problem when a more experienced mage tells me not to use a pet.  They're doing that out of knowledge.  When a power-hungry pally running a raid says no pets, out of ignorance, I will politely ask why, discuss why I disagree, and if we can't come to an agreement I'll leave the raid.  Mages are useless without their pets.  We can serve a bunch of support roles (e.g. CoH the group in), so if that's your role that's okay, but if we're on a raid as a general member it's different.<br>
<br>
Hey, lot's of twinked and bad mages out there.  I can say that 55+ it seems that most classes are pretty good, so people aren't afraid to use any class in a group any more.  It's just that all groups are cleric/chanter/tank/shammie, and as a mage you are fighting for 2 spots.<br>

<br>
I have seen good and bad mages in my years in Norrath, the bad thing is that people rarely notice the good mages, they are like good pullers in a way, only the bad ones get noticed.<br>
<br>
Probably 9 out of ten times I have been told to kill a pet was because a POOR mage came first, that is what really irks me, I did not build a mage as a twink, I built it because I saw its advantages/disadvantages and gave up a high level paladin as my primary (and I need to fix my sig pic heh) in doing so, and even abandoned a druid that gets exp once in a blue moon between porting the mage around. <br>
<br>
If I went back to the pally for some reason, my perfect group would be Cleric, Enchanter, Mage, Shaman, Paladin, and Sk/Monk/Warrior. Hmm as a matter of fact I prefer that group now.  <p>Kailere Drowsbane of Veeshan -Paladin of 55 summers<BR>

<br>
&quot;C. Mages that do not realize that they have a built in Memblur spell called /pet back off and /pet as you were. If the pet is on a mob, and the mage gets hit by another, the mage SHOULD immediately /pet back off and then reassist&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, if there is a mob on you and you immediately back your pet off it's going to go for the mob on you once it hits you again, you should always wait for the mob to be mezzed first or just desummon your pet if it looks like the enchanter isn't going to mez it in time.<br>
<br>
&quot;D. Mages that do not have a hotkey that has 6 lines of /pet back off are dumbasses, simply because a single line hit is not enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
6 lines of /pet back off is so very pointless, how many of those actually get through? 3?  I can just slam the hotkey for /pet back off if I wanted to, which I don't becuase I don't rely on the enchanter to stun the mob, it is more effective to /pet back off and then /pet attack on the correct mob.. If after a few tries that doesn't work hit your reclaim energy item hotkey.. You do have one right?<br>
<br>
That's all I wanted to say, flame away and sorry for bringing negativity to the thread. <p><img

<br>
Earthen boots.  Yes, the reclaim energy items are generally better to use since you get the mana back, but if your pet takes off running due to some pathing issue it can get out of range of the effect very fast.  The &quot;murder pet&quot; effect on the boots works no matter where in the zone your pet is.<br>
<br>
If my pet is fighting a mob and an add smacks me, I will move away from my pet as much as possible to lessen the chance of my pet trying to peel it off me.  Then once the enchanter mezzes I move back in and back-off resend pet to clear its aggro.  <br>
<br>
Mages, in my opinion, are a scapegoat class.  We always catch the blame if something goes wrong even if we had nothing to do with it.  My personal favorite is the time in Seb that my group was moving down to the area we were gonna camp.  Bad pull, multiple mobs, enchanter standing there screaming about pet breaking his mezzes, we all die.  We pop up at our bind point and the enchanter starts with the &quot;You need to learn pet control&quot; crap.  My response: &quot;I didn't think I needed to use pet control then, since I killed my pet when we started moving and didn't have one up then.&quot;<br>
Scrolling back up, noone was able to see that the enchanter ever even casted, or did anything besides scream at me the whole time.  We were doomed that fight due to a bad enchanter, but *if* I had brought my pet with us instead of killing it for the move then all the blame would have been placed on me.  It is just way to easy to shoot the blame at the mage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usynda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synda</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/6/01 12:59:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets</span><hr size=1> All these complaints are with merit. However, let me counter with some valid facts.<br>
1) When I was a level 12 mage I sent my pet to battle and had no idea of the need for crowd control.  I was having a ball and was welcome in groups.  I advanced in this capacity through level 20 when I went to Cazic Thule and received a rude awakening.  I was called a bad mage and kicked out of a group (no enchanter in it) but a Monk pulling and FD to the pull spot, and one of two other tanks going for the first hit on whatever mob he chose.  All I heard from the monk was WTF is the pet doing now?  I had sent the pet in as soon as the monk dropped, and never had any other pet control keys set.<br>
2) I was devastated for I loved the game.  My ERROR was not knowing about this information and even where to find it.  I had no idea of the boards (especially this one) and was busy in my business in which I am the boss and make a very very healthy income.  I started another character and got her to level 12 or so, for I was again having fun.  I found out that should I continue the main magician, I had to read, read, read.  The rest we all know.  I have macros for all kinds of pet control and diligently spend all my time concentrating on properly supporting the group, and reading and rereading this board and others, including Monk and others so that I understand their needs.<br>
3) This is not a game, it's become a business.  If the higher level players in this game ran our military we would have an end to world war threats and handle rogue country problems.<br>
4) Solution only lies in every Guild and magician above level 12 to inform ALL lower level magicians to come to this board.  How else will they learn how to handle their magician group requirements and control their pets?  There is no manual which can possibly cover all the facets of being a magician.  Ignorance is fact here.  I wouldn't want other magicians to go through what I had to experience.  As far as I am concerned the 'hell' level starts at 20 and doesn't end.  This is not negative in context, just a statement asking &quot;at what point or level is a magician needless&quot;?<br>
5) Older servers have very experienced players who have had numerous characters and are knowledgable.  New players on these servers are chastised as 'bad or ignorant' and truly they are ignorant of fact.  <br>
6) I would never have taken the time to address this issue if I didn't love being a magician and working with my wonderful pet. Unfortunately I am sitting idle at level 30, worried that I will find a group is CT who thiks I made a mistake and again spams &quot;Xylum (Solusek Ro)is a bad, bad mage&quot;.    <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucrispinskyhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Crispinskyhawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://fp.geocities.com/whisperskyhawke/bluehawk.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#333333>(3/6/01 7:05:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=33.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://fp.geocities.com/whisperskyhawke/bluehawk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets</span><hr size=1> We learn from our mistakes.  I think the only stupid mages are the ones that don't take time to teach and the ones that refuse to learn.  This takes time and patience.<br>
<br>
I once started a small train in Lower Guk because the puller had the wrong mob targeted.  I thought I heard fighting and without looking up sent my pet into the fight.  Fortunately I had a talented Enchanter in the group and we overcame the problem.  I admitted my mistake and talked to the puller not to leave a targeted mob up that he wasn't fighting.<br>
<br>
Point being it took more than one person to learn from this mistake.  This thread has bothered me because it says that people are stupid and dumb because they don't know how to control their pets.  Ask yourself if you have taken time to teach someone the finer points of being a Magician.  If you do and the other person refuses to listen, then they are the foolish ones.<br>
<br>
It bothers me also that our pets are not allowed on dragon raids or plane raids (depending on the leader of course).  But the simple truth of it is, when a pet is feared, it follows the goofy pathing while running away.  I disagree with the fact that a Magician should have to wait until 59th level to get a 3 minute fear immune buff.  This spell should be made avaiable at 49 - 51 level and then an upgrade at 59 level. <p><p><font color="#0000FF">Crispinskyhawke<br>

One thing I agree with: EQ has become a very anti-social game.  Why is it that the Magician is a dumbass for not knowing about BackOff/PetAttack when working with enchanters?    Because, rather than teach the Mage, the Enchanter is more likely to say &quot;I hate magicians, you suck&quot; (etc)<br>
<br>
I remember the first time my pet went after a mez'd mob after the initial mob went down and thinking &quot;hey.. i could back it off mid-fight to keep that from happening&quot; and then wondering later on why no enchanter had ever mentioned it before.  <br>
<br>
As for the other comments:  The poster is a dumbass for making up a list and calling others dumbasses for not following it.  He's a double dumbass for not being correct.<br>
<br>
(1) Instant Cast Invis is much better than Summon Companion.  Summon Companion is good for moving from spot to spot when they are short jumps.   It is horrible for pet control in high level raid situations.  Don't know where your pet is?  Get freaken' rid of it. <br>
<br>
(2) 6 lines of /pet back off is a waste.   Spamming the screen with back off's is a waste.  A good magician is the one standing beside the enchanter watching him and waiting as stun is cast then tapping his macro a few times.   Its timing, not brute force.   And, yes, you should have reclaim ready in case it becomes a hassle.<br>
<br>
Lost Tip:  If you are hit by a wanderer you should run it over the tanks.  This gets it off of you and allows you to do the back off/attack thing without worrying about your Pet going to the new mob.  <br>
<br>
Last thought:  I tend to avoid raids or people that tend to think that pets shouldn't be up during large scale events.  In fact, I tend to avoid bad players in general because they'll get you killed.  Example: The first time my guild tried The Maestro all 30sh of us got whiped out except for 2 clerics who camped.   When the clerics were camping it was down to 2 tanks and 3 magicians with pets on The Maestro. If it weren't for the pets the clerics probably would not have made it out of the game and thus we'd have had a horrid CR.   Just one good example of how pets can be the difference (unsuccesful as that attempt was).  On a brighter note, we did our CR and retried with better tactics (casters and pets staying away until he was under 50% then pets in and blast like hell) and only lost 4 people. <p> <br>

My Guild planned a raid on MM a few sundays ago...I was shouted out by the Ranger who was pulling to lose my pet and was told NOT to use one for the raid. Now I can only assume this is because he had a bad experience with a Mage in the past. We were fighting in one room of the Castle with about 16 Guild members present ranging from lvls 28 to 54. That had to be the most annoying thing I have come across in EQ as mentioned I felt naked without my pet and was reduced to a damage shielder <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   At one stage I got killed cos our ranger pulled most the castle and I just stood there and got a beating cos I had no pet to defend me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Now I have the /pet back off hotkey and Earthen boots so if my pet goes walkies I invis pet dead end of story. I really am working on my pet control in dungeons but peoples attitudes to Mages really annoy me.<br>

<br>
And yes, the common reason was because of mages who can't control their pets.<br>
<br>
If you want to participate in several high level raids, then I suggest you practice controlling your pets.  Get into groups with enchanters and multi-pullers.  Always have the important pet commands hotkeyed, and get ready to kill your pet easily when something goes wrong.<br>
<br>
6 lines of /pet back off really doesn't go thru, could be a bug, but make sure you press this hotkey times a million when needed.<br>
<br>
Use summon companion in conjunction with a /pet sit down.<br>
Hot key /cast # of summon companion and /pet sit down, good for those always moving raids.<br>
<br>
In large raids, never immediately send your pet in to assist the main tank.<br>
Always wait a few seconds first and make sure the tank and you are on/targetting the right mob, then send in your pet.<br>

What I told my guild on pets</span><hr size=1> I said&gt; &quot;C. Mages that do not realize that they have a built in Memblur spell called /pet back off and /pet as you were. If the pet is on a mob, and the mage gets hit by another, the mage SHOULD immediately /pet back off and then reassist&quot;<br>
<br>
Gamrok said&gt; Ok, if there is a mob on you and you immediately back your pet off it's going to go for the mob on you once it hits you again, you should always wait for the mob to be mezzed first or just desummon your pet if it looks like the enchanter isn't going to mez it in time.<br>
<br>
I say&gt; Agreed but we have all had that mobs that tags us as an add then moves on to someone else, or is snagged by the enchanter immediately after, this is where this point applies. <br>
<br>
I said&gt; D. Mages that do not have a hotkey that has 6 lines of /pet back off are dumbasses, simply because a single line hit is not enough.<br>
<br>
Gamrok said&gt; 6 lines of /pet back off is so very pointless, how many of those actually get through? 3? I can just slam the hotkey for /pet back off if I wanted to, which I don't becuase I don't rely on the enchanter to stun the mob, it is more effective to /pet back off and then /pet attack on the correct mob.. If after a few tries that doesn't work hit your reclaim energy item hotkey.. You do have one right?<br>
<br>
I say&gt; Usually 2-3 of them can go through at once, I have noticed it varies by connection speed, when playing at home I have a 7/1MEG ADSL line and usually get three, I noticed on a 28.8 at a friends house, 1 maybe 2 worked. But what it does when more than one are going is let you hit it once then move on, it is invaluable to those who do mot have both hands fully usuable (I recently had left hand in a cast) and it lets you actually get away with first back off, mob hits pet, then next back off hits from a single shot of the key. Of course I have a focus item in a hotkey slot, but in tight situations your pet can carry the day in the time it would take you to recast it.<br>
<br>
Synda, I agree that these things should be taught to mages, ( the rant concept of my post was a way of doing this, and it was meant to be humourous, but as I see from posters below you, some cannot take humor well :-)<br>
<br>
Crispinskyhawk said&gt; Point being it took more than one person to learn from this mistake. This thread has bothered me because it says that people are stupid and dumb because they don't know how to control their pets. Ask yourself if you have taken time to teach someone the finer points of being a Magician. If you do and the other person refuses to listen, then they are the foolish ones.<br>
<br>
I say&gt; Exactly my point Crispin, the intent of the thread was to teach and preferably in a humourous manner ( Thus the Dennis Miller line (not to get off on a rant here) and the use of dumbass in such a generic manner.<br>
<br>
Ezno says&gt; Well a bunch of stuff really, none of it all that impressive, nor quotable. But let's point out some things he said that were wrong. The point of Summon Companion is that you do not have to kill the pet, and you do not use it to find lost ones, you use it to summon ones that you parked intentiobnally for much less mana than resummoning would cost you.  Next he moans about pet back off, showing himself to be more foolish, because he has never even tried it, or he would know it does not produce excessive spam, it only actually hits a few times, the first one lets the enchanter know that you are in fact paying attention, he then stuns/quick mezzes and the second hit of it makes it work perfectly. Then he talks about wandering mobs hitting you, which is why I said if it happens do a back off and reassit so the mob does not jump it when the one he is on dies.<br>
<br>
Lilminx&gt; Exactly my friend, it is our job to teach 'em and it will make our life much less harder, when you see someone wanting to know what words make a 24 pet, then send them to the compendium same for if they want to know where the level 20 spells are sold for pets, etc. Teach a man to fish blah blah<br>
<br>
The overall trick is that until I stop dealing with the past residue of mages that had no clue in my guild, I am limited by their mistakes. However you will be pleased to note, that as a result of my post, the highest three mages can now use water pets at Trak runs :-) <p>Kailere Drowsbane of Veeshan -Paladin of 55 summers<BR>

Despite internet latency, the game has a set delay between pet commands (1.5-2s ?) so giving it 6 in 1 second doesn't seem to server any purpose. Unless you are lagging over 2 seconds, spamming 6 back offs will have no effect, and if you are lagging that bad it's time to reclaim the pet and sit back or gate out and not jeopardize the raid. Another issue is when you are backing off a pet, a mage who just spams &quot;/pet back off&quot; is a dumbass in my book, you have to time that with the mob's combat swings and the enc casting mez or you just break another mez. <p>Ealdalor ElderRune

What I told my guild on pets</span><hr size=1> A few observations:<br>
<br>
The most successful and happy mage is one that works with the group and is open to an exchange of information. I have added to my pet control hotkeys emotes so that there is no confusion for eg:<br>
<br>
/assist soandso (puller / 2ndaary assist)<br>
/em commands his pet to KEEEL %t<br>
/pet attack<br>
<br>
This will take any confusion away from which MoB you actually sent your pet in to attack.<br>
<br>
Another thing I do is assist off of a secondary assist person if there is one. The reason for this is simple on a multi pull the primary puller will see tone target aggro him and then that MoB brings adds. Then once the MoBs show up everyone there jumps on the most appropriate target. That way you assist off of the person who isn’t pulling but who has normally made and informed threat assessment. Also realize that if there are a bunch of mobs around if your pet gets hit on the way to the target then all bets are off and you have to crack the control leash. <br>
<br>
I also tend to wait for the crowd control to iron itself out. It doesn’t hurt to wait a few clicks before sending in the pet. My best RL friends whom I also spend a lot of time with is a Chanter and he tells me that bad Mages are worse that no mages. I realize that some errors due occur. No one is perfect.<br>
<br>
One other thing that I recently (46th level) learned is that an angry mob can taunt your pet off of their current target. You have to see it to believe it but its true. If your pet takes a beat down long enough it starts to not care about orders.<br>
<br>
As far as the /pet back off 6 times there is an inherent lag and I’ve noticed myself that with streaming hotkeys I’d rather just hit the single key myself multiple times. Seems to be more sure and effective in my experience.<br>
<br>
Also if you are going to go AFK in a group setting - /kill the pet. It doesn’t take that much manna to get him back and your party will thank you in the long run.<br>
<br>
Other than that I generally agree with everything as stated. Good leash control is critical to being an asset to a party instead of a liability.<br>

What I told my guild on pets</span><hr size=1> Pet back off doesn't work 100% of the time no matter how you time it.  And I do believe having 6 /pet back off commands on a hot key works.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because when I had /pet back off only once in the hot key, I had to press it at least two or three times to have an effect.  When I have 6 /pet back off commands, I only *ever* have to press it once to get an effect.  No matter *what* the pet is doing.  Sometimes the pet responds twice!  That would indicate to me that the commands are getting through more then once.  And face it, when things are hectic, you want to simplify everything you can so you can be most efficient in a given situation.<br>
<br>
BTW, this whole topic about not being able to get more then one line through because the rest of the lines are cut off because of spam is just not true.  That only applies to broadcast communication like /ooc, /shout or /auc (and maybe even say... haven't tested it).  If you are in a group tell you can spam all six lines.  It's a great way to learn language skills.<br>
