<br>
****<br>
Now, Im a level 65 Mage...not 61-64. Which means I have tried soloing for 4 levels, and I will say you cannot solo EFFECTIVELY like you did when you were level 30. That is pure BS. I could pretty much let the pet kill be itself at level 30 with no help from me. And you are saying you are killing mobs that hit for 300+ the same way? WHATEVER<br>
****<br>
<br>
NO we can't and SHOULDN'T eighter. Were you soloing in melee range with your dagger at 30 like you were at lvl 1 on moss snakes? Were you letting your yellow con pet murder dark blue cons at lvl 40 like you were at lvl 10? Why should a lvl 60 mage solo the same way as a level 30 mage? Soloing always got thougher as you leveled.<br>
<br>
****<br>
Now since you want to be the almighty poster boy &quot;I CAN do everything because Im a MAGE GOD&quot; switch servers to Tunare and let me watch you get you're a*s handed to you in BOT, HOH, TACTICS, TERRIS, POV, POS, etc. These are places that &quot;Kiting, Fear, and charmed pets work. Notice that only BOT is where you can solo...out of what 5 zones? How many zones can Wizards solo in? How about enchanters? How about Druids? Necros? Get the point? Did they suffer with the expansion of POP. NO.<br>
****<br>
<br>
I have personnally solo'ed in BoT, HoH, PoV and PoS, that's 4 out of 6 zones you named, only 1 of those (BoT) did I use charm to solo. About Enchanters, druids, necro, wiz, did they suffer with the expansion of PoP? YES. You act like ALL wiz, dru, nec, ench are soloing like mad. It's.... NOT... the case. <br>
<br>
Wiz: To quad kite in PoP, a wiz need a HUGE manapool. Otherwise they need to kill singles, wich is much less efficient than old world quads. Of course for wizzy who have 5k manapools, ft15, etc, then it becomes possible to quad in some places like HoH for very good xp. But by no mean are all wizzies able to do this.<br>
<br>
Druid: One of the least affected classes by PoP, I'll grant you that. DC killing in tier1, kiting or even quads kiting for uber druids is possible. Once again to get the best result you need an uber druid. Joe Sebilis druid without DC aa dressed in thurg leather armor is not gonna own PoP solo. This apply to wiz nec and dru, but I'll only mention it here to keep text as short as possible: a LOT of pop mobs can randomly pop immune to speed change spells (aka root and snare). Wich mean the spot where a_wiz_01 is kiting might not be viable on the next spawn, or might require a lot more effort and danger to kill. (for example in HoH uber wiz/dru can quad A_Valorian_guard00-04, but when A_valorian_sentry02 pops in that spot next, they are in pain.<br>
 <br>
Necro: Root dot never been their best way to kill, but they have to resort to it in PoP due to fear kiting having very little spots where it's easily doable. Charm killing in CoD is by far their best option for fast xp.<br>
<br>
Enchanter: They need a spec spell to start thinking about soloing with any regularity in PoP, without their PoP charm, enchanters don't get to make great xp in PoP. A chanter without CoD will not net the result you seem to think they would.<br>
<br>
Mages: Can't solo as well using old methods of sustaining pets. Can solo tier 1 by chaining or sustaining. Can solo PoP caster mobs easier than any other classes, only class that can still solo summoning mobs, can solo charm in BoT once 65. Uber mages can solo tier 2-3 mobs with traditional chain casting or sustaining, but it's hard. <br>
<br>
Point is, you are comparing apples to oranges. Simple point to show you that. In many occasion in this thread or others, you have mentioned that enchanters shouldn't be able to solo BoT minis. ADD MAGES.... Mages can solo BoT minis too. So we should stop chanters from doing it, but you mention nothing about mages doing the same? You even ask for our soloing power to be upgraded? Double standard? Just because &quot;you&quot; didn't do it don't mean it can't be done (it's actualy easier for a mage for some of the minis). You see the problem I have with what you are saying is that you take what a few of the best chanters, wiz, dru. nec, etc do and then pretend that every joe sebilis mage should be able to do the same. Then you have high end mage that come and point out that they can solo and get very decent xp in PoP and you totally ignore that fact. A high end mage can solo decently in PoP, in a comparable way to high end chanters, wiz, dru, nec. A low end mage can solo lightly in PoP, just like most low end of any of those classes. And how about you ask rogues, warriors, monks, clerics, SK, pallies, bst, etc how well they can solo in PoP? They too could solo pre-PoP, remember? (ok well maybe not rogues....)<br>
<br>
Here's ways to solo:<br>
<br>
high end: 1) go to BoT, charm an ele, kill a few mobs, zone, rinse, repeat. Comparable xp to any quad kiter, charmer or doter.<br>
<br>
2) go to HoH, PoV, PoS, etc, find melee mobs that don't summon and chain cast pets at them, it works. Earth pet helps, but I personnaly did it a lot with 61 air. You can also aggro kite with FoT and scar of sigils, works great too.<br>
<br>
low end: 1) Go to PoS and look for the druid or shaman mobs (don't forget dispell!) and rape them for 7% AA per kill until you get to 65, then it's 3%. There's not only the trees, flowers, bears and armadillo also come in caster version that any 61+ mage can take for great xp.<br>
<br>
2) Go to tier 1 zones and kill light blue yard trash. If you get over the mental block of fighting light blues, you'll actualy find out that it's very decent xp, not as good as grouping, but very viable. PoP Zem modifier and the fact that light blue are closer to your level and your advance to 65 make light blue xp much better than it was in old world, even with the penalty.<br>
<br>
3) think out of the box, go to old world and do mobs like lvl 60 king akanon, still decent xp even at 65. Try chain casting if you never have, try yoyo rooting if you never have, try aggro kiting if you never have.<br>
<br>
****<br>
That being said alot of Mages have went through changes just because Verant snap their fingers.<br>
<br>
Ill give you &quot;COTH&quot;...No I dont like that spell...NERFED in some zones.<br>
<br>
Ill give you &quot;MOD RODS&quot;...No I think its game breaking...NERFED<br>
<br>
Well we made you weak so Im gonna increase you Damage Output, but you will not be able to SOLO effectively anymore.<br>
****<br>
<br>
CoTH works in a lot of zones, in others (or certain area) it's disabled because it would be too easily used to exploit. What are you asking for? That CoH be allowed everywhere so we can sploit the hell of of emp room, seru's room, PoP trials, etc? The &quot;nerf&quot; is needed, it's life, be happy we have working CoH in most zones.<br>
<br>
Rods were OBVIOUSLY game breaking. It was one of the worst threat to EQ as a game that I have seen, they were as broken as manastone was 4 years ago. Do you know how powerful 300 rods ready to be used on the floor pre-fight are? (and yes I've seen 300+ rods ready on many occasion, myself on a fight like emp pre nerf I would have about 100-120 rods ready to use, then take into account there usualy was 2 other mages doing the same, bam 300+ rods or 67500 mana or 168,75 CH ready to be used).<br>
<br>
You complain about obviously broken content that was fixed... these are not nerfs, they are FIXES... You prolly were one to bitch about manaburn too before it was nerfed. Do you see the irony?<br>
<br>
****<br>
They problem is at 61-62 you can still kill in PON...very slowly. 63 those Mobs are light blue. Where as you have chanters soloing Mini-Bosses. Key word MINI-BOSSES.<br>
<br>
At 63 other classes can still solo dark blues. Why shouldnt Mages? Why should Mages only be able to solo light blue Mobs? Or go to old world zones (Umbral) to get any solo experience when you cant find a group?<br>
****<br>
<br>
Key words are MAGES CAN KILL MINI BOSS TOO! You are asking for &quot;us&quot; to be nerfed too, are you even aware of that?<br>
<br>
At 61 any mage with lvl 61 air pet can solo mobs that are dark blue at 65 still, namely the caster mobs in PoS. What's your point? We are not only able to solo light blue mobs, we can, at 61, kill DARK BLUE CON TO A 65 player.<br>
<br>
Sorry I derailled a bit from original thread purpose <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Imho PoP mage soloing is pretty decent, the incomming un-nerfing of the con system will most likely solve any whining we see here.<br>
<br>
My personnal solution would have been upgraded phantom plate spell in PoP. Call it summon planar plate built in the mold of the PoP summons (no more sucky 2hb with 5 charge of flare as summon ;P). For example a set of armor with the following stats would have helped a lot in PoP soloing.<br>
<br>
Summoned Planar BP<br>
AC: 20<br>
+5 str/sta/agi/dex +50 hp<br>
effect regeneration(worn)<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar legs<br>
AC: 18<br>
+5 str/dex/sta/agi +50 hp<br>
effect:vengence 3<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar boots<br>
AC: 15<br>
+10 agi +50 hp<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar vambraces<br>
AC: 16<br>
+10 dex +50 hp<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar bracer<br>
AC: 12<br>
+3 str/dex/agi/sta +25 hp<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar gloves<br>
AC: 15<br>
+10 str +50 hp<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
Summoned planar helm<br>
AC: 16<br>
+10 sta +50 hp<br>
class none<br>
race none<br>
<br>
There, 111 AC, +26 all melee stats, +750 hp, would definately help solo, wouldn't change much beside upping the dmg a little bit in groups or raids, would make pet tank a lot better (111ac/750 hp is significant), wouldn't infringe on other classes roles and would upgrade a mage spell line that was forgotten with PoP. It would be a great 63 spell imho.<br>
<br>
Another spell line we could have got an upgrade for that would really have helped with aggro kiting form of solo is a scar of sigils upgrade, something around 700-800 dmg for the same 2 second cast bolt would have rocked. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&lt;TDE&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>
