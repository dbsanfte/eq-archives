========================<br>
<br>
I have seen (and even repeated myself) the common view that the choice of specialization matters less once a magician has acquired Spell Casting Mastery (SCM) at some level, and continues to become less and less important as the level of SCM achieved increases. However, I have been doing some thinking on this, and I have come to the conclusion that the exact opposite may infact be the case. This post is designed to analyze this, and stimulate comment from other magi, showing where I make any mistakes or indeed agreeing with any conclusions.<br>
<br>
I will use the following basic assumptions:<br>
<br>
(1) The mana reduction for specialization at 50% and 200% skill levels are 2.5% and 10.0%, respectively. These numbers have been used in many other calculations on these boards, and I have no reason to question them.<br>
<br>
(2) The mana reduction for SCM is as follows:<br>
<br>
Mana reduction for SCM I = 2.5%<br>
Mana reduction for SCM II = 7.5%<br>
Mana reduction for SCM III = 15.0%<br>
<br>
These figures have also been oft quoted, but I have seen others quoted as well. These will do for the purpose of the calculations below, but if anyone has better figures, please state them (and your source).<br>
<br>
The assumption is extended to state, that the mana reduction for SCM stacks linearly with that for specialization.<br>
<br>
(3) The mana reduction for the mage summoned focus earring is 7.5% (on average). Again, an oft quoted figure. This assumption is extended to state, that this reduction stacks linearly with both the reductions in (1) and (2).<br>
<br>
Example Case<br>
=========<br>
<br>
Consider a 200% Spec Conjure Mage casting an Evocation Spell costing a base 400 mana. Then calculate the percentage mana saving he would have if he were to switch his specialization to Evocation.<br>
<br>
Condition 1<br>
=======<br>
<br>
This mage has no SCM skill and no mana reduction foci whatsoever. He has only his specialization skill with which to reduce his mana usage.<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 2.5%<br>
Spell cost = 390 mana<br>
<br>
Now, if he were to switch to 200% Evocation:<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 10.0%<br>
Spell cost = 360 mana<br>
<br>
Therefore for this magician, benefit of switching from Conjure to Evoke for this spell is:<br>
<br>
360/390 = 92.3, so a saving of 7.7%<br>
<br>
Condition 2<br>
=======<br>
<br>
The mage now has acquired SCM III. Woot /cheer!! He will never lose it again (unless Verant screw up and make SCM not work, and that can never* happen, ho hum ;P ).<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 2.5% (Spec) + 15.0% (SCM) = 17.5%<br>
Spell cost = 330 mana<br>
<br>
Now, if he were to switch to 200% Evocation:<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 10.0% + 15.0% = 25.0%<br>
Spell cost = 300 mana<br>
<br>
Therefore for this magician, benefit of switching from Conjure to Evoke now for this spell is:<br>
<br>
300/330 = 90.9, so a saving of 9.1%<br>
<br>
Condition 3<br>
=======<br>
<br>
The mage now has a 7.5% mana-saving focus item as well. Actually, he wonders why he wasn't using this all the time.<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 2.5% (Spec) + 15.0% (SCM) + 7.5% (Focus) = 25.0%<br>
Spell cost = 300 mana<br>
<br>
Now, if he were to switch to 200% Evocation:<br>
<br>
Mana reduction = 10.0% + 15.0% + 7.5% = 32.5%<br>
Spell cost = 270 mana<br>
<br>
Therefore for this magician, benefit of switching from Conjure to Evoke for this spell is:<br>
<br>
270/300 = 90.0, so a saving of 10.0%<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
=======<br>
<br>
Just specialization: saves 7.7%<br>
Spec+SCM III: saves 9.1%<br>
Spec+SCM III+Focus: saves 10.0%<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
=======<br>
<br>
Unless I have made some serious error in my calculations, or one of the assumptions is way off, it seems that the effect of specialization choice actually gets MORE pronounced as you gain more mana reduction capabilities, in terms of the percentage effect any given mage would notice on their own mana usage. This seems to be the exact opposite of previously considered wisdom.<br>

This does, however make the assumption that you are using them almost primarily on mobs that are not highly resistant to fire.  We have no magic based dd's, and only 2 magic based rains, that use an evoc check (not counting any PoP spells, or sub-49 spells).<br>
<br>
Evocation is not all we do, though.  We use alteration with pet buffs and some heals, conjuration with our pets, item summons, high level heals, and some of our nukes.  We also use abjuration for our fire shields and self-only buffs, and divination for invis.<br>
<br>
If you take a cross section of our abilities, conjuration provides the greatest mix of abilities and benefits.  Naturally, you have to weigh this in with &quot;what do I use most of my mana for?&quot;  That should determine your best bet for specialization. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A> at: 10/19/02 8:57:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usuzannadreamingheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SuzannaDreamingheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#333333>(10/20/02 8:46:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Effect of SCM on Specialization Choice</span><hr size=1> Jochan,<br>
<br>
You have entirely misunderstood the purpose of the thread. It is not at all about specialization choice and whether one is better than the other for various situations/playstyles. That has been discussed elsewhere.<br>
<br>
It is about, given *any* specialization choice, whether or not the AA Skill 'Spell Casting Mastery' actually makes the choice (whichever it is!) more or less significant. My example was merely that: an example. It would equally have been relevant had I chosen a Divination spell and cast with Abjuration and Divination specializations, but I tried to choose a 'realistic' example.<br>
<br>
Historically, many magi on these boards have stated, that the effect of specialization becomes LESS significant once one acquires SCM. I am stating here, based on these calculations, that I believe we were wrong in this, and that quite the opposite is true, i.e., that once a mage has acquired SCM, the impact of their specialization choice (whichever it is) is made all the more significant.<br>
<br>
Understand?<br>
<br>
Please actually read a thread through thoroughly before replying to an entirely different question than that that was being addressed.<br>
<br>
=====<br>
<br>
Just to address your sidetrack anyway:<br>
<br>
Specifically, yes, I know the mage spell lists, and I did not request nor do I need a lesson in them, thank you very much.<br>
<br>
Your opinion that conjuration gives you the &quot;greatest mix of abilities and benefits&quot; is simply that, your opinion for your playstyle. I totally disagree, but it is not the subject of this thread, and I do not want this thread hijacking to become yet another specialization choice debate. If you want to do that, feel free, but please start another thread for it.<br>

<br>
To further confirm my agreement with you, SCM obviously should not affect your choice in specialization, it should only enhance it.  This is proven in your numbers, once again, in an obvious fashion.<br>
<br>

50 spec: 3% reduction<br>
<br>
SCM3: 10% reduction<br>
<br>
So, without SCM main/sec spec is: 97/89= 1.09 and with SCM3 its 87/79 = 1.10. <br>
<br>
So, actually the difference with SCM becomes slightly larger just as you noted. Thats because the reductions are made off the original spell cost - not the already reduced cost.<br>
<br>
In short - you are correct. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 697<br> <font color=#333333>(10/21/02 3:17:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Effect of SCM on Specialization Choice</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Historically, many magi on these boards have stated, that the effect of specialization becomes LESS significant once one acquires SCM.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If that were the case, there wouldn't be so many magicians in a quandary over specialization choice.  What you may be referring to is this:<br>
<br>
spec 50 = 2.5% savings, with SCM 3 that becomes 17.5%.  On a 200 mana spell it would be 195 mana for spec 50 and no SCM, while with SCM 3 it becomes 165 mana.  Adding SCM 3 to a non-spec skill equals a 15.38% increase in relative efficiency, which is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> more efficiency than simply changing specialization and not training SCM</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
What this means is that a magician now doesn't feel as bad about not switching specialization, because he/she got a significant boost to efficiency anyway.  The bottom line is that specialization makes a difference, and an easily measurable one, but it is not as significant as training in SCM in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=shlakor>Shlakor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(10/24/02 5:05:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Effect of SCM on Specialization Choice</span><hr size=1> Without the godrods, i think it comes down to playstyle.<br>
<br>
If you chain pets as your primary damage (ie, no epic, no PoP pets) then conj is definately the way to go.<br>
<br>
If you have epic, or a pop pet, or even group alot with teh 60 water, where you dont reclaim your pet, but spend most of your time nuking for damage, then evoc is currently the way to go...<br>
<br>
I'm currently in camp one, but spending more and more of my time in camp 2. Another thing to consider is at 65, our nuke switches back to conj.<br>
<br>
Really, there is no &quot;right&quot; answer anymore. It really depends on your play style. I'm leaving mine at conj till i get to 65 and then feel out the lay of the land. I switched from evoc to conj back at 56 in the godrod days and it took till 60 really to get spec to 200. I figure switching again might be premature and actually hurt me as I do alot of chaining while solong.
