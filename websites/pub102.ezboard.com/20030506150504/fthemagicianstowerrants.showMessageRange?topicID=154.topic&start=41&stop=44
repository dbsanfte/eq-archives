&lt;&lt;and welcome to the Internet, i have a black belt, a supermodel girlfriend, and I drive a 100,000 dollar car.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
You obviously do not unless daddy bought both for you.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;hi, i played Starcraft, but as fun as Unit-Counterunit BS no tactics rushing is, i went to better games. So how bout you load the ole game up and go back to 7v1 comp stomps that you prolly enjoyed, or vs'ing the cpu and thinking yer l33t.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Usually when people start using the word &quot;l33t&quot; I completly loose respect for them any any crap that spews from their mouth/keyboard.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;What skill are you talking about btw? the skill it takes to hit the A key on some mobs, or to hit a few buttons to pop some pixels on someone? There's not very much skill in this game, it isn't some non-stop-action fighting game, or dogfighter. There is some, but not very much for you to talk about l33t skillz that are needed to kill some mob.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
There is not?  How about getting the right 12 people and classes to clear the first floor of hate?  Then splitting the 30k in cash loot and leaving thinking.. wow I achomplished somehting and got 2 friends epic parts.<br>
<br>
That is skill since healers need to know when to heal, mezzers must know when to mez and how to stay alive, oh.. and tanks need to know when to taunt and what weapon to use to be most effective.  Thats skill and its something &quot;zerg masters&quot; like yourself hardly begin to grasp.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;What the flying @#%$ game are you playing? Nothing will ever improve for us post 55? They've added new mod rods, which is more than nuff, they've added /pet hold, so the hell what if you have go through alt advancement, THEY PUT IT IN THEY DON'T COMPLETELY IGNORE US, so you're full of bullshit.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Hmm.. so you think the new mod rod spell is a vast improvment to our class.  Sure they are if you are a mage that loves changing to a completely support role at post 50 levels. <br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I dissagree, but as Analogy's seem to be beyond you're comprehension, i'll just drop it.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Sorry I did not care much for FPS games.. seems like you did.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;k, let's get one thing straight, None of those zones other than ToV you listed are top end zones, if you think they are you can go back to bustin up OS and tellin me how the King spawn is top end.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
&quot;bustin&quot;?  We speaking the same language?  The top end MOBs in Hate and Fear are TOP end encounters.  Yes both zones although old are top end.. and even the crap loot found on the lesser mobs is about equal to the quest stuff you get in Thurg.  Its a real toss up.<br>
<br>
ToV is obviously the very top end that much of us will stop at, some of us will go to PoM (since last series of nerfs however I doubt I will waste my time again there).  And a minority of us will go to Sleepers.<br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;On a raid i know my role isnt to dish out dmg, it's to provide CoH, it's to provide mod rods, and if people wish Elemental blanket/shard of core.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Oh it is?  I spent level 1 though 54 dealing damage, why the hell do I want to be a support role character?  If I wanted that I would have been a cleric.  From level 54 though 60 I did my time doing the stupid support role VI gave us.  Now I am done with being a support caster, its not what I signed up for and it was not what I was from level 1 though low 50s.<br>
<br>
I am NOT the only mage that thinks this way.<br>
<br>
If you want to be the summoner of worthless trash and giver away of mana then go ahead, have fun.<br>
<br>
<br>
 &lt;&lt;On an exp group i'll dish out dmg, and if i try will outdmg prolly anyone else over the course of the night. epic's DPS keeps up fairly well + nukes + DS's, not to mention i can still provide mod rods/coh.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Yeah you will when your allowed to make a pet.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Today in chardok we had about 4-5 sarnaks mezzed, and we lived cuz of one reason, mod rods. Not group friendly? you're full of @#%$, the chanter and cleric were buzzing around me like pirannah's waiting for the rods to hit the ground.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
LOL<br>
<br>
Thats so sad and to think if they had a necro there mana pumping you would be 100% worthless.<br>
<br>
Mages were simply not ment to be a support class nor were Necros.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;btw you're just as insulting a prick as me, i just do it in not so many words. i say @#%$ yourself, you say that i'm a child who is immature and needs to grow up. You've got a paragraph at the end insulting me, i do it with a few simple words, so again, F'off. Isn't it time for you to start bitching about how on Saryn you arn't a bunch of silver spooned mages who get everything they want on their epic just by asking the loving uber guilds, but on your server their evil and treat their mages like dirt. <br>

You started this argument 1 year ago.  You are right about 1 thing, we are both annoying.  We are so because this has become a personal confortation.  You just enjoy arguing with somone since I see no other reason for why you started the hostilities.  <br>
<br>
Your tag line makes me laugh each time I see it.. it used to be annoying.  Now I find it amusing.<br>
<br>
I am sure I will find this thread amusing a while from now when Warcraft III Online comes out and I switch to that.<br>

<br>
You have no idea how scary it is to think I'm arguing with someone that actually seems to think that was a serious statement<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Usually when people start using the word &quot;l33t&quot; I completly loose respect for them any any crap that spews from their mouth/keyboard.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
and when people can't seem to grasp the difference between lose and loose, i start to lose respect for them.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;&quot;bustin&quot;? We speaking the same language? The top end MOBs in Hate and Fear are TOP end encounters. Yes both zones although old are top end.. and even the crap loot found on the lesser mobs is about equal to the quest stuff you get in Thurg. Its a real toss up.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
caster(at least mage) armor from PoH/PoF seems comparable to Thurg, but meelee armor far outweighs the old stuff from PoH/PoF, even Kunark BP's arn't as good as Thurg's, let alone Kael's.  And no, they are not top end zones, sorry.  Only hard parts in there are CT/Inny, even the insane hp golem over in PoF is a @#%$.  <br>
<br>
But nice relevant point you got there, trying to put some of your wit together to make fun of me for saying bustin.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That is skill since healers need to know when to heal, mezzers must know when to mez and how to stay alive, oh.. and tanks need to know when to taunt and what weapon to use to be most effective. That's skill and its something &quot;zerg masters&quot; like yourself hardly begin to grasp.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
So a cleric needs to know that when a tanks health starts getting low they need to hit a button...a chanter needs to know that when lots of stuff comes, he needs to click the mez button on what the main tank isnt hitting...and the tank needs to know to mash the taunt button, and have whatever weps he can afford/was lucky enough to get?  damn the skill is just overwhelming.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Hmm.. so you think the new mod rod spell is a vast improvement to our class. Sure they are if you are a mage that loves changing to a completely support role at post 50 levels&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
k, now come back to reality with me and the rest of the mages.  We aren't a damage dealing class on raids, we never have been.  We can deal dmg, but we help out a raid more by makin rods, an CoH'ing, the dmg is nice, beats what a necro does.  As you yourself keep saying you can't use a pet anywhere, what kind of dmg did you think you were doing?  On some areas we can, but guess what, if you want to deal dmg play a @#%$ wizard and quit bitching about mages because the class you chose to play didn't turn out exactly how you wanted it.  Jesus tap dancing Christ, there's hundreds of thousands of peeps that play this game, do you think because you're one of the minority that think our class is broken it's going get fixed?  <br>
<br>
They are working on the mage, believe it or not, they've put a lot of stuff in for us we've asked for, and it actually makes me feel sorry for those @#%$ that they have to listen to bags of @#%$ like yourself who can't give them credit for attempting to listen to us.  I'm waiting for the day they work on pathing, and it pisses me off rather than work on pathing in ONE zone they nerf'd our best 50  spell.  but guess what, they've actually took some of our bitching to heart, and to me that shows that they actually do listen<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Thats so sad and to think if they had a necro there mana pumping you would be 100% worthless.<br>
<br>
Mages were simply not ment to be a support class nor were Necros.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Ya but guess what?  there wasn't a necro there, so i got to sit there with pet and nukes and deal out some nice dmg, and have the ability to x-fer mana over to the healer and mezzer, which we would have died if i hadn't, so guess fuckin what, that isn't 3rd rate support.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Sorry I did not care much for FPS games.. seems like you did.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
there's 100 times more skill in FPS than RTS games, sorry but building faster with a set strategy to rush someone doesn't compare to the amount of skill it takes to aim shots and use the different guns, or jump around the lvl via firing a gun into the ground and still pulling shots off at people 50 feet below you while your flying through the air uncontrolled.  <br>
<br>
So take your middle management ass and F'off at whatever piss ant dead end company you work at, while i enjoy my youth, k?<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;You started this argument 1 year ago. You are right about 1 thing, we are both annoying. We are so because this has become a personal confortation. You just enjoy arguing with somone since I see no other reason for why you started the hostilities. &gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
I didn't start an argument, i saw you crying over complete bullshit about how the mage is broken because it doesn't fit in exactly how you thought it should, and told you to go @#%$ yourself.  And unless you enjoy arguing wouldn't you be the Mature one as you keep claiming that i'm nothin but a kid, yet you seem to deem me worthy of a response each time.  Also rather sad that while again i'm an immature kid it seems you take enough of this so seriously as to keep track of the time you've been arguing with me.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;Your tag line makes me laugh each time I see it.. it used to be annoying. Now I find it amusing.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Well a dim bulb brightens, it seems you finally caught on that it's meant as a joke.<br>
<br>
The only thing that pisses me off about you is you cry and moan about us being broken, that anyone not on Saryn is a baby mage who gets handed their epic, and you seem to think that being 13 years older than me somehow makes you enlightened<br>

<br>
If mages could use pets on all raids or at least the majority of them the class would not be BROKEN post 55.<br>
<br>
I love playing my mage but would like to deal damage against top end mobs in ToV and other zones like I used to pre to low 50s in Sol B and Lower G.<br>
<br>
The reason this will not happen is because the time and effort to fix all high end zones would be too high.  Even if it was fixed the &quot;culture&quot; is anti-pet and anti-mage already on most servers thus it will not matter.<br>
<br>
So yes.. you are quite right we are now a support class and have been for a long time.  <br>
<br>
The problem is folks that play offence right into the early 50s will not easily change to a pure support role.<br>
<br>
This is why there are so many mages like myself that are infact &quot;grief players&quot;.<br>
<br>
In a year or 2 when EQ 2 (so many rumors on this are around) comes out I highly doubt anyone will<br>
care much.  The majority of us will dump EQ and move to the new game or move to Star Wars online.  Some of us will take a look at DAoC again or simply drop out of the MMOG world.<br>
<br>
I might at that point feel sorry for all the Clerics, Warriors, Melee - Hybrids, Enchanters, Shaman, Rougs, and Monks that leveled up their VI Loved classes and obtained fame and glory only to be cut down when does servers shutdown.<br>
