<br>
First off I play a mage since about 2.5 years (about 150 days played). I have no alt char above lvl 20. If I ever made an alt, I needed some of its abilities to help my mage. So, you can say I am a pure mage. Being that, I dare to say, I have an idea what the mage class is about. Here is what I would expect the new mage spells for PoP expansion to be like. I wont invent new spell lines, just further develop existing ones.<br>
<br>
Seeing the spells that are now being beta-tested, I dont see the mage class consequently developed further in PoP.<br>
<br>
Here is what spell lines I feel the need to be implemented in the new PoP expansion:<br>
<br>
1) Pets. You got those. Make each of them unique pls. I always loved the variety of pets. Add Monster Summoning 4 pls and make it a pure high melee damage pet without any procs or spells. Remember that the mage class is very dependant on their pets. They are our main weapon. I never felt our nukes should be our best weapon, but pets should be. Thats why I also think a spell like Black Steel is very nice and sufficient. I want to make the biggest portion of damage with my pet. Point. BUT I want to be able to use them on EVERY single mob. Recent pet changes helped that tremendously. Thanks for that.<br>
<br>
2) Burn Out series. If you up haste component, remember to up haste cap. Maybe add a HP component to it.<br>
<br>
3) Damage shield. I would expect a single target one (for pet or main tank) and a group one.<br>
<br>
4) Summons. Please give us usefull weapons for our pets finally (pet only, not player usable, like muzzle of mardu mask, thats a superb spell now, that you upped haste cap finally, thanks for that also). Either they should give a damage proc or &quot;utility&quot; proc (debuff of some kind). I dont want anymore summons to hand out to other players. We have enough of that.<br>
<br>
5) Nukes. Lines I see here are: single target magic/fire nuke (non LOS), bolt type spell, slightly better mana/damage ratio (LOS), personal area based spell (upgrade to scintilation), rain based targetted spell (upgrade to mealstrom of electricity) and pls add an upgrade to Scars of Sigil (fast cast low damage spell). If PoP will have more summoned mobs, dont forget an upgrade to our anti summoned nuke line of spells please.<br>
<br>
6) Personal shield buffs. ONE shield spell (HP, AC and magic resist, at lvl 61), phantasmal protection upgrade (around 8 HP and 6 mana regen per tic, at lvl 63), elemental shield upgrade (around +50 to fire and cold, everything less is a bad joke with the changed resists, at lvl 62)<br>
<br>
7) Mal...xxx. That one is alrd in the spell line up for PoP. should be seldomly resisted (maybe around 450 mana). But it should be upped to 75 decrease on all resists.<br>
<br>
8 )  Now use your creativity and bring something new to the class that is not a derivative from another class. Mages on this board have given tons of very classlike ideas that are by no means overpowering and make the mage class more fun to play. While summoned mezz and charm are interesting ideas, there should be more unique ideas - COMMON BE CREATIVE PLEASE.<br>
<br>
9) Not realated to PoP spells, but pls make the mod rod 2 spell summon a 10 charge mod rod (same mana/HP ratio on the effect) AND put a 10-15 tic recast delay on it. THX. Cause I am NOT HAVING FUN casting this spell over and over again for hours to give my mana to other classes. Thats not why I made a mage. If I have to cast this spell 30 to 20 times per hour I wouldnt mind, but right now I am more like casting it 50-100 times or even more often. Thats insane.<br>
<br>
10) Now re-evaluate the mage class alternative skills and throw in a few new, which cater to our spell line up and you have a ton satisfied customers who will gladly pay you the monthly fee while having a good time playing their mage.<br>
<br>
Please consider these things, when you finalize the mage spell line up for PoP. Its not too late yet.<br>

<br>
If you want to post something, PLEASE!!!! make it productive and positive. I really have enough of all this negativity here. No Verrant employee will be reading those endless threads with tons of negativity in it.<br>
<br>
Maybe we could make this thread some kind of a poll. Do you agree with most of my points or do you disagree with most of my ideas.<br>
<br>
Just state that, maybe give a list with what ideas you agree and with what ideas you dont agree (ideas 1-10). Afterwards we could maybe refine it and send it to the developers boards. Pls dont come up with any new ideas yet. This is just meant to give Verrant a clue what mages think about their classes spell lines and role defining spell lines that alrdy exist. Because obviously they are a bit off track in the moment for our PoP spells, which does not mean that it is too late yet to get it all back in track.<br>
<br>
Verrant has proved that they seem to listen to their player base (at least recently). So, why not get back to a creative dialogue with developers at Verrant. Its for the sake of all of us. If you all be honest, you like to play your mage and would mind to stop playing him/her. So cease this ranting and start getting positive again. Will help us all.<br>
<br>
So, please help, dont rant, be positive, state with what ideas you agree, disagree. No comments regarding other classes PoP spells pls. That only leads to rants.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

P.S.: Would it be possible that a moderator of this board could watch this thread and make it a positive and constructive thread in the end? Anyone? Maybe make it a sticky for some time?

<br>
one of the restricting factor is the mana to cast the rod in the first places.... (even with healers and rune items)<br>
<br>
because  if your idea went in ... mages with SoA .. will have literarlly unlimited mana ... not like the FT 70 it is now .... <br>

think it's a bit overpowering... <br>

Given that pets are what I consider our Forte', I would like to see our new spells and abilities focus around those.  Like an AA or ability to affinity with a particular element, making pets of that type significantly stronger.  Spells that additional augmentation or improve our pets, adding HP speed damage or abilities.

Number one, expand my usefulness in a group and in raid setting. A mage should be MORE than a portaly mod rod despenser, cother for the late.<br>
<br>
Number two EXPAND the soloable mobs, make the spawn more frequently and decrease agro ranges. There are FEW soloable mobs and about TEN to one hundred times the soloists as there are mobs, at least this is how Fennin ro server is. I would like to log on at OH 7 pm central not 2 am, and STILL have plenty of mobs to nicely SHARE. So double the number of mobs you THINK you need, and don't up the stupid resists, That is just plain ANNOYING and wastes mana, or runs players away from a zone that you spent precious time creating (I am thinking of Wakening lands).<br>
<br>
Number three YES please MORE pet class summoned items, like ARMOR they will wear and use and a wepon I would ACTUALLY give to them (rather than using for a toothpick or newbie party favors).<br>
<br>
Number four how about a COOL new graphic for the POP pets, I don't know Earth pet bigger and more colorful gems on the back, frost pet look like an abominable snow beast, Wind pet proc a tornado looking thingie, Fire pet a new unique look playing on the fire theme. I personally LIKE the air plane look of pets, could make pets have a different look on different planes. <br>
<br>
<br>
These are just my ideas, Dev team you are PAID to think outside of the box and creatively, its your &quot;job&quot; so to speak. I would like to add that the rewards DO need adjustment, if it takes 80 people to kill it, it should drop MORE than a junk weapon that no NEWB would use and 5 pl, at least a FEW good items to pass around would be nice. Also PLEASE spread the spells around the zones, and if it is a level 62 spell put it on a beast that a SINGLE group of level 62's can kill, NOT a guild of 65s with ALL AA maxed and primal weps with FULL planar skills and on and on.<br>

I have other characters as well. Ive done most everything in this game from helping n00bies to killing dragons etc etc. <br>
<br>
Summonning one mod rod for more mana with more charges as long as the ratio stayed the same would not be overpowering. It would be EXTREAMLY nice. No longer would our rods rot. Nor would we have to dish out 200 of them a fight. We could make a few previous to fight and be done with it for a few kills. So we could actually play the game VS being a pez dispencer. <br>
<br>
Nukes... READ: &quot;Winter's Frost Single Target Cold Based Direct Damae (Max: 1395) Evo. 380 65 ; Sun Vortex Single Target Fire Based Direct Damage (Max: 1300) Evo. 400 65 &quot;<br>
<br>
Druids out nuking us in damage...... + they get heal spells, regeneration, snare, mana regeneration, sow, ports, a baby bear pet (not that they need or use it) AE spells, etc. <br>
sorry but change the Damage and the mana used on our spells please. According to VI (that YOU!) Magicians are the second highest on the Damage Scale under Wizards. <br>
<br>
Epic Pet... + our new pets..... you need to change the epic pet so it gains levels as well level. INCLUDING its spells. Or the new pets will be the only thing anyone uses and even questing for your epic will go our the window. <br>
<br>
As said above. We need a point blank AE spell. We need the spells you have listed changed both in mana and Damage. <br>
<br>
A new pet heal would also be nice. Or increase the drop rate on the 60th level pet heal. As only .5% of the magicians on our server have it.  <br>
