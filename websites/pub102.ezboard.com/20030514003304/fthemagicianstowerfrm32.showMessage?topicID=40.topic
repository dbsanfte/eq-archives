<br>
Saw a Necro today with Dire Charm, belive me, it aint very funny to summon your pet afterwards. It is sick to see those quading 130 pets, they ripp apart exp mobs in seconds. That necro easy soloed 4 mobs in the same time I soloed 1, and I was using epic and Boots of Bladecalling I also had regen and kodiaks so Mana wasn't a problem.<br>
<br>
I don't really expect to get a pet that strong, because frankly I think Verant will nerf Dire Charm in some way, I doubt it was meant to be possible for Necros, Enchanters and druids to gain 1 yellow bubble in less than 30mins. But it feel stupid that the prime pet class now are dropped down to 4th pet class.<br>
<br>
Then add to the fact that some of our spell are broken since Kunark, some of our skills don't work ... Even the fact epicpet look like a human and bolts not showing anymore.<br>
<br>
Then they did the major melee upgrade a few months ago they said this wasn't the caster upgrades, but they should look at those as soon as Luclin was released. What happend with this, Luclin been out a while now how long shall we wait? Or have Verant decided that Luclin was the fix they was talking about?<br>
<br>
We really need to get a straight answer about that. Since Ronaldor seems to be on a good side with Alan maybe he can get a straight answer on that question.<br>
<br>
Is the caster improvments that was mention a few months ago considered done?<br>
If they not considered done, then can we expect them to happen? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rhasinfirestorm>Rhasin Firestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 150<br> <font color=#333333>(1/11/02 6:13:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Petition about improved skills and bugfix</span><hr size=1> Edit: Err...

Almost made me sick to my stomach.<br>
<br>
Mages are so far behind on the power curve right now... or the usefullness curve... or the raid contributions curve... hell, ANY curve there is we're bottom of it, it seems.<br>
<br>
Enchanters, Necros, &amp; Druids can now get effectively a yellow of XP every 30 minutes (I have verified this with a 60 Druid friend of mine, as well as a 60 Chanter. They both can get those rates).  Because of special skills and how they boost the melee classes now, there are monks soloing away with 4 to 6 times as many AA points as ANY caster I know (this may change with Dire Charm, tho). I personally know melee-types who've got over 100+ AA Points. That just nauseates me a tad when I'm still struggling to get out of level 55... and a few of the things that Verant PROMISED US as regular fixes (i.e. /pet hold) got made into Alternate Advancement items.<br>
<br>
Overall, I am both rousingly pleased and excruciatingly pissed off at Shadows of Luclin, as an expansion. <p><center><image src="http://home.houston.rr.com/jtully1/tunisig.jpg"><br><b>Tuni Gearspinner</b><br>

Even up until people started plundering the high end velious game, Magicians have always been a pretty potent, pretty one dimensional class. What other class is able to both provide a reasonable amount of damage absorbtion AND damage output like a Magician? We have a very flexible equation for damage absorbtion and damage output when fighting non uber mobs. Want to tank something for a long time? Chain cast epic pets and then earth pets. Need to kill something quick? Burn it down, we have a nice DPS damage spell (Scars), rains (against single targets the 3 waves stack up, especially if you land malosi first), and of course the absolute best damage shields in the game.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that Magicians largely suffer from one of the same problems that Druids have, that is being middle ground across the board and not being able to excel in any one area. Yes, we  can do alot of damage absorbtion, and alot of damage dealing, however we can't compare with the classes which excel at either. Combine this with an increase of high personel requirement zones which will almost ensure that you'll have several damage absorbers and damage dealers along, and a severe lack of utility (disabled CoH anyone?), and you have a class which, on paper, looks pretty good, but in practice, is suffering.<br>
<br>
Until we get a long time magician at a high enough level in Verant in order to effect some serious changes, I doubt these problems will ever go away either. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.rpi.edu/~redina/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/02 4:31:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Petition about improved skills and bugfix</span><hr size=1> look, guys... you are compairing a class w/ a very potent arch ability aaxp skill, to a class without an arch ability aaxp skill.<br>
<br>
what im trying to say is, before knocking dire charm as unfair at least compair a frenzied burnout pet to a dire charmed pet. frenzy burnout CAN be refreshed, and it gives our pet +200 atk (!) and +90 haste, amongst other + stats.<br>
<br>
if the dire charm pet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  still</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> outdamages the frenzy burnout pet, then i fullly agree, either nerf d.c. or upgrad f.b.<br>
<br>
also, you have to take into consideration that dire charm is limited to mobs under 46. frenzied burnout however can be used anywhere, without any limitations. paired with pet hold, this skill will make us much more raid friendly.<br>
<br>
<br>
one more thing:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It is sick to see those quading 130 pets, they ripp apart exp mobs in seconds.

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
there are level 45 mobs which quad for 130? lol please show me what zone <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> youre in</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
most level 45 mobs double hit for 100-120s. granted, thats more than our pet, but saying they &quot;quad for 130&quot; is a bit extreme. <br>
anyway, in the very near future i see verant nerfing d.c. so that you cannot heal or buff your perma-charmed pet. <br>
verant quite simply <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  did not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> intend on people using these perma charmed npcs as permanent super pets (as strange as that sounds). <br>
charm is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  primarily</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a cc spell, and only secondary an offensive spell. <br>
its the kinda thing which was intended to be used like loh -- just in case in a messy situation (for example, in an undead dungeon where the chanter died due to a bad pull, the necro in your group could hit dire charm and potentially save the group.) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 55 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 32 Erudite Enchantress<br> Morell Thule server.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 1/12/02 4:39:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zeem>Zeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/02 5:17:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Class skills</span><hr size=1> Noonie,<br>
<br>
Frenzy Burnout can't be refreshed, it is 72min refresh cycle on it, and the buff last 36sec, after the 36sec are up your pet suicide.<br>
Someone posted a log with a frenzid pet, it kinda looks like the pet even miss more than usually. It say it Flurry and Rampage, rampage might be hard to see if no other mobs near, the Flurry didn't even show (there should been 2 extra hits). <br>
It can't compare to Dire charm.<br>
Luclin have ALOT of way undercon mobs, go into Griegs end and you will find green mobs that hit for 150+ (and rampage), I heard someone said the mobs near entrance of Deep was Dire charmable, and those hit for more than 200. <br>
Go into Acrylia near ring of fire and those skellies hit for over 130, at round three of ring of fire the skellies that spawns are green but still hit for 160. I could go on, but a chanter will in 90% of the exp zones have no problem at all finding mobs that hit for 125-135.<br>
<br>
The problem aint either that they just gave Enchanters the skill, they also gave necromancers and druids, so that suddenly three classes that now have very good pets that clearly outdmg us.<br>
If Frenzy was permanent buff or even 36 min buff and it added 20pt dmg , 200 attack 95% haste, flurry rampage it would be good, it kinda would have been half as good as Direcharm, but a 36sec buff there you lose your pet and you can't really see the diffrence are useless.<br>
<br>
The truth is that I really wanted to see ONE good class skill that was worth it, just ONE. Pet hold is the only one I will take as it is now. <br>
From what I seen there someclass skills that have extremly powerfull skills, then you see a Pally do a 5k critical hit you feel kinda weak.<br>
<br>
For start they could do a few things that would make me feel alittle better. <br>
Lower the refresh timer of Elemantal forms and remove the kos component (hello the skill cost a fortune and gives less improvment than wizard familiars).<br>
Increase the duration of Frenzy burnout to permanent, and make sure it add some extra dmg.<br>
Give us Spell casting fury mastery, I could have agreed that this should only been a wizardskill, but then Druids get it mages certanly should too.<br>
And finaly give us some equal to Dire Charm, well maybe they should call it something else since we never charmed stuff before ...  Maybe call it Monstersumming mastery .. or something, instead of charm a mob and instead of do like normal monstersummoning (summon an elemantal and put monster skin on it), instead it cloned any L40-L45 mob that happend to be in the zone and made it your pet. Same refresh timer as Dire charm ofcourse, a little lower risk than Direcharm, but yuo couldn't be sure you got a L40 crappet or a L45 good pet. This would fit our profile, it would be easy to do, and it wouldn't be more powerfull than Direcharm.<br>
<br>
As it is now, none of our class skills are good, they really need to balance these stuff out a bit. We where the weakest class before Luclin, Luclin but us even further behind (ok, maybe bard was worse).<br>
<br>
But as I said before the most important thing I want to know is this.<br>
<br>
Is the caster improvments that was mention a few months ago considered done?<br>
If they not considered done, then can we expect them to happen?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rhasinfirestorm>Rhasin Firestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 155<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/02 6:13:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Class skills</span><hr size=1> Frankly, for something alongs the Monstersummoning Mastery, I'd love to see it be something passive and go off our Monster Summoning spells. Cast MS2 or MS3 (ratings change, as does what you can summon), but you get an almost identical copy of that monster that you randomly summon. Of course, it would tend to work better in higher powered zones and less in newbie zones, but hey, I'd go for that.<br>
<br>
But basically, Dire Charm is overpowering. ESPECIALLY if one can cast beneficial buffs on the charmie, heal it, etc. Isn't this going to be Kael all over again? <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>

They don't take into account any logistical issues about how they're charmed, and re-rate the mob accordingly. <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>

I'll also admit that I feel weak that a druid is not only able to get a incredibly better pet than me( dire charm), but can easily outnuke me also( faster direct damage skill).  <br>
<br>
  It appears obvious to me that a mage's ability to deal direct damage through spells has been outpaced, but the only thing that I see mages being able to do is summon things faster. I became a mage, because I wanted to deal damage, not be a vending machine.  <br>
<br>
  Mages have always supposed to been THE pet class. If nothing else, we have unquestionably the best pets. We lost our number 2 spot in DD capability to Druids when Kunark came out. The focus of a post 50 mage was pets, and with the exception of CoH, nothing else. And with the way that charm works, many a chanter/druid/necro now can easily make a pet far better than the epic. My only question is, what is there left for mages? <br>

<br>
Not only does the pet NOT have it's attack speed or statistics increased very much (ie number of hits, haste speed, and damage per hit) if anything at all... but the supposed 'explosion' that happens to the pet.. doing 'massive untold damage to anything within range'..?<br>
<br>
It doesn't happen. Pet just 'poofs' at the end of the 36 seconds. I've seen this skill demonstrated for me twice... and it's a flabberghastingly large waste of AA Points, to say the least.<br>
<br>
I say it's time to storm the gates and tell Verant that mages are sick of being walked on! <p><center><image src="http://home.houston.rr.com/jtully1/tunisig.jpg"><br><b>Tuni Gearspinner</b><br>

All the above destroy us: 2-4x what we can do in the same time frame.  SKs, Rangers, and paladins are slightly better.  Enchanters with dire charm destroy us.<br>
<br>
10th best solo class is more like it ... and we have about zero advantage over straight melee classes like warriors and rogues (with optimal equipment) these days.<br>
<br>
I don't know about bards - I don't have any 60th level bard friends to compare against - but I wouldn't be surprised if they also outperform us.<br>
<br>
Only clerics are straight out WORSE than us at soloing.  That is pretty sad.<br>

all I have to say, its bullshit, all this time we were being walked on it was &quot;oh but you still have the best pets&quot; now we can work on our epic for how long?  months, years, still not get it, finally get it MAYBE if we're EXTREMELY lucky, just to see an enchanter be able to spend MUCH less time getting a skill that makes a pet that destroys our epic pet... so chanter, druid, and necro have better pets, wizzy and druid nuke better... druid damageshield is very similiar to ours most of the way up...<br>
<br>
am I missing something?  dont we look like nothing but a very weak druid, with no sows/ports/root/snare/effective dots/heals/buffs/everything else, so we can't do all that, but our nukes, and now pets are behind them, the only thing we have that they dont are these wonderful summons, oh and CoH but now we can't use that in half the zones...<br>

I do agree though.

ah, its mostly exadurated. keep in mind, when bls first get their pets they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be overconned since they must last roughly 10 something levels <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  and</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be roughly as powerful as a necro pet. the super damage the bsts warder does the first level he gets it, he makes up for by doing pathetic damage the level before he gets a new pet.<br>
<br>
<br>
anyway, recently i had the opportunity to duel a level 39 beastlord pet with my level 39 earth pet. <br>
<br>
i used everything a level 39 mage would most likely have to buff my pet (except the ds of course): <br>
bo2, earth staff, summoned platemail, summoned daggers (3), an elemental blanket, and an elemental defender.<br>
<br>
the beastlord did the same. <br>
he used the level 39 level buff, enchanted his pet w/ spirit of scorpion pet proc, and buffed his warder w/ all his shammy hand-me-down buff spells.<br>
<br>
an uninvolved rogue conned our pets. <br>
she said the mage pet was even to her, so it was level 30. the bsts pet was lvl 31.<br>
<br>
the results? mage pet won w/ roughly 25% health left. <br>
i was quite surprised. i figured the bst pet would have been stronger due to the fact it has to last them 10 levels. i can only imagine how much stronger a 44 mage pet is than a 44 bsts pet.<br>
<br>
edit: i just realized that the elemental blanket is a level 49 spell, i thought it was earlier. <br>
ah well, the pets proc was poison based, and the blanket doesnt give pr resistance. my pet gained only 1 ac while wearing the blanket so it bares no influence on the outcome really anyway. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 55 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 32 Erudite Enchantress<br> Morell Thule server.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 1/15/02 10:22:23 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=40.topic&start=21&stop=24>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=40.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=40.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=40.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=40.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=40.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=40.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
