Seems so Cyricus, I'm only casual now myself due to college.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for FB, I'm indifferent to them removing the explosion.  As was stated it would probably be resistable, not do substantial damage, and leave us vulnerable.<br>
<br>
It may very well be an &quot;end-game&quot; skill, but that doesn't mean that it will not be open to countless others who are not in that elite few.<br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes, if I have to give up the explosion to have the skill actually work, that's fine with me.<br>

(including the FB one)</span><hr size=1> I agree with Wez, the pet changes are great, but are not magician specific. They helped all that use a pet.<br>
<br>
I like removing the pet expolsion though as a 1000 point aoe was useless and potentially dangerous.<br>
<br>
Yes I know you don't mes in high end encounters, but a pet is a single target weapon, so should have been the explosion. It should have been a DD at the target the pet was on, and blasted for a lot more than 1000. So at 1000 I would rather the pet stay alive, and continue to add damage.<br>
<br>
Wez is also correct all classes are being upgraded, and we have been patiant. <br>
<br>
The pet changes effected us a lot more than most classes, but not in all situations.  <br>
<br>
So magician ballancing still has to be done, and fixing FB to do as advertised with the haste, flurry, rampages, etc.. IS NOT ballancing as it is an AAXP skill that you earn with time and experience, and should not be considered for ballancing. The same way that lifeburn is not being considered as a fix (as it worked as advertised), to the necro class, or mana burn to the wiz class.<br>
<br>
Magician's have had it rough so long, that a fix to frenzied burnout is looked upon as ballancing, and not as a FIX to a SOL expansion skill. <br>
<br>
Why do people look at the Magician class, said THEY FIXED what was broken, and we are ballanced, when other classes skills are fixed, and STILL warrant upgrades?<br>
<br>
As said pet changes are great, but are NOT magician upgrades per say. They are PET upgrades for pet classes.<br>

<br>
  It has NOTHING to do with balancing, it has to do with a broken AA skill being fixed and people screaming its a nerf.   How do you nerf something that existed in theory only.  The skill has never worked to begin with.<br>
<br>
  Yes 10 months is a long time. But it is being looked at now at least.<br>
<br>
  As to high end encounters,  so what if you cant mez everything?  You still do NOT use aoe spells as they are dangerous and CAN get everyone killed due to through the wall, ceiling, floor aggro.<br>

Ok having the pet not die is fine, but a very small damage increase for 30 seconds is still not worth spending 6 points on... <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=86285"><img src="http://home.attbi.com/~jwalkup/ozsig.jpg"></a><br>

There are many, many enounters where you can...sure there are some where it isnt the best idea.....but you can still use them alot.  <br>
<br>
Some of you make *way* too much a thing out of the pet going bye bye after the duration.  It is a very very minor thing.  Unless you are just a twit and were to use it 10 seconds into a fight....or you decided you werent going to be prepared to make another one...  In fact, the only time that it poofing would be a benefit is if you were xp'ing...  Do you really plan to use this skill early in a fight or something?  <br>
<br>
As for it only being there in theory....some of us paid for the skill that our pets would do dmg, then poof doing even more dmg to a mob.  That is no longer the case.  The fact that you would mention this at all is rather sad.   Flurry, rampage and 99% haste are there only in theory.  Quick lets remove them!!!! It wont be a nerf it will be ok because they never *really* worked!  See what I am getting at...its a *very* stupid thing to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uylaine76.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ylaine76</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1010<br> <font color=#333333>(9/1/02 12:05:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=323.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New changes on test.

The reason the explosion is useless *either* way is because level 63+ mobs completely, 100%, without fail, always, always, always, always (maybe it'll get listened to now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) resist our pet spells, FB explosion being from a pet would just get resisted anyway so if you wanted to use it on high end raids it would of been worthless<br>
<br>
Thats why I like not having pet die anymore, cause unless you fight mobs like Trakanon the explosion would do nothing due to level restriction on pet spells <p><a href="http://www.bladesofwrath.com">

That is making changes without saying a word like finally upgrading air pet's max damage (still haven't done jack S^%$^t to MS3).<br>
<br>
I was an advocate of the &quot;non-boom&quot; in FB.  We do need an &quot;End Game&quot; ability like wizards though and FB I believe is supposed to be that.  If it is to last 30 seconds then:<br>
<br>
1. Max/Min damage should increase to +100%<br>
2. Increase haste to 99% (remove cap obviously)<br>
3. Pet should Flurry every round<br>
4. Increase ATK/DEX/AGI/STR/AC by 100<br>
5. Increase HP by 100%<br>
6. All procs and spell casting become irresistable<br>
<br>
Therefore, for 5 rounds you'd have a pet because of flurry, ATK increase, irresistable procs/spells, and damage increase, could theoretically over quadruple its damage potential.  It could also act as make @#%$ tank for 30 secs if things went bad (even on end mob targets because epic pet would have approximately 8400 HP and could then be part of the CH chain).<br>
<br>
Truthfully I'd like a longer duration ability but this would have some possibilities.<br>
<br>
And Jazzen, wizards are using their &quot;end game ability (MB), on things like Fungus king to farm loot. <p>Sarridon Soulcraver

<br>
i do no know of ONE person who plays the game with particle efects on. i used to, but it was just a joke.<br>
<br>
im running a decent system, athlon 750, 256meg PC133 ram all cas 2, geforce 3 TI 300, 64meg ddr, and a cable connection, and even i lag a shitload with no particles bar epics.<br>
<br>
please stop adding in useless shite like this, focus on BROKEN and useless skills and spells, rather than cosmetic changes that only annoy and aggravate players in the majority.<br>
<br>
i bet that 99% of people will go 'oh kool, new particle effects&quot;<br>
*turns them on*<br>
*casts spells*<br>
&quot; ok sweet, they look nice, now to turn them off so i can play properly&quot;<br>
*turns of textures* <p><p>

A completely different team working on a completely different system dose not affect class issues. <br>
<br>
And the spell effects actually seemed LESS laggy than the old ones when I went on test, had about 10 people spaming skin like wood to see how bad it was with everything turned up as high as possible. And considering I have an older system (P2 - 233mhz, Voodoo 3, 224 RAM) I would think Id lag way before most people in testing out this new feature. <p><Center>

<br>
well, the whole point of the new changes is to make it so people can play with particle effects on in more situations, so i see it as a good change.<br>
<br>
and casual players (which make up the vast majority of eq players) typically use particle effects. at least i did before i joined a raid guild.<br>
