If you are in Velious, Luclin, or Planes of Power, if mobs that dont like you are near you when you /corpse, they will attack. If you are in Kunark, or the old world, they don't. What the /corpse command does simply is, if you are within semi close distance of one of your corpses, it will summon it to where you are standing.

He quit Everquest a while ago, and abandoned his Bard and leveled a wizard to the mid 50's.

<br>
Well, I kind of feel bad bugging people over stupid stuff...like freaking out over loosing my body (and not even having the right zone) at lvl 10.  Although I did ask for help with the body thing.  The girl that helped me was really nice too.  Especially since I had to SHOUT.  I know that THAT in itself annoys people, but when I got to BB (where I THOUGH that my original body was) I could not remember the /tell, /group, /shout, /occ, whatever command to talk to people just in my ZONE.  So I &quot;politely&quot; shouted: <br>
<br>
&quot;If anyone in BB sees my body, it is right on a path, can you please send me the /loc of it, sorry to shout, but I still don't know how to use this chat thing right.&quot;<br>
<br>
SO anyway, this girl told me to do /corpse and it said I had no body in that zone.  Once I got to LF (she said I had to be there if I entered from GF and was not in BB), it DID say my body was there (just too far away to summon).  She taught me how to make a BLANK button into a corpse key though (but I messed that up too, just put the text ON the button but no command in).  However she was REALLY patient and walked me through all of it until I FINALLY got it.  Once I totally understood what she was telling me...to go invisible, then stand right ON my body, then RUN like crazy to the zone line, pushing the /corpse button ALL the time...I FINALLY got them all to the zone line and looted them.  Man, I had a HUGE pile o' bodies.<br>
<br>
Anyway...sometimes I don't know if I should trust people though either if I don't KNOW them.  SHE was great and SO was the guy that ported me to the moon.  BUT...I was really nervous of HIM at FIRST.  <br>
<br>
See, I met him becuase when I was standing in the spires waiting to take off to the moon...he was standing there too.  I am not sure what class he was (can't remember and it wasn't a normal class either, one of the name changes) but I did the &quot;who&quot; thing and found his name and he was lvl 57 (or 53?) so I figured that he knew WHERE to stand and that if I stood near him, that I would be in the right place.  Well, I did say Hail to him when I FIRST started waiting for the moon (and it was just the two of us there), but he ignored me.  So I just kept standing there, keeping quite, waiting for the moon thing to happen.  <br>
<br>
THEN, after the first two groups disappear (and I kept seeing the countdown start over YET AGAIN) I finally asked him IF I was in the right place...I told him that I DID have my stone from the lady, etc.  I guess he wasn't going in the spires to the moon, but just hanging out doing whatever.  That is when he offered to port me there (and I flew to Kelethin over and over, etc.)<br>
<br>
BUT...see in the mean time (before I stated talking to him, but AFTER he ignored me the first time)...ALL of these people kept coming up to him asking him for money and eqipment and buffs, etc.   Anyway at one point he had three of them all talking at once and SWARMING around him.  They were ALL THREE jumping UP and DOWN too, like a bunch of rabbits.  I could tell that he was getting annoyed but I was just standing there waiting on the moon TRYING to mind my own business.  But I was bored since I had been standing there for like 40 minutes at that point, so even though he ignored me before, I sent him a tell and said &quot;LOL, looks like you have aquired a coterie.&quot;  So he tells me &quot;If I wouldn't get in trouble I would port them all to SkyFire.&quot;  Well, when I looked that up on my map, I saw that it was in Kunark (where someone told me not to go until I was lvl 30+, which is why LAST weekend I jumped off the flat boat and fell in the water when I got on the WRONG boat from the port in BB to Freeport).  <br>
<br>
SO...when he tried to port me to the moon and I FLEW/BOUNCED to Kelithen (Kelithin?)  and saw HIM no where around, I knew that it *looked* like Kelethin and NOT like I *thought* the moon would look like...but I wasn't sure where I was at first.  I didn't see those lift ramps, just tree house lights above.  THEN after we tried tried THREE times and I kept BOUNCING to Kelethin, he was like, &quot;well...let's see if I can port you somewhere ELSE&quot;.  Now THAT worked (we went to some place that I had never seen, but only for a second, then he told me to gate back...he bound me at the Spires) and he would meet me there after I REGISTERED the expansion.  <br>
<br>
I kept telling him that if had other stuff to do that I could try and figure it out on my own.  But after he told me earlier that he wished he could port those people to SkyFire, I was kind of nervous about going anywhere with him.  ESPECIALLY after I kept bouncing to Kelethin (I though that maybe it was annoying him by bouncing).  In reality, I think he probably just wanted to make sure his port thing was working (which is why he ported me somewhere else for a minute).  But I was getting really scared that he might just drop me off somewhere to get eaten.  He didn't though, he was really nice.  But I WAS kind of scared of him for a while.  I don't know WTF I would do if someone ported me to somewhere REALLY dangerous.  I guess I would be stuck there for good.   <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/19/03 3:20:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#333333>(1/19/03 3:15:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=25>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaPhoto2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Getting unstuck from troll</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Dracca, Getting stuck between a char happens occasionally, you may also find yourself actually stuck inside another player when you first zone into a new location that is crowded like the bazaar or nexus.

Thanks, I will.  Hopefully I won't die QUITE so much at once for a long time.  Yikes, yesterday was nuts.  <br>
<br>
Today was better, I got to lvl 11.  I didn't go to Qeynos though.  I got to the port and decided to go to Firona Vie (on the flat boat, and NOT jump off this time).  But for some reason my boat never went there.  It went back to the SAME port after I zoned three times (shrug).  It didn't go to far though, I don't think.  The ride from the port to Freeport (which looks REALLY short on the map compared to the ride from the port to Fierona Vie) was a MUCH longer time that how long I was on the boat today...so I know I didn't miss getting off.  I think I just went out and back in.  Very odd..anyway I was GOING to hunt for a while and then take the boat to Freeport and then go to Qeynos but I was having too much fun killing goblins, BIG skeletons, scarbs and greenbloods that I just stated there and got up to lvl 11.<br>

It helps to have a hotkey with the following on it--<br>
<br>
/corpse<br>
<br>
This &quot;drags&quot; your corpse (or another persons who has used the /consent command).<br>
<br>
In many cases, the best thing you can do is go INVIS to go get your corpse.  Target body, and then start hitting the /corpse hotkey as you run to a place of safety and drag the corpse along.  Then you can loot it and be back on your way.<br>
<br>
Now there are some places that INVIS won't help.  But for now, you should be ok for quite a few levels.  Until you go to Unrest or some other place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Where do I go (site/link wise) to see a list of what is safe for my lvl.  DO I go to EQMaps?  I have been there and also to the following (these are so not gonna be spelled worth a crap).<br>
<br>
EQMaps<br>
<br>
Allakzamm<br>
<br>
The Mage Compendium<br>
<br>
Caster Realm (part of EQ Realm?)<br>
<br>
Grated, I may have been to the right places and just have been distracted clicking in the wrong areas.  I tend to go crazy looking up new and interesting things and get sidetracked, bigtime.<br>
<br>
...and a few others, but I can't remember the names.  But I can't find a lvl guide (and I don't mean where to hunt, per say...just where to AVOID, so that I don't GO there and get in WY over my head.<br>
<br>
Basically, I DO know this...<br>
<br>
1.  Not to go to Kunark (unless it is just to that lower tip...Firona Vie).<br>
<br>
2.  NOT to go to Velious at all.<br>
<br>
3.  Not to go to a Troll, Dark Elf, Iskar or Ogre City (per the 'racial tensions' in my book).<br>
<br>
But I need to start looking up specifics.  For example, I know that Kithicor woods I need to be invis and run through FAST and at day...to go from Freeport to Qeynos.<br>
<br>
But I also need to know abou my OWN continent.  Granted, I know what Crusbone is and I am not SURE if I should go in alone OR not (but I don't, because those Orc's a MEAN and they scare me).  But there are some other places too that were an the map that Jaytee Bushwacker posted...like<br>
<br>
Unrest<br>
<br>
Dagnor's Cauldron <br>
<br>
Mistmoore<br>
<br>
Minotaur Mines<br>
<br>
I just need to look up the recommended lvl for these.<br>

A good rule of thumb, when you're exploring while invisible, is to take your time and /consider a mob before you get too close.  If it says &quot;Regards you indifferently&quot; (doesn't matter what color of a con), then it doesn't see through.<br>
<br>
There is an invisibility vs. undead spell, but living mobs will see you and you can't have Invisibility and Invisibility vs Undead on you at the same time. <p>Tadwen Brytewisp<br>

My main druid had just leveled to 53 (sorry not sure about the number) was bound near the giant fort in Burning woods. I went down to Steamfont Mountains to get a hero bracer. Got the hero, sat next to the entrance to the mine and typed /camp desktop. Went to bed, got home from work (I camped just before a patch) I get an email from a friend saying how sorry she was, she and another friend of mine tried to keep me alive but they couldn't the mob was just too tough. She also wanted to know why I hadn't responded to tells. Then she said something about getting a guide to move me to arena. I log back in and I am in lake Rathetear arena, and I am thinking this is strange, check the inventory and I am naked, this is even stranger. I look at the exp bar and I am halfway through 52, ok now I am really MAD. I also cannot remember where I originally camped out. The friend who sent me the email was not on. So I finally remember where I camped out and get over there. Loot everything but one item then I check the corpse timer and it says resurrection time has expired. So I finally make the connection, I had camped out something hit me, and I died and went to my bind point. Had fired off a nasty /petition because I was sure I had been hacked. Get to my bind point and there nicely stacked at 8 bodies. I check a body and there is some sort of totem on it that I had never seen or heard of. So about this time I get a tell from a guide, explain what had happened and everything I knew. Guide thought I was making it up and had no idea what totem was, so this monk comes out to survey the damage. Sees the bodies examines the totem and then proceeds to res the 8 bodies. Thank goodness because of the patch the timer didn't expire. 100% resses and I managed to get my level back.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I figure and this is not 100% sure that when I /campdesktop I disconnected but my char did not. He must have stood there for awhile before something happened upon him. And got killed then at my bind point my friends saw something hitting me and not responding (they assumed I had fallen asleep, they petitioned and the guide said the only thing he could do is move me.) We were hunting in the area and they were going back to our spot to hunt some more saw the pile of bodies and took action. The only thing I can think of for the totem is it is something the server puts on bodies before the patch so they don't poof. The guide who helped res my bodies was wonderful and I finally calmed down. My bind point since then has been in the city of shadowhaven. Don't want to take any chances. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I campout by clicking every one of those silly buttons. <br>
<br>
Also it is a lot easier to trust people now in game, because now there aren’t a whole lot of bad things they can do to your body. Was a time in game when if you typed /consent  they could take things off your body. So there were more than a few horror stories associated with that. Now if you type /consent all they can do is drag your body. Also asking for help in game can &quot;generally&quot; get you some higher levels who remember all too well these younger days. My druid has done many a corpse run to help someone. Had a high level necro pull a link dead corpse out of the giant fort in frontier mountains. That one I zoned into Frontier Mountains from Lake of Ill Omen, started to run towards the giant fort. YOU HAVE BEEN DISCONNECTED. Then for 15 mins got the you have an char logged in message.  Ahhh the memories!<br>

<br>
But I have another question (which isn't exactly skill related, more READING the skills thing and DEATH).  I hate EZCodes, hopefully this will post...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/EQ000013.gif" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
Okay...now first, I got all of these in here EXCEPT for the bottom, which is just some funky languages and trade skills that I have never done at all, like pottery and jewelry.  I hope the pic is clear too, I followed the directions on how to take a screenshot from the EQ fashion forum but I didn't have time to crop it, etc. in a graphics program (running late for work, as usual).<br>
<br>
Now...<br>
<br>
1.  I was TOLD that my limit on skills was my lvl x 5 + 5 (that would be 60 for me).  BUT when I go to Niola Impholder she says I can not put anymore points in piercing (that I am at my limit for that skill).  So WHAT is up with that?  Is piercing just DIFFERENT (and if so, are there others up there that are too)?  I don't care about languages or trade skill (not now at least, I am not sure how all of that works yet).<br>
<br>
2.  I want to work on my swimming JUST becuase in the future IF I fall in the water, I want to have a better chance of NOT dying (and THEN having my body STUCK under water).  So IF I take EVERYTHING off (and I am just naked, no clothes, weapons, Malachite, money) JUST summoned food and water...and I DO go to work on swimming (like jumping in the water by the Felwithe bait shop) and I DO DIE...will that be okay?  What I mean is, if I loose my NAKED body (underwater) is it okay just to leave it THERE (nothing ON it) or will *I* (my ENTIRE character of Dracca) DIE for good if I don't get the NAKED body back from underwater?<br>
<br>
3.  How the heck am I supposed to WORK ON H1 Blunt and H2 blunt...is that like hitting things with a club, staff and hammer (as opposed to piercing)?  Or do I just not need to worry about that?<br>
<br>
<br>
*edit*<br>
<br>
and one more thing...<br>
<br>
4.  Is there ANY reason that I NEED to work on alcohol tolerance?  Because I don't like it when the screen goes all blurry, I can't DO anything and it starts to give me a headache after a while.  LOL, I LOVE wine in RL, but in EQ all it does is annoy me.  But IF I am GOING to need that skill in the future, I CAN just buy some wine and drink it RIGHT before I camp everytime. <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/20/03 4:43:55 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stehle>stehle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#333333>(1/20/03 4:51:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=26.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Okay...I don't want to start a NEW topic</span><hr size=1> Noticed your AT (Alcohol Tolerance) is 2.

I recently found time to extract my revenge on some mobs that plagued me in my earlier days.  'A skeleton' from Najena.  'Tae Ew Jusdicator' from The Feerrott.  The dreaded 'orc 1' in Eastern Commons.  Orc1 was probably the most satisfying-- tagged all of them and then just stood there and cast scintilation.  Game over.<br>

So you (A) need a weapon of the proper type, and (B) need to go whack some monsters with them occasionally.  It is much easier to work on weapons skills while you are in a group with fighter types because the mob will focus attention on them and not hit you.  This does not work while solo, because the moment you get into melee range the mob will ignore your pet and attack you.  So don't plan on doing a lot melee damage, but you certainly need to work on some of it a bit.<br>
<br>
One of the biggest reason to jump in and melee occasionally and take some hits is DEFENSE skills (and later you get a DODGE skill).  By increasing these skills, you will benefit much more later in life by taking less damage when you do get hit.<br>
<br>
If you go put some points into 1hb and 2hb right now you will find the trainer happy to oblige you.  But since you already have a higher piercing skill, you cannot train that one further.  The formula you used is *mostly* accurate, but not for casters melee skill which is (Your_level * 3) + 3 . . . instead of the 5's.<br>
<br>
Good job on the sense heading, keep that one maxed out!  It is a definate advantage.<br>
<br>
You can go swimming in the Felwithe pond back there without difficulty, no bad things to bite you.  I learned most of my swimming while bound in Halas and hunting Everfrost and Blackburrow.  There is a big pond in the city entrance that you must cross to exit the zone, so I always swam across.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Blackburrow, I highly recommend it for levels 12-16.  It is really a good place to learn what &quot;dungeons&quot; are like in this game, and controlling pets.<br>
