Keep their level.  Keep their current attack.  Change the cast for the spells they do to procs.  Change AI to melee.   <br>
<br>
Problem solved.<br>
<br>
The level 52 fire pet will quad for 29 as usual and proc 140 damage based magic and fire DD's.  The level 58 and 63 fire pets will do the same.   <br>
<br>
This will give us that extra &quot;situational&quot; style pet.  Currently, the firepets are practically useless in ALL styles of combat.  They're junk.  We know that.  Verant knows that.  The ants that live in my backyard know that.  Changing the cast to proc would give us an edge against mobs like Emp or Seru as well as give the unlucky @#%$ that got the 63 firepet when they turned their scrolls in a decent pet to use.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>

His dps is negligible, he can't tank, he hits for considerably less damage, and his nukes are not scaled properly.  <br>

Again?<br>
<br>
As I've said.. After I got my 52 wizard pet, and more so after i got my 58, I used them almost exclusivly in groups.<br>
<br>
Useless? I think not.<br>
<br>
They aren't a Solo pet though, they aren't straight forard, They are situational.<br>
<br>
Stuns are your friend.. or why do so many mages give their pet a pair of Gnoll hide lariats..? <br>

Once we reach 52nd level, you'd think we should get at LEAST as useful a pet for every element as we had since level 1.<br>
<br>
Leave the Voc Fire and Greater Voc Fire as they are.<br>
Add Voc Fire Warrior and Greater Voc Fire Warrior pet spells.  (or make up a better name)  They would simply be regular fire pets like the pre-52 fire pets: relatively low hps compared to Earth pet, good DS, decent attack, same type of fire spell, all scaled up for the level of the pet.<br>
<br>
Make the 63 Fire Warrior Pet version drop like the current one does now, in addition to it.  Maybe you could call that one a Balrog hehe.<br>

Why?<br>
<br>
Well, the 58 and 63 fire pets both cast root.  Most groups do not like rooting pets.  Why?  Well, rangers can't do their crits with bows, rogues can't evade as well, and all the melees have to watch their range on a rooted mob.  Try rooting an enraging mob as well--they flip out and start twisting around, thus ruining the idea of keeping their backs to the other melees.  The 52 fire I don't remember rooting at all, or at least not when I had him.  But the 58 and 63 definately root a LOT.  So depends on what group you're in.  Most times the same level air pet will serve you just as well as far as stunning goes, and the lack of root doesn't upset anyone.  With C2 on these pets they do seem to chain stun a lot more, thus I am convinced they base their nuking off of a mana pool.  <br>
<br>
That being said, of course this pet is useless for soloing (refer to the &quot;rooting&quot; argument).  The 63 fire pet gets &quot;shieldskin&quot; (50-ish dmg rune), &quot;shielding&quot; (50-ish dmg hp buff, ac buff, and magic resist buff... btw, wont' stack with burnout IV OR V), both utterly useless to this pet except to help him farm greenies (which he can't even do an impressive job of).  <br>
<br>
The 52 and 58 fire at least nuke for a fair amount.  They also use fire *and* magic based nukes.  The 63 fire throws out a stun that hits for a max of 70 (at least on PC's in duels), and that's it.  He doesn't cast any other sort of nuke.  For those that have him and don't believe me, test it for yourself--Child of Ro only does low low damage stun nukes and roots.  His melee is something like... 68 maybe (which isn't horrid, but much weaker than his counterparts).  Of course they cast their normal O'keil's (don't ask which one, but as if it would matter) and have next to crap for hp's.  <br>
<br>
How do I think they could be improved?  Well, this maybe have been suggested elsewhere, but having the thing do a snare instead of root (maybe single target Bonds of Force) wouldn't be horrible.  Before people start screaming about overpowering mages by giving them snare, remember that with the fire pet a majority of the damage will be coming from the mage nukes, not from the output of the pet (like other pets).  The snare could have a low duration (like BoF at 45 seconds), and the pet itself could even have it's melee dmg lowered to match the 58 fire or something.  <br>
<br>
Another suggestion is to make the 52+ fire pets akin to the Servant of Ro AA ability.  The things do such little dmg why not just have them sit back and be like real wizards?  Sony has shown they can code this by making the SoR a pure caster, so why not?  And give the Child of Ro pet something better than a 50 dmg rune and 70 dmg stun nuke.  Sure the chain stunning could be useful against casters, but it dies almost instantly on an enrage (faster than the other pets of course).  <br>
<br>
As it stands, I only pull out my fire pets as a parlor trick.  I primarily use my 61 air or 62 water for the damage/stuns, or even dabble with the epic.  Very rarely do I ever mem the Child of Ro, and the times I do I end up getting rid of him because someone in the group gets upset over the pet rooting or he ends up dying for some other reason.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=222062">Booperbustle Tinkermeister</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
His DPS is crap.  The nukes are ok but they don't happen enough to make any real difference for the most part.  With the air pet, you know you'll get a DD+stun every time (assuming it lands) and the water pet you know you get a cold based DD and backstabs.<br>
<br>
The 52 fire pet does root and this is absurd.  If, in a duel, you root a fire pet and back away from him, he'll randomly cast spells but at the normal rate he would cast anyways.<br>
<br>
I'd rather have a pet quadding for 54/56 than 29 when the DD spells being cast does 140s to 170s DD and the low DD+stun.<br>
<br>
Pets have never shown to have mana.  They do not benefit from the focus effects of items (yep I posted on this a while back, down to page 3 or 4 now called 'equipping pets') and seem to be on a 'random' timer on how often they can cast.<br>
<br>
As to if clarity affects them or not, there's only one way to see...logs.  But I don't think it does.<br>
<br>
I could buy the lvl 58 fire pet....but why?  It'll never be used.<br>

Air, Water, and Earth all tend to cast once every 6 or so seconds (you could follow a pattern of taunt, cast, taunt, cast, etc. watching the pet).  Fire pets aren't like that.  When you first bring them out, they spend a while buffing themselves, and when first attacking a mob they will seem to chain cast themselves out of mana, then melee/cast/melee/cast.  Just from testing the pet out in BoT (Child of Ro I mean), giving the pet C2 has a tremendous effect on his nuking.  Without C2 he just casts 4 or 5 times, then melees and switches back to casting every little bit.  If he has C2 he'll keep up with the casting, decreasing the time he melees in between casts, etc.  <br>
<br>
There isn't really a way to prove this using logs, save just counting how many times he casts non-cracked vs. cracked.  Anyone with the higher level fire pets test this theory and you'll see.  <br>
<br>
I will agree for a fact that the other pets don't have mana though.  They have a very distinct pattern to their nuking.  The fire is the only exception.  Regardless, he's still not a viable choice over my other pets ATM.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=222062">Booperbustle Tinkermeister</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
