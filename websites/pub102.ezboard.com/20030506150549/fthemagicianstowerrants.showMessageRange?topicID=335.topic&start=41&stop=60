Yes, we had a new support role added with  Call of the Hero and  Summon Rod of Mystical Transvergence, and yes, in raids the ratio shifts away from damage and towards support, but it is not as if the support tools aren't very useful in groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Who said utility roles and tools weren't useful in groups?  Previous to trods though did you rely on that utility to maintain DPS?  I'm extremely happy for trods, because without them our DPS and damage in groups would be much lower.  Any magician worth their snuff was already summoning rods in groups well before trods existed, but trods were not a necessary component to maintain our damage margin, which indicates that our offensive nature is slipping, wouldn't you think?<br>
<br>
Your next argument will be we don't have to use trods to maintain DPS because we can canni pets.  Not having the epic, you may not understand the want to keep a 500 mana 5 minute recast pet, but having used it for nearly or more than a year I can tell you I dread resummoning it :)  As you know though I put alot of love into my pets -- muzzle, armor, weapons.. my pet is important to me and in places where I like to group my pet is a lifeline for my group as it proves crowd control and often is the tank, I can't canni pets -- and if canni pets is the solution to a mana chrisis to produce constant dps then where's my other missing utility spells, since it sounds like we're just poor wizzies then. :)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> True, support is much more required on raids, but then support beyond the minimum yields diminishing returns. When there are multiple mages on a raid, the support duties are easily shared, and mages can do what they do best: deal damage. While it is stressful to be the only mage on a raid, it is much more relaxing to have three or more mages. Likewise, it would hell to be the only shaman or enchanter on a raid.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If you were to break classes into three catagories and assign them a major or minor how would you classify mages?  Traditionally, and even still, in groups magicians have been damage (major), pets (major), utility (minor) -- while with the last two expansions and explicity with trods in Luclin utility has become more important, it is still a minor role in most groups, mages don't join a 6-man team to drop rods like they do on raids.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, classes like Shamans have traditionally been healers (minor), buffers (major), debuffers (major) and a minor in damage -- typically.  Their role in groups and raids doesn't change.  It may be that the role is split between the shamans on a raid, but that role is the same from level 1 to level 60.<br>
<br>
Magicians on a raid change their major/minors quite a bit.  We will typically minor in damage, pets and major in utility.  That in my books a complete change of role wouldn't you say?  Imagine walking into the first elemental filled zone in PoP and the group saying &quot;ok, Raz is the chanter,&quot; how out of place will that be?<br>

What part of &quot;malicious deception and trickery&quot; is not a personal attack?<br>
============<br>
<br>
What part is? Last I heard, personal refers to people, and people can be tricksters among other things, but people cannot be trickery. Besides that, it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> malicious trickery.<br>
Read this stuff, man:<br>
=============<br>
Thank you for the history lesson Ylaine<br>
=============<br>
=========<br>
&quot;Brainwashing&quot;?? No, I would call it &quot;informing&quot;.<br>
==========<br>
<br>
=================<br>
All I want to know is WHY DID VERANT COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR ROLE in the end game? You have changed our class for the worse can't you see that with how many people are upset?<br>
=================<br>
<br>
=================<br>
can't say it is overly biased one way or the other. It is simply the truth. <br>
==================<br>
etc, read the first page<br>
<br>
To me, these posts showed that ylaine's post was so convincing to many people because they viewed her argument as fact. An argument is totally different from fact. Fact is something which is proven and accepted, an argument is trying to convince someone of something which cannot be proven, or at least there is not enough evidence at the time to prove. <br>
<br>
When replies imply that people took the post as something it's not, how is that not deception, and why am I wrong for pointing it out for what it is?<br>
<br>
The point of my posts up until this one have not been to either attack ylaine or ylaine's opinion. It was to observe the fact that this post is argument containing facts, not fact itself. <br>
<br>
You may say, no, you were attacking ylaine's opinion. You're wrong, wrong, totally wrong.<br>
<br>
===================<br>
This is something I have be careful about myself when I get into &quot;arrogant mode.&quot; There are better ways to suggest that a post is biased or blatantly ignores critical facts than suggesting that the poster is malicious, that is, has the intent to harm others.<br>
====================<br>
<br>
Would you like a cookie? Your god is not mine.<br>
<br>
=====================<br>
Jeez who pissed in your cheerios?<br>
=====================<br>
<br>
I'll tell you who, or rather what, did. Comments like the second half of your paragraph:<br>
<br>
================<br>
You even said yourself that you DIDN'T play a mage since the beginning, yet you are gonna make a statement like this? Get a clue. <br>
================<br>
<br>
I didn't play a mage since the beggining, so I'm wrong? I've played magician since before kunark, which is exactly the same era that everyone else in this thread inspecifically claims to have began. I've also played since EQ when gold, and followed the mage class among others second hand on websites while messing around with various classes on RZ before moving to the nameless.<br>
<br>
The reason this pisses me off is because it's completely irrelevant. Put yourselves in my shoes. You people cannot deal with my arguments properly so you dismiss anything by saying 'you're a newbie mage, you don't understand what the class was like before kunark.' First of all, I know pretty damn well what the class was before kunark. Second of all, that has nothing to do with anything, it's just a clever.. no, it's just a maliciously deceiving way of dismissing my arguments. I believe, mr wayfarerman, that you provide the perfect example. The quote from me you quoted has absolutely 0% to do with how long I've played, because the quote would be equally valid and meaningful said by someone who has never played EQ at all, yet you dismiss it because I didn't start a mage until a few months after I could have? Get a clue yourself. <br>
<br>
<br>
In fact, any time in this entire thread it's been insinuated that my arguments are void due to my lack of having a mage on fennin ro(most beta players played this server i believe, but you wouldn't know that since you're all newer than me) the poster has done nothing but provide more malicious deception, because it has nothing to do with my argument and the point of both of my previous posts on this thread: TO DISTINCTLY CONVEY THE VITAL CONCEPT THAT YLAINE'S POST IS TO BE TAKEN AS  A WELL WRITTEN ARGUMENT(something rarely seen on this board by whine-mages) AND NOT AS PURE HISTORICAL FACT. I tried to leave out whether I agreed with it or not altogether, although it would be easy to infer that I disagree with the fact that just because mages have been about offense, they should still be now.<br>
<br>
But anyway, the term piss on cheerios is a very harsh way to describe how I was feeling. I was actually in a very peaceful mood when I wrote that, wasn't any more angry or frustrated than ever. Wayfarerman's reply certainly seemed more pissy, to me, than mine did.<br>
<br>
Many things 'piss in my cheerios' about modern mage whines. Funnily, they're all related to uncreative wanna-be complainers. This 'new mages don't appreciate' bullshit is utter nonsense. You cannot prove that all mages who started before a certain point have a certain opinion. On this very thread, I among 1-2 others have come forward to prove that we've been playing plenty long, and are happy with the mage class. On the other hand, look at the author of this thread, she admits to beginning a mage after kunark. If anything, this shows that NEW mages are the ones unhappy with the class. Unfortunately, most whiney mages are too lame to come up with their own material, so I'm sure my arguments will be dismissed 400x more times by people who bought EQ as trilogy and call me a newbie.<br>
<br>
========================<br>
It's been said before, but I think the fundamental issue is that players that started the game after Kunark came out have a completely different view of the mage from those who started before Kunark.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure that you can really understand what it's like for us who started pre-Kunark to be turned into vending machines. <br>
=========================<br>
<br>
This is exactly what I'm talking about. I know exactly what it's like to 'be turned into a  vending machine, and I like it, considering I haven't actually lost any power. Which segways to...<br>
<br>
===========<br>
P/S The best class on their BEST day couldn't touch Mage DPS pre-Kunark. So how you can disagree with Mages as damage dealers is beyond me.<br>
===========<br>
<br>
first of all, I don't recall VI ever using the word DPS back then. Second of all, the game is allowed to evolve, which is something some of you insist shouldn't happen. Third of all is, we still are the best dmg dealers. In fact, we do more damage now than we have ever come close to in the past. <br>
<br>
I don't disagree that mages are a dmg dealing class. I disagree with you on the point that mages aren't currently a damage dealing class. <br>
<br>
This type of cookie cutter argument is based on opinion that we <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be a damage dealing class, and assuming we're not a damage dealing class. We <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   are</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a damage dealing class, thus everything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> how it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   should</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be. I don't see why it's neccessary to bring up how we 'used to be' a damage dealing class prekunark etc, and we still are...<br>
<br>
Anyway, not to put anyone down, but I really wish some people would doa little more work to come up with your own ideas. Really, I'm trying to encourage you to come up with your own arguments instead of copy&amp;pasting the ideas of more entrepreneurial whiners like wezloc, or in this case, ylaine, whose post was so well deceptively designed that I had to reply merely to point out that it was an argument, not an encyclopedia. I'd rather have to identify a thread as deceptive than listen to the same old 'old-skool-mage' bullcrap forever. A good post SHOULD make people of the opposing view like me so busy with arguing the difference between fact, opinion, people, and posts, that I can't even find time to actually come up with argument for the points made within the post. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A> at: 9/23/02 9:10:43 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwayfarerman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>WayfarerMan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 216<br> <font color=#333333>(9/23/02 9:26:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.molinari-dist.com/Wayfarer.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: a new players view of the class</span><hr size=1> Krilen, that wooshing sound was my point flying over your head.

I went through a Paladin, Druid, Warrior and Necromancer before I finally settled on the Magician, who was made on a different server. <br>
<br>
I liked being isolated from my old server.  I started over - no Oracle robe, no Glowing Black Stone, nothing like that.  I was a completely independent character in a new and foreign world. <br>
<br>
I made a magician because necros didn't like them so much on their board. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     I wanted to see what all the hubbub was about.  I haven't been let down - sure, there are dry times, but they don't last for 3+ years, much like some others on this board. <br>
<br>
I built a good rep around myself in Velks Lab, back when I was doing the run to 60 over a year ago - back when I didn't have my epic.  When I'd go LFG, people would pick me up most of the time. If not, I'd solo or make my own group.  Recently, I've been getting nightly invites to CT sewer groups from people I don't know - it's kind of neat <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I raid stuff, too.  I've had an Emp fight with one other mage.  Yeah, I was making rods almost the entire fight, we had enough to win - it was awesome!  I was a solo mage on a HP fight, and I had time to make rods and nuke / rain for ~50k as well as use my pet.  My group got exp, and I received our 60 heal.<br>
<br>
The mage class is a very complex one.  We're built on old principles: pet, nuke, summon.  Those old principles are still with us today, in a more dynamic world and larger, more involved battles such as Emp - AHR.  For some it?s hard to see any of the first two, some guilds recruit only mages for mod rods. That?s not the mages fault, or the mage class in general - it's the guilds.   <br>
<br>
I still do damage, more than our fair share - I feel. I have never needed pet parses, or nuke comparisons vs. other classes to feel powerful.  I've had a feeling of being powerful since level 8, back when I killed my first puma and it's still with me today.  <br>
<br>
I don't see the problems some others do with their mages on raids.  I'm not a mod rod bitch when I raid.  I actively use my pet, and nuke along with making <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Happy Panda Fireworks</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and flare staves for myself and some others; they're fun!.  <br>
<br>
I have my own style, and it mixes well with raid encounters.  I work harder than a &quot;rod bitch&quot; who spends the entire time dropping t-rods near a wall. I take on 2-3+ more jobs during a raid on top of making rods. Those worthless AA skills called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Quick Summoning, Spell Casting Mastery and Spell Casting Fury</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> help make my night more productive and eventful for all those around me.<br>
<br>
Mages still have plenty of power.  It may not be as showing as a 5k critical off GSS, or a 2k double backstab from the rouges - but being the backbone of an entire raid, to having offensive potential with utility support is such a great combination. <br>

Put up or shut up.

Because we have been given an amazing tool, one of the most obvious applications of which is increasing our DPS in groups and raids, that therefore, our DPS is slipping?  What are you saying, that if we didn't have rods our damage output would suck, and therefore our damage output sucks?  Or potentially sucks?  Or trends towards suckage?  The situation as it is is that we do have rods, and they do in fact increase our our damage potential.  Of all the int casters, we are the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>least</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> dependent on mana to do damage, we have the easiest time of replacing our mana, our damage output is less sensitive to downtime/uptime ratios, our sustained damage output is comparable to rogues and monks and what?

<br>
Not sure how you think you are able to read my mind, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, but Mister Mathematics here would never be so stupid as to make some claim like that.  Rods are an important part of every 57+ mage's nutritious breakfast, along with pets, nukes, and so on.  I am well aware of the limitations of pet cannibalization, and especially for the epicked mage.  For many mages, non-epicked, and without healing support, it can be a very important tool.  But rods are obviously now a critical part of the mage class.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Aamilae:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  As you know though I put alot of love into my pets -- muzzle, armor, weapons.. my pet is important to me<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As well you should know of me.  Until recently, I went through a couple a dozen gnoll hide lariats every week.  Up until <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Elemental Pact</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I was all for making the best pet I could and keeping it alive.  When I get my epic, I no doubt will cherish it as you do.<br>
<br>
Really, I do not understand why you bring pet cannibalization into this, it has little to do with the subject at hand.<br>
<br>
All I am saying is that the mages have become in part a support class, that this support is viable in groups, and need not dominate a raiding magician's life unless there are insufficient numbers of mages available.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Aamilae:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Magicians on a raid change their major/minors quite a bit. We will typically minor in damage, pets and major in utility.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, I think that's the problem, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Yes, mages provide some unique support capacities, and therefore, if there is only one mage on the raid capable of providing that support, guess what?  Their time is spent providing support and damage dealing, of which there is likely an excess anyway, fades into the background.<br>
<br>
The problem appears to me to be that you do not have enough magicians.  Of course one magician is stressed and has to focus on support.  Get three, and the picture will be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>very</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> different.  Using your own terminology, each mage can then <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;minor&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in support, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;major&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in damage.  The flaw is not with the class, but with an insufficient number of mages.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wisbus:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  ...some guilds recruit only mages for mod rods. That?s not the mages fault, or the mage class in general - it's the guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Exactly.  My guild has a strong mage presence, and I make a point of cultivating relationships with other mages by helping on their epics and making pet groups and so on, so I am rarely the only mage on a raid, even if I am short on guildies.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Wilbus:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Glad I'm a mage!<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Yeppers, never wanted to be anything else.

Second of all, picking on grammar or poor word choice is lame. Semantics on a message board just provide a healthy speed bump... if I said I didn't consider myself attacking ylaine, don't go and bring up a word, look it up in the dictionary, and spin it so that it contradicts whatever else I just said. Take out the word malicious if you like, replace it with chocolate. You can't go wrong with chocolate, unless you're allergic. I don't see why a post can't be malicious and the poster of it not, unless you conform 100% to the words in a certain part of a book and completely ignore other parts of the book. But hey, I don't use that book, mine doesn't say anything about motive, just says it's &quot;evil, blah blah blah&quot;, and evil is subjective.<br>
<br>
Now, see how refreshingly useless semantics is? &gt;&lt;<br>

<br>
Please read the 2 quotes from me you quoted before this quote. I'm not even bothering to argue against ylaine's points. All I wanted to do in this thread is make sure everyone understands that it's a persuasive argument and not a historical document.<br>
<br>
Want me to prove it? You can't really 'prove' something like that, compared to say, proving a mathematical equation or something. Maybe you could if you whipped out dictionary.com. I also don't wanna pick out 1-2 quotes and just point out that in some weird icelandic religion they're contradictory or something.<br>
<br>
Observe the spin she puts on this quote. Spin does not have any place in historical document.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> While not as powerful as Wizards they should be atleast a better option than summoning Mod Rods for *clerics* to nuke with<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
She attributes the fact that it's better for us to rod clerics to nuke as a problem with our offensive capability. When in fact...<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with offensive capability. Our nukes are still better than cleric nukes. Our nukes would have to be insanely good or clerics insanely bad to make it more efficient for us to nuke than rod.<br>
<br>
It's not a problem with nukes, it's the fact that mod rods give back more mana than they take to cost, something I'm extremely happy about. She, however, makes it seem to the reader that it's a problem with our nukes &gt;&lt; a very chocolate thing to do in a historical document.<br>
<br>
What would be better, a mage making rods for a cleric to nuke with, or a mage making rods for a 2nd mage to nuke with?<br>
<br>
If these are the only 2 options, it's still better for the mage to nuke.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind I have no brain, so I can't compute these things. Perhaps a fix would be to give mages a no-drop ultimate rod. Not sure if that could possibly fix it though, since, no brain. Or rather, I'm too lazy to think about them for more than 3.4 seconds. This thread is not about the power of rods anyway.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> and hopefully help them see that we're not some mod rod class and we don't deserve to be forgotten as damage dealers <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And here is where she draws unneccessary conclusions from unrelated evidence, which I'm sure is some more of your ad-hominem-esque fallacy crap.<br>
<br>
The fact that we have had damage spells in the past has nothing to do with the present in this game. I could as easily argue that &quot;We ARE some mod rod class, and we DO deserve to be forgotten&quot; and it wouldn't be any more relevent to a historical document than the above quote from ylaine's post.<br>

question: why? the ratio on mod rod 1 returns a total net loss of mana. (meaning, it costs mana and/or time to  heal that damage, plus the raw mana it costs to summon is greater than that which it returns).<br>
<br>
i see NO reason to use mod rod 1 in a group, unless:<br>
a) clerics and/or other valuable supportive casters needed mana<br>
b) you were grouped with an offensive caster which greatly outclassed you to the point where even after the crappy ratio was considered it was still more efficient to feed (i.e. 51 mage grouped with 60 wizzie)<br>
<br>
i see no reason why before trods &quot;good mages&quot; should be making mod rod 1's in a group...<br>

We are now walking Wal-Marts. I spend almost as much mana on suppling others than nuking in raids. I became a Mage because of the soloing power, not to be a merchant. <br>
<br>
I too believe the Mage class has been hamstrung. Are we worthless, no. Are we powerless, no. Are we what we should be, hell no. Can we still play and have fun as a Mage, yes.<br>
<br>
I have been a supporter for revamping the Mage class all together. We are Elementalist, therefore we should be able to be masters of the elements. If we fight a fire based creature, we chould have water and earth spells that conteract that creatures power. A fire bolt should never be used against a Fire Elemental. (See my point?)<br>
<br>
If I am being groomed to be a Merchant, then VI should upgrade my mana and natural medding so at least I can do some good in a group. I have no problem standing in the background with the clerics, but I don't have the mana or the medding skills to be much good for very long.<br>
<br>
As far as I can see we are a hodgepoge of mediocre skills. We are masters of nothing and a poor jack-of-all-trades. I constanly see players of other classes 7 to 8 levels below me kill faster and more often than I can.<br>
<br>
I really like playing my Mage, and I will continue to do so for many months to come. However, I see a time when my Mage will become the supplier to other characters I will develop. Unless we baraged VI with our concerns, nothing will change. In reality, unless something is done soon, EQ will be ignored and will remain as is forever when EQ2 comes out.<br>

- Put yourselves in my shoes. You people cannot deal with my arguments properly so you dismiss anything by saying 'you're a newbie mage, you don't understand what the class was like before kunark.' First of all, I know pretty damn well what the class was before kunark. Second of all, that has nothing to do with anything, it's just a clever.. no, it's just a maliciously deceiving way of dismissing my arguments<br>
<br>
- In fact, any time in this entire thread it's been insinuated that my arguments are void due to my lack of having a mage on fennin ro<br>
<br>
Excuse me, but what arguments are you referring to? Until i read your 3rd post, i had absolutly no idea why you were disagreeing with the post and it didnt have any &quot;arguments&quot; in it as well...<br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
-I'm not even bothering to argue against ylaine's points.<br>
<br>
Yes, exactly! I havent seen a single argument from you in all those posts, logical or otherwise. All you said was: Ylaine is wrong, wrong, wrong... But why is that so?? <br>
<br>
Quote:<br>
- The fact that we have had damage spells in the past has nothing to do with the present in this game.<br>
Wasnt that what Ylaine was trying to point out?<br>
To me, it looked liked a more or less accurate history, a few points missing here and there, but malicous?!?<br>
I have been playing a Mage since Kunark came out, and i chose the class for the pets and (gasp) the summoned stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I liked the idea of a self sufficient, not gear dependant class. Dont have it? Summon it!<br>
<br>
Well, needless to say, i was a bit disapointed about the summons, but the pets and nukes made up for it.<br>
Also, back then, Monks would be darn happy to see a mage come along, and it wasnt unusual for tanks to ask for bandages, arrows, food and water.<br>
<br>
And for the record, dont forget about the sword of runes nerf... err, fix <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Didnt they promise us new summoned weapons with situational procs back then? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujineq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jin EQ</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ciudadfutura.com/lossims/pics/paredes/jintekken.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 224<br> <font color=#333333>(9/24/02 4:59:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> Maybe I quitted Magician, because I didn't like Rod Summoning???<br>

ummmm can i say, STOP WHINING, ok little harsh but seriously.... im not a mage, i had a mage, loved it, just had to try somethin else, i have a few epic mage friends and i just need to say that you all are one of the best classes in the game, you can pretty much solo any single mob, mages i beleive are the only class that can successfully/constantly solo the 7th floor of ToFS, epic mages are GOD, on Rallos Zek   Epic mage &gt; ALL    even against MB wizards, it kinda angers me that you need to detail your set backs when you all are one of the most well off classes out there.<br>

you'd be better off talkin about warriors, theres a class that has some setbacks  = ) <br>

Its kind of sad that &quot;flashy&quot; numbers, and &quot;sparkling colors&quot; seem to get everyone's attention.  Someone sees a 2k nuke, and goes crazy with envy, while in the meantime Mr. Wizard is taking &quot;Five&quot; because he just burned his gas tank.

<br>
I think mages are alot funner to play now, then several years ago.  Back in &quot;the day&quot; I had to meditate way too long, and now I have probably spent a total of 5 minutes on my butt meditating (4 minutes coming from spell swapping haha).  My epic pet just tears stuff to shreds, can maintain high dps, and have a role in a raid, one that IS necessary on uber mobs.  Yep, I love being a mage!<br>

<br>
From the start, I made a pretty decent income selling summoned bandages, fangs, swords, daggers, etc. just going to EC and calling them out to the zone.  This was low-level stuff, but when your idea of a good weapon was a Giant Snake Fang (go kill a few asps in EC, you'll find one) and no one could kill a griffon, it was also pretty uber.<br>
<br>
Swords were always welcome in Lavastorm (though by the time you could cast them you were too high for the zone) - both for their proc and because they could hit critters that required magic weapons.  <br>
<br>
As time went by (I'd say probably by December '99), players got past the early levels, and our gear stopped being so useful.  The market started sporting stuff that was just better than our summons, and for a fair price a player could get a permanent item.  For players starting then, they never saw our summonings as being very useful.  Bags still vanished on LD or camp, taking stuff with them - which of course made people shun them outright, who wants to lose a Yak to a linkdeath?  Other equipment, aside from coldstones, were never really needed.  <br>
<br>
Druids discovered quad-kiting in SK somewhere in here, and Mages discovered we could debuff them and their mobs as they passed.  This at least gave us some fun things to do while /ooc'ing for a group.<br>
<br>
So for about a year, we became nothing but our nukes and our pets, and the occasional debuff.  Because of pathing in dungeons, pets weren't welcome, reducing us to our nukes for those times.  Not group-friendly.  Half of our nukes were line-of-sight bolts.  Not group-friendly.  Somewhere in this time, we also got Waterstones, and we felt at least a little better since we could solo the entry room in Kedge indefinitely without buying a pricey fishbone earring.<br>
<br>
Sol Ro temple zone appears, and we get focus items - which help a lot in our soloing careers, and at least give our pets some extra &quot;oomph.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Through this, Necros still wanted our level 1 daggers, because while dual-wielding them their pet could become an insanely low-delay DPS machine.  They wouldn't group with us, or with anyone, since they could solo xps far more efficiently.  Somewhere along the line this got fixed, and to appease the necros their pets are given a minor lifetap proc.<br>
<br>
Kunark arrives.  With levels 51-60.  We get some neat spells (among them Gift of Xev and Muzzle of Mardu).  Our pets acquire some interesting traits - some are monks, some are wizards, some are rogues.  This flavor change is pretty nifty.  Epic quest is introduced, and an Epic-equipped magician is actually a freaking badass!  However, since Inny only drops six or seven staves a year, and PoA is a VERY tough raid, Epic magicians are few and far between.<br>
<br>
For the average magician, this time, to put it mildly, rather sucked.  There were moments of absolute glory, when in outdoor zones groups of 4-6 pet necros/mages would hunt Overthere and similar zones, with six pets all wielding Swords of Runes.  The procs would be going off like popcorn and the pets simply ginsu'd mobs like no tomorrow.  Bolts would occasionally land for double.  The times when this wasn't happening, we were just another class that happened to do damage with a pet and a few nukes rather than with a sword or directly with a spell.<br>
<br>
Then, SoR was fixed.  Procs went away, the page was turned in our spellbook, and for the most part, we never summoned them.  This was about seven to ten months into Kunark, I think Velious was still some few months away.  We had a dry spell here where we were kinda having a crappy time of it.  Still did decent damage, simply just not a &quot;must-have&quot; class for groups, and there were plenty of &quot;must-haves&quot; wandering around that made it difficult to get a spot.<br>
<br>
However, in this time, something happened.  Call of the Hero arrived.  Suddenly, raiding a dragon no longer required a massive breakin and a huge effort, a magician could sneak in and call the whole group over.  People started thinking &quot;Hey, that's kinda neat, let's figure out what we can bypass with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The mod-rod was present here, but because bosses still had &quot;minimal&quot; hps, the fight was generally over quickly one way or the other.  TRods were good for CR mana recovery, but they really didn't get used a lot - primarily because at best we'd have Clarity to regen our own mana.  The spell was also so extremely uncommon that it really didn't make a difference.<br>
<br>
So Velious comes out, and with it a few new spells.  We get monster summonings, and a couple of DoTs (I'm still wondering why we got those).  Kinda cool, not much changed.  Lotta cold mobs meant at least our fire-based spells had a good time.  We had a few more places where CoH could help folks get places.<br>
<br>
&quot;Class Balance&quot; becomes a hot topic for VI.  <br>
<br>
Hate and Fear got revamped near here, minibosses arrived that drop formerly god-gear (including earth staff), and Inny and CT became major ass-whuppin machines.  Being an Epic magician doesn't seem to unattainable to folks any more.<br>
<br>
Not long after V, Luclin comes out.  <br>
<br>
And with it, bosses with fantastical hps.<br>
<br>
And the TRod.  <br>
<br>
KEI, a few FT items, and lots of medding helps us discover that we could regen some mana and hand it out to clerics.  Bosses had HUGE hps, and without additional sources of mana regen, clerics couldn't keep a main tank alive - so we became a source of mana for those clerics.  <br>
<br>
We started getting popular, but with a rather myopic view of raids.  Pets still were doom to a raiding party, as most zones and dungeons that got raided had terrible pathing, and pets would catch agro and bring the whole zone down on the magician.  <br>
<br>
Summoned bags stop vanishing immediately upon LD or camp - directly as a result of a player suggestion that the vanish check take place at login rather than disconnect, and gives us thirty minutes to recover our materials.  Players take a long time to notice this, but folks are starting to warm up to our bags.<br>
<br>
Our soloing life expands a bit, since we now have a pet heal and some armor we can summon for them.  Transon's Protection also is good for us here, with additional regen and mana recovery, and we also scored an Improved Invis.  <br>
<br>
Throughout this, low-level magicians don't see many changes, aside from having a few more zones to experiment with.  Also note that our pets haven't changed.  At all.<br>
<br>
Six or so months ago, partly for the &quot;Class Balance&quot; and partly for testing the new &quot;focus&quot; idea out, we get a bracket of new spells across all levels that introduce focus item summons - and suddenly we're a hot ticket!  Prior to raids, in groups, just wandering around, people want our focuses.  Despite some folks today having permanent items, I still get requests all the time for items.  <br>
<br>
About six weeks ago, VI turns the spotlight on the magician pet...and Epic Gonad can now quad for 81 (a four-point enhancement), and has a very large hp buff.  Other pets across all levels also get bonuses to damage output and hps.  Resist rates for pets become the higher of their owner's or their own.  Pets take no xps from any fight as long as the mob registers damage from any other source.  Pets become non-agro critters when not fighting, removing the &quot;pathing trains&quot; in raid situations.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly, magicians vault from a ho-hum spellcaster to a genuine DPS machine.  Wizards can still outdo us in the short-term (and boy howdy can they!  Rock on, wizzies!), but for overall long-term damage output, we suddenly are the bomb.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sooooooo, long story short, we're a heck of a lot better now than we were before.  Where a lot of folks are complaining about nerfs, I'm not sure where that's coming from.  Seems the nerf bat recently got pulled out of our collective rectum.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I'm pretty happy with where we've been put.  Sure a druid can do higher damage with his or her nuke - big deal.  Have you seen the mana ratio on that spell?  Have you considered what that druid's mana pool looks like?  Think that druid could put something toe-to-toe in melee with a mob (with a reasonable expectation of survival, Teddy doesn't count here), PLUS nuke it, and walk away?  <br>
<br>
We are a powerhouse, guys.  Whether you like the way we are or not, we rock.  We can outdamage almost anyone in the game, and we have a pocket tank that can do most mobs that are of interest.<br>
<br>
I still chuckle at the thought of those folks ages ago begging for a root spell &quot;We need an escape hatch!&quot;  Pfft.  Gate is our escape hatch.  When Gonad is at 20% health, you should already know whether you're going to click the Gate button or not.  That's a personal peeve of mine, pay no mind, just had to write it.  <br>
<br>
Later, all - <br>

You ignore my point because you think i'm attacking her motives, when in fact, I feel that I'm attempting to straighten out a potentially devastating copy and paste epidemic in which people reiterate this point a bazillion times, perhaps not because they believe it, but because they assume it's fact. Instead of arguing that it would never become a copy and paste epicdemic, or that people are smart enough to distinguish history from opinion, you argue that I was wrong to make the observation.<br>
<br>
And I disagree with your example of past historical documents. 1) It's possible to make an unbiased history. 2) Just because past historical documents have done it, doesn't make it okay to do it 3) Just because past historical documents have done it, doesn't mean it's wrong for me to speak out against it.<br>
<br>
If you don't think arguing semantics is a speed bump, look at how useless the entire semantics conversation has been.

<br>
I didn't pick to play a magician so that I could use a single spell (Trod) and simply play vending machine.  <br>
I don't see a magician as a bent old man picking up Trods and dropping them again while everyone else fights.<br>
<br>
I don't see magicians as a one way raid-bus-service using CotH.<br>
<br>
I *do* see mages as a swirling maelstrom of elemental death, between pets, nukes, DSs PB nukes, etc.<br>
<br>
That is why I chose to play as a magician.  To be a damage dealer, to devistate opponents with my offensive spells and a powerful minion...<br>
<br>
Well, after the changes to our class, I'm reduced to Trods and chainpetting.  My best nukes don't work in a raid situation, and because they're not lures, won't stick on many things even if they did work.  Magician mana, to put it simply, is a thousand times more useful in your cleric/necro/druid/wizard/enchanter's mana bar.<br>
<br>
That alone should be tricking alarms at VI, that my class is useless to the point that our high end role consists of giving our mana away to others.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this new round of balencing will restore mages to the role of damage dealer again.  Perhaps PoP will have something useful for us.  But I just don't see it happening.  So far, changes have been applied in magnitude of the player-base-clout.  And because there are so few mages, we have extreamly little clout.<br>
<br>
And, if VI acts as they always have, that means we will get very little attention.<br>
<br>
Just to clarify and sum up, my issue with the mage class is not that we arn't useful enough (although the point could be argued, it already has been, and I won't insult your intelligance by doing so again), but that our role has so changed...to be frank, &quot;This isn't what I signed up for.&quot;<br>
<br>
Clerics still heal, wizards still nuke, warriors still tank, however the mage play style has changed from a damage dealing role to support.  I wanted to be a damage dealer, and I don't want to start over as a wizard.  Mages are supposed to be the second best nukers, VI has maintained that we are (cough) and thats the role I signed up for.<br>
