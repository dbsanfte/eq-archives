Some feel that there are certain placeholders, others feel that it's random, others feel that there is a point system.  All of these are covered in some detail in previous posts.<br>
<br>
Personally I've only seen the her (yes HER, see my poll in the Polls section hehe) four times in my 3 years of playing EQ.  One of the best tactics I think is simply to bind on the high hill south of Paw from where you have a great view, and just kill everything in the area between Paw/Aviak City/Hermits.  That seems to produce the most spawns in most posts you'll read.<br>
<br>
But be aware, no one, at least to my knowledge, has ever truly pinned this down.  It's luck of the draw as far as I can tell.  You almost HAVE to have a good tracker (I prefer Ranger 50+) dedicated to helping you and a few friends or guildies can't hurt...if they're terribly patient that is.  Average time for this camp seems to be anywhere from 0-300 hours.  I think the average would be in the 30-90 hours range assuming no competition.<br>
<br>
Also, be aware that many lower level trackers/players will PHARM this item and just offer to multi-quest it for a power-level to 46 or so.  Some people approve of that system others do not (I'm more in the &quot;do not&quot; camp).<br>
<br>
I answer in detail here because this camp was one main reasons I took a year long hiatus from EQ.  I had a 53rd level Mage and camped for 80 hours and never saw it once!  Quillmane is an insult to the player's intelligence.  On the up side, she is pretty to look upon...sucks that we have to slay the poor innocent thing hehe.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps a bit.<br>
<br>
Good luck brother of the Elements!<br>

First of all, I have a 62 Druid, so I used her.  Just so much easier with tracking and SoE.  You really need either an alt or a friend who can track.  <br>
<br>
I did kind of a widened triangle between the Hermit, Paw, and the Aviaks, but spent most of my time between Paw and the Aviaks.  I killed all of the escaped split paw gnolls that came up on track.  When there were no gnolls, I killed other critters, mostly lions and wolves, some elephants.<br>
<br>
She spawned 2 times for me, both times at around the same spot, West and just a little South of Paw (North and just a little West of the Aviaks, if you want to triangulate.)  The first time she spawned after about an hour, and she dropped the legs.  The second time was about a half hour after the first spawn, and she dropped the cloak.<br>
<br>
My mage was camped at Paw, I logged her on really quick, nervous as hell that someone would see Quillmane's corpse.  There were 3 other people in the zone, all at Paw, but they were busy killing gnolls.  My mage was able to sit there and wait for the timer to expire, and she got her cloak.<br>
<br>
I realize that I may have been just incredibly lucky, but all I can do is describe what I did and the success I had.  Hope it helps...  =)<br>

<br>
Once a young bard (level 21) called that he saw Quill, and I and another mage ran down to where he was.  I was sowed (I go through a lot of potions), found him just north of the Aviaks, nuked first, and by time the pet caught up he Quill was on the run.  Dropped the leggings, and I let the bard loot em.<br>
<br>
Second time a tracker called that Quill was up, I manged to spot it just to the west of me.  Again I was able to get the kill (this time before anyone else was even close).  This time she dropped the cloak!<br>
<br>
Took me most of two levels, getting very minimal experience, but killing for minor experience kept me sane while I waited. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mastercaledronius>MasterCaledronius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#333333>(1/2/03 7:59:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1543.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.home.earthlink.net/~slitherjack/CALFACE.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Quillmane</span><hr size=1> Glad that worked for you Cuprin <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I camped South Karana, a combination of Aviaks and Hermit from about 25 to 29 and only saw Quill once.

I also wanted to make sure that I wasn't talking down those who wait til higher levels to camp quill, I just wanted to offer a different perspective for those who might not be out of the &quot;gnoll exp&quot; range.  The mage is my second character, the first being a monk that spent a looooong time killing green minotaurs waiting for Raster to sapwn, so I understand what a pain killing greenies can be.<br>
<br>
I also was very lucky as the first time there was only one other mage in zone, about five levels lower than I was, and the second time a lower level mage, and a higher level one that already had his epic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ice8601>ice8601</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 6:17:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm25.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1543.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Quillmane</span><hr size=1> Being the owner of 2 of these fine cloaks, here is my take on it.

using a tracker friend, kill escaped splitpaws, bull elephants, cyclopse and undead cyclopse. <br>
thats it. <br>
one note, she will not spawn at night.<br>
I like to camp at the hill where you can see paw and KFC.<br>
Gives a great vantage point. <br>
By focusing on these mobs. i have had 8 spawns and 2 cloaks. all in about 10hrs of camping this peice.<br>
I got 2 because, I fell in love with levitate. so after I complete the epic, i dont have to go back and look for her. (MQ is avalible on Tarew Marr if you need it.)<br>
I have helped others in my guild aquire this item using the same method.<br>

I don't think the clops has anything to do with it personally b/c killing the cyclopses did not do a thing for me.
