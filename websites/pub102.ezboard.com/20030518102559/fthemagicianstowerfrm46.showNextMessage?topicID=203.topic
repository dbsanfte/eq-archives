<br>
I've read up quite a bit, but I'm curious about some stuff.<br>
<br>
We will be trying with this group...<br>
<br>
62nd level mage (me, BO5 and 62 pet)<br>
61st shaman<br>
61st cleric<br>
60th paladin<br>
58th ranger<br>
55th enchanter (ack)<br>
<br>
Ok, Im more than a bit concerned that the enchanter is too low in level to deal with the resist rate on the Trial mobs.  Anyone have any info on what their magic resist is like?  We are hoping that, since the chanter isnt part of the DPS equation, we will be able to get through even though he's really too low.  This is our adventuring group so suggestions about replacing people won't really help.<br>
<br>
We are planning on doing a standard strategy of pull em all, kill one at a time while chanter mezes the rest.  Obviously, this won't work real well if he can't get his mez to stick.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions/comments would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Personally, I don't see how it's going to work with those particular group members.  I just don't think you'll have the DPS.  Shaman, cleric, and enc = no dps.  58 ranger?  Awesome sounding xp group tho!<br>
<br>
The great thing about the trials is that they are really fun no matter what.  You don't have to succeed to come away with some xp, items, parch, and some memories of a heated battle.<br>
<br>
I'd say, regardless of what folks say here, do it anyway and see for yourself.  Since you aren't going to change the make-up of the group, there isn't much room for suggestions.<br>
<br>
Make sure you guys get as many buffs as possible from other folks.  You will pretty much have to do them one at a time because AE isn't feasible in that setup.<br>
<br>
My guess is that you'll fail on the first wave due to lack of speed or you'll at least run out of mana if you reach the 2nd or 3rd. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=411018&amp;resize=true&quot;" target="_new">Talusini Petuccini</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arch Mage - Master of the Elements<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverlynxsilentfist>Silverlynx Silentfist</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/03 9:27:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looking for help on first trial attempt</span><hr size=1> Well, we arent expecting any DPS out of the enchanter or the cleric, but saying that the shaman will throw out 0 is more than a bit unfair.  Her 61st level dog with chanter speed and blades of walnan generally throws out around 45 DPS against 1st tier mobs.  Also, she says that conventional shaman wisdom is to throw out nukes during trials.  Now we aren't talking mage nukes here by any stretch, but conservative estimates put her nuking power at around 25 or 30 DPS (a bit less if she has to use poison due to cold resist levels).<br>
<br>
We are estimating<br>
<br>
Mage 60 DPS (I think this is a bit low...but Im not sure how much of a hit i'll need to take in order to maintain my mana)<br>
Mage pet 80 DPS<br>
Shaman 30 DPS<br>
Shaman pet 40 DPS<br>
Paladin 45 DPS<br>
Ranger 65 DPS<br>
Enchanter 0 (though he his pet may contribute occasionally...who knows)<br>
Cleric 0 (though he might be able to do some meleeing early on?)<br>
<br>
Total 320 DPS<br>
<br>
Its a bit lower than the highest target I've heard (333 DPS) but all of those are conservative estimates based on our experience/logs in other 1st tier environments.  That being said, we don't really know for sure what to expect from the Trial mobs.  Do they tend to mitigate better than other similarly leveled 1st tier mobs?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the reply.  I'm hoping that we prove you wrong, but we are fully prepared to put some levels on the enchanter and ranger if thats what we need to do.  We set the goal of trying at the end of the month and it is upon us.  If our group can't put out the DPS, even with some levels on the ranger and chanter I'm not sure what we will do.  I could always use my monk instead, but I think subbing out the mage for a monk is a *really* bad idea.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You're kidding yourself actually. I hate to be blunt, but if you try and maintain this number, you'll be OOM before the end of the 2nd wave. Your target number using nothing but SOFB, is 35DPS (2,000/60). This number accurately reflects tossing out 1 SOFB per mob. The goal is to be down a mere 25% of your mana by the 4th mob. (SOFB for me uses up about 6-7% mana, tossing out 4 of these usually downs me about  25%) If your group is really good, you'll have time to regen 10% of that, and with a mod rod you're even better. Also, don't forget that without a Druid, you'll need to be throwing out Banishments as well. Using this strategy I end up around 30% for the exe fight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Mage pet 80 DPS<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
A bit hopeful. 60DPS is more like it. Maybe 70DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Shaman 30 DPS<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Hmmm, not sure on this but my expectations are lower for a shaman.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Shaman pet 40 DPS<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, a bit hopeful. 30-35DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Paladin 45 DPS<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Take it down a small notch. Depending on equipment and AA they might be able to do this, but from my experience (and numerous parses) Paladins top out at 40DPS and usually hit 35DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ranger 65 DPS<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, probably a bit optimistic. I'd say about 50DPS. Remember, the nature of exe fights make it near impossible to use Archery.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Enchanter 0 (though he his pet may contribute occasionally...who knows)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Take this up to 20DPS. Most chanters I work with are able to function well with at least 1 nuke a fight.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Cleric 0 (though he might be able to do some meleeing early on?)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Depending on the how the fight goes, you can take this up to 20DPS. I know some clerics who nuke in exe, in between heals. Of course, they have ungodly mana pools.<br>
<br>
BTW, you only need about 300DPS to get through this fight. The key is to have a tank on the ball. Make hotkeys for the specific mobs, MALOSINI the mobs you plan on Banishing (to solidify the banishment), and send the pet in as soon as you get the target from the tank.<br>
<br>
By my count you should be able to make it through by the skin of your teeth. <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller, 61st Arch Mage of Requiem<br>

Sorry.<br>
<br>
First I think 61 Air might be the better choice.<br>
I havent tried 62 water in trials yet but I also don't intend to do so. why? during the waves you can forget positioning. Neither you or the tank will have time for that. And on Boss it hardly will make a difference. compared to that I find the Stun of Air Pet really usefull. In my parses I have often seen a few seconds &quot;break&quot; in the attacks by the Mob...so that helps your cleric ;-)<br>
Also...if something goes wrong esp at Boss mob (like Tank dies) you might have a small chance to still make it with Air Pet tanking. Water Pet = forget it, I think.<br>
<br>
But beside that it all comes down to dps.<br>
as others already said: 300+ dps on EVERY Mob = win, less than that = you lose.<br>
<br>
As for dps:<br>
61 air pet comes out at between 50-60 dps (that was with Blades, Mask, Belt, Bo3(was 61 at that time) and best haste from epic enc (dont ask me with that was exactly)) and all procs and spells included.<br>
I did 60-70 dps on every Mob<br>
So I came down to 110-120 dps for Mage. (DS did about 15)<br>
<br>
Our Pala (61/62 at that time) usually came out at 50-55 dps, but he's pretty well equipped, so 40-45 might be realistic for you.<br>
<br>
Enc and cleric both usually do 30 dps as well.<br>
In your case I doubt your enc can cast a lot Nukes because he is so low lvl.<br>
so you might be left with 30 dps from cleric. But...I think your enc will have serious problems with mezzing....so you all will get pounded a lot, so cleric will have more to do...so probably no nukes at all.<br>
<br>
Once we had a 61 Ranger (non epic) with us and he did between 40-65 dps.<br>
<br>
Let's count an optimistic 70 dps for Shaman (35 Pet+35 Nukes).<br>
<br>
So...that leaves you in best case with:<br>
120 (mage)+50(Pala)+70 (sham)+50 (Rang)+30 (cle)<br>
<br>
so all that could come down to the needed 300 dps. <br>
But I pretty much estimated &quot;max values&quot; here.<br>
Let Cleric be busy with healing..under 300.<br>
Let Ranger get slowed (I think he will because of his lvl) and he might drop to 30 dps (at least that happened to our Ranger when he got slowed)...under 300.<br>
Get a few resists on your nukes...under 300.<br>
<br>
Not wanting to sound negative, but if I would get 1 pp for 10, I would still bet all my money against you. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_new2.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yizanpetpimpin>Yizan Pet Pimpin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 67<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/03 2:54:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home1.gte.net/res0rg9w/tomoanim3.gif width=100 height=125></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looking for help on first trial attempt</span><hr size=1> While DPS is a pretty large factor in trials, what I have seen is that working together and communicating to each other is equally important.  Make sure the tanks have a hot key to let the group know they are slowed so the slow can be removed.  Make sure you communicate to the group when you intend to banish, this lets the tank know to grab a new mob.  I would say probably THE most important thing is to beat into the tanks head that he MUST grab new targets quickly when one old ones die, dont bother taunting before breaking mez, no time for that.  If the chanter would be too fragile, it may be good to have the warrior pick a new mob at 10% and get a taunt in before the first dies, but he should be breaking mezz ASAP when one mob drops, you need to get on the next mob quickly.  I cannot stress to you enough the importance of Damage Shields, the mage DS and shaman potion DS stack, by using both on your tank it can significantly improve your DPS.  Before you port in group DS your whole group, then single DS the tank and have him down a potion, this should be the last buff before popping in.<br>
<br>
Hope this advice has helped some.  In the end I would say dont expect to win right away.  I attempted the trial at least 75 times in the span of 3 weeks in various pick up groups.  As has already been said, you dont have to beat the trial to have fun.  In every failed attempt I learned a little more, and in some of them I managed to get parchments and if nothing else the trials are good for XP so long as you stay alive.  I would say to go into this expecting the worst, hoping for the best, and just enjoy yourself with your friends. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

As a result, we were only able to get one real attempt in.  For our first effort I think it went pretty well.  <br>
<br>
We made it through the first wave with loads of time to spare (about 20 seconds or so of downtime).  I was at about 85% mana or so when the second wave popped in.  The other guys were &quot;good&quot; on mana but I wasnt able to get specific percentages.  The chanter had little trouble keeping things mezed on the first wave.  No rocks or named spawned.<br>
<br>
The second wave things went to hell unfortunately.  The big problem was our paladin missed the part of the plan that involved targeting the rock guys first.  We got 3 fungus guys and 1 rock.  He targetted a fungus guy first so everyone got on it.  I banished the rock guy but he resisted.  At just about that moment the paladin got mezed.  Things sort of went downhill from there.  Despite the drama, we managed to kill two of the mobs in the second wave.  I know the rock guys can't be mezzed...can they be stunned?<br>
<br>
Its not a resounding success, but considering how we did on the first wave I think we can pull it off with a favorable pop.  We have already refined our tactics some and it should make a difference.  After we recovered from our first attempt, the enchanter's munchkin woke up and he had to call it a night.  We were up for an attempt, so we went ahead and tried again with only 5 members, no crowd control, shaman haste, and no clarity on the shaman or the cleric.  We knew we were going to get smoked, but we were curious as to how bad it would be.  It wasn't as bad as we thought it would be.<br>
<br>
Our first pop had a rock, 2 fungus, and a named fungus.  The shaman used the AE slow (by all accounts a mistake, but it was an experiment so what the hey) and did a good portion of the tanking.  My banish landed on the rock (sans tash or malo that was pretty much pure luck Im guessing) and we proceeded to beat down the named guy.  He went down easier than I thought he would and we then moved on to the other guys.  We put down the first wave, again with lots of time to spare.  I used a bit more mana (was sitting at about 80% when the 2nd wave popped) but the cleric used a lot more mana (surprise).  Next wave had two rocks and two fungus.  I managed another banish once it refreshed, but the shaman was having serious resist issues so they were putting out the pain a bit faster this time.  To make a long story short (too late) the paladin went down and we bugged out.  Considering that we were a man short, we were glad to have gotten as far as we did.<br>
<br>
As far as DPS goes, I ended up dropping approx 50 DPS (occasional BWS clickage..its kind of long for the trial environment but with horse and shrunk buddies it seemed to be a nice supplement).  My pet pulled about 70, but I think I'm going to give Euphorion's suggestion a try and see how the air pet does.  I didn't know how it would play out but, as you said, positioning was pretty much not happening.  Too bad.  Not sure how everyone else's numbers turned out DPS wise.  We will all have to do some logging and comparing on our next attempts so we can see where we need to improve.<br>
<br>
We did make use of the shaman DS potions.  Top end for the paladin and low end for everyone else, as our shaman isn't alchemical enough to make the good ones and we weren't able to buy any of em last night.  I think these are easily underestimated and we will be trying to use them in all of our future attempts.  We've decided not to mess with slowing.  It generates more trouble than its worth considering all of the mobs were slow-mitigated...a tidbit that I hadn't read anywhere.  The shaman is going to stick to debuffing (resist debuffing that is) and nuking.<br>
<br>
We are going to give it another shot on Saturday.  Hopefully, our experience both together and now with the trials (though it is still limited) will make a difference.  I'll post again once we have had a couple more shots at it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input guys,<br>

He's going to get a lot of resists and get beat on a lot, I personally would not depend much on his crowd control.  Instead, I might get a little unconventional.  Especially if your shaman is pretty well equiped.<br>
<br>
I would probably ask the enchanter to try to mez no more than 2 mobs maximum per wave, and would be happy if he kept one under wraps.  I would have the shaman slow an add after sending her pet on the main target and just let it beat on her while you kill the other 3.  It shouldn't do much damage to her after being slowed and that will let the DS work some and save the enchanter a bit of pounding.  The only downside is that the shaman pet will probably end up on the add quite a bit, but that's better than having your enchanter squashed after a couple of resists.<br>
<br>
I would also strongly encourage the cleric to break out his/her hammer and melee some.  With shaman dex buffs there should be lots of procs and it's not like they would be able to sit to med much anyway.  Besides which, a good shaman can heal plenty for the entire trial and their mana regen is second to none.<br>
<br>
For a good shot, you will also want as many outside buffs as possible.  At a minimum you will want a C3/4 and better haste than your enchanter can supply (Shissar or Valon probably).  Some nice attack buffs from a higher level ranger and beast crack would also help. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103898" target="top">Master Evelle Fyrestrike</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

(You have a paladin that can rez if somebody dies so the cleric isn't a requirement)<br>
<br>
1) Tell the tank not to waste time by taunting before breaking mez and to use 1hs to break mez ASAP.  (Slap his head until he acknowledges.)  If mez isn't broken you can't send your pet and wasting precious DPS.<br>
<br>
2) Set up your group in a corner. Next to the stage or back corner.<br>
<br>
3) DS the tank and don't slow the mobs. (Slow the boss).  Any damage taken by the unmezzed mobs beating on the damage shield means you have less damage per second required when it's that mobs turn to die. <br>
<br>
4) Malosi rocks before you attempt to banish.  If only one rock don't bother banishing and just melee it first.  (Hotkey that banish is inc. and if the melee's target disappears to assume it's been banished.  A confused tank searching for a banished target will lose a trial.<br>
<br>
5) Don't waste mana on the first mob of each wave.  You have ~10 seconds extra to kill the first mob of each wave then you do to kill the last 3.  (The executioner spawns in the corner of the room and walks to center aisle.  Then when mobs die it spawns at the aisle.)<br>
<br>
6) Before you begin 4th wave ask your priests about mana.  If priests are under 40% mana tell your group to do the following before last mob of 4th wave is killed.  (To kite executioner while priests med)<br>
<br>
Click of damage shields (Don't want the executioner to be summoning or he'll wack the kiter requiring a heal which negates the whole process)<br>
Destroy Pet unless you have pet hold / suspend companion (Repeated AE's will agro pets and do damage to exec and start summoning)<br>
Malosi the Executioner<br>
Slow the executioner. (chances are the slower will get agro so they should be ready to kite.)<br>
Tell the priests to refrain from healing the kiters as much as possible or the healer will take agro.  Especially if the kiter only has first range agro.<br>
<br>
<br>
When the priest is comfortable with their mana engage.<br>

I know the easiest solution is to change out people, but we adventure together all the time so anyone that gets left out of the trial is someone that can't adventure with us in PoS or PoV.  Sure the enchanter is kind of low to be there anyway so I can understand the wisdom of replacing him (though I really dont want to suggest it...the constant outdoor fighting of the planes has lessened his enjoyment as an enchanter quite a bit already).  If we leave the cleric or the shaman behind then we won't have a cleric or shaman in storms/valor....from what I understand thats kind of a big hit.<br>
<br>
If we have no luck on our next attempt(s), we may have the best luck trying to powerlevel the chanter up a few levels.  With a concetrated effort in nightmare or disease we could probably get him up to 60th in a relatively short time.  It would be nice to not have to do that...but if we have to in order to succeed it will get done.<br>
<br>
RE: Amel's Guide<br>
<br>
1) Done it, both online and in person.  I think it sunk in.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2)  We were doing the back corner...to the right on enter.<br>
<br>
3) Doing double (potion+aegis of ro) DS on everyone and Flameshield on the pally.  Going to try with no slows next time in (except on the big guy of course)<br>
<br>
4) Good suggestion.  We were just relying on the chanter tashing the rocks...perhaps waiting the banish on the tash malosi combo would be safer.  In you guys' experience is Tash not enough for a reasonable chance at no resist on banish?  Also, I'll have to be sure to stress the importance of switching targets after banish.  I haven't touched on that specifically in my &quot;briefings&quot;.<br>
<br>
5) Interesting.  The first mob of each wave eh?  I hadn't heard this one...are you sure about it?  Any idea how much more time you get?<br>
<br>
6) Thats sort of our plan.  I dont have /pet hold but I was hoping that I could /pet back off him and get him to hold back.  Does that generally not work well enough?  Id hate to be the one to mess everything up...but Id also like to have a aego'd pet for the big guy..just in case my pet has to spot the paladin on tankage.  If I'm going to use the air pet, I'd like to do whatever I can to maximize his usefulness.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oggar, thats a good suggestion on shaman/chanter synergy...we've been known to do something similar to that when hunting at times.  We may have to give that a shot.  Our shaman isnt uber, but she could easily tank one (maybe two) of these guys if they are slowed.  Anyone know what percentage slow is mitigated on these guys?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks yet again for the help/suggestions guys.<br>

At the start of a wave the exec begins at the back-right corner. He then walks to the middle, does a 90 degrees turn and starts walking to the stage. It takes him about 10 seconds to get to the spot where he normally pops after you kill a mob. So you get 10 sec extra on the first. <p>Arch Convoker Rhand Drago'Magica<br>

<br>
No, sorry but /pet back off won't work nearly well enough.  I have tried before I got /pet hold and it resulted in a wipe.  If it gets to the point of kiting the Executioner, you do NOT want him summoning or it makes things 10 times harder.  He casts this crappy &quot;Armor Break&quot; AE nearly constantly (makes a very annoying swooshing sound too) that will aggro your pet.  Either you will LD your group with the /back off spam or the pet will get in a hit or cast on the EXE and start tanking him, it's almost a guarantee.<br>
<br>
Kiting the EXE is not really a fun process.  I've had to do it a few times with marginal groups with moderate success.  We did it a bit different than Amel suggests though.  Our tactic was not to touch the EXE at all but let him proximity aggro on the tank and start chasing him.  This worked well since everyone else could med, but it had some quirks.  With the EXE unslowed he was a pretty deadly variable running around the room and a mean one too.  Since he just has proximity aggro on the kiter, he is touchy as hell.  We found you could sit to med safely in any corner as long as you didn't cast at all (not even self buffs) with the EXE in your half of the room.  When ready, the cleric hits the tank with a HoT from across the room and you engage, slow, kill.<br>
<br>
One last tip, don't waste mana on Mala on the big guy.  In 20+ wins I have only had him resist Malosini once.  That is with no Tash or OOS either.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103898" target="top">Master Evelle Fyrestrike</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I don't agree on the kill the rock first strat either for this very reason. you do have more time to kill on the first mob and I say take a fiend then go to a rock IF able to target quickly.<br>

Also the bane of the trial are named mobs. Sure they drop loot/parchment almost everytime but when they do appear it makes the trial so much tougher as they have much more HP and hit harder than the regular monsters. The real opponent here is time and EVERY second counts. The Prime executioner is a pushover, it has approximately about 20,000 HP (which isn't too much), and double hits for 700 max. Once slowed any decent tank could tank it. <p><p><a

do rocks until you have only one left (get to this in a sec)<br>

the rock you leave up should have tash, and probably malo on it.  that rock is your freebie, if things are going good, kill it like normal.  if things are falling apart, named mob not dying fast enough, nuke resists, whatever..you can banish it and get some more time.  most times you can kill it normally, sometimes it saves ya butt.  only note to this is that your healer should probably have a horse so they don't have that rock chasing them when they try to med.<br>

the easiest wave you are ever gonna have is 4 rocks, they die so fast it's not even funny...a focused firebolt is like half their HP in one shot.  the hardest would be 3 fiends and a named.  with the group you have there, i could almost guarantee a worst case wave would set you far enough behind you couldn't recover.  you gonna just have to get the plan down and keep trying and hoping for a good run.<br>
<br>
without pet hold you'll want to cancel pet when boss pops if you're kiting...on the other hand since you're cancelling pet anyway you can go ahead and cannipet your mana up to full fast, give out new rods if needed, redo DS, and still go into exe fight with like 90m after making another pet.  pallies can get insane aggro with chain-stuns (sure you know that) so you can use that extra mana to just hammer him down.  killing the executioner is insanely easy if you can avoid being summoned. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zacatac>Zacatac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1730<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/03 5:02:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looking for help on first trial attempt</span><hr size=1> We did a guild group last night.<br>
<br>
62 enchanter<br>
62 wizard<br>
62 magician<br>
61 paladin<br>
59 beastlord<br>
58 druid<br>
<br>
Group was Aego'd and Focus'd by guildmates before entering.<br>
<br>
We killed PE on 3rd attempt. With KEI, Beastlord buff, my Xenogy's buff, mod rods and gear I was a nuking machine and still at 60% when we got to boss.  Got a parchment and a nice clr/dru/sha earring too.<br>
<br>
We did single target strategy.  Rocks and named first.  If named + rock appears, MA takes named and I do banishment on the rock.  If 2 rocks appear, MA takes nearest 1, and I did banishment on the 2nd one.  Only needed to do it twice, but I did manage to pull it off (I mala'd them 1st, then banished) and it helped a bit.  With 2 pets + BL, tank and 2 nukers, things were dying a just the right speed.<br>

<br>
When I have done &quot;one mob at a time&quot; trial groups I typically tossed a minimum of 1 SoFB, and typically 2, per mob.  In some cases I have nuked each mob 3 times.  Then I pet canni between waves.<br>
<br>
I save the Banishment for &quot;just in case&quot; we aren't quite dropping the mobs fast enough, and we need a quick reset of the executioner.<br>
<br>
If I need to use more than 2 Star Rubies, the group dps is insufficient.<br>
<br>
In my case, I did trials at 60, so without the benefit of PoP pets or epic.  I could have nuked somewhat less if I had the 61 or 62 pet at the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 906<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/03 8:25:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Looking for help on first trial attempt</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Malosi the Executioner<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

In my experience, it is exceptionally difficult to get Malosi or Malosini to land without some help from Tash and Mala/Malo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showMessageRange?topicID=187.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showPrevMessage?topicID=187.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showNextMessage?topicID=187.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=187.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.threadControl?topicID=187.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=187.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=187.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46>Planes of Power</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
