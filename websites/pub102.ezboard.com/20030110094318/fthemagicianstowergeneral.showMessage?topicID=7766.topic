I just dinged 48 last night after 4 hours of Skellies in DL. <br>
<br>
 I am currently just looking at 52 and beyond to see what I should be learning and what I should be looking out for as far as AAXP and Gear and Where I should fight things like that.  I like to prepare for what I am going to do next while I am not able to be playing.  This way when it comes time to play I can maximize that time.  <br>
<br>
So I have a cuople of question that I thougth maybe the wise Arch Convokers of Norrath and those on there way there might be able to help me with.  I am personally leaning towards some type of a split on AAXP and regular xp from 55 on up.   <br>
<br>
I dont want this thread to turn into a debate on which is better I dont care really I just want to feel like I am accomplishing something while I XP grind out the next two months.  I figure if I am getting some AA along the way I will have something to look forward to at least.  <br>
<br>
First of all my gear is weak.  I have basically crap for resists and I dont even have 255 int.  I have minimal gear that offers any type of effects either.  I have recently acquired a BWS and I have not added it to my magelo yet.  So I do have a right clicky (broke my frickin bank but I have one).  <br>
<br>
I was wandering what I should go for in the way of gear.  Specifics would be awesome.  If there are any quests I can do at say 52 or 55.  I am an Evocation mage so that might have some impact on gear selection.  Just let me know what you think any feed back is what I am looking for.<br>
<br>
Second what AAs should I get.  I am thinking about getting run3 for sure.  I would also like to get SCM and the one that allows crits since I am evoc.  Just as a side note I have heard a lot about 5 second pets what AA do you need to accomplish this.  I know that I am evoc but this would help me greatly and probibly prevent death while soloing.  Also what other AA skills do you feel are worthy of a mages time.  <br>
<br>
Third dont know exactly where I am going to fight so if you have any input on favorite spots plz let me know.<br>
<br>
I am also curious to see how long it takes to do the grind from 52 to 65 any estimates of online time.  I have to find a way to get this done.  I have a limited amount of time and will need to make sure I am using my time wisely and fitting in EQ whenever I can.  <br>
<br>
I would like to thank everyone in advance.  The players on this board have changed my EQ experience forever.  I am so glad that I have found this community where I can pick the minds of those who are far greater at EQ than myself.  Just a testament to the power of this board is how quickly I have moved up through the ranks compared to the first time I played.  <br>
<br>
Back in 99 when I played I took a mage from 1-24 in 17 online days.  Now that is a blazing pace I know.  But now with Ravian I have been playing for 9 online days including 1 day online time sitting in bazaar and 1 day at least PLving friends.  So 10 less days to get to 48 than it took me to get to 24 the last time.  I am hoping to hit 60 in about 18 online days or so.  If I stay focused I think it is posible. <br>
<br>
You guys are awesome.  Thanks for your time and your wisdom.  I have a great love for the mage class and reading these boards makes me proud.  MAGE POWAH!!!!  oh yeah and erudites are the best class.<br>
<br>
Also if this is not the correct place for this post please feel free to move it.  It just didnt fit into one single catagory of the board so I put it in general.  Also everyone knows that the other parts of the boards dont get looked at as much :P Thanks<br>

The bar moves so slow as it is in the mid 50's, don't add to the delay. <br>
<br>
Try to pick a point where you've got a good xp rhythm, then pick up the AA's you feel you need, then switch back to normal xp.<br>
<br>
From a psychological perspective, it will seem like you're getting a lot more done that way.<br>
<br>
Others can provide better advice than I on where those points might be in your career.<br>
<br>
As far as gear and levelling, I spent a lot of time in Scarlet desert from 51 to 54, its good xp, but try to have your resists up in case you fight the blood tribe shammies.  I would usually make more than enough in pp and drops to pay for kei refreshes on a regular basis. Maybe not the best 'pure' xp spot in the world, but a pleasant pp/xp combo.<br>
<br>
From a gear perspective, look for bargains where you can, if you don't have super high int, then leave some inventory space for extra malachite. BWS &gt; 255 int, so i think you've got a good start already. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
as for places to hunt I suggest the 6th floor of the tower of frozen shadows if you can get there. CR is a pain, but the kobold looking guys are great xp till they turn light blues at i think it was 53(?) they drop a few plat each and are easy to kill, when you get the 51 earth and the 52 air they are a push over. <br>
<br>
As for the aaxp, at 55 I put 20% to aaxp, at 56 I had run 1 and almost run 2. once i get run 3 I am going to stop aaxp till 60 or 65 dont know. I dont think it is worth it to save for aaxp till you are high level, but run 3 is a life saver.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=madcazter>Madcazter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#333333>(11/6/02 10:17:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7766.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: On the way to Arch Convoker</span><hr size=1> Greetings,<br>
<br>
I can try to give you some good advice on AA points from a personal view. I was lvl 60 when AA's came out so naturally what would be green to me at 60 would be blue to you at 51, with that being said, If I was 51 when AA's came out I would have went 100% in AA's for lvl 51 got what I wanted then went back to 100% exp.<br>
<br>
I know this may not be the consenus of the main stream and I do realize that lvl's are your best thing you can get, being an officer in my guild we discourage AA's before lvl 60. But imho AA's are a lot easier to get at lower lvl's VS Higher lvl's.<br>
<br>
Dont sweat your gear that will get better as you have time to commit to raids ect.<br>

<br>
I'd get run3 at 51 asap - being able to run away from most mobs will save you xp in the long run.<br>
<br>
If you do nothing but solo &amp; have epic, get them at 51 - epic pet is overpowered vs. mobs you will be fighting.<br>
<br>
If you group 100% of the time, i'd get aas at 65 fer sure. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buppy>Buppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(11/7/02 1:00:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7766.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: On the way to Arch Convoker</span><hr size=1> First off, get out of the 'int is king' mind set. Once you hit 200 int, you can usually do better by adding  mana items. (Mana/int over 200 is only half the value of below 200.) At 52, that 3 int earring is only giving you 15 mana. Summoned earring is better, even without the effect.<br>
<br>
Get all the HP and mana you can get. The 56 rods still add decent mana regen if you remember to use them, and the more hp you have the less the hit will hurt.<br>
<br>
Third, at 57 switch specs to Conjuration. Bolts and Rains are nice, but your DD spells will get much more use (All non-bolt DD past 57 are conj based). That plus the pets/summons will save you alot more mana.<br>
<br>
Fourth, splitting AA and normal xp does at least seem to slow down disproportionately, so I'd stay at 100% either way, picking up AAs when your at the level to get the ones you want. Of course, it's probably psychological, so feel free to experiment. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Buppyy O'Boom</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
Gear-wise, the best things you can buy are an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Earring of the Solstice</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (great stats, Flowing Thought I) and a Horse. Cheapest horse is 8 or 9k depending on CHA. On Brell the Earring averages for about 10k, I imagine its the same on your server.<br>
<br>
Other useful things to get are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Clay Bracelet</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (right-click Eye of Zomm), <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>White Ceramic Band</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (right-click Burst of Flame), old focus items if you don't have them (right-click Reclaim Energy), <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Amulet of the Grey Wastes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (Worn Enduring Breath) and an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Enshrouded Veil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (Summoning Efficiency 3). I weild a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sarnak Summoner`s Dagger</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> because it procs Blaze, our level 34 nuke. Rarely melee with it and there are definitely better stat items out there I can buy, but nothing impresses friends more than a mage going melee and proccing like mad. Plus it looks cool :P<br>
<br>
Quested, I'd definitely snag the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (great stats, Flowing Thought III, buff duration focus) if you don't mind dealing with the MAJOR TIMESINK known as tradeskills. Be prepared to spend tens of thousands of plat (at the least), and a few weeks time maxing out your tradeskills for this quest.<br>
<br>
AA wise, most mages will agree, get run3 ASAP, even if you have Jboots. Back before they changed mod rods, regen3 was the way to go. Nowadays I can't say what you should get, so I stuck with regen3 and I'm still liking it (with TPP and regen3 alone, I regen at 12hp/tic standing and on horseback, 15hp/tic sitting). After that it's a good idea to wait til at least 60 before farming the serious AAs.<br>
<br>
5 Second Pets are your Class AA's Quick Summoning 3. Need to be level 59 and spend 6 AA in General, 12 AA in Archetype, and 18 to max out Quick Summoning.<br>
<br>
I recommend either 100% AA, 100% exp, or 50/50. Either way its gonna be slow.<br>
<br>
Lots of hunting spots on these boards, and an entire section dedicated to them. The most popular solo spots for low 50s seem to be Scarlet Desert on Luclin, Jaggedpine Forest on Antonica, and Ocean of Tears between Freeport and Butcherblock. Forget about soloing the planes until your 60s, btw, IF you can solo them in the first place.<br>
<br>
A good reasonable pace is a blue an hour, anything slower and you're wasting your time grouped or solo. At that rate it will take you 250 hours to go from level 50 to level 60. Post 60 I couldn't tell ya. AA is much easier to get at 60 than at 51, simply because you'll be fighting much higher level monsters for exp at 60 than you would at 51 (IE: Shrooms in FG are high 40s and perfect for a level 60 mage. Whereas Seafuries are low 40s at best and while suitable at 51 are mostly green at 60).<br>
<br>
When you get to 57, you may reconsider your choice of Evocation. 57+ all of our major DDs (Shock of Steel, Shock of Fiery Blades, Black Steel, Sun Vortex) are Conjuration. However all of our rains and bolts (as well as anti-summons) are Evocation. Whichever you pick, be happy with it, and don't let anyone tell you you're wrong. I myself am Conjuration, and it suits me just fine.<br>

Very helpful as always.  I think I have found where I am going to fight when I hit lvl 49.  I think I will go do the poachers.<br>
<br>
I read that they give you 1% per kill at lvl 51.  That would be a lot more exp than 4% per hour.  acctually more like prolly  20% per hour based on how quickly mana regains and how much mana they should take.<br>
<br>
After that I will go do nobles in HHK until 54.  There again 1 kill = 1% exp 6 min spawn two nobles = 20% per hour and not even using mana.  So I guess lvling wont slow down much until I hit lvl 55 or so.<br>
<br>
That being said is it resonable to assume that to get from lvl 50-60 it might take more like 145 hours to hit lvl 60.  5 hours a lvl up until 55 then 4% per hour there after?<br>
<br>
I would love to hear what more mages think about my gear as far as upgrades go.  Also any tips as I am about to embark upon a serious gind for almost a month to two months of playing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=7766.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=7766.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7766.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.threadControl?topicID=7766.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7766.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7766.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral>General</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
