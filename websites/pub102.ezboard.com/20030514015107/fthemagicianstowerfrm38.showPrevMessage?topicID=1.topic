Butcherblock is also very nice, but I always got major lag there, don't know why, it was much worse with 30 people there than Greater Faydark with 100 people in it.  Clearly, though, a gnome mage should leave Steamfont as soon as possible... it's not a great zone to hunt in. <BR>  <BR> Around Freeport, Eastern Commons is nearly as bad as Greater Faydark... nice zone to hunt in, but usually filled with idiots.  North Ro is a good alternative.  I like the areas around Freeport, good places to hunt for well past 10th level. <BR>  <BR> Misty Thicket deserves it's reputation as one of the best places in the game to level, and it's well worth the trip to Rivervale when you can make it.  You can hunt to 11th level or higher there, all the way to 14th if you <em>really</em> want to, although gaining exp will become progressively more difficult after 11th.  But some people like the comfort of a zone with practically no insta-death mobs. <BR>  <BR> On the far side of the world, Qeynos/Qeynos Hills are okay hunting grounds but the hilly part of Qeynos is buggy, mobs teleport constantly.  Tox forest is without a doubt the worst newbie zone in the game, dark and empty and extremely buggy as well.  Everfrost, on the other hand, is IMO a better hunting area from 1-6 than Misty Thicket even; I've taken my Erudite and Human druid characters there to level (assuming you can make it through Blackburrow and avoid the vengeful skellies in Everfrost).  I really like Everfrost from 1 to 6.  After that it's very difficult to find mobs that you can gain exp from and still solo... Qeynos Hills is better to solo, but if you group up you can hunt the Everfrost plains or go to Blackburrow or Western Karana.  Usually, though, I find a way to get to Misty Thicket or Freeport, where the hunting from 6th to 10th level is much better, solo or grouped. <BR>  <BR>  <p><font size=-1 color=#ff0080>

<br>
Obviously during levels 1-4 all the decaying skeletons, rats, kobold runts and so forth are your choice. Then at 5 and 6 try to get Kobold camp one. I soloed that camp through these entire two levels - including pulling the solo kobold on the hill side. Your level 4 AE spell is great here.<br>
<br>
At 7 things get slightly awkward - I think 7's probably the first hell level <img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)">. The area to your left after zoning into Steamfont from Lesser Fay is now home. Stay away from the skel's and puma's - these are nasty. Choice here is Kobold scouts and regular kobolds and rogue clockwork spiders (I love the sound these make when you hit them!).<br>
<br>
The camp nestled down the back of this little corner is good too - I actually had to 'break' the camp 3 times during level 7. Usually 3 out of the 5 con blue, the other two green so you can pull 3 kobolds to the hill side. The trick is to leave your pet guarding (/pet guard here) on the hill side, run down to the camp, burn and run back. Then act as the main tank getting of those AE's when you're able.<br>
<br>
I'm now at 8 so I'll be picking on all those skeleton's and odd puma that I saw roaming the hills there. I'm also going to move to the cogs down past the Mino Caves.<br>
<br>
Theoretically you could stay here till 14 killing harpies, drakes and the like with the occasional group killing mino's. I expect you'd be pretty fed up by then though. Time to move on.<br>
<br>
Happy travels!<br>

It saves you quite a bit of money since you don't have to get a bind and you get better prices at Erudin for stuff you kill.<br>
<br>
Note: Consider making your mage AGNOSTIC.<br>
<br>
Level 1-2: Possibly the easiest level to get if you are careful.  Just hang around near the Erudin porch and kill every moss snake you find.  There is a hut west of the porch with a hill where little critters crawl by...plus there's good light from the hut.  Straight south from the porch is good too, be sure to use your candle.<br>
<br>
Level 3-4: Run to Paineel!  Yes, you can hunt there and the skeleton guards watching the newbie area there will NOT hurt you.  The problem is, they also won't help you if you get in trouble.  Kill everything in sight!  If you are getting clobbered by that fire beetle gang, undead rat, or Noclin's pet, run quickly to the zone!  It's not that far.<br>
<br>
By now, you should have killed enough decayed skeletons for weapons (decent loot) to sell.  You should be able to afford your Lev 4 pet and Gate.  If you have money left over, a lantern is a great idea (unless you have are using a 2h blunt weapon).<br>
<br>
Level 5-6: Best bet for exp are Kobold scouts and watchers on the Paineel side.  There is also a 3 kobold camp on the Paineel side of Toxx which occasionally spawns a shaman.  They can still be solo'd.  The 4 kobold camp near the bridge should probably be grouped since skeletons walk by a lot...especially when you are OOM.<br>
<br>
Lev 7: Life gets a bit interesting.  Critters are a lot tougher for your pet, so you have to tank a LOT more with it.  Hit Kobold Sentries, Briar Snakes, and those pesky Skeletons.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 8, buy your new pet spell.  You will now OWN the forest.<br>
<br>
Lev 8-10: The abandoned heretic pet that walks from the bridge to Paineel is your new target.  The Skeleton Miners at the Paineel mineshaft can be taken with a group of 2-3.  At around Lev 10, try to get a group for the 4 heretic pets at the hut east of the the ivory bridge.<br>
<br>
And if you happen to find a good group (very rare in Toxxulia) you can even try to take on the cats at Kerra Isle.  Stick to the area BEFORE the bridge.  Be sure to bring a cleric to cure poison and disease. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upokets.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pokets</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(8/17/00 6:03:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Things to kill from levels 1-10</span><hr size=1> All i can say is 1-14 is Nro..Coyotes and skeles at first..then firebeetles and spiders and 'dillos...then move out to the sand..kill Jackals and Orcs till 8...rattlesnakes and desert tarans and some scarabs until 12..then get to 14 off scarabs and dervishes <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=thujone>thujone</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/00 10:31:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Things to kill from levels 1-10</span><hr size=1> I went from 4-7 fast in Qeynos Hills just killing large and giant bats near the zone to Qeynos and the guard tower near the crossroads.

 My main being a gnome necro, I was quite familiar with the intracacies of these happy mountains =)!.<br>
<br>
When I started my newbie mage (like yesterday =),) I basically decided to do the same thing my nec did in steamfont... worked out *better* than with necro actually =).<br>
<br>
Note: I was somewhat twinked... maybe 2-3k in items, basically junk off a *verY* old failed gnome wizard project of mine ... no hp gear or anything that would greatly affect the battles, did have 203 int but I really think this will all work with your little gnome starting int of 133 (if it's not 133 go back to creation right now and fix that!)<br>
<br>
1-3: Go to gnome newbie area (take path out of ak'anon turn left at fork, follow fork, in valley is newbie area.) <br>
<br>
Lvl 1: Fairly simple, don't need anything but your newbie nuke, kill the rats, anything that cons even. Don't mess with spiderlings or infected rats yet, spiderlings are slightly tougher than they con, but will be more or less cake next level, infected rats are a actually quite tougher than they con for some reason (oh no!). The fights are simple, nuke, autoattack, nuke in between the rats hits... dead rat.<br>
<br>
Lvl 2: You can do spiderlings, kobold runts, and still large rats are good xp. Be very careful with spiderlings as pulling one will indeed pull all spiderlings around it.. so if you are going to fight one (it seems spiderlings are much better xp than the other mobs their lvl from what I have observed) nuke it, run to edge of the gnome newbie valley away from the mobs and fight it there. Don't go doing anything stupid and you'll be lvl 3 soon.<br>
<br>
Lvl 3: It's going to slow down a little bit now, deal with it. Same mobs again and again and again. Patience and perseverance will get you to lvl 4.<br>
<br>
Lvl 4: Go to windmills, make the windmill with Forpar Fizfla (something similar to that) inside your base of operations.. Don't count on running to watchman mylz when you need help, MANY MANY times he has just simply be in absentia and I died expecting him to be there. So if you get in trouble run to middle mill, bust open door and hug Forpar.<br>
Pull kobold scouts (even yellows) clockworks, gnome skeletons. Pull with your lvl 4 nuke, when it attacks you back up so it fights pet (or type /pet attack as it runs at you) nuke and nuke, have hotkey for pet health and check it between nukes if pet got below 50 percent (usually did) i would run in and get aggro, autoattack and cast between mobs attacks. Keep a constant eye out for skeletons and pumas. Don't mess with female rats, large plague rats, or drakes. I dont like the windmills area because of the danger... but you don't lose xp so it's mainly just a waste of malachite if you die.. this place is really the only bridge between lvl 3 and 5 in steamfont =).<br>
<br>
Lvl 5-7 Go to the kobold camp near the newbie area. Attack one of the kobolds... you'll have to stay in melee, try to get ONE of the kobolds dead, you probably won't be able to kill all three, then run to watchman dreeb and he'll kill other two (this should break up the camp for you... more or less). If you don't want to risk this, /shout for help breaking camp (if there are shamans in the camp don't even try it period) or just shout for some buffs telling them you need them to break camp... if you don't get any answers hang around druid rings and you'll eventually druid pop up that might help.<br>
Anyways once camp is broken I would have pet guarding back from camp and I would pull to it (I used to leave pet on guard in camp but it could be bad if the spawns got screwy and you might end up with 3 on you) the only one's you'll have any trouble with will be that shamans. Really though they aren't that hard... just med up more before killing them, if you have the mana also kill kobold on hill. Do this camp all the way through lvl 5, lvl 6, and lvl 7 (getting a tad bit slow at 7 but not horrific yet... with only the lvl 4 spells it's hard to solo the other stuff in zone, anyways getting through lvl 7 at this camp won't be that painful).<br>
<br>
Lvl 8-12 Go to the big cog (it's near mino caves, can't find them? www.eqatlas.com/atlas make that your friend =). Set up camp behind the big cog (the one standing up... you should be sitting on the side of the zone wall. In front of you will be the skeleton in middle of cog, summon pet, pull with nuke, nuke nuke jump in if pet gets low (be more conservative about this now) then when that's dead turn to your right, should be a skelly there, then behind you would be a skelly by the tree then on the other side of the cog laying down is a skelly. Run around between these spawns, will get you to lvl 12 very fast. Do be careful of the mobs that will wander into the center of the cog, they can aggro you and they are a bit tougher than the skellies, although you can solo them if they bring skelly along you'll die. Pretty safe other than that... you probably will have mino hero kill you 1-2 times if you're here very long, sorry it just happens, no big deal.<br>
<br>
Lvl 12-16 Ocean of Tears!<br>
Get on boat in butcherblock, ride it TO freeport, then stay on it and ride it back TO butcherblock, along the way you will see two big rocks that the boat goes through, jump off, on the right island are two sirens. Set up pet, they won't help each other, kill them for excellent xp =). If you can kill both spawns and have mana to spare run across to other island, follow the shore of it and there is a third spawn. Stay here til lvl 16.<br>
<br>

Hunt in Greater Faydark, Freeport, Misty Thicket, Steamfont, and any other starting area. Once you get level 4, grab your spells. If you are short on cash, i recommend just getting the DD spell and Elementalkin : Water and Elementalkin : Earth. <br>
<br>
Level 4 - 8<br>
I highly enjoy Misty Thicket. Little competition and great hunting. Kill Black Bears, Shadow wolves, Giant Bats and Rats, and other things until level 10 if you want. I hunt there typically until level 8.<br>
<br>
Level 8 - 10<br>
Once I hit 8 I typically cruise around with my new pet. Crushbone is nice. Kill Cents and Legos. Get the belts and pads and turn them in for a lot of exp and some cash. Also, you could try your luck in Black Burrow. If you go to BB, get the Gnoll Fangs and turn those in for exp. I personally like Crushbone for the belts, pads, exp and good faction hits. <br>
<br>
Level 10 - 15<br>
Once level ten rolls around, you are finally experienceing the beauty of the Mage. From levels 10 - 15 I hunt in WCommons. Solo Young Kodiaks, Kodiaks, Dervs, Scarabs, Spiders, and Darkweed Snakes.<br>
<br>
That's all I have to write today. Good luck. Sorry about the Signature... I suck at HTML<br>

With the May patch, things are vastly better now for a starting mage!<br>
<br>
1. The new gnome armor quests have been added.  I just recently completed the last item at level 13 with my chanter wife to get the book, which is +5 int, +20 mana!  We both ended up with full sets of the quest armor.<br>
<br>
The quest items items are:<br>
<br>
All are LORE ITEM, MAGIC ITEM, NO DROP  <br>
<br>
Cap of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +2 Sta: +1 Int: +1 Mana: +5  <br>
 <br>
Bracer of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +1 Dex: +2 Int: +1 Mana: +3  <br>
 <br>
Legs of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +4 Sta: +2 Int: +2 Mana: +5  <br>
 <br>
Sleeves of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +3 Agi: +1 Int: +1 Mana: +5  <br>
 <br>
Robe of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +5 Agi: +2 Int: +2 Mana: +10  <br>
 <br>
Gloves of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +2 Dex: +2 Int: +1 Mana: +5  <br>
<br>
Boots of the Collective Initiate   <br>
AC: +3 Int: +1 Cha: +2 Mana: +10  <br>
 <br>
Spellbook of the Eldritch Initiate   <br>
Int: +5 Cha: +5 Poison Resist: +5 Disease Resist: +5 HP: +10 Mana: +20<br>
<br>
The mana boost alone is great.  I just swapped out the cap for a savants cap a high level gave me for zombie skins in unrest, but it's close to even for mana at this level!<br>
 <br>
2. many of the quest items that drop are sellable, and sell to the vendors for good coin.  The deseised rat tails sell for 1.5pp's (yes, thats not a typo), and drop regularly.  This is a big boost in starting plats for buying spells.<br>
<br>
All in all, this area is now fairly amazing thru level 12 - 13 where we finally left to seek our fortunes.<br>

1-4 Well this was heeeeeeeeeeeelll, when I got there, I noticed 6 roaming small mountain lions, all threatening. The only other thing to hunt were skellies and spiders... well each time I tried one, I got ganked <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Then I waited for rats and kobolds to spawn.... while I waited I died two times from lions coming out of nowhere <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I finally dinged 2, and continued to slowly hunt rats and runts through 3&amp;4.<br>
4-7 W000000T Pet! Well, this made it a lot easier. I watched someone take the first kobold camp solo, and I decided to try. I was lucky that the spawns were managable. I got up to 6, then logged. When I came back, of course, all 3 kobolds conning blue right there. So, I nuked one, and ran my ass off to Guard Halv(think it was him). When I got back, I summoned air pet, and waited. The one by the fire spawns the quickest, followed by the small tent, then quickly afterwards by the one in the larger tent. Also, there was one kobold off left on a cliff that was nice when I was waiting for another spawn. Quick exp, plus scalps for mage quests <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Gonna finish 7 tonight and hopefully move onto windmills and finish 1-10. Also, this is my first caster, so it was a little awkward (My other chars are pvp Pally and Monk, Pally is 32, Monk is 21). But I really like the mage class a LOT! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>
