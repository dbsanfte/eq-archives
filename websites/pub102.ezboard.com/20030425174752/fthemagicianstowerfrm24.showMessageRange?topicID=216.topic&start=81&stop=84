There was a ton of people in there so we were just taking out the stuff right by the enterance.  Well a bad spawn happened and we got an add right before our last mob died.  I put my pet on teh add and my guild group was able to take out the remaining health of the new mob.  I forgot the name of the add.  It's not too important, they all hit like an SoB.  Anyways, my pet died, the mob ran at the paladin, then the Cleric, then the chanter, then the wizard, then me, then the druid, then me again.  During this time I had cast another 54 water pet.  Well the paladin never got a hit off on teh mob, he was down before he even knew what hit him.  Basicly it was everyone running for their lives.  Well my pet was doing a decent job damaging him, but he had a lot of hit points.  Anyways, paladin, cleric, chanter, wizard are down.  the mob starts hitting my pet again.  The pets health was going down very fast. So I started casting a new pet almost as soon as my pet started tanking.  Well when I did a /pet get lost at 10 percent health the mob ran after me.  So I just ran around the walls at the enterance and the begining of teh tunnel that branches to the right.  I spammed /pet health so make sure the pet wasn't taking damage.  When teh pet started taking damage again. I stopped and started casting a new pet.  The druid then tried to snare the mob which doesn't work but pulls argo, thankfullly for me, after the pet dies.  That gives me enough chance to summon a new pet.  I send the pet in and the druid starts running around.  Luckily my pet takes argo again.  This time I wait a few seconds before casting a new pet cause this pet seems to be doing a pretty good job.  Then cast a new pet and do that whole running thing again, cause the mob was now very mad at me.  This time I turned off taunt and just kited him til the sucker died.  The whole time this was happening I was thinking, &quot;Oh, I am so dead, sooooooo dead.&quot;  Anwyays, somehow right after that the druid eitehr moved to the wrong place or just got unlucky with a bad spawn and and ended up pulling 3 or 4 mobs on to us. Well I was totally oom and hell there was too many of them. the druid died and I tried to run around again but instead just ended up dying in a very unhealth spot.<br>
<br>
 I don't know if this counts as solo, but I sure as hell didn't have a ton of help killing it.  ANyways, I am pretty proud of doing that..  Between that and totally taking out my whole guild in the arena night, even bet a 56 epiced monk and a high level nerco... I am pretty proud of myself<br>

I also did not list all the things that have eaten me alive along the way. Retlon and Lockjaw were retribution kills, for example. Rats have probably killed me more times that I have soloed them. They and Luclin Wolves, Lightcrawlers, and Shimmering Rockfeinds are on my most-annoying list.<br>
<br>
The basic soloing keys to me are:<br>
<br>
* Keep Gate memmed -- Gate is your best friend<br>
<br>
* Drink SoW until you get Run3 -- you need room to chain pet or get Gate off, or speed to kite an add until pet finishes off intended target<br>
<br>
* Keep Scintillation or Scars memmed -- may save your life with an unexpected add<br>
<br>
* Never sit -- if you have to sit, wait after nuking until you see the taunting message from pet<br>
<br>
* Buy a horse and stay on it -- see above -- make friends with a Shammy and get Ant potions for headless horses. With a horse, you are always regenerating mana at 20 per tick (at least for me) plus your FT items and buffs. Put /dismount into the chat window if things get scary. Quicker to be able to run and no risk of clicking off SoW/SoE by mistake.<br>
<br>
* IMMEDIATELY after engaging, get out of 1st-person view so you can see wanderers before they add on you. You can chain or Gate if things go bad with the MOB or an add on your pet; an unexpected add on you and you are dead fast.<br>
<br>
* ALWAYS /assist your pet -- pets will switch targets in a multi-MOB situation.<br>
<br>
* Run *through* the MOB and your pet when you over-nuke and get aggro<br>
<br>
* Pull with malise-line spells, low-level (4?) bolt, or White Ceramic Bracelet.<br>
<br>
* Use an Extended Range piece so you can buff and heal pet from a safer distance, as well as pulling from farther away. Drachnid Thxyl is soloable with 53 Air -- though A Dread Widow will HT -- hit me for 701 with a SVM around 150.<br>
<br>
* Get a Silverflank Belt -- keep /pet sit on -- drag Fluffy around with the belt so she can heal up faster<br>
<br>
* Choose your pet carefully -- I don't know how many times I have answered &quot;What pet is the best?&quot; with &quot;It depends...&quot;<br>
<br>
* Never be stupid and try to solo MOBs you shouldn't<br>
<br>
Oops -- violated that last one...<br>
<br>
...at least at 51 and one yellow, I only lost a single blue at death -- could make that back in 20 min without KEI on the Dryads.<br>
<br>
I also have spent a *lot* of time in the Bazaar to get good deals on equipment. My gear gives me around a 3000 mana pool and pretty solid resists.<br>

<br>
Down to the questions:<br>
<br>
Tarbul Earthstrider -- chained 49 Earth and lots of Lava Bolts. Was low risk since there is a lot of space to run and not too many roamers.<br>
<br>
Quag Maelstrom -- easy with 51 Earth and Lava Bolt. No chaining, just stay well back to avoid the manadrain effects.<br>
<br>
Corrupted Seafury Cyclops -- stupid -- was an add while XPing on Seafuries. I was used to chain-pulling one or two Seafuries onto a single 51 Earth, armor, BO3, and DSed. Sat on horse, Lava Bolt, and chaining 51 Earth, finger over the Gate hotkey.<br>
<br>
Kael Bank wanderers -- 49 Water, full armor, BO3, DS -- A yellow-to-me Lieutenant walks by and I think &quot;Thurg armor drop.&quot; STUPID! I pull and it and eats through Water. I switch to 49 Earth, memmed for cannipetting and chain. No drop of value. I WANT MY CoV FACTION! I'm still KoS in SS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now using 51 Earth, looking forward to 57 Earth this weekend.<br>
<br>
Slixin -- chain 51 Earth -- see note near top on watching for wanderers. Saw him there when collecting drops for the Phenocryst's Phocus. Did not realize he was also part of the VP Key quest, so only killed him once. Same for Rottgrime. Lots of info on these two in the Epic section, most of it good.<br>
<br>
Nez and Phurz -- STUPID, STUPID -- I *really* wanted my Epic (and still do).  I had duo-ed out there with a Bard and decided to try to solo.  After killing everything around that meteor strike just west of the spawn point, started getting higher-level PHs at the spawn point -- seems to be anything Illia's lists as being able to spawn over 40. Kill with 51 Earth, Expedience, BO3, DS, and keep mana up. Cannipet with 49 Earth, KEI, stay on the horse and watch for wanderers. I can get about half mana restored in a minute if I am quick with canipetting. Nez popped finally. Lots of malise, Shock of Swords -- sticks. Chain 51 Earth -- constantly moving to avoid wanderers. Breathe deeply as Nez sinks, quickly loot. Start canipetting. See Phurz pop -- engage chaining 51 Earth, same deal. Was blue to me at the time and did not summon.  Like I said -- VERY STUPID -- but I am so sick of Dryads, anything for a change.<br>
<br>
Barducks Darkpaw -- had killed about a dozen animals during 51 through 56 and 7 AA on Dryads. Dryads down to 12 per 2% XP so I decided to play Whack-A-Gnoll for a change and to make sure my faction in town stayed decent (Amiable, but no clue how many animals drop that quickly). KEI at this point since I need to make 60 quickly at the request of a friend's guild so that I can join them. I see a named Gnoll, dark blue, wandering back to the cave and remember something about a decent ring quest and heads of something or another, whack him with Malosini and send in existing 54 Water, Muzzle, armor, BO3, DS. Whoops -- pet gone fast. Not your run-of-the-mill Gnoll. Throw up another 54 water and change to 51 Earth. About 10 minutes (I am guessing, not much time or thought given to setting a timer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) of 51 Earth yo-yo and DoT (not so good at that yet) and mainly chaining 51 Earth, with Sirocco as mana balance (Trodded once or twice, don't recall) permits. Dropped the head - checking I found it was not the quest I thought - /shout-ed about it, took the Sabertooth Forged Ringmail drop, and then the word about the war comes over. 100m, I switch back to 54 Water / Sirocco / Char and whack a few Gnolls in town to make up for the first trip to JPF when I arrived from SFG, cast a pet, had it poof unexectedly, and then the empty town was Gnoll-infested and I was quickly dead. Bad timing -- if the town is empty -- go back to SFG and wait it out -- about 15 to 30 min.<br>
