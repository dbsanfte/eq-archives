People were single grouping in Fungus Grove, and every 3rd or 4th shroom would drop a spell.  They'd walk away at the end of the day with backpacks full of spells, 40+ each.<br>
<br>
Two weeks later, the drop rate was nerfed to what it is today, and shrooms no longer dropped spells, only the harder mobs in the zone did.<br>
<br>
Three weeks later, Australia received it's first copies of the Luclin expansion.<br>
<br>
By changing drop rates on items/spells to be high immediately after the expansion, and lower after a week or two, you penalyze those who can't obtain the expansion, especially those in Europe and Australasia.<br>
<br>
I suspect that the spells are able to be obtained through other means, but we have not yet discovered how.  I have also sat listening to magicians in the Serverwide.Magetower channel talk about their travels through PoP (No, Australia still doesn't have it) and link to 4 or 5 spells, or the items they have summoned.  <br>
<br>
This implies that either they are the only caster in a group killing LOTS of mobs, or there are better/worse drop rates available, and the information as to where these are or what mobs just isn't out there yet. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kathodos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Battle Cleric of Tunare - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kantreach</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Arch Mage Antagonist - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=artulyn1>Artulyn1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 87<br> <font color=#333333>(10/25/02 1:27:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1625.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Parchments to rare?</span><hr size=1> Wez the level of the spell you get depends on the parchment type you turn in.<br>

One thing we still need to confirm is if all the spells you get back are mage spells, I'm assuming you're giving them to the gnome in the green robe, Elementalist Somat is his name IIRC. <p><br>

<br>
a few months after release, demand will be much, much less. so, drop rates need to be nerfed a bit so that there is only a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>slight</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> surplus.<br>

the parchment drop rates are pathetic for the demand. sorry, 1 drop in 12 hours from  mobs which require a full group is so not cool. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kathodos>Kathodos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 227<br> <font color=#333333>(10/25/02 2:12:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1625.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.battle.net/war3/images/human/units/animations/waterelement.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Parchments to rare?</span><hr size=1> Noonie, if the drop rates remained high for three months, and were then throttled off, I wouldn't be complaining.

<br>
I do object to what I saw happen with Velious and Luclin where by the drop rates were high for a week to two weeks, then virtually cut off in comparison. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And as someone else stated, Kunark drops were broken, so noone got spells. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Look at it from my point of view, Australian prime time for raiding/grouping with friends/etc is around 7:30pm to 8pm AEST, until midnight-1am.  All EQ patches (which we currently have a lot of to fix the expansion issues) are starting at 8pm AEST (3AM PST).  So not only can we not enter the expansion due to it's &quot;world wide release&quot; not being anywhere outside the US <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , but we can't even play the game at all during the evenings.<br>
<br>
The drop rates can't be too bad if some people have 8-10 of their class spells (unless they're lying).  Perhaps try changing the zones and mob cycles that you're hunting? *shrug*  Can't get into PoP yet, can't offer much in the way of constructive advice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kathodos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Battle Cleric of Tunare - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kantreach</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Arch Mage Antagonist - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kyndigsenl>KyndigsenL</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#333333>(10/25/02 2:13:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1625.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Parchments too rare?</span><hr size=1> Maybe my thinking is off on this, but I recall when Kunark was released and similar complaints were being made about spells being incredibly rare, etc.  Of course nobody was really going into sebilis, chardok or charasis at that point when the expansion was first released.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that parchment drop rates are substantially better in some of the as yet unexplored planes.  Just a thought.  Might want to give it a few weeks before demanding they fix the drop rate until we see a bit more of what's still out there.<br>

<br>
I don't agree. I don't want to be spends weeks due to a built in time sink to get low level spells. I mean 61 to 63 spells should be common. Some of these zones require 6 or more people just to kill effectively. We should be seeing drops. Things are alot different then the days of sebillis. Back when Sebillis came out we really were not ready for the difficulty of the mobs, nor could we imagine that mobs could take such a leap forward in difficulty. Things are different now and we know what to expect. We have so much more knowledge now as players and gear is good. I mean this expansion will introduce better gear but those in luclin gear will still be able to tackle much of the content. The drop rate is insane and considering that pure casters require spells just to fuction this should be changed. Forcing us to need spells and equipment is a double penalty and when a number of the hybrid spells are easy to obtain this just makes it that much harder for the caster. I can see hybrids and pure melee rolling on parchment they don't need then turning it in to make a phat profit on spells. We just had 3 years of this kinda crap. I would prefer not to go through it again. I thought that is why they made ancient spells?<br>

I am talking about GSS and Topor ect. If they made them no drop it would encourage more people to buy the expansion. I mean some of these rare spells like malo, topor, sunstrike are a few years old. How long should people have to wait to get spells? The pet heal is a year old already so it makes no sense that they can't put those spells on vendors. I mean keep everyone but the uber from having it for a year seems long enough to me. If they made sure that everyone had a full spell book going into this expansion then I could better deal with the drop rate. However a number of mages don't even have BO4 and now they wanna send us through more hoops to get more spells. It makes no sense and hybrids don't have to deal with this stuff. I don't know one level 60 paladin that doesn't have brells so why does only 5 to 10 mages per server have the level 60 pet heal? <br>
<br>
I know some wizards that have been playing for 3 years that still don't have sun strike. VI needs to understand that you can be a &quot;hard core&quot; gamer without being in a uber guild. I think people feel that if you are not in a uber guild then you are a &quot;casual gamer&quot;. I can say that isn't the case. I know a number of people that play 10hours per day that have never been in a uber guild. These spells are needed to balance classes. Uber guilds get uber gear that help to reward those that want that type of enjoyment out of EQ. People should not have to join a Uber Guild to get basic spells. To me this is telling everyone that isn't in a top guild that they shouldn't even waste time leveling to 65. I can't understand that kinda thinking. Mages have been under powered for a long time and without our spells we remain under powered.<br>

My understanding is that the parchments are NO DROP but the resulting spell is tradeable.  This allows the frontrunners to make a decent profit off of their efforts and adventurousness.<br>

Before you know it there will be 61+ spells for sale in the bazaar.  Lots of them.  Many will sell for 25pp (or just above what an NPC will give you for them).<br>
<br>
If they dropped like candy then they would be worth nothing.<br>
<br>
I do dislike the randomness associated with the research procedure.  I hated the FV turn-in quests.  If its research, then from a role-playing standpoint, why, if you follow a procedure, are the results different when the same procedure is followed verbatim?  There should be a set of ingredients and actions that lead to a specific result EVERY TIME.<br>
<br>
I also believe that a *few* of the results should be NO DROP spells, to allow those who made the effort to learn research to distinguish themselves.  However, I know that viewpoint is unpopular, and will not push it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have been in all 4 of the accessable zones for 10+ hours each fighting and in that time I have seen 1 I repeat 1 Ethereal Parchment drop that was in PoI off of JunkBeast out of the 3 times I have killed him.<br>
<br>
I have gotten 1 1/2 aa points and am 40 percent into 61 now and I have one 61 spell, firebolt of tallon which I bought for 5pp the day it went for sale.<br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to get that one parchment and guess what? I turned it in and got Firebolt Of Tallon back! WTF!?!?<br>
<br>
I have gone to the camps where people say they are common drop like in PoJ fighting the mobs there, none dropped from them. I was even in the best camp there outside the trials for 5 hours straight tonight and not 1.<br>
<br>
So either I am extremely unlucky or this is just screwed. They totally need to up the drop rate of them. And I have not just been killing the soloable blues, I have been killing lots of level 60 mobs and the yellow spiders in PoN. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=denaeb2>Denaeb2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#333333>(10/25/02 7:07:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1625.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: stop whining?</span><hr size=1> Its not whining to have been in the friggin planes for almost a week now and not seeing a single parchment drop. Seriously they need to up the drop rates because at this rate ill be level 65 and still have very few lev 61-63 spells. I could understand if these were for lev 65 spells, ok but for lev 61 spells its ridiculous. You have to understand that lev 61 is a whole new plateau in terms of relative power for all casters. Talking about they will come eventually, wait till your lev 65 and you have huge gaping holes in your spell book and the spells you want cost 50k-100k and you still need 15 spells because thats where its heading.<br>
<br>
Lets not take the wait and see attitude about it because if its not discussed Verant will not do anything about it. It has been a huge let down to me personally, seeing all these spells and then getting to lev 61 and only having 1 available and spending hours upon hours hoping just hoping to see 1 parchment drop and finding out they just wont drop for me.<br>
<br>
I think that the lev 61 spells should be largely available on the magician vendor (like kunark). Then the lev 62-65 should be from the parchments and the parchment drop rate needs to be upped to maybe 1 for every 4 hours on average.<br>
<br>
On the recieving FoT from the parchments. I think thats a bug that wasnt fixed. I think originally they did not plan on selling any classes lev 61+ spells so you are receiving that spell because they never took it out of the NPCs quest return pool.<br>

This happen to me about 40mins ago. I have spent over 35 hours since I got the expansion hunting for parchment. 35 hours and when I do the turn in I get Fire Bolt of Tallon. Sorry but anyone that tells me not to whine or BITCH gonna get a huge flame. I petitioned but dunno if anything will be done. Sorry but after 35hours of hunting to see only two parchment drops is insane. To win one of those drops, turn in the spell and get the one spell that can be purchased back is just plain evil.  I am not pleased, and no this isn't fun at all atm.  I was in PoJ and we were killing white and yellow cons to 61. So this is not yard trash. We were killing tons of named and nothing. 11 hours of hunting today and I get fire bolt of tallon ugh. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Even the person complaining about how &quot;lousy&quot; the drop rate is was complaining about ONLY seeing 2 in 4-5 hours.  That seems quite reasonable imo. And, there is still a LOT to be explored.  Be patient guys.<br>

Right now were having to compete for spells between 11 classes!   Thats insane!

It pisses me off to no end. I doubt I will leave my friends and join a big guild just for spells though. Wonder if that was intended as part of verants Idea of social interaction....Leave your friends join a big guild and get a chance at getting make believe gear/spells!<br>
