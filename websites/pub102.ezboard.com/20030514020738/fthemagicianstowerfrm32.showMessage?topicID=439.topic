Effect:  Summon Magi’kot’s Demise<br>
Required Lvl 65<br>
<br>
Pet Vitals:<br>
Lvl 65<br>
3500 hp<br>
Class: Warrior – max skill levels (mitigates dmg better than any other pet at least)<br>
255 – Str, Sta, Agi, Dex (or values of the four pop pets added together whichever is less.)<br>
Immune to Fire, Cold, Disease<br>
High resist to magic<br>
Casts – Retribution of the Elements: 75 or 100pt DS, +25sv fire, cold, disease, magic (doesn’t stack with any other major DS, it casts on self and on the group magician is in… just targets owner with /tgb on and casts)<br>
Procs – Bane of Fire (-50pt fire resist), Bane of Ice (-50pt cold resist)<br>
Max Hit capped at 65 (maybe 75?), flurries<br>
<br>
Appearance:<br>
Humanoid with particle effects for each element and holding two swords or perhaps a mace with red and blue particle effects representing the two procs.<br>
<br>
It would be a tier 4 quest item and require the original mage epic as part of the turn in.  HP would hopefully be balanced by its mitigation though if not, bring the hp up.<br>
Idea being it is the true power of the orb which Magi’kot summoned and it killed him.<br>
I never read much of the lore though, so it probably wouldn’t allow for it.  It would wreck pvp though :/.  Just a random thought anyways.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
<br>
The 200dps Answer<br>
Although I no longer play my mage, I still read a few message boards from time to time.  The 200dps question caught my eye (not because it matters or has any significance rather it was just a question looking for a concrete answer), so I thought I would answer it.<br>
<br>
For my part, I decided to play it conservative on the dps aspect and go quite overboard on player ability (or more correctly access).  Thus I allocated 65 dps to the magician’s pet and left 135 dps to be conjured by the magician himself.  Due to my departure from EQ and subsequent lack of knowledge regarding some effects I tried to remain conservative.<br>
<br>
To satisfy the question of sustained dps, here is how I treated it:  the pc must be able to sustain 135dps over minimum possible intervals (in this case 16 seconds) infinitely.<br>
<br>
The list of required items/effects upon the magician:<br>
Spell: Sun Vortex<br>
Burning Scepter of the Elements<br>
Leggings of Secrets – Secret of Power = +23% dmg<br>
Mask of Secrets – Preservation of the Akheva = +18% mana saved<br>
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br>
Mental Clarity 3<br>
Specialization: Conjuration<br>
Flowing Thought 15<br>
Talisman of Vah Kerrath<br>
Enchanter:  Voice of Quellious<br>
Druid:  Protection/Blessing of the Nine<br>
Bard:  Chorus of Marr<br>
Beastlord: Spiritual Dominion<br>
Horse: 22pt mana regen<br>
Waterform<br>
Natural mana regen<br>
Mod Rod regen (optional)<br>
<br>
The mage’s total mana regeneration is 111 mana/tick.  (107 mana/tick is required)<br>
<br>
Why Sun Vortex?  Because ASOS lacks the damage output to maintain a high enough level of DPS when used with a right-click nuke. (FBOT not included because it’s a bolt, but one could theoretically sustain 135dps with it as well)<br>
<br>
Why a right-click nuke?  Because none of the spells are efficient enough on their own.  Better gear (focus effects) or more mana regen would solve this problem, though I was unaware of any at the time.<br>
<br>
Why Burning Scepter of the Elements?  It provides the required efficiency while still allowing the magician some flexibility due to its lower cast time. <br>
<br>
A look at Sun Vortex:<br>
Before:&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After:<br>
1550 dmg&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 1907 dmg<br>
6.35 seconds&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 5.38 seconds<br>
395 mana&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 284 mana<br>
244 dps&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 354 dps<br>
3.92 dmg/mana&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 6.71 dmg/mana<br>
<br>
<br>
The Math:<br>
Sun Vortex - 1907dmg + BSoE - 248dmg = 2155dmg<br>
2155dmg/135dps = 15.96 seconds (Thus the magician needs to maintain 1 cast of SV and 1 cast of BSoE every 15.96 seconds)<br>
Magicians mana regen = 111 mana/tick or 18.5 mana/second<br>
18.5 mana x 15.96 seconds = 295 mana regened<br>
295 mana regened – 284 mana cost = +11 mana/per 16 seconds (which is equivalent to FT4; thus the need for 107 mana/tick regen minimum)<br>
107 mana/tick = 17.83 mana/second x 15.96 seconds = 284 mana regened = mana cost<br>
<br>
(*Note:  The mage’s mana pool is irrelevant as this cycle either requires no or nets him mana.  Additionally, crits and other AAs than SCM3 and MC3 were not taken into account.  Criticals were not counted as they would increase the dps thus requiring fewer casts but at the same time depend upon the number of casts to estimate their contribution)<br>
<br>
Even if one is unable to procure such mana regen and focus effects, I would estimate a well equipped mage could sustain about 115 dps in this manner.  Alternating a right click nuke is key to efficiency; however, if that is not an option, chaining ASOS would be the second best method. <br>

I believe the items and spell effects listed above that one would &quot;need&quot; could be trimmed down in an exp group.<br>

Also, adding in a dex buff to the pet would increase it's DPS, maybe not by much, but still, some.<br>

Mana is hardly even a consideration for mages with the proper AAs, given a group with at least 20% downtime (ie, almost all of them).  200 or even 240 DPS is manageable even with mediocre gear; the limitation is not mana but rather agro.  200+ DPS almost requires that a paladin/SK be tanking in place of a warrior, and anything over 220 is bordering on suicidal.  Mages have no agro-reduction skills or spells, but we do have the advantage of 'neutral' damage (pet + DS) that allows us to rival the agro limits of wizards and rogues.<br>
<br>
I never use my right-click nuke anymore, whether soloing or grouping.  18 seconds for 600 damage?  In 18 seconds I can do 2 reclaims for 270 mana + 180 meditation mana + FoT at a net cost of mana gained and 2200+ damage (average w/ bracer and SCF3).  I would do that, petless, over BoBC.  (Assuming 70 DPS on the pet, pet + BoBC in 18 seconds = 1860 dmg.)   However, there is no need.  Just chain nuke on pulls and do a quick Suspend and Cani whenever there is a moment's rest.  It requires a great deal of attention to detail and timing to maximize efficiency, but mana - excepting that mythical 90-100% uptime group - should rarely be a consideration, even with only 5-6 FT and no enchanter buff.  (A horse, though, is an *absolute* necessity.)<br>
<br>
Required AAs to maximize this strategy:<br>
SCM3<br>
QS3<br>
Elemental Pact<br>
Suspend Minion II<br>
Total Cost: 43<br>
<br>
I also happen to have Improved Reclaim, which slightly reduces efficiency while grouping but is incredibly useful for certain soloing strategies. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninelven>Ninelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 12:04:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   yeah...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>200 sdps with the proper gears / spells and mana regen is easily doable for *UBER EQUIPED* magicians.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I find this doubtful.  I just illustrated 107 mana/tick regen is needed with the focus effects in order to sustain 135 casting dps.  If the Talisman of Vah Kerrath and waterform doesn't work on a horse the mage has already dropped below to 101 mana/tick.  If Secret of Power is ran 1 - 23 then the average should be about 12% which would further drop the mage below the dps mark.  Intstead, lets take an item with fury of druzzil which is 1 - 30 an average of 15% and still nowhere close enough to being able to maintain the damage neccessary for 135 dps.  If you feel like throwing in downtime, dps willl drop and right click nukes are no longer viable and damage/mana suffers even more.<br>
<br>
For example, the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=225352" target="top">mage at this link</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> could sustain 135 dps for about 65mins counting the talisman but not indefinately.  The example also counted on perfect conditions (always a mob to nuke, pet always on a target, no resists, etc..)  Therefore, without outside help beyond that of currently available buffs and equipment, I find it hard to believe it is &quot;easily doable&quot;.<br>
<br>
As for fear of nerfing, I am not responsible for what anyone but myself fears.  If SOE is ok with enchanters, I doubt they could care less about maybe 10 total mages with all the most elite gear breaking 200dps mark.  Once again, I didn't answer the question because it matters (it doesn't), but because I felt like it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=istaron@themagicianstower>Istaron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 196<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 12:11:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   100% uptime</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I just illustrated 107 mana/tick regen is needed with the focus effects in order to sustain 135 casting dps.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You demonstrated this in a 100% uptime group, which is a fable.  In reality, you only need 50-70% of that mana regen to sustain 135 DD DPS.  Furthermore, Mage mana regen during that discounted downtime, given XPG, Tranquility, a horse, pet cani, and FT 5-10 (hardly UBER), approaches 200 mana/tick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dalrenfieryblade>Dalren Fieryblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 12:13:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A random thought and the 200dps answer</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ...that mage cant be real right? umm...me want.... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=490410">Dalren Fieryblade of Tarew Marr</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninelven>Ninelven</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 12:24:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   exactly</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You demonstrated this in a 100% uptime group, which is a fable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If there is downtime, then dps drops rapidly and use of a right click nuke is not possible.  Mana regen would increase though through pet-canni.  The question is the amount of mana that can be attained through pet-canni.  Any estimates or preferably logs of mana/sec pet-canni provides would be welcomed.  If the mage is indeed able to regen enough mana to nuke enough to compensate for downtime his only problem would then be agro from his massive casting damage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2554<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 4:15:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A random thought and the 200dps answer</span><hr size=1> 200 relative dps is achievable, that has been somewhat well established..  If not easily achievable, parses have already been posted where a magician achieves close to 200 dps in a fairly high uptime group.<br>
<br>
The 200dps question for 100% uptime is still interesting, though, especially if a damage dealing melee, such as a rogue or monk, is unable to achieve this as well.  There is a lot more to the game than XP groups.  Luclin saw end game encounters designed to last more than 30 minutes.. that's 30 minutes of continuous(100%) uptime.  Situations where mobs have an unusually large number of hitpoints or mitigation ability can increase your uptime by a lot (Elder Thought Horrors come to mind, at least the ones I faced pre rod-nerf).  Way back in the old world druids used to be able to kite rather difficult mobs..  Killing a single one might take more than a whole bar of mana.  The technique was sometimes referred to as &quot;med-kiting&quot; and could take quite a long time to do.<br>
<br>
There may not be many situations where 200dps for 100% uptime is practical.  It is an interesting question though.<br>
<br>
Also, what is the nuke stats on BSoE?  I did the above calculation with Boots of Bladecalling and got a similar answer (100+ mana regen is needed) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalahadbb>KalahadBB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#333333>(1/6/03 8:49:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A random thought and the 200dps answer</span><hr size=1> 200 dps is sustainable without using a pet, even.  With the 65 earth pet, QS3, SCM3 and a summoning efficiency 4 item, you gain over 200 mana per tick.  About 220 to cast, regain 450sh, 6 second cast (1 tick), so 230 if you wanna be exact, with no lag.  Add a horse for 30 more (its 30, not 22, at 65 anyways).  Bard song for another 20, C5 another 18, FT 15, plus aten neck/emp robe etc that stack on top of that.  Which comes out to 313 without any effects that stack with FT15.  <br>
<br>
Now look at sun vortex which is 3.92 damage per mana before any focus effects/specialization.  With SCM3/specialization (21% mana saving, if I remember)  It is up to 4.9 damage per mana.  Now focus earring which averages out to 7.5% mana saving, after that its up to 5.45 damage per mana, now throw in damage bracer...(bit higher if you have a better focus).  If you figure a 10% damage increase on the bracer, average, your damage per mana now comes out to exactly 6.00.  Then figure in fury 3 and fury of magic 3, 14% chance of doubling the straight damage before the bracer...which then raises damage per mana up to *about* 6.7.  Using that mana ratio, assuming no resists/agro problems you would have the mana to do 349 dps.  But if you look at the numbers, chain casting sun vortex only comes out to 236 dps (with focus ring/Blessing of Reverance).  Sooo theoreticaly, yes its possible.  What I do when i exp in groups, which is rare cause I prefer to charm...is I suspend a water pet, have it fight durring uptimes and pretty much chain nuke with vortex, while they are pulling more I suspend it and reclaim earth pets to sustain mana, obviously how much I can reclaim durring downtimes, depends on how long it takes to pull. <br>
<br>
Now, water pets from all i've seen have parsed around 80 dps on average, mine come out higher...but whatever =).  That leaves 120 dps for the mage.  Which meens the mage needs to be regenning 105 or so mana per tick to keep up with 200 DPS.  Now with everything listed above, not counting reclaiming your regenning 83 mana per tick, which leaves you 22 short.  And regenning 230 extra per tick durring downtime, meens for every 10 ticks of uptime, you need 1 tick of downtime to bring that mana back up.  Which meens for a 1 minute fight, to keep up 120 DPS you'd need 1 tick of downtime, 2 minute fight, 2 ticks of timetime (aprox).  Dont think a 9-10% down/pull time is alot really.  Obviously the less mana regen you have the longer between pulls you'd need to keep up with it.  Now to achieve 120 dps using sun vortex, which maxes at 236, you'll need to be nuking about 50% of the time.  So the other 50% of the time you can either be medding, or clicking a scepter/boots, which are 32-35 dps.  Which meens your adding another 16-17 dps on top of all that.  I dont feel like re-figuring all the numbers to account for that tho =).<br>
<br>
Say, remove the bard, since they are kinda rare.  Now your down to 63 mana regen per tick, which meens your losing 42 mana per tick.  Then you'd need 1 tick of downtime for every 5.4 ticks of uptime.  Which ends up being about 15% downtime.<br>
<br>
Okay thats enough numbers and my head hurts =(.  Anyways, yes 200 dps is possible under the right circumstances.  Would I expect every mage to attain it though?  Nope..<br>
<br>
Note:  AA's required for the above numbers...SCM3, Fury 3, fury of magic 3, Suspended minion 3.  Quick summoning 2 (ring+bor equals the 50% cap anyways) or 3.  Also need an instant clicky reclaim energy item (jee, never seen one of them have you? =)<br>
<br>
Edit: Forgot Xegony's guard and Spiritual Dominion...which is another 15 mana regen per tick.  Which with a bard takes you 7 short of what you need, 5 if you use Pot9 instead.  Which meens you can have about about 95-97% uptime groups and keep up with mana.<br>
<br>
My question is...300 dps?  I'm thinkin its possible with 70% uptime but I dont feel like runnin over the numbers...Heh, maybe another night.. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=526560" target="top"> Arch Convoker Kalahad Thundersoul</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

The only problem with this is that horse and natural mana regen are the same, when you're on a horse you're just treated like you're sitting the entire time so at 60 you'd have a mana regen of 20/tick if you're not moving.<br>

I can easily believe that relative 200+dps is possible given an uptime figure below 100%.  At the moment, I am interested, as I believe the original poster is too, in a 100% uptime situation.  Yes, we know that doesn't happen in xp groups, that's not the point.  The idea is just to figure out the maximum potential a mage has over a long period of time.<br>
<br>
In any case..<br>
<br>
Assuming 200 mana per canni, and 1 tick to complete canni, your 29% Cost reduction, 30% damage increase, and 15% nuke haste I figure that you'll need about 42 mana per tick of mana regen -other- than cannibalization in order to achieve 120 dps.  You'd need a ratio of between 53 and 54 nukes to every 50 cannibalizations.  This means you need to be cannibalizing about 40% of the time.  During that time you'll have no pet damage, so 120 won't be the number you'll need to achieve.  You'll need to nuke more and canni less.  <br>
<br>
Lets say instead of going for a 1:1 nuke:canni ratio you aim for 3:2.  4 Nukes per 3 Cannis.  You'll cannibalize 38% of the time, which reduces pet output by that much.  80=&gt;50<br>
<br>
4 nukes for every 3 cannis will give you 149 nuke dps.<br>
<br>
149 + 50 = 199<br>
<br>
Cool.  It's possible, all we need to do is see what the extra mana regen requirement is(that is, the regen you need other than pet-canni).  At 4 nukes to 3 cannis, it's about 62 mana per tick.  Somehow this is lower than the 100 that was figured above.<br>
<br>
To anyone looking to get out the nerf bat, remember that this is assuming you get 200 mana for every 6 seconds you are not nuking, and the time it takes to suspend and reactivate your pet is included in that 6 seconds(personally I need to see this to believe it).  This means you can't hesitate on, fizzle or interrupt any of your spells.  You also can't move.  You cannot rebuff your pet or heal it, indeed you may cast no spells at all other than those that are part of the nuke cycle.  You can't misjudge and cast too many nukes or too many cannis.  <br>

<br>
Regarding the amount of mana regen on a horse:  I can think of 3 possibilities to explain differences.<br>

2. Meditate becomes slightly more effective from 60 to 65<br>
3. The person has a meditate skill increasing item equipped.<br>
