Currently the situation with Ragefire and his spawn rate is something that causes too much contention in this game.  We play a game that is designed to make us interact and work with each other.  With the reduction of ragefire pops there has become an increasingly hostile environment for clerics who wish to complete their epic.  Guilds themselves have become a part of the fight for ragefire and it is causing friends to contest each other and in the end leaves everyone involved with a bad taste in their mouth.  We each pay Verant money so that we can sit down and play a game. When we log off the game it should only be with a feeling of happiness and with memories of good times.  The ragefire spawn though leaves one to log off feeling bitter, disgusted and completly frustrated with the game.  Because of this I want to try to fix the situation.  I am asking that all players send an email to the following addresses to let verant know that we are not happy with the ending of the cleric epic.  <br>

  If you want you can just copy and paste the following to your email.<br>
<br>
  I am a player of Everquest.  I am asking the designers at Verant to please come up with a better solution for the ending of the cleric epic.  The current spawn rate and accessibilty of Ragefire causes contention and fights among people that normaly are friends.  It is my belief that the spirit of the game is something that wants us to work together and to interact with others.  Ragefire as he now is designed almost forces players to go against each other and leads to bitter feelings for everyone.  Please consider the situation as it now stands and look for a solution that will not pit friends against friends.  Thank you for your time and have a good day.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
  I do not know if Verant will listen to us or not, but I do know that I feel we must try to do something.  The way things are now with Ragefire simply stink.  More then one person I know says the camp is painful and wish something would be done about it.  Well now is the time for us to try to do something about it.  This message is being posted on as many boards as I can find that are related to Everquest.  Let your friends know and have them send Verant an email.  If nothing else is done atleast we will have voiced our opinons and have tried to fix the problem as best we can.  Thank you all for your time and may you have good hunting and safe journies.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimaginos9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Imaginos9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 530<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 5:00:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something for everyone concerned about ragefire</span><hr size=1> Heh i very much doubt you will find alot of sympathy from a class that...<br>

They create an epic that is &quot;unresistable&quot; to guilds and &quot;must be had&quot; for a class that is essential to every raid and then try to &quot;bottleneck&quot; it.  Just not a bright idea.  No matter what the bottle neck is, it will alway be grossly over contested.  Guilds need these things and so they will go after them with all the energy they can muster.   Stronger guilds will always win first and on down the line.<br>
<br>
Look at that compared to the mage epic.  If the cleric epic is a delicious 3 scoop ice cream cone for guilds our epic is a chocolate cover &quot;poop-sickle&quot;.  The general feeling is &quot;what? give the mage another pet? so what..!  I want to rez'd in faster..&quot;  But they certainly came up with a nice bottle neck for us.  3 day rare spawns in a planar zone and then a random drop on the 7th isle of Air.  I bet you every mage that wanted an epic would have one if you had to go to the 8th isle for the cleric epic.  In fact, that is what they should have done.  Place cleric epic on 8th isle and ever other classes on a previous isle before that.. Problem solved.  we could all get our epic while the guilds mindless plows to get the clerics theirs.<br>

<br>
- Weeks farming tradeskill supplies, so you can get 1 point of gain in your skill.<br>
<br>
- Random rare spawns that get ganked by any level 30 for their own use instead of the use it was intended for.<br>
<br>
- Rare spawns, with uber rare drops<br>
<br>
- Spells that prove to be as useless as tissue paper in a swimming pool.<br>
<br>
- Hidden limits on pets and spells that go beyond that limit, decieving us into incorrect thinking.<br>
<br>
...and the list goes on.<br>
<br>
It should be about fun. It should most definately be about having a good time, but sadly, it's turned into a massive time sink alone. Time sink = more money spent to play = more money/longetivity to Verant.<br>
<br>
Besides, the only reason why it was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  changed once already</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was not because it was unpleasant, but because of massive ammounts of infighting, killstealing, and customer service reports that wound up sapping more time and money from Verant than they were willing to expend.<br>
<br>
P.S. I don't know what guilds don't have a clue about the power of the Magician epic, but my guild, and those that I raid with ask, and nudge from time to time for me to finish it up. They are as concerned with me getting my epic as one might for a Cleric's epic. In fact, I even had a guildmate camping for Quillmane today for me, without my knowledge.

Every increase in DPS makes a guild more effective. The epic pet is a large increase in DPS over other pets a mage can use.<br>

<br>
It's not verant that caused the problem, it's greed, pure and simple. The game reflects alot of Real life. In real life is greed, therefore it is expected in game.<br>
<br>
The only thing that is verant fault in the cleric epic, in my opinion, is the fact there isn't enough bottlenecks. If you were bored and had guild support, you could kill everything in the cleric epic and get all the peices, excpet ragefire, in one day.<br>
<br>
Lord Bergugle (I've killed/camped him 3 times now solo, for clerics that didn't feel like it, because I was bored. I get 2-3 a day normally)<br>
<br>
Seeker in Temple of sulisek Ro: Again, a spawn which, at most, takes an hour to spawn/kill<br>
<br>
Dude in Sol A (forget the name) Again, not a hard camp. takes an average of 5 hours or so, of which i've done numerous times before.<br>
<br>
Ixiblat Fir: the spawner spawns every hour or so if he's killed. Max wait, 2 hours.<br>
<br>
Overking: if he's up, Personally, I can get a raid force down to him within 10 minutes. He's a 2 hour spawn.<br>
<br>
Ragefire: The only spawn that takes over a day to spawn, AND is guaruntee'd to have the peice on him.<br>
<br>
If anything, I'd make a petition to make the cleric epic harder, more botlenecks. Heck, even the rogue epic has longer bottlenecks than the cleric epic. And we all know how fast the rogue epic can be obtained. (if you don't, it was considered an epic factory when it first came out)<br>
<br>
I don't blame verant, I blame the individuals that camp ragefire. If they can't come up with an agreement, then Why should verant have to act like a babysitter? <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25288" Border=0><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~fitzpp/sigpic1clones.jpg"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=brayns>Brayns</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 5:47:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   didn't they try this before?</span><hr size=1> It seems to me that a similar post involving this SAME thing was posted not too long ago.

No sympathy hear, Guild help that most mages recieve are a byproduct of the guild helping out another class, or helping someone get 1 item that they want.  /guildsay anyone want to go kill magi p'tasa?<br>
guildie 1 says why?<br>
guildie 2 says it would be wiser to spend our resourses getting guildie 8 their epic (name any class)<br>
guildie 3 says hey I need item xx from PoH, can I get some help?<br>
guildie 1 says OMW<br>
guildie 2 says sure, thats worth getting<br>
/guildsay I'll go but can we kill magi p'tasa while we are there?<br>
guildie 1 says WTF all you can think about is yourself<br>
guildie 2 says Already told ya guildie 8's epic would be more worthwhile<br>
guildie 3 says F it, I'll help you take magi p'tasa heck might as well since we have  a reason to go there anyway.<br>
<br>
Nope no sympathy until other classes have sympathy towards all classes.  Course it's always nice when the epics fall inline with each other (i.e. phinny wizzy/mage).  Though most guilds will attempt to all classes, it's certain individuals that think it a waste of time.  I am more than happy to sit there watching for rage (8 clerics camping and me...hmmmm wonder who's gonna do the most damage waiting on their guilds to show up?), I don't remember a cleric in our guild ever really camping for rage alone, everyone in the guild wants it, and most are more than willing to sit there as long as the cleric is bound there, and a few others in the guild can get there in less than 1 minute (leaving their groups and a fleeing xp mob that could drop some phat loot).  Don't we all sacrafice for the clerics as it is?<br>

<br>
about 50 clerics waiting on a spawn that has an average 4.5 day spawn, including patch spawns, so about 4.5daysx50clerics=225 days...grats in about 8 months, cleric at the bottom of the list, when you get your epic!<br>
/sigh<br>
/rude VI....<br>
Why not just make the spawn harder to kill and more common......so it is more of a measure of your guild/friends power and achievement in the game...oh, that would make the quest more fun to do, nevermind, everyone prefers the frustration and hate/anger another rare spawn causes....<br>

I bet you every mage that wanted an epic would have one if you had to go to the 8th isle for the cleric epic.... <br>

I've seen them kill Trak for the BP (to sell of course, payed for by the bard that wanted his epic) Talendor (for fun and for loot to sell) and Gore (for more loot to sell).<br>
<br>
Az...the reason they don't just up the lvl of the encounter and lower the spawn time is because if they did that, only the uber guilds would be able to kill ragefire. This would ultimatly also mean more and more cleric epics comming into the game.<br>
<br>
Currently one comes into the game, guarntee'd, every 3-4 days (ragefire pop). If they up the time to 2 days lets say, that's 3-4 cleric epics in the game a week, much more than any other class on average. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25288" Border=0><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~fitzpp/sigpic1clones.jpg"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uathao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>athao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 10:03:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Something for everyone concerned about ragefire</span><hr size=1> Hobie,<br>
If only the uber guilds could kill him, and he spawned at a rate of once every two days, don't you think that the ubers would get all their clerics epiced and then stop camping him (the way some guilds are getting as far as VS is concerned on our server for wiz epic, and yes they also have plenty of vs legs...)...you may see 3-4 enter the server per week for a few weeks but then it would taper off after a month or two when the people who CAN kill him have done so and the people who want to kill him are able to try it and see if they have enough power to get this awesome item for their cleric friends...I am not saying make him so hard that ONLY the ubers can kill him, perhaps as hard as a HoT named sorta difficulty, so that you must have achieved more than getting a zerg quantity of people together to kill him yet not have 6 groups of decked out level 60's...<br>
<br>
My point is bottlenecks due to long spawn timers suck!  Think of a better way to use risk/reward for nice items like this in the future VI...bottlenecks caused by the difficulty of the encounter are fun and satisfying to complete!  Perfect example is the end of the druid epic, once you have that level of power thru friends/guild the last mob is not hard to have a shot at due to a short timer....sure the last mob for the cleric mob should be 'harder' since the cleric epic is 'better' but a similar spawn rate would make this quest more FUN!  (fun is why I play games)<br>
<br>
This only applies for nice NO DROP items really, some items need to be limited in how often they enter game for obvious reasons (ie farmage/economy).<br>

I have gone to 7th Isle in Sky getting Magi crowns several times too - atfirst we needed Warrior epics too - later we needed absolutely nothing else - but when we had a magician only needing that piece we went soon after - and got the crown for that magi and others that still lacked.<br>
<br>
Unless I am mistaken all but one magician in our guild has his/her epic (and the one has been on a long break till recently) - maybe 10 magi epic pets in total including now retired people.<br>
<br>
So, not all guilds are ignorant of getting their magicians an epic pet - excluding my own epic I would venture I have spent about as much time helping getting Jabobors as I have getting wifebeaters.<br>
<br>
Anyway - I do agree - the cleric epic isnt terribly hard - its just too much in demand. I consider myself very lucky I got it in SolB before Rage was camped at all. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4264>Mikar of the Nexus</a><br>High Priest of Brell<br><a href=http://companions.windsofstorm.net/>The Companions</a><br>The Tribunal

<br>
*) Change Ragefire to be a level 30 drake mob that is easily within killable range by people in the zone.<br>
<br>
*) Change the quest drop to be highly desireable by all newbies everywhere, but make it a rare drop. It should preferably be NO DROP, but not LORE because the druids should have the chance to stock up on extras so they can sell MQ rights and get better equipment and spells.<br>
<br>
*) The final turn-in mob should spawn only when the Sister of the Spire has been killed. During the 3 days it takes your guild to work its way through PoA you can powerlevel the druid to the point where he can go turn in the quest drop for you.<br>
<br>
*) And since this is now much easier than camping Ragefire in Skyfire, the Overking and Ixilblat drops should be changed from always-drop to a 5-10% chance of dropping (and the Overking and Ixilblat changed to rare spawns with 20 wandering placeholders) and the Plasmatic Robe should be changed from always-drop in Temple of Sol Ro to an infrequent drop off High Priest M'Kari.<br>
<br>
Those few little changes would bring the insanely hard cleric epic quest in line with the ridiculously easy magician epic.<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
And before I gather more flames than Solusek himself, let me point out that I have helped camp and kill Ragefire on more than one occasion. Yes, it is frustrating, and moreso because it is the last step in the cleric epic quest, but it is in no way, shape, or form comparable to some other epic bottlenecks out there. At the absolute least, you and a few friends can rack up some serious experience and stock up on Kunark spells while you wait. If you are vigilent and determined, you can beat any guild that isn't already in Skyfire when Rage decides to spawn. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showMessageRange?topicID=260.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showMessageRange?topicID=260.topic&start=41&stop=56>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showPrevMessage?topicID=260.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showNextMessage?topicID=260.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=260.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.threadControl?topicID=260.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=260.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=260.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants>Rants !</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
