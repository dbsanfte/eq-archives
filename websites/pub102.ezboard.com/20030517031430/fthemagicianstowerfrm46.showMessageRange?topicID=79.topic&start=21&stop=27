<br>
Finrazielthemage no guild leader praises their mages YOUR DREAMING they praise what they see damage (wizards and rogues) and healing (priests).<br>

Necros realised how pathetic it was giving their mana away and voiced their worries in the necro Best of the Best.<br>
<br>
It is only just now some mages such as yourself are realising how <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> pathetic</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we look kneeling before the cleric and wizard in the raid like slaves or some type of whore.  Maybe your alright with that role.<br>

I play the role we were originially intended for and only that NOBLE role.  Damage.  not some damage and ooooo sticks for you priest and wizard of mana pleasure.<br>

<br>
it was a useful @#%$ spell, and if you did anything other than summon rods on raids you were probably wasting your goddam mana, if you didn't like that role you shoulda made a twink rogue.<br>
<br>
i did that role since i didn't mind dropping rods if it was something useful, keep in mind we havn't been about damage since pre-kunark, we were CoH by kunark, then that got nerfed and we were full fledged mana whores, to do otherwise was to be in denial.<br>
<br>
now if VI wants to attempt to change our role back to damage and offense ala pre-kunark, i'm all for that, and look forward to it.<br>
<br>
and if not, if they manage to @#%$ it up and keep us away from damage/offense, i'll trade my boots of flowing slime in for a fungi and play a meelee, since i can't really see how we'll be useful on raids w/o 3 charge t-rod untill i've played and seen the new spells/abilities in action. <p>Thon Tarliser<br>

Magesthink,<br>
<br>
If you couldn't figure out how to work in enough rods to feed a raids needs and *still* quadruple your normal DPS by using rods, then you must not be a very good raid mage at all.<br>
<br>
The only bending is other classes bowing before me whenever they wish to snag a rod.  TRODS *make* mana.  We don't *give* away squat.  Cleric C.E.s me and I pop out a couple rods and end up with more mana then I started with.  The cleric is giving *ME* mana.  Yeah real demeaning that, what ever will I do with being full mana ALL THE TIME??  Blast mobs into cinders is what.  When my mana gets a bit low the clerics and shamans don't even have to ask, they KNOW to Torpor or CE me...and I pump myself up again, and STILL have spare mana to drop a few more rods and begin hammering out a ton more damage again.  I was never OOM on any big fights, and mana = power.  The only thing pathetic and sad is your lack of understanding what a symbiosis of classes is.  You pump cleric to heal far more, cleric pumps you to nuke far more.  Not rocket science.<br>
<br>
Our mages could pop out 20, 30, 50 rods in no time if needed and still be full mana.  Even though a wizard or cleric can sometimes make more efficient use of our mana for some important purposes, it *doesn't* mean we had none of our own to do whatever we wanted too, and there were almost always rods left over so never did I have to limit myself to *only rods*, hell alot of times I finished a boss fight with more mana then I started it with.  Most times a few premade rods and a few more to pump the buff classes while prepping is more then enough, and I then proceed to use my OWN rods to massively boost my own DPS during the fight.  Thats why rods were broken, they had no mana-over-time limit.  Thats what also made us gods.<br>
<br>
If you let yourself be treated like nothing but a rod whore that isn't 'allowed' to do anything else, then...grow a backbone or get a guild with some sense.<br>
<br>
Rods had some issues, sure.  But demeaning certainly wasn't one of them.  That is *you* letting *yourself* be demeaned...rods have nothing to do with it, other then being your scapegoat.<br>

Mages by all guilds on high end raids; and I am not sure what small raids you join, and by guildies are associated currently as mana givers.<br>
<br>
Fin you are in essence a Mana Whore in denial.<br>
<br>
You provide mana for another class.  Your seriously fooling yourself if you think other classes in a raid want you more than you were brought as:  A slave to feed mana to those classes that actually do something proud in a raid such as damage and healing.<br>
<br>
necros figured this out back in the days of BEST of the Best some mage such as yourself <br>

LOL<br>
<br>
You want to see yourself as demeaned, go right ahead.  I guess Enchanters that c3 and VoG a raid are demeaned too then, and shamans and clerics who buff the raid too, because they are not using their mana to attack the mob directly at every given moment.<br>
<br>
I can't help that you and your guild are that narrowminded.<br>
<br>
Explain to me how spending 1 min pre-fight and maybe (if needed) tossing out a couple critical rods mid-fight, and then self rodding and getting back MORE mana then you had AND using it to nuke FAR more then you ever could before is 'demeaning'?  Really.  Please explain how you operate in a raid enviroment, I'm curious to see where this 'demeaning' part is.  You claimed it, now show it. Blow by blow. Post a typical 'demeaning' raid of yours. What do you do with all your mana??  If you are spending all your time sitting around medding from making rods then you and your guild don't understand the 24SecondManaFactory at ALL. *IF* making rods left us OOM then sure we have a problem, but it doesn't.  Not even close. We actually end up with MORE mana...to spend on, oh I don't know...nuking and stuff?<br>
<br>
Why are you so bitter about making a few rods so others can do more for the guilds success?  Its not like it takes more then a 20-30 seconds to toss out more then enough rods to make everyone happy and ensure a successful fight.  Are your healers not healing you so that you are right back at full mana?  If you never used your own rods to increase your DPS fourfold on a raid encounter, then I'm sorry, you really ARE nothing but a rod-whore in that case and thats your own fault.  If your 'guild leaders' don't understand how it works, and expect you to 'only make rods to feed wizards' then I'm sorry, you are in a gimp guild, or you failed in showing how that is totally the wrong way to run a raid mage.<br>
<br>
I'm done with you.<br>
<br>
Wallow in bitterness if you like, thats your prerogative; you bring the demeaning on yourself.<br>

Look around on the General post.  Try playing a game like Sacrifice where our exact role in eq is mimiced by a creature literally called Mana Whore.<br>
<br>
I suggest you take the time to look at the many posts starting with MAGE and Mana Whore on the General Forum.  Or perhaps the fun pictures of Rod Slave posted at the bottom of posts here on this board is not enough for you to get it through your head.<br>
<br>
Fin you ARE INFACT A VERY VERY VERY SAD example of the mage as they are preceived on raids.  <br>
<br>
Sorry I refuse now knowing that summoning Trods is consider more of an exploit to use or to be convinced by my guild we need them.  Guess what, we included only two more clerics and with out Trods and we took Emp.<br>
<br>
In PoP mobs will have less health and as we all know Trods are ment for Luclin mobs at most and are totally not needed for kunark, Velious, or Old World mobs.  Trods nerf is a blessing.<br>
<br>
I am so glad ignorance in how some players refuse to realise How demeaning Mages look in raids feeding mana is not stopping Verant from finally fixing us.<br>
