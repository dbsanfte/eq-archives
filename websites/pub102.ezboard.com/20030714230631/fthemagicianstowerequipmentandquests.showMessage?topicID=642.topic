You could probably take her out were it not for her pet, and two &quot;Mageless&quot; pets that flank the Najena gate on either side of her.   Plus the two Tentecle Terrors that are also in that room might mash ye into paste, should they aggro on ya.<br>
<br>
In a group, you would do well, but solo?  You must be using the 16th level pet.   Probably not...but don't let me stop you from trying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

At 24, I was able to solo that room and make some decent experience as well while camping for the focus items components.  I could also take out the Mages that are in the rooms beyond the Najena sign, and the two-spawn DE female pair the are in a little room past the area with the heads on stakes (these babes were tough, gotta nuke em hard with SoSpikes). <p><b>Seek Pyremaker</b><br>

Getting into a battle in the mage room back there can cause Lenora Parlone to come up and join in, and when she does you'd better have help for CR because you will likely not know where your corpse is.

A partner would help a lot and the Tentacle Terrors are difficult.<br>

Good luck,<br>

p.s. if anyone is in the dungeon keep auctioning for the items.

<br>
A few days ago I went to Najena to try to get a Broom, the last of the focus items I needed.  I was 33rd at the time and I had never hunted in Najena so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I looked around and found &quot;a Magician&quot; under the Najena sign as described above.  Everything was green, but there was the Mage, her pet and at least two Fire Elementals right there.  If they all aggroed at once, I thought it would be a problem, so I took several precautions.  <br>
<br>
First I rehearsed the route to the zone being careful to remember each turn so that I could get out quickly.  Then I walked up to each mob to see if it would aggro without me attacking it, none did.  I summoned a pet, swords of runes, then medded to full.  I put Burnout II on the pet and medded to full once more.  Finally I put a DS on the pet and myself.  I was ready!<br>
<br>
I targeted the &quot;a Mage&quot; and hit her with Shock of Swords, ready for a big fight.  What I got was a message that she would &quot;seek revenge upon me&quot; as she dropped like a sack of potatoes.  None of her friends (the other mobs) seemed the least bit interested in seeking that revenge.<br>
<br>
Jobober, dual weilding and all buffed and fire shielded, seemd a bit disappointed.  Of course the mage had nothing on her.  I wandered a bit more, fell in a pit with &quot;an Injured Halfling&quot;, didn't know the way out so I gated back to EC.  The next day in Najena I traded an extra Stein I had for that elusive Broom.  Now I'm wondering if I could solo Najena herself and get a nice Tome outta the deal. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~tabb/XtalName1.jpg">

<br>
I never went into Najena's room at the appropriate levels to do so.  The first time I ever went into Najena's room I was level 51.  It was when I was working on my epic, trying to get those dang pages.<br>
<br>
At level 51, bursting into Najena's room, I took more damage than I expected.  Even at my level and with my own buffs on, they were able to hit me hard enough and frequently enough to interrupt my casting alot.  In the room was Najena, Najena's pet, 2 magicians, and their 2 pets.  So, in actuality you'd be going up against 6 mobs, taking melee damage as well as being blasted.  Having good AC, MR, and FR would help alot.<br>
<br>
Najena is lvl 35 I believe?  Don't take her lightly.  She is, after all, the boss mob of the dungeon. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Thanks for the advice!  I had seen in the Beastary that Najena was only in her high 20's.  Of course that doesn't mean a whole lot (the bestiary could be wrong, and/or she could be a miss-con).<br>
<br>
I'll put off trying her unless I go with a crowd.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~tabb/XtalName1.jpg">

My fellow mage friend got her ass kicked by Drezna, she was down to like 50 hp when drez died, and she got jumped by a large skeleton and died.  (of course I laughed at her, being lvl 50 and dying to a large skeleton is just hilarious) Watch out for those goblin magicians too, if you take a wrong turn in the tunnels you'll run into the widowmistress and she will kill you.  She backstabbed me at lvl 20 for like 200 damage and I cried and I cried.  I of course, went back and took revenge on her.  She gave me a stiletto so I was happy.  Even though the pathing there is horrible, I have to say that is one of the most fun dungeons ever in the game.  <br>
<br>
btw if you fall into the hole down to the room where linara parlone is, to her left there's a hole in the wall, you can duck and squeeze out of there - provided that you're not kos to her.  She's pretty evil, she charmed me at lvl 50 for like 5 seconds and I have 75 MR... and if you do manage to crawl out, you'll probably run into moosh and get a kick in the face from him.  Because when you do fall down that hole, your pet will turn around, walk down the stairs, open 2 doors and run smack into moosh and aggro him.  So like, watch out for that hole.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Also by najena's room there's a little trick, you don't really need the key into her room, just stand right next to the door and duck around for a bit, she'll come running out if she's up.  My mage friend and I zapped her for 600 dmg each and she fell rather fast.  Then you loot her key and voila.<br>
