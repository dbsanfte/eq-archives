<br>
1.) Pet is very nice sustained DPS (comparable to a non-casting hybrid or lower end tank in most cases - ie. decent by itself.)  Even when mage is OOM, Jobabtik is still out there doing damage.<br>
<br>
2.) Useful summons, including focus items that boost buff durations (hello!  save me mana rebuffing and Dot costs!) and damage for the wizzies (/hug bracelet, earring, ring)<br>
<br>
3.) Useful debuffs on the mob (/hug malo line)<br>
<br>
4.) Nice unresistable damage vs. non-slowed mobs via damage shields (believe it or not, there are times when NOT having a slower works...)<br>
<br>
5.) Very nice nuking DPS when they open up the mana hose, better short term DPS than rogues for when adds come in and its necessary to melt them down fast.<br>
<br>
Let me assure any mages on the Saryrn server that if you need a cleric for your group to look me up!  I love grouping with yall!<br>

Some days I look for a group for 30+ minutes easily.  Some days I do not.  Those of you who say they never LFG for long are either BS, or really lucky.  Its not like players are waiting for you to log on just so you can group with them.  So that in itself will have you LFG.  I have had a full group, sitting at the GY waiting for a healer.  Sometimes these groups end up breaking up because not enough of them are looking for groups.<br>
<br>
One thing you super Magicians out there need to realize.  You can always replace damage from a Magician with another class.  So dont make it seem like the show would not go on without you.<br>
<br>
Also, this is not being negative,,,its being realistic.  Do people want us in groups...yes.  But pretty much after they make sure they have a slower and healer.  We are wanted after that.  Unless it is a all pet group.  But still the preference is Slower, Healer, Tank.  <br>

I am only 62, and I am sure things get tighter at 65, but I do not spend more than 20 minutes LFG.<br>
<br>
I will emphasize as others have that building groups is the key.  Yesterday as an example, I zoned into PoI, and found an enchanter <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>/LFG ON</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and invited them.  Now I have a slower, which is the core of a PoP group, and we started exping immediately while recruiting.  Over time, while killing mobs, we recruited another mage, then a druid, then a necromancer, later on a bard.  With three strong pets, we killed mobs very quickly, even the unslowable ones.  No wipeouts, no deaths, and it all went very smoothly.<br>
<br>
Having a good reputation helps you both recruit others and be recruited.  I have been building groups for most of my career.  Prior to 61, I was especially good at finding odd corners to pull and built groups there, so I met a lot of people.  I also am an adequate puller, and the horse helps enormously in some places.  I am known for getting small groups together and going quickly, and for sustaining those groups as the membership shifts.  I am attentive to details, and make sure everyone has rods, focii, arrows, whatever.<br>
<br>
Thus more often than not, I need only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>/LFG ON</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at the beginning of my session, and while I am still summoning I get tells either inviting me, or asking if I am starting a group.<br>
<br>
With all respect, I do think that an openly negative attitude towards mages is going to impact how often one is invited to groups.  I for one would prefer not to group with someone who repeatedly gripes about their class and their lack of abilities.  I would much prefer to group with someone who uses their skills in a workmanlike manner to advance the group to the best of their abilities.<br>
<br>
Two more comments.  I like the new <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rthen</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if this is an example.  Concrete examples, explicit reasoning, and no implicit condemnation of others.  You would also do well to re-consider your foreswearing of serial pet reclamation.  Using <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Reclaim Energy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to gain mana is a powerful technique, and you will have much less down time if you take advantage of it.<br>

I normally spend about 10mins LFG, and if I don't have one I make my own. Normally I turn groups down because I am getting so many invites during the times I am online. Sometimes making a group isn't a option so I go work on some quest things, or play my beastlord twink. There are just alot of things to do to keep busy in EQ. I have seen just as many rogues LFG as mages. Also I see people shouting looking for rogue/mage all the time.<br>
<br>
As far as a procing slow weapon, I feel it is very appropriate for the class. I think summoning items with useful affects is what the mage is all about. Our pets are very great tanks outside of PoP. However in PoP they are seriously lacking which is a issue. Either increasing hps drastically or giving mages a 20 to 30% slow proc would fix this problem.<br>

My lfg woes are mainly in PoV, and yes I do see just as many rogues and wizzies sitting around as well.  I recognize that it is easier to get groups in the lower tiered zones but having hunted in PoV, it is difficult to go back to those zones as they are now filled with levels 50 to 59 players.  In addition to less experience from mobs in those zones, lower level players in your group typically means less kills per hour for even less experience.  Not a gripe, just an observation.  I guess I got spoiled from hunting in PoV. <p>Khalendor Dayze</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2451<br> <font color=#333333>(12/10/02 11:12:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mage Looking For Group</span><hr size=1> Again, when building groups, I often recruit below my level.  This has numerous advantages.<br>
<br>
Lower level players:<br>
1) Bring most of the abilities of their higher level companions.<br>
2) Are pleased to have a group in a higher level zone.<br>
3) Are easier to control and lead.<br>
4) Remember you well later.<br>
<br>
Having <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">a</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> slower is so much better than having <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">no</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> slower, etc.  I would really rather get the ball moving as soon as possible as opposed to waiting for some ideal group or camp that may never happen, or which may break up.<br>

<br>
1) The people who have the least problem finding groups in PoP are the people in the high level (*cough* *cough* *uber* *cough*) guilds, who also have the highest end gear and a metric butt ton of AA points.<br>
<br>
2) Someone said that soloing is fairly easy in the lower tier zones as long as you had Epic or 61 pet.  If you don't have epic, and can't get into groups in tier 1 zones, and can't solo in those zones without epic, how are you supposed to get parchments for 61 pets?  (please be reasonable, if you don't have epic, you don't have &quot;uber&quot; guild to hand you the 61 pet, nor do you have 40k for the spell in bazaar).<br>
<br>
3) It seems that if you are a casual player, your best bet is to stop leveling at 60 and continue to solo AA points until you have spell crits, pet hold, and all the other handy things the &quot;ubers&quot; have.<br>

What I've read on this board so far and what I've experienced myself is  that people don't know how much damage a mage can do.  They never see how much damage the pet is doing, and it has been lauded that Wizards are the best nukers in the game.  In any group I've ever been in by the time I leave everybody there knows that the mage is preferable to the wiz.  My pet can take the agro off of the tank and my nukes are almost as good as any wizzies.<br>
What I've read on here about full caster groups is so true.  They are by far the most fun and result in more kills.  The best group I've been in was three mages a cleric and a necro.  Casters always appreciate the fact that we need mana to fight.  I've been in groups where the tank just keeps pulling despite the OOM cries from everybody including the healers.  Thats when the casters discreetly agree that it would be best if we all gated away on our deaf tank friend.<br>

It has the added bonus of giving the highest group memeber the biggest portion of the xp split. <br>
<br>
Stormhammer is a unique situation where the population is small, and quite frankly, there aren't a ton of people around lower than myself that are LFG (though this is more of a server balancing problem, not a game balance problem.)<br>
<br>
While this option worked fairly well in my younger days when there were more mid-levels on the server, I only did it for fun, as back then, I could usually get better xp solo.<br>
<br>
I still find that equation to be true for my level, though PoP solo isn't really an option outside of PoJ prisoners/rats.<br>
<br>
Xp rates if pulls are pretty consistent:<br>
<br>
PoP Solo &gt; PoP Groups &gt; Old world Solo Xp &gt; Non-PoP Groups<br>
<br>
For your average mage that decides to go to 65, three of these options go away according to most accounts. Those who say otherwise tend to have gear / AA levels i couldn't dream of having, especially anytime soon. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>So dont make it seem like the show would not go on without you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
When I recruit folks for my groups, I automatically make me, my class, and my abilities the central focus of the group.  This way, the group will continue to go on regardless of who I might add or lose.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Now I have a slower, which is the core of a PoP group, and we started exping immediately while recruiting.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In the groups that I have formed, a slower is useful but not a necessity, and certainly not the core.  It is a support role, although a very effective one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>My lfg woes are mainly in PoV, and yes I do see just as many rogues and wizzies sitting around as well.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In some cases, this is circumstantial.  In most cases, people are lfg and staying lfg because they are waiting for the right group makeup.  I have been turned down many times by folks lfg, but unwilling to duo with me, or group in anything but a Trinity group (Tank/cleric/slower).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Lower level players:<br>
1) Bring most of the abilities of their higher level companions.<br>
2) Are pleased to have a group in a higher level zone.<br>
3) Are easier to control and lead.<br>
4) Remember you well later.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well said, and something I take to heart.  Recruiting below your level has many advantages.  Recruiting at or above your level has its stumbling blocks.  It's exceedingly rare that I would be able to group up with a 65th level magician, but much more common to group up with 2 or 3 mid-50's.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The people who have the least problem finding groups in PoP are the people in the high level (*cough* *cough* *uber* *cough*) guilds, who also have the highest end gear and a metric butt ton of AA points.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Where did you get that information from?  I wouldn't call 44 AA's a metric butt ton.  My gear is average, or even a little below average.  I'm in a very nice guild, but I rarely depend on guild connections for my grouping needs.  The people who have the least problem finding groups in PoP are the ones who plan for it, train the AA's for it, and recruit/teach others.  Cousin Raz has the right idea.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you don't have epic, and can't get into groups in tier 1 zones, and can't solo in those zones without epic, how are you supposed to get parchments for 61 pets?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm still unepicced, yet I could have soloed in PoJ for parchments even at level 59 (which is when I first trained in Improved Reclaim).  Not a huge number of single pullable mobs, however.  That makes the camp much more doable with a partner.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I agree that our soloing abilities do not exactly measure up to the prime solo classes, but lfg woes are frequently (though not always) a product of point of view and lack of improvisation. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ninjashimm>NinjaSHIMM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/03 4:31:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=37>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> <br>

- I do too sometimes, but a few of them, when I invite them, they don't want to join up.  We were camping the outer caves in PoV, agro kiting.  1 Necro 5 Magi.  We thought heck, Magi_LFG has been LFG for quite a few, get her.  She asked who was pulling, I said the necro, she passed. /bog<br>
<br>
Later the next day she was LFG again, I did not bother to ask her.  I dinged 65 that day. hehehe<br>

Now I bought those spells full well knowing that the price was going to drop, but as a casual player, I greatly prefered to have those spells as early as possible.  I think they bought me an enormous increase in damage output, and made the last dozen or so weeks much more enjoyable to play.  I consider the money well spent, as much as my bank aches when I see those same spells now half or less.<br>
