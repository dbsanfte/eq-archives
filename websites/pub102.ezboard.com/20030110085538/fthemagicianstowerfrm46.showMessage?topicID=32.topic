<br>
First, we have four new pets, with different names than our previous pets.<br>
Ward of Xegony - air<br>
Servant of Marr - water<br>
Child of Ro - fire<br>
Raathe's Son - earth<br>
Old news you say, but this is what I'm getting at:  Xegony, Marr, Ro, And Raathe are the gods of air, water, fire, and earth, respectively.  In order for this expansion to be large enough to appeal to their audience, it's almost given that there will be one plane per god, maybe even a few more for quests/transportation/linkage.  From that logic, it only makes sense that xegony, marr, ro, and raathe each have their own plane, filled with their wards, servants, children, and sons.  In other words, it seems to be quite logical that there are at least 4 zones full of, if not completely comprising of elementals.  Thus, our new charm/mez elemental spells will be quite useful.  And if these elementals can only be mezzed/charmed by the masters of elementals (or we're just a lot better at it - for elementals), then maybe our roles in these raids (or even xp groups!) will finally be EXPANDED.  Wait, did I just say that?  Mage roles expanded.  Beyond CoH and MR2.  Just what the mage class has been looking for, yet people scream they don't want it, because they're not enchanters and they have never done it before.  But wait, if you get anything new, you will have never done it before....<br>
<br>
/rant about rants off<br>
<br>
More blatant speculation:  We have smaller nukes compared to other classes, more so than ever before.  However, as mages, our pets should really be the major force in our damage dealing.  Our nukes are only there for when times get rough, or to speed things up a bit.  Either way, I think the lower powered nukes only prove that our pets will get as big of a power increase as the 44 to 49 jump.<br>
<br>
Next, the Host of Elements ability looks like an amazing ability with lots of potential.  We get to summon a small army of elementals now!  Combine several mages.  MB groups no longer rule the big mobs, when you have 6 level 65 mages throwing 54! elementals at the mob simultaneously.  How many single raids have that many people on it?  Granted, the host will AT BEST be comprised of pets the same level as our primary pets, which I am guessing will be mid 50's.  But in 60 seconds, pets dealing out even just 50 damage a hit on average are going to do tons of damage if there's 54 of them (2500 damage per round of combat).  Pure speculation, would be awesome though.<br>
<br>
Any ideas on what Elemental Translocation might do?  Seems to me like it's going to be an improved summon companion, that works with the summon companion spell, but lets you summon him whether he has aggro or not.  Maybe it has no text because they are testing it for pulling exploits and are not sure if it will be included yet.  Other ideas are maybe it will be our first teleport spell.  Maybe mages will be responsible for porting to those 4 elemental planes via this ability.  Any other ideas?<br>
<br>
Finally, quoting from one of the planar ability descriptions:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
You may train in this ability twice each level, beginning at level 61.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Now that sounds to me as if it uses a system separate from AA, more closely tied to levels.  Perhaps we get so many points per level, or maybe each boss (god) we kill is worth so many Planar points or something to that effect.  VI has already said they plan to remove pointless timesinks, which I believe AA is definitely a good example of one.  Anyone have any other ideas on how Planar advancement will be done?<br>
<br>
In conclusion, these have been my speculations as to what might possibly be the future of PoP.  If you have any information to support or disprove anything I've said, or want to speculate on some other aspect of the new expansion, post it below.

Yes, I know how VI is.  They removed the pet haste cap.  They increased the amount of hitpoints and max hit of our pets (basically raised them a few levels without making them con any higher).  They put two excellent spells in the game, one that allows us to summon people to our side, useful in tons of situations, and one that allows us to lay two full bars of mana on the ground for every bar of mana we use, med up, and keep laying down mana, turning a large guild encounter into a small guild encounter, and an impossible encounter into a possible one.  They gave us spells that summon items with effects similar to items that sell for several k.  We can solo a wide range of enemies, from chain petting even or higher cons to farming low stuff with the best of them.  We can go from 10 percent to full mana in under three minutes for the cost of ~11 malachite (6gp).<br>
<br>
And when PoP comes out, there's even more.  If we fight in an elemental plane (I am willing to bet we'll be one of the few classes that can solo any of the planes), we can handle the one thing that seems to have been problematic before: crowds.  With charm and mez elementals, we will be a soloing machine in at least one zone, and a boon to a group there as well.  We can call a small ARMY of elementals to fight at our side (if you really don't think a skill that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> summons elementals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> isn't supposed to be for a magician, then I can only wonder if you've been playing EverQuest, and you have absolutely no clue whether they will be a bunch of yipping puppies or a manifestation of the wrath of the gods).<br>
<br>
I started this thread to be one of the few positive threads in this section - to focus on the elements of the PoP expansion that show potential to be really cool.  I guess I can't stop the perpetual whiners from posting in this thread, but I can ask that if you have something negative to say, back it up with something more than &quot;You know how VI is!!&quot;  Can we have ONE positive thread?  Just one that doesn't focus on how much is missing from a source that we know is incomplete (the test server) or how bad mages got screwed in the last 3 expansions?  Can we assume VI wants to make money off this expansion, so they're going to try to make it as cool as they can for ALL classes?  At least in one thread?<br>

<br>
Perhaps Elemental Translocation is a monster summoning spell that can summon monsters that are in other planar zones? Or maybe a group port to one of the elemental planes? Also, does anyone think there might be a revamp of PoA for PoP?<br>
<br>
And about Host of the Elements, yes it would be a wonderful thing to behold, 6 level 65 mages with HotE 3 summoning 54 (I think its 54, 9 per mage?) pets on a mob for 60 seconds. But this is also impossible, can you imagine the graphics card requirments to display this. My card would probably fizzle out. If anything, they would use the skill one at a time, first mage would summon the pets, when they fade next mage would, ect. <br>
<br>
And please stop complaning about summoned charm/mez, atleast its something potentially useful and new. Necros can mez undead, we can mez summoned mobs. Now just let us summon corpses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><b>~Archangyl Lightfyre~</b><br>

I didn't say it's not out skills.<br>
<br>
My idea for Host of Elemental is we will summon a group of small elementals and they attack our target (like one mage class in DAoC...I think VI use the same idea from that) but not summon the same pet as we have normally.  <br>
<br>
I have been EQ for long time enough(even not from beta ..).  But..from the track record of VI, they haven't done anything &quot;not screw up&quot; in the begining and fixed (or even leave not fixed) later!  Especially..in the class called &quot;Magician&quot;<br>
<br>
New idea of new idea is good.  I'm happy to see some hope as well...but I hold my back not too excited about it because I don't want to be disappointed when the truth comes out!<br>
<br>
just my 2 cp!  no attack at all! Hope we will be all happy mages when PoP comes out! <p><table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" bordercolor="#000000" bordercolorlight="#808080" bordercolordark="#800000" bgcolor="#000000">
