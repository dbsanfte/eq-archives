<br>
at lv 39 the orges don't arggo me even when i fight in front of them.so it's a good start.what i do is :<br>
1)send FIRE pet and cast malise<br>
   no matter malsie land or not<br>
2)back off and cast blaze when gem pops<br>
3)back off and cast new rain when gem pops<br>
4)back off and cast blaze when gem pops<br>
   he come to me at 2nd or 3rd wave,doesn't matter,the blaze will follow your 3rd wave and kill him.<br>
<br>
first thing to notice is park pet ON HIS SPAWN POINT,i found it's more likely he will melee with pet and if he does instead of casting insects,he will die fast this time =)<br>
second is about choosing pet, i know the most important thing is to choose one you love most, but pet's damage will be greatly reduced after insects land,so fire pet serves best here.just let Oowomp hit it,he'll get hurt even if my pet is can't attack.<br>
you may notice the rain in step3.i tried many times,it do damage fast,just like 3 shock of spikes with in 1 tick(can't cast shock, it always got resisted),while casting second blaze will cause him to come immediately.so i think i'm using the fastest way to kill him.although rain may hit the orge in house behind him,but it's rare,i camped him for over 20hrs,just 4or 5 times the rain hits the orge inside house,and he can't interupt you last blaze anyway.he's too low(hits for 20ish).about the orge inside house,kill it if it's orge wise one,for it heals Oowomp during fight.raider won't do anything but watching how Oowomp is butchered.<br>
<br>
exp=not bad,speed just like cythina of rathe mountains,also 6mins spawn<br>
loot=good!i'm not twinked so the  3int mask, 5int ear ring, hp collar and things alike are all good things to me(my int has go from 157 to170),i'm still using small cloth items!also  5 wis bracelet to sell for good money.but don't expect to loot many, loots come i think 1 out of 15kills?you'll eventually got all the things youwant,be reminded that you're still gainning exp as fasst as you did in rathe mountains 5 lv before.<br>
with fast exp,loot to use,loot to sell,the benifit is multifolded.but obvious,this is a overcamped spot,you have to wait for hours to get it,just ask those people to send you a tell 15mins before they leave.(you binded at oasis of course).if it's being camped(usual case)just go to najena to camp torn pages,or try to kill the newbie dragoon at bridge of nektulous forest(i heaven succeed yet),they always drop 2.5pp-sword.<br>
<br>
i won't say i'm killing him single handedly, but it happens twice that i gone link dead when my first wave of rain lands,and when i come back,i found my pet had finished Oowomp for me.(i never died,of course)<br>
<br>
i think it's a good idea to do all the way from 39 to 44 here,but i get bored again after i got all the things i need in 2 days.i got 2mask,3earing,1 headband,3 helm,3bracelet,3arm,2 belt(got things to twink my shaman now).dang,forgotten to say, it drops 0~4pp,and often have fine steel hammer or star,which worth around 4pp at commonlands(don't sell in freeport!it's like 30%off!)<br>
<br>
be serious,although Oowomp will often wasting time to cast drowsy on you(resisted,recast,resisted again,recast again...)but he will cast a big DOT on you once drowsy landed.i think it's highly possible to get killed if phantom chain is not put on(don't think bandage can keep up with his DOT)<br>
<br>
that's all for my experience of camping Oowomp<br>
hope it helps<br>
think i'm off to kedge?get a harpoon for my shaman?<br>
or shall i again,listen to 'most people say so',go to DL for yetis?<br>

Only reason for fighting him at these lvls would be beacus of the wonderful loots.<br>
<br>
I tryed him for half a lvl at 41 and i dident get that good exp. Loot was wonderful though. <br>
Hehe if you want good exp try Eastern Wastes at the Ulthork place, This place is really wonderful, Just try to stay away from the Whooly mamoths.<br>

i hunted him now and then from lvl 39-42 and everyonce in a while he will resist malise and a CB or so on but once you land the Malise the air stun should stick 2 out of every 3 times in my experience hunting him..<br>

I've found, at least on most MoBs like oowomp, they'll spawn with SOME of their self-buffs. And Oowomp usually hastes himself first thing, so even when you cast on him he doesn't come at you until he's done hasting himself. My advice is to pull with nullify... it also gives you a much better chance to get away if he's SoWed and you get in trouble (doesn't happen much)... maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems like he's easier when pulled with nullify, and he never resists anyways.<br>

He is pretty easy to kill at these levels. I got approx 1/3 blue bub of exp per kill and anywhere bewtween 10gp to 5pp per kill. He seemed drop a decent item every 7th fight or so. He's on a 6 minute spawn timer and begins to buff himself when he pops. I pulled with nullify magic and he usually ran towards me at that point, sometimes he would cast a weak dd nuke on me that hit for about 70dmg then charge me. I would sick fully buffed and armored fire pet on him and let fire pet get aggro, let oowamp charge u a bit to get him away from the rest of the camp and sick your pet on him when he's about half way to you. I believe my fire pet could just about tank him solo but I want the ful exp. I would then cast 2 blazes, spread apart, so that i wouldn't get aggro. 9 times out of 10 the second blaze will cause the Shammy to begin his death run. U could let pet kill it the rest of the way or u could smite him and kill im quickly. my pet would be between 60 to 70 percent health and i would have only used 2 blue bubs of mana. very easy kill and the other green ogres would just stand and watch the OOwamp's destruction. He casts some other pretty cheesy spells but he is no match for you and your pet. I never even came close to dying once. Be sure u have all your shields up, including the elemental shield, and u will have no problems. Also, i gave my pet 2 daggers of symbols to improve his saves, don't know how much good it did but every little bit helps when soloing.<br>

I am currently lvl 40 and the experience is decent for a hell level.  Loot is really good, so it is worth while.  If i can offer any piece of advice, use teh air pet, he is a shaman so your pets stun spell will be the most helpful, also the air pet has the highest hp regen of all the pets so scorge will not end up killing your pet.  Also, be sure to let pet build argo!  His dot really hurts and almost killed me once.  <br>
<br>
My Advice once agian....USE THE AIR PET!!!<br>
