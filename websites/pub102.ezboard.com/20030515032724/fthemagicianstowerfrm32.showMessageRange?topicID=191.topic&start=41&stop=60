And then you get comments like that.  I'm just trying to add some credibility to our demands.  You have classes that rag all over others when they get cool abilities and any single flaw in their own yet leave out any overly great abilities they may need to have looked at.<br>

So basically it makes you a hypocrit.

For soloing purposes they are fine, they don't really  help that much and certainly aren't overpowering.  But my point is all you need a a cleric with a bit of extra mana to spare. (not exactly a rare case scenario.)  And your mana regen goes from 10 minutes to get to full, to about 45 seconds.  Beating out every other single or combonation of other means to get mana back.<br>
<br>
And each one of those single components to get mana back is usually rediculously hard to obtain, compare that to one spell, and an availible cleric.   And it doesn't even do 10% the job the mod rod does.<br>
<br>
That looks a little haywire to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utukodo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tukodo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/02 3:37:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Replies</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If you chose to accept a life of servitude as a Mod Rod wench, then accept your choice and move on.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Rhasin, you should try an uber of battle of 10-20 minutes someday, if you ever get the chance to.  In these scenarios I have 2 options.<br>
<br>
1) Drop mod rods for the clerics to keep everyone alive.<br>
<br>
2) Use all my mana to nuke for 10-20k dmg in hopes of moving a mob's (million+) hp by 2 pixels worth while all the clerics go OOM, the warriors die and we end up wiping out.<br>
<br>
Hrm, tough choice here.  Not to mention they are using mod rods faster then I can drop em, not even nuking a little is possible for me to do.  Either I use all my mana for mod rods to keep the battle going or we are dead.  If people demand mod rods, they can't be ignored.<br>
<br>
If your talking about Kunark dragons or whatever it is your killing, sure I'll be nuking.  If the battle lasts less then 5 minutes I don't drop any mod rods.  But that kinda stuff is rare of what my guild does these days.  Luclin mobs have a ton of hp and these battles last forever.<br>
<br>
I think the only Velious encounter that requires this is AoW.  Velious royals and NToV mobs usually die fast, kunark and everything else before that are fast battles.  Once you get to Luclin though the encounters last a long time.<br>
<br>
I have *NO* choice but to be a mana wench in these encounters and I'm sorry if thats disheartening to hear for all you up-coming high level raiders but thats my experience in the high level scenario.<br>

They're not as harsh on resistances as they are AC, so overall, your casters will be doing the brunt of the damage while the melee hold aggro. Unless, I missed my interpretation of Luclin mobs in my journeys?<br>
<br>
I do have to ask, though, what would be the issue with throwing your pet into the fray in a situation like that? Damage + Rods? And are we talking Ring fights or just end boss encounters?<br>
<br>
Maybe it's just me, but I'd say a 5 minute fight is about where it should be if you use a good strategy. It's not too long, not too strenious, though would take very good teamwork. When you stretch into 20 minutes, I think most people get bored. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886">Rhasin Firestorm</A><BR>

I know that in raid scenarios, it turns us into mana clerics of a sort, but with a cleric to back you up, you can do it VERY VERY well.  I like having a spell or ability no other class has, and the selfsame ability that many folks need.<br>
<br>
    Rods serve to speed up the buffing process before a raid begins, and in long encounters allows the clerics to never be oom.<br>
<br>
    I honestly don't give a hoot about magician nuking power, but I care about pet power, and giving mana to the classes that need it the most.  An epic wizard can do more with the 440 mana I can give him than I can accomplish with the 180 mana I spent to give it to him.  I am not a backup healer, but I can help keep the primary healers from running out of mana.  I'm not a tank, but my pet can do some mana-free melee damage to help the tanks live just a little longer, or the mob a little shorter.<br>
<br>
    Rods are self balanced solo, though.  Nice to have, but not a huge boost to soloing ability.<br>
<br>
    Summoning mana may just be one of our class-defining abilities, post 55. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udalmathius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dalmathius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#333333>(4/25/02 6:50:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=47>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Replies</span><hr size=1> Last 2 Burrower parasites did 46k and 42k damage + Epic pet + 35 point damage shield on MT's.

Mages are not weak damage dealers folks and better realise this, especially in Luclin I manage to contribute as much damage as most power melees only most likley beaten by wizards. Mod rod2 is a tool, powerful yes but class defining hell no, with mage can so such a multitude of things that make a raid run better and when soloing am a badass, I kill @#%$ for exp solo low 50's group might lose a couple peeps so don't tell me am weak lol.<br>

I made my Magician because the class was 2nd best nuker in the game behind the wizard and had a awesome pet.  Matter of fact I dont think anyone made a Magician just so they could wait 50+ levels to get mod rods.  We were pure destruction with no defense.  Now some of you rather roll over (dont take offense) and play that support roll with no defense and no offense.  Prefights yeah no problem, but lately druids and everyone else is asking me to give mod rods so they can nuke and I just sit there idle.  That is a embarrassment to the class.

for instance i hardly dropped rods during fear raids (not doing CT), or hate etc.., because even the mini-bosses drop so quick there's no point, but on 15-20 minute fights, we can really make or break a raid.<br>
<br>
first time my guild did va Dyn, it was myself and a 60 mage doing rods. without those, there's no way we could have won that fight. we were an intergral and essential part of the fight.<br>
They could have attempted, but with no quick mana around for clerics, it would have been a wipeout. <p><p>

Plenty of time to do this, after giving everyone a rod thats typically 30ish rods at the clerics disposal, 30 x 660 = 19800 mana for the clerics, or 66 CHs, thats a lot of CHs, and depending on how big the fight is, how long, your gonna have more people if its tunare or somethin prolly, so you have more mana right there.<br>
<br>
Typically I dont need to summon mods at all in a fight, given I'm not doing tunare or such, we're still on stuff like rhag 2, vindi, etc. but I dont summon them during the fight, dont have to, give em to people before hand, clerics take em from people, I have the spell memed incase they get low and aren't getting any, but typically I nuke the fights, so I am EXTREMELY happy with this spell.  This is the best thing that happened to mages, because it answered our prayers, we are needed on a raid, they want us there for this, yet thats not what we do during the fight, during the fight we get to nuke like we all thought we would when we made mages.<br>

My thought exactly. So why is it mages finally get a spell that makes them wanted, needed, and able to fulfill thier role (damage dealer with useful summon abilitys) , yet some feel that its to powerful? <br>
<br>
Manaburn is powerful ,Direcharm is powerful ,/dis Defensive is powerful ,/dis Trueshot is powerful ,Complete Heal is powerful ,Duelist + Backstab is powerful. Isnt it about time mages had something to add to this list? <br>

Different guilds fight different things.  When I bring up the debate I'm talking generally, and although it's good to know how much people fight which mobs, I'm still assuming 10% old world, 20% kunark, 30% velious and 50% luclin.   This is assuming more than 1 group = raid and generally for all 50+ guilds in EQ.<br>
<br>
That said no you can't  just bring a bunch of wizards to a raid and nuke the crap out of luclin mobs.  They just have way too much HP.  You can mana dump for about one minute which still leaves 5 more until you get mana back.  And sitting down during this time isn't often smart (specially after mana dumping.)  Which means Tukodo was right, in most luclin encounters, mod rodding is preforable.<br>
<br>

I get lots of comments like this.  Yes I really like mod rods as well, and most mages it seems want more pet power as opposed to nuking power.  Giving to classes that use mana a lot is good.  When you conisign your mana bar for someone else to use thats somewhat a slap in the face unless it's a special circumstance.   Raids aren't special circumstances.  I think this next quote summed my position up best.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
I think the problem most are inderectly refering to is that having such a powerful utility spell puts magicians well ahead of Necromancers and Wizards in raid utility.

<br>
This is exactly what I'm driving at.  Mod rod 2 is really good, and I mean reeeeeally good in raids.  It's a strong utility we bring to raids and I'm happy for that, but it's not in the direction which we want to go.   What I fear happening is Verant looking at all our class abilities and not giving us a good per or damage solution to raids in leiu of how useful mod rods already are.<br>
<br>
Someone asked about useful summons.  I agree. We should get some more.  Or rather augment some of the existing ones so they are more useful.  Giving one class breaking skill that is super useful doesn't fix everything else.  Our weapon summon upgrades should be stronger, and bane weapons is an excellent idea.  Including more good missle weapons, or even poison for rogues.  The rest of our summons aren't really useless at all.  Lev rings are still one of the best means for no component levitate, waterstones are superior to EB, coldstones rock over UV spells.  The summons are pretty good.  And make them too much better and we will be a pure support class.<br>
<br>
Finally..<br>

<br>
Manaburn does a whole bunch of DD damage to a mob, wizards specialize in DD damage.<br>
<br>
Direcharm is another barrel of monkeys, but better things could have been invented for it as well.<br>
<br>
Defense is all about what warriors do best.  Tank.<br>
<br>
Trueshot exemplifies ranger archery which is very class specfic thing for them. (No one can shoot a bow nearly as well as a ranger.)<br>
<br>
Complete heal all about clerics and what they do best.<br>
<br>
Backstab is a huge &quot;rogue thing&quot; to do.<br>
<br>
Summoning mod rods is summoning.. But it's an indirect way to get to something we don't really do.  It's like giving rogues a rare poison that procs ice comet, or monks the ability to summon &quot;monk&quot; skeletal pets.<br>
<br>
What are mages known for?  Summoning yes, but summoning uber pets.  If you are looking for an uber summoning item for mages it turns us to utility.  Which isn't the direction we'd been working for all this time.  And even if you are ok with that it has to be an ability that doesn't impede on another classes ability.  That can be hard to do and still make it uber.<br>

I remember a time when the magician community was demanding exactly what many are now complaining about...WE wanted to be more raid friendly. We wanted something better than gift of xev and the like to make us more desireable on raids. So VI threw out CoTH and then most recently mod rod 2. which I think are pretty good spells. So what if on a raid we cant nuke the hardest, we are still one of the best solo classes out there if we do it right....Alot ofplayers asked for more Utility type spells for raid situations and now we are (at least on MithMarr)a must have on raids. Sure we need more increases in power in accordance to our lvl...but when it comes to raid situations many mages asked to be utilitarian and now we are....and the moral is be careful what you ask for you just might get it..p.s I still love being a mage most of the time <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uarlinastarbright.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arlina Starbright</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(6/2/02 11:33:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=191.topic&index=57>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   7 mana per tick?</span><hr size=1> 7 mana per tick?<br>

You're not being very ambitious at all!<br>
<br>
Generally, when I group with a magician and my regular cleric, we're <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> far</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> more aggressive with our mod rod usage.<br>
<br>
Making and using 3 Mod Rod 2's take roughly 22 seconds. It costs 1200 mana, returns 1980 mana, and requires 400 mana to heal up the damage (CH).<br>
<br>
So, the group has a net gain of 380 mana, over 22 seconds.<br>
<br>
That's 17 mana per second... or <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 103 mana per tick</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> when doing the MR2 gig non-stop.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's a lot, but it's probably not too powerful.<br>

We do have stronger nukes now (via focus), albeit not that much stronger. If they get any stronger, Graffe's is gonna get overloaded by all the whining.<br>
<br>
Pets are getting their upgrades now and becoming more raid friendly, so that can be crossed off the list.<br>
<br>
As for TRods, I really don't think they're overpowered at all. It was a much needed upgrade. If I'm one of a few survivors in a raid and the cleric needs mana, I'd rather not have to waste my time with the previous rod and neither does the cleric.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=70160">Deveryn Ev'Liarsh</a>
