I have played a half dozen classes extensively at 60 as well.<br>
<br>
This post is not about balance, I make no claim that any idea here is in and of itself balanced against anyone. My position on mage balance has been stated in other threads and I really would appreciate if this didn't turn into a mages suck vs mages rock rant.<br>
<br>
One thing about EQ that has always bothered me seeing as how I am a caster at heart is the is simple lack of variety in the magic system, so much is doubled up and scaled. I think in truth they probably have less then a dozen truly different spells types. The classes are very basic with no way to define themselves as unique, different, or interesting. Something else I have noticed is that there seems to be very few ways for people of exceptional talent to differentiate themselves from those of lesser talents, EQ is dumbed down and is 95% about knowledge and not about quick thinking innovative ideas or strategies. Which leads me to my last point, strategy(at least to me, and for the purpose of this post) is the use of a variety of factors in an advantageous way to achieve a desired result. The only way to have deep strategy is to have a significant amount of variables, something which simply does not exist in EQ. The reason that things are only done one way is because there really is only one solution to the problem, only one way through the maze, thus EQ strategy is always one variation of the MA, heal team theme.<br>
<br>
I was personally somewhat disappointed with the AAXP abilities, pre release I thought we had a pretty good looking list, however the actual mechanics mean to me that other then pet hold I won't be bothering with any of the class abilities a situation that I don't find very appealing(I have pretty much decided I won't be doing XP camps for AA abilities, I will go on with my regular routine and take them as they come).<br>
<br>
Some abilities that I thought would be far more interesting, would have added more to the class and mages would have enjoyed are:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Traveller</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level)<br>
The ability to zone with your pet, provided your pet is not currently aggroed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet Control Mastery</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (3 AAXP 3 levels)<br>
Increases the range at which your pet will hear your command by 50/100/200 feet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mental Command</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level)<br>
Separates your pet aggro list from yours, meaning that an action by your pet does not cause you aggro. {<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I figure this by itself could take care of the wandering pet train issue, if your pet wanders off and dies so be it, at least it wont train you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->}<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Call of the Pet<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  (5 AAXP 1 level)<br>
72 min refresh<br>
Summon Companion with aggro clear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Elementa</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (3 AAXP 3 levels, Earth, Air, Fire, Water)<br>
All on the same timer, 72 min refresh<br>
Common issues<br>
 any cocoon stuns the mage for the duration, and have a 3 second casting time at level 1, 2 second at level 2, and 1 second at level 3.<br>
Stone Cocoon <br>
The mages ac jumps to 1000/1100/1200 and he is given 1000/3000/5000 hp shield for up to 30 seconds. <br>
Flaming Cocoon<br>
The AC of the mage is increased by 200/300/400, and a DS of 50/100/150 for up to 1/2/3 minutes.<br>
Wall of Wind<br>
The AC of the mage is increased by 200/300/400 and ranged weapons do no damage.<br>
Water Shell<br>
The AC of the mage is increased by 200/300/400 and the mages FR/CR are increased by 50/100/150.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Elemental Swarm</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (6 AAXP 3 levels)<br>
144 minute refresh<br>
For the next 30/60/90 seconds each pet that the mage casts becomes an independent mob with only the target on his aggro list. This ability is only usable on 49 summons and these mobs are not buffable. This would obviously have to be tested but would be interesting.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Equipable Pets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level)<br>
The Mage has access to a pets equipment slots, as he would have access to his own. This means that if a pet dies, it leaves a corpse so that equipment can be retrieved.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Elemental Ally</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level per ally)<br>
144 minute refresh<br>
This ability allows the mage to form an alliance with one particular greater vortices. The name would be generated by some random name generator, which could be some 20 x 20 x 20 x 20 syllable randomizer(I mean there elementals after all they should have alien sounding names not Goner etc..) or another idea would be the mage choosing the name for the pet.<br>
<br>
The Statistics on this pet would start baseline as a vortices of the appropriate type. While the pet was out the following would be in effect:<br>
<br>
-&gt; The pet would take 50% of just the magicians XP regardless of source.<br>
-&gt; The pet gains experience and progresses as a warrior of equal level gaining small advantages as they grow in level(2% extra hp/ac  1 damage etc..).<br>
-&gt; When the pet dies, he requires a resurrection just as a normal PC, his experience loses are the same as any other.<br>
-&gt; The Pet has normal Equipment slots that are available to the Mage as if the mage had Equipable pets.<br>
-&gt; The Pet zones with the mage as if he possessed the Traveller ability.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet Unity</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level)<br>
The mage is capable of casting any self only buff on the pet as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet Inclusion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (9 AAXP 1 level)<br>
The pet is affected by any group/AOE buffs that the mage is and the pet is in the area for.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Elemental Legion</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (6 AAXP 3 levels)<br>
144 minute refresh timer-Duration of 2 mins<br>
The next time the mage casts a pet summon spell, the number of pets that are summoned are 100/150/200 divided by the level of the pet summoned, so if a level 40 pet is summoned with level 1 skill 2 are summoned, level 2 skill 3 are summoned and with level 3 5 pets are summoned. Each pet is controlled normally but must be targeted to accept any commands.<br>
<br>
Thats it for my AAXP class abilities, next I would like to discuss our startling lack of pets. For some reason VI decided that the 4 elemental pets were as interesting as they wanted to get with pets when there was a whole world of pet ideas that could have been used.{<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> I am aware of the global memory file limitation</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->}<br>
<br>
I am going to list a few ideas for pets that I think would have been very interesting and would have added great dynamic to the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Imp</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 24, 160 mana, Ashroot, 8 second CT<br>
This pet would produce a level 16-19 imp that has a DS = Fire pet DS, and Casts as a wizard, level 12 spells. Its mana pool would be limited just as a normal level 16-19 naked wizard, would have a mana regen rate the same as a normal caster with max med skill. But you would have to /pet sit it in order to have it regain mana at all.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Gargoyle</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 44, 240 mana, Gargoyle Eye, 12 second CT<br>
This pet would produce a level 34-36 that doubles for 55 points, would have HP between 1500 and 1800, but would regenerate at the same rate as the pre 34 pets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Stone Servitor</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 56, 400 mana, Large brick of ore, 10 second CT<br>
This pet is non combative(ie non aggro), instead all he has is 8 slots and a str of 200. This pet basically acts as a bank of sorts and can be summoned in addition to the normal pet, this pet will only follow orders when he is targeted and will remain after the mage comes back regardless of the amount of time it takes, but will only last 10 minutes after the mage comes back. In addition this is always a travelling pet and can cross zone lines with you freely.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Stone Statue</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 58, 500 mana, Small stone statue, 12 second CT<br>
This pet is level 49, has 6khp, Quads for 84. This pet drains the mage of 5 mana/tick. The pet moves as slow as most snared mobs and is immune to movement rate modifying spells such as snare/sow/root etc... However the pet is also immune to knockbacks and gravity fluxes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Stone Goliath</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 60, 1000 mana, Star Metal, 20 second casting time<br>
This pet is level 58, has 12khp, Quads for 120. This pet drains 100 mana/tick from the mage. Should the mage run out of mana, the pet will turn on the mage as if a charm had broken.<br>
<br>
These are just a few ideas for pets other then the standard one that could have been created I am sure there are a hundred more.<br>
<br>
Next up is spells, for some reason VI seems to have some sort of aversion to adding new spells, why I have no idea, they seem willing enough to add new equipment.<br>
<br>
The first thing I would like to address is the fact that mages lost a rather unique place with the luclin expansion spells that of componetless utility spells. Several other classes get them now where as it was what we got as payment for getting those utilities so late. So my first two spells are to give us back that unique place, not compententless but persistent.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Floating Ring</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 58 200 mana peridot<br>
Summons a ring(AC 6) that while worn causes the wearer to levitate persistently.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Breathing Stone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 57 200 mana  peridot<br>
Summons a stone(AC 6) that is used in the ranged/ammo slot and provides the ability of persistent enduring breath.<br>
<br>
A few other more practical end game resistance items would be nice as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Flame/Frost Stone</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 60 150 mana<br>
Summons a stone that gives  25 vs Fire or  25 vs Cold(2 separate spells) and goes in the ammo slot.{<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> This would be a lesser version of the resistance stones found in ST</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->}<br>
<br>
A few different types of pet buffs would be nice as well, things that would customize our pets a little more and give there boosts a little more meaning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Flesh of the Levitation</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 55 400 mana 1 hour<br>
This spell Increases the pets AC by 100 but reduces the pets Dexterity/Agility by 50(have no idea how much an appropriate amount would be. Does not stack with burning fury etc...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Burning Fury</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 55 400 mana 1 hour<br>
This spell increases the pets attack by 200 but decreases his ac by 50. Does not stack with flesh of the levitation etc...<br>
<br>
And lastly, a spell that would at least make us closer to druids in DSing and would give us more of an edge over druids in this department.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summon Ring of Flame</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Level 59 200 mana Bloodstone<br>
This summons a ring which has 2 charges of a damage shield(10 pts-10 minute duration) which stacks with the regular mage damage shield and most other normal damage shields.<br>
<br>
I am sure there are a million ideas for spells that would be interesting for mages.<br>
<br>
The last thing I will discuss is Research, I hate research as its currently implemented. I like the idea, but this is just not the way to do it. What I would like to see the current system used for is the creation of expendable foci, For example, instead of creating a scroll you combine the words/runes, and create a rune of flame. These expendable foci would go in the ammo slot when they are to be used and would have vanish after a set number of uses.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
Rune of Flame,  25% to damage on Fire DD's, 5 charges etc...<br>
<br>
These are just a few of the ideas I had while soloing last night(thats all I am gonna type at 5 am), I think maybe if we all could throw some ideas into it maybe VI will find something that they like, who knows crazier stuff has happened.<br>
