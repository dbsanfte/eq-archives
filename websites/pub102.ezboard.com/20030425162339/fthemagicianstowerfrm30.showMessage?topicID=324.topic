I figured the best ruler to measure them by was Flowing Thought per point spent.  I use FT because I believe it's the primary limitation on casters - how fast we can regain back the mana we use on any spell we cast.  Most of the work is just big algebra expressions, might be some errors in calculation, and in my thought process of accounting for all the factors involved.  Some I couldn't really figure out how to convert into a FT measurement (air elemental, pet discipline), and some I didn't do because I don't know how fizzle-rate, channelling, and subtley is determined.<br>
<br>
There's some variables I used numerous times:<br>
x = mana savings <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (caused by specialization, casting mastery, and mana preservation-type items)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
y = basic mana regen rate in mana/<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> sec</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (not mana per tick, and this is here because I made the assumption that if you're not casting a spell you're sitting down and medding, or using that time to rune-med with a Shield of Auras type effect.  I don't exactly know what sitting med rate is - about 4mana/sec I believe.  y does not include any FT items or effects because they are irrelivant to the analysis.  Yours may vary - my rate is about 12mana/sec using SoA)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
r = cast time reduction <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (caused by items like Naki ring, or other skills like Quick Summoning)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
s = normal cast time of a spell<br>
<br>
Remember that if something says 10%, that you have to use 0.10 in the equation.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mental Clarity</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - This one's pretty simple.<br>
<br>
(increase in FT) / (points spent)<br>
<br>
So spending 12 total points on Mental Clarity obtains 3 FT, or 0.25 FT/point.  However the first 2 points spent work out to 0.5 FT/point, while the last 6 runs at only 0.167 FT/point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Innate Regeneration</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - Using Modrod2<br>
<br>
(660 - (400 * (1 - x)) - (y*((3*0.5) + 4.5*(1-r)))) / 900 / 1 point<br>
<br>
the 3*0.5 is just a approximationn for time takes to actually click the rod 3 times.  The expression containing y means the amount of mana lost because you could have been medding during that time instead.  900 is the number of ticks to get all the health regened back.<br>
<br>
So with just specialization (about 11% mana savings I believe) and rate of 4mana/sec on y, with a 15% reduction using a Naki ring:  (660 - 356 - 21.3) / 900  =  222.7 / 900 = 0.247 FT/point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Spell Casting Mastery 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - This one rules<br>
<br>
(mana spent per minute) * x / 10 / 12<br>
<br>
10 is the number of ticks in a minute, 12 is number of points for SCM3.  I believe I read tests show SCM3 to be about a 10% savings.<br>
<br>
So lets say you use 1000 base mana in a minute - that's almost exactly 3 cast SoFB.  1000 * 0.10 / 10 / 12 means that by spending 1000 mana in a minute, 100 of it is knocked off by SCM3, meaning about 10 mana per tick saved.  That gives SCM3 and incredible 0.833 FT/point when you're using 1000 mana a minute.  If you're chain making modrods, say 10 a minute, that's 4000 mana used and 400 saved.  Effectively giving you a sustained 40FT during that minute and FT/point ratio over 3 - by far the best of any AA.  Even using as little as 400mana a minute, you get 0.33FT/point However, unlike innate regen and mental clarity, which are always going, this relies on you to be casting to take advantage of it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Deftness</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - How many magi actually have this? =p<br>
This one's a bit odd - the flowing thought rate gained by this skill, similar to Quick Summoning, is only active during times when you are casting beneficial spells - this would usually be useful if you solo by healing your pet almost exclusively. (which is I do - pet heal, SoA med, nuke when mana's full - gets me a point in less than 3 hours)<br>
<br>
s * r * y / 6 / points<br>
<br>
What this means is that every second saved by reducing cast time, means more time for you to meditate.  The 6 represents 6 seconds/tick.  So lets say we have Deftness3 and we're chain casting Transon's Elemental Infusion(level 52) and medding inbetween cast times.  5 * 0.25 * 4 / 6 = 0.833FT while casting beneficial spells, at a pretty steep cost of 0.069 FT/point.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Spell Casting Fury</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - kind of an odd one<br>
This, like mastery, depends on a certain amount per minute - this time damage.  It's kind of complicated =p<br>
<br>
(1 - (1 / (1 + (damage modifier)*(crit percentage)))) * (mana / damage) * (damage*frequency/ 10 ticks) / points<br>
<br>
Damage modifier for fury1 is 0.33, fury2 = 0.67, fury3 = 1.00  Crit percentages are 2%, 4%, 7% for each respective level of fury.<br>
<br>
The first part of the equation calculates the percentage of &quot;free damage&quot; generated by various levels of Casting Fury, and how much mana it would have cost to produce that damage.  Mana / damage is just the amount of mana a spell cost (times by (1-x) if you want to account for mastery/specialization).  Damage * frequency / 10 ticks is the ammount of damage per minute.  Lets say we're casting SoFB five times a minute, with no focus bracer, to keep things a little simpler with Fury3.  1 - (1 / (1 + 1.00*0.07) = 0.065<br>
0.065 * (334 / 1005) * (5 * 1005 / 10) = 0.065 * 0.332 * 502.5 = 10.855FT and creating a pretty good 0.905 FT/point.  Fury1 works out to only 0.091 FT/point though - so do it all the way!<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mend Companion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
This analysis doesn't account for the amount of time saved should the skill save you from having to remake a whole new pet...or find a rez <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(1980 / normal heal amount) * ((normal heal cost)*(1-x) + y*(s*(1-r))) / 1440 ticks / 5 points<br>
<br>
normal heal amount is 580 for 52 pet heal, 900 for 60 pet heal. Their respective mana costs are 275 and 400.  1440 ticks is the recast time on Mend.<br>
The equation takes into account mana lost by the time it would take to heal the pet the same amount that Mend does instantly(I assume it's instant).<br>
Using the 52 pet heal, with x of 11%, y of 4, r of 15% we get <br>
3.414 * (244.75 + 4*(5*0.85)) / 1440 = 0.621FT or 0.124FT/point.  3.414 is basically the number of heals needed to equal 1980 points healed by Mend.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Quick Summoning</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
This is basically the same as Deftness - it mostly likely will apply for long CoH or mod-rod pile making sessions.  It calculates the extra mana gained by sitting during the time saved by being able to cast quicker.<br>
<br>
s * r * y / 6 / points<br>
<br>
At max QS, casting CoHs and medding inbetween, you get FT4, or 0.22FT/point.  However if we take into account the difference between QS2 and 3, wearing a Naki ring, the last 9 points spent on QS3 are only worth about 0.088 per point.<br>
<br>
So, if I haven't made too many mistakes, or bored you to death, quick summary:<br>
<br>
Spell Casting Mastery 1-3 = 0.33-4.0FT/point<br>
Innate Regeneration = 0.247FT/point at any level<br>
Mental Clarity 1 = 0.5FT/point<br>
Mental Clarity 1-2 = 0.33FT/point<br>
Mental Clarity 1-3 = 0.25FT/point<br>
Mental Clarity 3 = 0.167FT/point<br>
Spell Casting Fury 1-3 = 0.905FT/point<br>
Spell Deftness 1 = 0.083FT/point<br>
Spell Deftness 1-3 = 0.069FT/point<br>
Mend Companion = 0.124FT/point<br>
Quick Summoning 1-3 = 0.22FT/point during CoH, 0.083 making modrods.<br>
Quick Summoning 3 = 0.088FT/point<br>
<br>
A lot of the numbers change depending on the spells your casting, and whether you have SoA.  Plus having some skills changes others - such as Deftness lowers Mend Companion slightly, but Deftness and Quick Summoning can up Spell Casting Mastery by letting you spend more mana per minute.<br>
<br>
Man I've had a slow day to think on all this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Counting all those points for each of those abilities is redundant and doesn't give a true representation of how much bang we get per point.  Just because some abilities have to be gotten before others doesn't mean the higher ones &quot;cost&quot; all of the points you've gotten until then.  That would be like saying my my  Greater Vocerate Earth pet costed (**insert some huge figure here equaling all money I've ever spent on earth pets throughout my mage's life**) just because I am required to use all the previous spells first before obtaining the level 57 one.  See what I mean?  Character didn't spend all that money for the 57 spell.  Character spent all that money on all those spells.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/kimmisc/dedollsig.jpg>

normal heal amount is 580 for 52 pet heal, 900 for 60 pet heal. Their respective mana costs are 275 and 400. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>360</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ticks is the recast time on Mend.<br>
The equation takes into account mana lost by the time it would take to heal the pet the same amount that Mend does instantly(I assume it's instant).<br>
Using the 52 pet heal, with x of 11%, y of 4, r of 15% we get <br>
3.414 * (244.75 + 4*(5*0.85)) / <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>360</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> =<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> 2.48 FT or 0.496 FT/point.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  (3.414 is basically the number of heals needed to equal 1980 points healed by Mend.)<br>
