<br>
Mages are slow, snail-footed and everything changes, from a tactical point of view, when we are given a SoW. <br>
I chose the Karanas, beacause Aviak city is so overcrowded and soloing somewhere where you hardly see other players gives you a special feeling, enabling you to completely immerse into Norraths World ;-)<br>
<br>
Anyways, here is where I think hunting is nice when avoiding the overcrowded spots. Head to North Karana. Bind on the bridge. From here its easy to run to the gypsy merchants, where you can sell all the nice loot.<br>
Keep your eyes peeled for Griffennes and Griffons, as they mean certain death if your paths cross. Just avoid them, and you'll be fine.<br>
I either run around invis (when I'm just selling), or I will have a pet summoned. Often a pet will get jumped by a lion - which is a nuisance, because it's good to keep pet at full HP and yourself at full mana at all times.<br>
Now to hunting: cross the bridge and zone into East Karana. Summon a good Pet (I like water best, but only when I know I'll engage poisonous spiders) burnout it and sit down to get full mana. Then head right at the shore and follow it.. keep following the shoreline for some time.. you will find a lone Pine tree, which is the last tree before a long stretch without trees. This is your hunting base. Rest and med close to the water, as it is safest.. if you med up the hill, Griffawns can jump you there. When you are ready, head for the crest of the hill. You will see Gnoll reavers. should be good experience at 20 and they have decent to good loot. Just make sure not to venture too far away from shore, cause they might spawn behind you and cut your escape route (or worse add to your pulls). <br>
Stay away from your pet, so that he still answers your macro-call /pet report health, when your are seated to regain mana.. the gnolls tend to run at you, when you are too close within aggro range. otherwise they will keep to your pet and burn themselves to death ;-) monitor your pet's health constantly, and occasionally burn the mobs a little, your mana bar should accompany your pets health bar. then return to your safe spot at the shore and med to full..<br>
<br>
watch out for the undead gnoll reavers, as they are quite tough. Other mobs you can do are: war dog, dark stalker, etc.. <br>
You will get good and constant experience from the reavers.. and the loot is really ok, dropping words, some gems, a little cash and a lot of raw-hide armour, that sells for 2 pp at the merchants. the undead gnoll reavers will give you very good experience at levels 21 and 22 and still at level 23.. <br>
Gorge hounds will be conning blue to you at lvl 23 and they are not so tough anymore.. I would engage them with care at lvl 20, where I got killed quickly by one.<br>
<br>
This is a very nice spot to get you to lvl 23.. and it's (mostly) not crowded!! You can sit here, enjoy the Karanas rain, fish a little at the river, while medding up, and your exp bar will seem to be animated, so quick it will go up ;-)<br>
nearby the bridge is a village with selling merchans (just always make sure no Griffs are flying too close, they'll jump you even within the houses).. oh and talking about Griffawns: at lvl 21 and 22, they can be taken with an earth pet (cause of his HPs) and give very nice experience and lot (words, gems..)at lvl 23 it is difficult to find blue conning griffawns.. but when you do, engage them, the exp is always worthwile. In North Karana there are a lot of Griffawns flying around, but beware of othersd, or Griffennes, or Griffons (Or Grimfeather.. YIKES), they will join the fight and might be quicker than you can gate :-)<br>
<br>
Upon reaching lvl 23, I heade to the gorge (foot of ramp), there on the right side (south side) where the gnoll family spawns, is a nice spot to hunt too.. <br>
The gnolls are a nuisance (no good loot, and too many greens) but they are fun to watch, as they will engage spiders and other mobs together, (and win ;-)). The chief gnoll (has a different color, not blue, but brown/white) is still conning blue at lvl 23 and gives great exp.. so when you can get him isolated from the other green guys, its a good shot. Anyway, here you should use a water pet, cause your main target are the crag spiders. don't let them touch you, their poison is extremely nasty, and can kill you if youget poisoned at half health. Monitor your Water pet's health (it is immune to poison), and nuke the Crag from time to time.. they'll drop like flies and are very good experience. In case you are a tailor, hmm... you'll love to kill them.<br>
Camping Broon I find is a nuisance. I was grouped when camping him, and apart from occasional cyclops toes (research item!!)there is no loot.. and the exp from Broon is so small, you can't see it on the bar... /sigh<br>
so forget Broon, and go solo Crag Spiders.. their experience is much better ;-)<br>
Dangers in this spot is to find a good place to sit &amp; med.. I kept just at the start of the hill, a corner point where I can see the ramp and the trees.. dont get too close to the ramp, becauise a nasty (!!)named Giant (for warrior quest, I think) roams that area when spawning, he kills fast. and there should also be those Evil eyes roaming around.. uhh. I have tremendous respect for these and I avoid them a lot. They will blind you, fear you, and/or charm you.. it's no fun when you are doing strange things, without being able to control your character.. I attacked a group of other players, they thought I was a NPC and almost killed me, until one of them cast cancel magic on me...<br>
East Karan is great fun, great exp and nice lot, if you are , like me, a mage that enjoys soloing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ))<br>
