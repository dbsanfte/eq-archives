For the reason compared between the statistics of the level 20 pet heal and the new level 64 pet heal, the rest seems rather unbalanced (underpowered) and out of scale. This was a reply to another thread, but the nature of this issue made me reevualuate that and I decided to make this into a new thread instead.<br>
<br>
The level 20 pet heal had a 2.25 h/m ratio, this is 1.9 h/m. In short I would not use this spell, I would stick with the level 20 pet heal until you get the level 60 pet heal, with THAT ratio is not very good either...2.2 h/m ratio. The only reason I use the level 60 pet heal is the fact it is no worse than the level 20 pet heal, but it is also no better. I avoided use of the level 52 pet heal altogether when I got it. But the new planar pet heal is REAL nice at a 4.0 h/m ratio. They just need to scale the other pet heals accordingly.<br>
<br>
Here are the pet heals (OLD and NEW)...<br>
<br>
LV8: Renew Elements<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 33 (L8 )  to 50 (L25) for 25 mana. (MAX 2.0 h/m ratio)<br>
LV20: Renew Summoning<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 140 (L20) to 220 (L60) for 100 mana. (MAX 2.25 h/m ratio)<br>
LV44: Refresh Summoning*<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 338 (L44) to 370 (L60) for 200 mana. (MAX 1.85 h/m ratio)<br>
LV52: Transon's Elemental Infusion<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 556 (L52) to 580 (L60) for 275 mana. (MAX 2.11 h/m ratio)<br>
LV60: Transon's Elemental Renewal<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) by 900 (L60) for 400 mana. (MAX 2.25 h/m ratio)<br>
LV64: Planar Renewal**<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) by 1200 (L64) for 300 mana. (MAX 4.0 h/m ratio)<br>
<br>
*Denotes a spell of unknown origin, this may be a POP spell or may not.<br>
**Denotes a POP spell.<br>
<br>
As you can see here only the level 8 and level 20 pet heals scaled correctly. But the other 3 pet heals do not, it was not until POP that we (so far) get a truly improved pet heal in Planar Renewel. The Level 44 and 52 pet heals are actually WORSE in their heal to mana ratios. But based on the level 20 pet heals and the new POP pet heal I do have suggestions on what the lv44, 52, and lv60 pet heals should look like, without changing how much they heal.<br>
<br>
*Change MAG LV44 Refresh Summoning from a mana cost 200 to a mana cost of 150. This changes the mana ratio from 1.85 h/m to a ratio of 2.47 h/m.<br>
*Change MAG LV52 Transon's Elemental Infusion from a mana cost of 275 to a mana cost of 200. This changes the mana ratio from 2.11 h/m to a ratio of 2.9 h/m.<br>
*Change MAG LV60 Transon's Elemental Renewal from a mana cost of 400 to a mana cost of 260. This changes the mana ratio from a 2.25 h/m to a ratio of 3.46 h/m.<br>
<br>
From these new numbers you would see a general linear increase in the spell performance from the old pet heal spell at level 20 to the new pet heal at level 64. As the level 44, 52, and 60 pet heals stand, they are unbalanced and out of scale and do need retroactive changing to reflect the old and new heal.<br>

They will not scale the other pet heals. If they do then we will be better at healing pets then beastlords and very equal. We get SCM, specialization and focus to help bring the cost of spells down. Melee only get focus items and as of now 90% of hybrids don't even use them because they offer inferior stats and they would rather boost there melee side then there spell casting side.<br>
<br>
Wezloc<br>
<br>
Planar Renewal + Transon's Elemental Renewal + SCM3 + 200 specialization + MP3 + spell casting haste =<br>
<br>
2100hps/490m 11.9sec cast time<br>
<br>
Beastlord best heal in PoP is 2100hp/425m 9sec cast time.<br>
<br>
I think that is as close as it probably should be. A argument can be made that it is too close right now. If we start healing like beastlords then they are gonna want damage/tanking pets like mages.<br>

Rebalancing the level 44, 52, and level 60 pet heals has nothing to do with that thread. Your thread was regardling the new level 64 pet heal and how it relates to the beast lord pet heal. And even if they do the beast lord pet heals are SO far ahead of the magician pet heals ours STILL would not come close...read my post to compare the ratios the beast lord pet heals: <br>

Here is a rehash about the ratios from that article...<br>
<br>

<br>
Beastlord Pet Heals<br>

LV9: Sharik's Replenishing<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 28 (L9) to 33 (L18 ) for 15 mana (MAX 2.2 h/m ratio)<br>
LV15: Keshuval's Rejuvination<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 85 (L15) to 100 (L30) for 30 mana (MAX 3.3 h/m ratio)<br>
LV30: Herikol's Soothing<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) by 300 (L30) for 75 mana (MAX 4.0 h/m ratio)<br>
LV39: Yekan's Recovery<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 580 (L39) to 583 (L40) for 125 mana (MAX 4.6 h/m ratio)<br>
LV49: Vigor of Zehkes<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 840 (L49) to 910 (L56) for 250 mana (MAX 3.6 h/m ratio)<br>
LV52: Aid of Khurenz<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) from 434 (L52) to 438 (L60) for 125 mana (MAX 3.5 h/m ratio)<br>
LV55: Sha's Restoration<br>

LV61: Healing of Sorsha<br>
Increase Hit Points (HP) by 2100 (L61) for 425 mana (MAX 4.9 h/m ratio)<br>
<br>
The Level 49 and Level 52 BST pet heals had a lower ratio for a much faster casting time. But overall the beastlord pet heals CLEARLY had a far better mana ratio than the magicians did. You said that our pet heals are already too close to the beastlord pet heals, how is a 3.3 h/m - 4.6 h/m close to the current average of 1.9 h/m - 2.25 h/m ratios that magicians have now? There is no reason not to rebalance the older heals based on what the level 20 MAG pet heal was and what the proposed level 64 MAG pet heal may be.<br>
<br>
Changing the older pet heals to reflect that scale between what the level 20 pet heal is and level 64 pet heal would still not make us anywhere near as good as a pet healer as beastlords currently are. There pet heals have FAR better mana ratios and can be cast a lot faster and does not have a recast like our pet heals do. Also remember in the comparisons you was making that Beastlords also have access to Spell Haste items and Mana Preservation items. The only things they do not have access to is specialization and spell casting mastery. But if you feel this way WEZLOC, are you recommending that they remove or reduce the power of not only our current pet heals but Planar renewal as well?<br>
<br>
You have not explained to me why they should NOT rebalance the older Magician pet heals or why they should reduce (nerf) the power of the older pet heals. But like I said earlier...rebalancing the older level 44, 52, and 60 pet heals has nothing to do with your post. This thread was only about rebalancing and rescaling the older MAGICIAN pet heals and was not even looking at the beastlord pet heals for a comparision. But if you do wish to compare the spells then it stands the magician pet heals seem more unbalanced when compared to the Beastlord class. Regardless it does stand that the older pet heals are INDEED unbalanced as is and out of scale.<br>

<br>
A few quick questions regarding one class 'encroaching' on another's territory.<br>
<br>
1. Why should a hybrid be better at any casting skill than a pure caster? <br>
<br>
2. Can you name any example of where another hybrid is better at a 'type' of spell than their pure caster brethren?<br>
<br>
3. Does a self only, or self-pet only ability do anything to increase a class's desirability in groups or on raids?<br>
<br>
4. Now that BL's can effectively chain summon warders, why should it matter if we come close to them in healing power?<br>
<br>
5. Beastlord's have many deficiencies, how does a better mage pet only heal make a difference to beastlords?<br>
<br>
I guess where I'm leading with these questions is that it should make no difference to the BL's if mages become better pet clerics, as it has no impact on their desirability in groups or on raids. This isn't exactly the same thing as druids and shammies getting versions of CH..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There's no reason the beastlord's can't continue to receive other upgrades without mage heals becoming better as well.<br>
<br>
That being said, I think VI should decide on a pet healing ratio for mages. At a minimum, that ratio should stay the same for each of the subsequent spells, possibly getting a little better as you progress later in the game. Naturally this ratio should be improved from where it currently stands.<br>

If you add in SCM3/MP3/Speicalization then the beastlord heals are not as far ahead of some would have us believe.  I doubt they will rebalance the older heals. I am not saying that i am against it but relative balance must be kept and if we can heal as good as a beastlord and out damage them that will bring up balance issues. It would be the one thing beastlords would use to have there pets upgraded to be equal or greater then mages. Because like you said upgrading bst pets to be better then mage pets doesn't affect the mage at all.<br>

<br>
I don't agree. SCM3 can be had at level 55. From that point forward a mage can start drastically reducing his mana cost in his given specialization. I think to ignore that is foolish. Beastlords are a support pet class, i.e. the term pet cleric.  Mages have ALWAYS been Wizard with a pet model. We have a very low cost pet that can be replaced for little cost. That is a huge advantage for the mage.  <br>
<br>
I just think that bst were made with the intent of being the best healing pet class. They heal the best so there pet is alot weaker. If we start healing as good as they do then there is no reason their pets should not be stronger relative to ours. Considering that we are gonna be able to do near 280dps with 1 nuke and they can barely scratch 50dps even uber. At some point the mage has to give up something. We are the best pet class that doesn't mean we should be equal in healing also. We have the strongest pets and they are the easiest to replace, vs a  class that has weaker pets, which are more difficult to replace.  <br>
<br>
If a mage can do double the dps of a bst, and his pet can do double the dps of a warder then the beastlord has to have a advantage somewhere. Right now it is utility i.e. personal heals, slow and pet heals. Remember bst do not get root or snare just like mages. They are a hybrid pet class that pays the same penalty for having a good pet as a mage. Instead of snare they get slow. The reason they heal better then a mage is because they are part priest.  I think pushing for better heals is a very tricky territory. If you want better heals you have to give up something for them. I personally don't want to give up anymore to other classes.<br>

I soloed Yeldema with only the level 52 pet heal and finished the fight with mana. I solo in UP daily and net 3/4 blue per kill. I think the heals serve the mage just fine if he knows what he is doing. We always bitch as a class that druids shouldn't be able to heal almost as good as a cleric and nuke almost as good as a wizard. Well we see how unfair it is that druids are so overpowered. Why do you want the same for us?<br>

Estimates have shown that 2% of mages have their epic. (I have NO idea if this is anywhere near accurate). That being said, class solutions should be designed around the other 98% first. If the other 2% gain more power, great, but they should not be used as a measuring stick for the rest of the population. <br>
<br>
Back to the point at hand:<br>
<br>
Once again, all i'm asking for is a little consistency with the heals. The charts in all of these posts have shown that our heal/mana ratio is very erratic. Quoting my earlier post: &quot;At a minimum, that ratio should stay the same for each of the subsequent spells, possibly getting a little better as you progress later in the game. Naturally this ratio should be improved from where it currently stands.&quot;<br>
<br>
Right now, the ratio is all over the board. Adding an additional heal at 44 is a nice touch for those who need to cycle heals, but cycling extremely inefficient spells isn't all that productive in the long run.......<br>

Sorry, sometimes I forget that I have BoBC and Epic and think that is the average mage. I remember the old days of having to use regular pets and nuke with mana hehe. However to be fair to me, you have to understand that the circle of people that I raid with makes me feel very much below average. I look around and all the mages that are at my level in terms of &quot;raiding&quot; have vastly superior gear. I am talking Shield of Auras, Creater Dagger ect....<br>
<br>
Also a ton of mages have epics now. It isn't as rare as it once was. It is still hard to get but alot of people have them. Seems everywhere i turn there is a mage epic now.  I just think we need to be careful not to ask for to much. We are not druids and are not loved like them. They get to have it all without giving up anything. For the rest of us it doesn't work this way. If we improve to much in healing we will be forced to give up something and I for one don't want to give up anymore.<br>

<br>
The 8, 20 and I believe the propsed 44 are based off Alteration.  52, 60 and 64 are Conjuration.  You can only take into consideration a specialization of 50 into the first 3 heals making them even more inefficient.  (3 percent savings? instead of 11 or so for 200.)<br>
