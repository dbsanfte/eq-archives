<br>
There was a time when I thought that doing the practice research was gonna be the way to go, but it turned out to be WAY more hassle than it was worth to me. I kept the concordance as a light 6 slot bag, and nowadays I just shell out the plat to use my practice points every level...<br>
<br>
Pretty much all of the utility summons are available at the Library in Erudin (top floor, the vendor wanders around, so be patient), The Library Mechamagia in Ak'Anon (2 vendors in a room to the left as you enter the library) or Neriak (never been there, not into getting killed! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
For the words and components, I just let my guildmates know which ones I need, and they hold onto them for me. The key to getting words and components is to let your friends and guildies know what you are looking for <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Lorendel Daywalker<BR>Proud husband to Brianna :D</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mzee>Mzee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(8/24/00 6:45:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What is spell research</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Ive been hanging out in High Keep pit now off and on and I must say, this is the place for words of transcendence! I've picked up three in about  a weeks worth of playing and Ive also seen others loot them. I have also bought some off the regular vendors there, as people must sell them. I bought a gloves of rallos zek off of the minor, and someone looted a flame of vox down there as well. Supposedly the flame is less rare than the gloves. <br>
<br>
I got some other inside info that the gloves are readily available at the druid ring in NK? I have not been able to substaniate that clame as of yet, but will post when I can. I hear that flame also drops in Unrest, but I havent seen any ( or was too low a level  to loot any myself). <br>
<br>
Again, if anyone has any info on where these things drop besides the standard &quot;kill mobs for that level&quot; it would be apprecieated by one and all. Or at least those of us who are running first time characters and are trying to catch up. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unefariusgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nefarius Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(8/24/00 7:27:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Research components</span><hr size=1> I have verified that Ice of Velious is readily available on one of the dwarf merchants on the Sister Isle in OOT.<br>

Grrrr.<br>
<br>
I maxed out my points at the guildmaster and started researching my spells. I seemed to get about a 50% success rate except for that darn water pet which required about 5 tries (at 12pp a pop for the 20th level pet scroll). <br>
<br>
Practice research is pretty cool, at least at this level. When I hit 25 I used a backlog of practice runes I'd made (the ones that triv at 62) and got my five points with only seven pairs of runes, so practice research isn't nearly so heinous as something like tailoring. The only annoying part is getting all those goofy components, many of which don't stack. (Why on earth do sheets of parchment not stack??? They're paper, fer cryin' out loud!)<br>
<br>
Ice of Velious has been pretty easy for me to obtain just by fighting mobs and by finding it on vendors. Jade shards are common too, but I have a rough time finding pearl shards. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 25th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Kalamos</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(9/9/00 8:06:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Research</span><hr size=1> I agree whole heartedly with using skill points to increase your research level.  Sure it gets expensive at higher levels, but the practice items can end up costing you a fortune to get and a nice run all over Norrath.  Forget it ... I put my first point into research at lvl 24 (hint: that first point will give you the skill level of whatever your current char level is) and put all my saved points into it.  I researched the Fire, Water and Air pets as well as Everfount and Cornucopia with only one failure (luckily the failure came on Cornucopia ... a summon food scroll costs a lot less than the lvl 20 pet scrolls &quot;grin&quot;).  I plan to pour my next 20 skill points into research to do the lvl 29 spells when I get there.  So to sum it up ... I say forget practice research ... use your skill points, save older components to re-research spells you already have until it becomes trivial.  You can always sell the scroll to another Mage or simply give them away.  I've given research alot of thought and hae asked a lot of questions and have concluded that in the interests of enjoying the game (not running around looking for practice components) this is the best way.

I also thought about practice research (I do have 40 shark skins from playing in Erudin harbor one night, so I may do that research) but decided it was easier to just fight stuff and get plat than it would be to fight stuff trying to get components, or to go around buying components.<br>
<br>
No, non stacking parchment does not make much sense. Just another example of Verant trying to make it harder for us casters (they call it balance, we call it stupid). Seems we're stuck either wasting slots hold research crap until you loot the other components while hunting, or haul around the other components until you can get to a vendor and do research there. Either way, we're kept loaded down with stuff taking up inventory slot that could be used for sellable goods <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That's why I decided to leave all the crap in the bank, and buy my points. I'll ask higher levels to combine for me, or just wait until my skill gets up. To &quot;The Hole&quot; with Verant and their trying to make stuff difficult! <br>
<br>
All mages unite!!! Help your bretheren! Hit that combine button for us! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Oh, and I have NO problem at all with paying 5-10 plat (per spell if I have to). I understand it took alot of plat to get the skill up. Just like I ALWAYS try to give 2-5pp (depending on location and level or the person) for SoW. I personaly don't &quot;charge&quot; for any help I give, but I find if I am polite and nice enough, people usualy give anyway (be it for a Sow with my Shaman, or a flame shield or food/water/band-aids given out while I am preping to hunt). I know I like to be pleasantly surprised by 10-20pp (20 is the most anyone has dropped on me for any type of unsolicited help) for a Sow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
What's my point? Research is a pain any way you look at it. As long as we work together (heck I give away words runes and pages whenever I'm grouped) it will not be so stupid. Agnostic knows Verant will never change it to make sense. Although all the talk about STR bonuses, tintable plate, and other changes to blacksmithing has given me some hope for the future of trade skills. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It just hasn't gven me any hope for research. <br>

Here's what he taught me, and it's worked well for me so far (having just hit lvl 29 and researched my Earth pet on the second try woohoo!!)<br>
<br>
1.  Buy your level 16 and level 20 pet spells at the Ocean of Tears merchant.  Overall, it's cheaper and less hassle than trying to research the pets.<br>
<br>
2.  Don't research until you absolutely have to.  Save all your practice points until you reach a level where you find a spell that you MUST have.  For me, that lvl was 24 and the spell was Everfount.<br>
<br>
3.  My mentor never used &quot;practice research&quot; - neither have I.<br>
<br>
4.  When grouped, offer to buy/trade mage words/components from others when they loot them.  Give necros the necro words you loot, give enchanters their pages, you get the idea.<br>
<br>
5.  CHECK MERCHANTS.  I've found Gloves of Rallos Zek, Flame of Vox, etc. on merchants along with a few mage words as well.  Not to mention finding cyclops toes, gargoyle eyes, etc. that are components for the mage focus items.<br>

<br>
I begin to hate research with growing passion every new spell level. At 29, Air and Fire pets are on vendors, and the 24 Earth pet is also on a vendor, so that one is also easily researched. At 29, the only pet requiring a researched spell as a research component is the water pet.<br>
<br>
So I saved up a batch of words of dimension and ice of velious and trotted out to the merchant in OOT. Bought a stack of level 20 water pets and started creating a pile of 24 water pet scrolls. I had hoped this would count as practice so I wouldn't need to spend money or skill points. But no, at level 30 the 24 water pet is trivial to research. &lt;sigh&gt; <br>
<br>
Apparently, if you want to raise your research skill by doing actual research, you have to research spells of your current circle. The research components for these, of course, only drop from mobs that con white or higher to you.<br>
<br>
The other night I paid a player 20pp to get 1 words of coercion and 1 flame of vox, neither of which have I ever seen drop off anything. Since components are turning out so expensive and hard to obtain, I've almost always found a high level mage to hit the combine button for me.<br>
<br>
So why am I raising my research skill? I don't dare make them myself, since I stand a great chance of losing my components. I guess I raise my skill so that I can combine spells for lower level mages. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 30th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Nathrak</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(9/29/00 2:47:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   research</span><hr size=1> I too had trouble with those lvl 24 spells, failing 5 times to make my pet (bad luck I guess, research maxed for level)<br>

<br>
Preparing for your new pets:<br>
<br>
The time to start preparing for your new pets is not when you are almost ready to ding or after.  At the very least, start a full spell circle before you need them. ie. You just ding 24, start looking for lvl 29 words and components.  Like to plan in advance, then print a list of every word you'll need and collect them for any level whenever you find them.<br>
(This works for those that don't have guildmates to help. If you have friends that are willing, let em know what you need)<br>
<br>
Researching those new pets:<br>
<br>
I collected all my components for a pet and put them into the research book.  In Kunark Firona Vie bank I saw a high level mage.  Being respectful of his time, I had everything ready to go, and asked him if his research skills were good if he would mind hitting the combine button for me.<br>
<br>
I've done this 3 times now with great luck. If you aren't begging words, are already pre-loaded and asking someone for 30 secs of their time, most everyone will be happy to help a fellow mage out.<br>
(note: make sure in your haste to preload your research book, you get the right components in. I screwed up once and lost everything because I hadn't put the right ones in. doh!) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udunedin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dunedin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(10/6/00 1:37:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Research</span><hr size=1> a nice place to find components is High Keep,  i have gotten a couple of Flame of Vox's,  3 ice of Velious and various words like Tyranny, Trancendence.  if you go there you will find a lot of the words and components you are looking for for the lower to mid level spells<br>

My research is at 147 at 51, and I still fail 44 alot which is trivial, personally the failure rate is set to high it seems for magicians.  The 49 words of bonding seem really hard to find.  Words of convocation drop alot off of the gnashers and ragers in dreadlands, I hear alot drop from lower guk also, been their never seen any. Think I have been getting the incarceration from the recluse's in dreadlands also, just sold 32 of them.<br>
<br>
  Their is a seller qeynos that sells the scent of marr, tears of prexus and blood of vox something like that, I figured someone sold to the seller, so I bought a few, had more, ended buying 100 and the seller still had em, so this seller has an endless supply of them, its the one next to the mage guild, check them all.  <br>
<br>
As for practice, just keep making til it hits trivial then move on, I stopped training my research at 39, seem to be pointless even at trivial you tend to fail alot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(4/16/02 11:28:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Research</span><hr size=1> I'm pissed like hell with all that research stuff.<br>
And I regret it soooo much, that I ever attempted to get it started.<br>
<br>
When I went lvl 24 I was so happy that I can have Everfount and Corncucopia finally.<br>
<br>
So first I attempted to start the practise research. Wasted a few fruitless hours on it before I gave up. Then I pumped money into the research skill and got it to 46.<br>
I thought that would be a good time to try it and I was hoping to get at least 1 of the both spells with the 3 Words of Transcendence I had.<br>
<br>
what shall i say...failed all three times.<br>
Just for the fun of it I tried to research the lvl 24 Pets for which I had 2 scrolls available.<br>
Failed again both times.<br>
<br>
Now I think it's complete bull**** and after that I didn't play my mage for almost 2 months and started a druid up ;-)<br>
<br>
I mean a random factor is nice, but when my skill is 46, shouldn't I have gotten at least *1* spell out of the 5 attempts?<br>
<br>
and sure, many of you just say &quot;I will just buy the skill&quot;.<br>
But for somebody who doesn't have a high-lvl-main for the money supply and who also cannot play the game for 10 hours a day to get all the components I think that's ridiculous.<br>
<br>
Oh well...started to play the Mage again a bit.<br>
Lived up to 29 with the earth Pet only. wasting time to summon food and drink whenever I log in. (poor people like me have to save coins where they can ;-) ). and for the levels 29-33 I won't need more than my Fire Pet as it seems ;-)<br>
<br>
But still I know it will suck at higher levels not to have all teh Pets available.<br>
And maybe I'm just unlucky but from 24 to 28 I got hundreds of Words from all the Mobs I fought. But not a single one for the Mage class.<br>
<br>
Sorry, it's not very constructive, I just think the whole research stinks big time ;-)<br>

Even when it starts to get insanely expensive in your upper 40's.<br>
<br>
Even so, research is easier now for a mage than it used to be.  The spells in Katta are huge -- not having to chain research your level 49 pet is a major bonus.<br>
<br>
There have always been rumors about vendors that sell mage research components.  I've chased more than a few, only to find out that it was just luck that someone sold a component to a vendor.  The dwarf vendors in OOT and Dagnor's Cauldron are examples of these... remember that the dwarves on Sister Isle are prime mage camp sites, and that Ice of Velious isn't used past 24 except for chain research... many mages dump their components once they don't need it, and that dwarf is the closest vendor.<br>
<br>
Level 16 and 20 pet spells can be bought from the high elf on the AC isle.<br>
<br>
Level 34 research pets CANNOT be bought from Katta... they are no longer there.  Verified as of 4/20/2002.  One Level 39 research pet CAN be bought there -- think it's water, but don't quote me.  All level 44 pets are there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=outofmana>OutOfMana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(12/6/02 12:35:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Finding HL words and components</span><hr size=1> For what it is worth, check out the merchants in the bank in Jaggedpine Forest.<br>

There are a lot of 50+ characters hunting this zone who no longer need these things and they often dispose of them to the merchants by the bank.  There are enough HL mobs that many of the things you need will be there.<br>
<br>
If you are really lucky, there will be a HL mage exping on gnolls or dryads who will do the combine for you.  Personally, I'm always willing to hit the combine button if someone hands me the book with the components in it (research about 180 from memory). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showMessageRange?topicID=10.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showPrevMessage?topicID=10.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showNextMessage?topicID=10.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.threadControl?topicID=10.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=10.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions>Library Submissions</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
