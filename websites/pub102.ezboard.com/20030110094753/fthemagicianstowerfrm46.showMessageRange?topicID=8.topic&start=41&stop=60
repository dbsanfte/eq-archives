Im sorry Mr Beta Tester but what upgrade did we receive?  No, Im not talking about recently.  We did get a 1005 nuke.  That is less then the 1024 that we had currently.  We had COTH semi-nerfed to where it could not be used in certain zones.  We found out there was a haste cap on pets.  And on and on.<br>
<br>
If you havent noticed, alot of Magicians are worried because of what has happened in the past.  Sure, if you only believe in Trodding/COTH then you think Verant has given Magicians something decent in Luclin.  But, when guilds only need 1-2 Magicians on a raid (and not for damage) that is not good for Magicians as a whole.<br>
<br>
Also, pet upgrades went across the board to all pet classes.  But in general, nothing Mage specific.<br>

We did get a spell FAR too powerfull then it should have been, but with it came a new direction for class roles which *most* of the 'old school' or 'raiding' do not want to do. They are stil searching for the glory of parsing pet damage, nukes and dmg shields and flaunting it about, ergo .... why the community is disscontent. <br>
<br>
I do not agree with it mind you - I stoped playing for myself and played for my guild mates/friends years ago, but the Mage that plays for himself ...... he is unhappy. Right or wrong.<br>

<br>
You mean recently?  He means during the expansion.  He is right, specially when you compare with other expansions.  Luclin for mages was better just merely as an expansion than Kunark or Velious, theres not much in debating that either.<br>
<br>
Maybe you think what we got wasn't enough?  Well, what can we compare it to?  The best EQ changes?  Say.. what happened with melee's and their AC and damage on weapons?<br>
<br>
Well we didn't recieve a 200% increase (or more) in damage.  We did come a lot closer than you may think though.  In sheer DPS from nukes from focus items and some good nukes with decent ratios and enhanced specialization abilities worked out pretty nice for us.  Now couple that with going from like almost no mana regen to having godly combos with trans rods and in ideal circumstances having mana regen of 100 mana a tick, thats pretty sweet.<br>
<br>
Remember when enchanters were worried not too long ago about Verant giving out flowing thought I items?  Because they were supposed to be the only class that gave a clarity effect to others?  Well now we have stackable flowing thought items going up to KEI levels.  And then of course new spells and abilities that add mana regen too.  <br>
<br>
Mana regen basically was cut into a third of the time now that is was before.<br>
<br>
All that with luclin.<br>
<br>
We can chain nuke now in proper circumstances, and are able to keep it up nearly indefinitly.  Our pets got a crapload of upgrades, even considering the haste cap and FB fiasco.  I mean our epics was upgraded how many times in the last expansion?  Compared to others?  We got higher damage, more hit points, and now a focus item that upgrades it's potential even further?  What other epic has gotten that much of an upgrade?  <br>
<br>
Only gripes we have now mainly come by comparing us to others.  And some of them I can follow.  But just for upgrades alone Luclin, that beta tester is unquestionably right.  I can only hope we do half as well with PoP. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimmlazen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 9:49:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Where are the Mage beta testers</span><hr size=1> NO NO NO and More No<br>
<br>
We did not get any spell upgrades.  Where?  The focus items was already admitted as a way to get focuses into circulation to try them out.  Guess what?  Its not Magician &quot;specific&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Mana Regen?  Where?  Others have shields and buffs that gives 7-8 ticks.  Thats without a clerc.  I dont know about you, but I dont have a healer in my pocket.  So without the healer, TRODs dont do me any good.<br>
<br>
Pets?   Upgraded across the board.  And those classes received other upgrades that was specific to there class.<br>
<br>
We have gotten so used to not getting upgraded that we accept anything as a upgrade.  Ex:  Druids and Shaman CH...thats a upgrade.<br>
<br>
Why do you think so many Mages are concerned about POP?  Look at the past.  Everyone has caught us in the Nuke department.  Im waiting for the swords that proc the same damage as my spell (wouldnt surprise me).  Pets barely holding on to the top Pet position.  Trods?  Why?  The encounters will be faster according to Verant.  Pet heals and buffs?  Where?  Im still looking for the change to the 800 AOE for 800 mana.  Why not?  Wizards got theirs changed.<br>
<br>
So yes, Im questioning where is the Magicians that suppose to be representing the Magicians on a whole.  Not the couple that is happy with any little &quot;soup and bone&quot;.  Also, no I do not speak for all Magicians, but if you read majority of the board, there arent too many happy with what is being seen.<br>

<br>
No new pets.<br>
No new nukes on release of SoL.<br>
No new rains on relase of SoL.<br>
No new PBAE on release of SoL.<br>
No Focus Items on release of SoL.<br>
<br>
<br>
What we did get.<br>
<br>
Improved Invis. Great spell, but should have been in SoV.<br>
Summoned Armour. Nice but not great.<br>
Elemental Blanket. Nice asked for this a lot in ToV.<br>
Elemental Defender. Never use it.<br>
<br>
Think that is about it.<br>
<br>
Now AFTER months of SoL release we got:<br>
<br>
Shock of Firery Blades. Use it all the time<br>
Malestrom of Electricity. High mana cost. Nice spell.<br>
Focus Items. Always wear the bracer-ring-ear ring.<br>
Pet upgrades. Way over do. Thank you again Verant.<br>
<br>
AAXP skills.<br>
<br>
Pet Hold. Damn nice<br>
The only other ones I have found of use are the ones given to every class. Run 3 SCM and SCF. Frenzied Burnout broken still etc..<br>
<br>
Over all the best things to happen to magicians with the expansion on release was improved invis.<br>
<br>
Everything other spell on release paled to that one spell in my opinoin.<br>
<br>
Caster ballancing did bring Focus Items, and pet improvements, but it was not with the release of SoL, but caster ballancing.<br>
<br>
So over all, I have to agree SoL on release did not improve magician's, very much at all.<br>

<br>
I know most of us old schoolers have seen hard times, but truthfully compared to the past Magicians have gotten a lot of the fixes we requested during the whole class balancing thing.<br>
<br>
Luclin has done quite a bit to even up the odds...<br>
<br>
Give you an example, my guild did tunare and parsed the whole combat out.  Out of the top 10 melee damage dealers 2 were epic pets.  That didnt take into consideration of the pets casting ability and my nuking ability, my modrod ability.   Sure mid-50s is difficult for a mage, but it is also for a Wizard or a enchanter.  <br>
<br>
A magician at level 60 isn't a bad life.<br>
<br>
and let me say one more thing... A magician going from 1rst to 60th nowadays has it extremely easy compared to what us old timers went through.<br>
<br>
Total time playing Waylor:  285 days, 13 hours, and 30 minutes and counting.<br>

I think in &quot;certain&quot; situations and on &quot;certain&quot; mobs we are awesome.  But most of our damage is done with things that we received Pre Velious and Pre Luclin.  That is Epic pet/DS/Nuke (except for 1005 nuke).  We got armor (but still cant tell if helps Epic).  Mages dont even wear the armor and the armor is low level items.  But what we did receive is Trods.  At first it wasnt bad, but this is a example of just a simple Dragon raid:  Different raids almost same scenario...except for COTH.<br>
<br>
1 EX:  First, I have to stay NON KS to dragons because I need to COTH people in to our safe zone.  That means no raid experience (so slow on AA).  Then I summon as many Trods as I can.  Everyone grabs a TRod.  The during the battle I summon a Trod, step to side, summon Trod, step to side, summon Trod.  After a few then I Mod up.  Oh my !$# ..1#$.  Now tell me that isnt boring.  I look up to see how the battle is going...throw a few nukes.  Then I here &quot;Where's the Rods?&quot;.  So rinse and repeat.  <br>
<br>
I am saying what I dont like to hopefully have some fun on raids and get some of that experience.  I dont want to be too powerful, but I want to feel like part of the battle.  Hell, right now I feel like the water boy, giving out water so everyone else can play.  And thats really what it is.<br>
<br>
So please Mr Beta Testers...dont have us still doing this.   Please help us enjoy ourselves once again.<br>

Take out the nuke upgrade as it isn´t really an upgrade. Furthermore i consider trods both a blessing and a curse. If you simply say trods are uber YOU don´t know what you´re talking about or didn´t experience the joy of dropping rods for months yet.<br>

<br>
I dont like self righteous peeps like you.  Ive been playing the class for years and you try to say because I dont like to Trod I dont like my class.  Well I say you dont just because you dont believe in doing damage.  I dont play games to sit on the sidelines.  I play to be active.  So yeah Fook Trods.  Im sick of them.<br>
<br>
We got THE SECOND MOST POWERFUL SPELL IN THE GAME, first being Complete Heal. T-Rods are incredibly powerful, and if you don't realise their power your a complete idiot. Idiots, go play a Warrior, run up to the mob and press A. Otherwise, learn to play your class, Mages are incredibly powerful.  Matter of fact you said:<br>

What we got with Luclin? QS3, Pet Hold, Improved Reclaim (incredibly powerful), New Pet Heals (nice), Nuke Upgrade (Sofb), Pet Upgrades (huge increase in DPS).<br>

<br>
Improved Reclaim?  I dont chain cast.  So it only helps those that do.<br>
<br>
New Pet Heals?  Review others pet heals.  And we are the Premiere Pet class.<br>
<br>
Nuke Upgrades?  1024-1005= -19 (no increase)<br>
<br>
Pet upgrades?  Across the board to all Pet classes.  Not Mage specific.<br>
<br>
Pet Hold?  Please,,,all those AA for that skill?<br>
<br>
Compare those to other classes AAs.  And BTW AA's did not come out with Luclin they were added later.  But compared to other classes we need a Major overhaul.<br>
<br>
We can turn ourselves into Elementals:whoopie  We Frenzy Burnout: pathetic.   And so is the rest of the AA's.<br>
<br>
Also, why is it that a few Magicians gonna tell the rest of the Magicians to be happy and play the way they play.  And I dont have a cleric walking around with me so Trods dont help me when Im soloing.<br>

Um we went from worst to best.  It's not hard to figure out.  First, we were always meant to be a class that precast a lot of it's good offense, man they said that just after EQ came out.

Necros can lich, shamans can cani and we can mod, but do it a lot faster than either two.   If soloing is your life, just slap on TPP and take a mod charge off every time you get to 100% health.

I guess you missed the patches were the greater vocerates were upgraded and the epic was upgraded.  And those non mage changes to pets that seem to make no difference to you makes about the most difference to the one class that uses pets more than any other.  So I'd wager they count pretty heavy too.<br>

Pet heals and buffs? Where? Im still looking for the change to the 800 AOE for 800 mana. Why not? Wizards got theirs changed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The nukeage I'll agree with you on, theres many better ways of handling them and mages should be 2nd (although we are settling for 3rd now that we've been behind druids for so long.)   <br>
<br>
Pets holding top position is a matter of prestige for the mage.  I do wish verant would understand that.  It's a point of pride, even if little else.   Having an extremely situationally useful pet that is at the top would be oodles better than it is now.<br>
<br>
Trods are a blessing and a curse and if you think if you took them away from mages the community would jump for joy you've been licking froglocks for too long.  I'm praying they don't do any more adds to that line and start fortifying our other older areas.<br>
<br>
Change to the rain will happen or we won't use it.  Right now I wouldn't use Maelstrom of electricity unless it fell from the sky and scribed itself into my book while I wasn't looking.<br>

Some people considered MS a joke.  Can you blame VI for not doing that again?  Besides, you can't really create a better spell of the same level than another spell.  Ancients were the best attempt at this.<br>
<br>
Shock of Feiry Blades isn't a new nuke?  And it was conjuration to boot.<br>
<br>
No rains, well even the rain we got afterwards wasn't so great.  I'm fine if they skip an expansion for a rain spell.  I would like some conjuration rains however.<br>
<br>
PBAOE.  I should write a thread on this alone..  In fact I will after I'm done this..<br>
<br>
Focus items were an afterthought and given to all classes eventually.  I'm not happy or unhappy we got them.  It comes out even for me.  Although I can make a casting haste ring whenever I want, I'm out a good ring slot, and have almost no chance of getting dibs on such an item should one drop (because I can summon one.)

Actually we did well for AA.  Check out the other classes if you don't believe me.  I keep on telling people this and they don't listen.  No we didn't get manaburn or lifeburn.  Suxxor.   Yes FB sucks.  Yes some of the elemental forms suck.  The rest by far is good though.  (With the absolute horrid exception of mass group buff)<br>
<br>
At any rate, if you use some of the abilities or not, some of the AA can really change the world around for a mage.<br>

Some real pessimists here.  You keep forgetting to look at everything.  Yes that includes resist rates in luclin, areas that we are good for, or needed for, and heck even items.   Like I said before I hope PoP is half as nice as luclin has been.<br>

T-Rods, as Noonie as shown us numerous times, combined with a partner, will produce unlimited mana. They are the best form of mana regen in the game.

Those who feel it is a burden should look towards their guild or their raid leader.  Any sole caster of a critical support spell is going to be stressed, especially such a high cast rate spell.  Get one or two additional mages, and rods are hardly a burden.  The fault is the structure of the raid, not so much the nature of the spell.  The fact that rods can be consumed so quickly ups the stress level to be sure, but three mages can casually provide all the rods that might ever be needed, and concentrate instead on their primary function as damage dealers.  And with all that mana generated by rods, mages will deal a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
Take your complaints about rodding to your guild officer or raid leader, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Spells/Shock_of_Fiery_Blades.htm">Shock of Fiery Blades</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is so good it's ridiculous.  No, I don't mean its ratio or anything, but it is a fire based conjuration shock.  No tricky LOS issues like a bolt, and we all know fire is a better nuke than magic.  The spell is practically a no-brainer.  When fire nukes are appropriate, which is most of the time, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Spells/Transons_Phantasmal_Protection.htm">Transon's Phantasmal Protection</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is another sweet spell.  A componentless upgrade to the phantasmal armor series with mana regeneration?  Its only fault is that it does not stack with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Protection of the Grove</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and in any case, with hitpoint regeneration now translated into mana regeneration, PotG/PotC is only one and third mana per tick better mana regeneration than TPP.  This is significant.<br>
<br>
The two pet heals, of which I only have TEI, are both significant. Prior to <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Spells/Transons_Elemental_Infusion.htm">Transon's Elemental Infusion</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, the next best pet heal would be the 20th level spell <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Spells/Renew_Summoning.htm">Renew Summoning</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  Comparing the two, TEI heals over two and half times the damage in nearly the same amount of time and is conjuration based?  How is this <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a major upgrade of the spell?<br>
<br>
And no, mages are definitely <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the masters of healing their pets, we never were.  That distinction now clearly belongs to beastlords.<br>
<br>
How long have mages been asking for improved invisibility?  We got <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/Spells/Veil_of_Elements.htm">Veil of Elements</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, which many thought we would <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>never</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> get because of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Call of the Hero</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Focus items</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> were announced as part of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Luclin</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and delivered very late.  They gave cheap and immediate access to all mages to nearly all the good focus effects except mana preservation and extended range.  Many mages still use the summoned items.  For those who respond <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Whoopee!  More crap to summon!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I respond <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Oh boy!  More buffs to cast!  More heals to toss!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Nearly every caster class has their share of stupid boring spell casts in support of the group or the raid.  Suck it up, soldier, and stop complaining.  We do need some kind of drop or auto drop command to be sure.<br>
<br>
The AA abilities are better than many mages are willing to admit.  The archetypes are solid, and benefit mages strongly, and the class skills, while not as good as Ranger or Wizard, are better than most other classes.  I have 80 AA, and I don't regret a single one of them.<br>
<br>
And while the recent batch of pet upgrades in theory benefited all pet owners, in practice, mages benefited far more than other pet classes.  Warders <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>still</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> suck, and necromancers were never as dependent on their pets as we are.  Neutral pets opened up many encounters, making mage + pet the norm, instead of the exception.  The upgrades to the epic and the greater vocarates were significant, and matter much more to mages than the upgrades for necromancers.  For all other pet classes, the improvements had marginal effects.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cyricus:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Chaincast usually means death. Need some kind of aggro reduction spell then...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->You don't actually chain pets, do you?  I do.<br>
<br>
With the new resist rules, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Malosini</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can have a profound effect on resists.  I always pull with this spell soloing.  Encounters vary, but almost always when I chain pets, I can chain cast <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Boots of Bladecaling</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> while the pet is fighting, and still keep the mob on the next pet.  Often, in order to speed things up, I can alternate boots with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wrath of Elements</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Now that I have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Spell Casting Subtlety 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I find I can alternate boots and rains and still chain pets.  I chain cast all day long, pushing aggro as hard as I can, and I never die.<br>
<br>
Aggro management is not difficult for mages, and never has been.  We are usually among the last to get aggro in a group or especially on a raid.  We do not need any more tools for aggro management than we have already been provided with.<br>
<br>
Yes, SoL and post-SoL, we mages did indeed <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;make out like bandits.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  We are back near the top of the heap where we ought to have been before.  We crank out serious damage, as was intended.<br>
<br>
PoP looks to me like it will turn out well enough for mages.  If the new pets are fine, and the damage spells are tweaked a bit, I will have few complaints, which I have enumerated elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I have not felt this good about being a mage since Kunark.<br>

Why reclaim pet if you had a heal<br>
_______________________________________<br>
Why? because reclaiming a pet and casting a new one is infinately more mana efficient then healing a pet. You can heal a pet a little bit, for a large mana cost, or you can reclaim your near-death pet and summon a new one and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> gain mana</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in the process. Hopefully nothing you're trying to solo will kill your pet faster than you can click velious legs. Your pet will be buffless for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
The summed mez will be pretty helpful with improved reclaim I think, assuming there's enough summoned mobs to kill. IRE your pet at like 4% health and mez the mob, summon a new pet and use clicky buffs. You can fight all day in that case.<br>
<br>
______________________________________________<br>
Mend companion? Other classes get this as a regular heal instead of having to put AA's into it...and theres is not a refresh time on it<br>
______________________________________________<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where you're getting this info. My best guess is that you were looking for something negative to say about something, and since that one didn't look particularly great to you, you made something up hoping no one would notice.  As far as I can tell, the only class that gets a pet heal that comes even close is beastlords (unless you want to count a shaman, but those pets aren't even close to comparable).  Necro's don't get any heal spell that good. Their 1000pt pet heal takes 500 of their own health.   <br>
<br>
But that doesn't matter, either. Yes, it's nice to be able to heal a pet you gave weapons and armor to, and buffed up, but just because you CAN give your pet weapons, doesn't mean it's the most efficient way of doing things. Like a few have said, mages aren't the best pet healers. I would have to agree that that is a beastlord's thing now.<br>
<br>
__________________________________________<br>
Mass Group Buff? Im no Shaman..what group buffs<br>
__________________________________________<br>
I totally agree here, weird...<br>
<br>
__________________________________________<br>
Quick Summoning? Nice..but would be better if they also worked on our DD spells<br>
__________________________________________<br>
I'm thinking you need some new tactics. Making a single pet and nuking/healing isn't what works anymore. That was good for level 20-50ish, but it doesn't cut it anymore. I think that yanbun was inferring that the new pets would at least be comparable to epic, so you can feel free to reclaim-cann. Quick summoning helps out tremendously there.<br>
<br>
Not to mention chain summonig.  When you got a mob coming after you, you want to be able to cast a pet as fast as possible so you can regain concentration.<br>
<br>
Yes, it would be nice if it worked on nukes, but it's MUCH more helpful on pets.<br>
___________________________________________<br>
Turn Summoned? Where are the summoned mobs? None right now, so dont say wait for POP<br>
___________________________________________<br>
<br>
Wait for PoP.  If i'm not mistaken, there's a few planes that are element-based, and it stands to reason that there will be a lot of summoned mobs. This also applies to the new charm and mez summoned spells.  If there aren't, then you have a legitamate complaint.<br>
<br>
As for right now, I can agree. Not just that the summoned mobs are scarce to say the least, but if i have a bunch of summoned mobs on me in the hole, the last thing I want to do is fear them to get more.  about the only thing I can see this helping with is getting a chance to gate while in the hole.<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
<br>
Please tell me where and what is good. No one likes there Class AA's. My RL brother (60 Wizard) even talks about how Magicians got screwed on there class AAs. We got hand me downs from other people regular spells or things that we dont use.<br>
_____________________________________________<br>
It's their, but I don't want to talk about grammar (especially since I make a few mistakes here and there myself) but I figured in case you didn't know, now you do.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I agree that we got a few AA skills that, to put nicely, suck, but we can't compare our aa skills to manaburn and DC. Yes, those are nice, but we're not the only ones screwed out of decent class AA skills. Rogues have it just as bad, and i'm sure a few others as well.  DC for druids and necros is borderline worthless, and even the chanter DC is pretty limited.<br>
____________________________________________<br>
Im sorry, you can be a &quot;Verant Poster Boy&quot; but what we got needs to be REVAMPED.<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but not everything we have needs to be revamped. <br>
<br>
And I don't see how raz is a &quot;verant poster boy.&quot; you think because he uses correct grammar and makes his thoughts clear he's a poster-boy? Maybe it's because his view differs from yours. I've never heard raz say that verant is perfect.<br>
<br>
I think instead of trying to find something negative to say about everything, try out different tactics and play the game. Evolve. Mages have improved by leaps and bounds since luclin came out, you're just not seeing it.<br>

<br>
Verant's poster boy? Because he can pass English Class?<br>
<br>
<br>
Every class with a Group Buff gets MGB, except Beastlords (and they want it).<br>
<br>
Sure, we don't get a Manaburn, or an Archery Mastery 3 type AA, but we come out better than most Melees do. IRE is pretty nice. Elemental Forms could use their reset timer brought down. Frenzied Burnout could use a lot of work.<br>
<br>
Does it matter that we got the pet upgrades with Luclin or later? Point is, we GOT them, and increased our pets DPS by alot. The epic pet is a monster, out damaging most melees. We got pet resist changes, and although they screwed up their innate resists, pets now survive much longer (especially in Pvp). <br>
