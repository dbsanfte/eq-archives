I'm definately on the lower echelon of mages at a mere 21, but I've come across something that I definately needed to post.  I saw a post a while ago that I couldn't find again, where someone complained that the Beastlords warders were conning at or near the level of their controller.  Someone replied to that with something to the effect of, &quot;That doesn't mean that your pet won't tear throught their warder while your laughing and enjoying your summoned Ale.&quot;  Unfortunately, I'm very sad to report that, yes it does.  I tested this out twice (far from scientific I know) and I'm proud to report that &quot;%M&quot; won both times.(Both times my pet was 20, and his pet was 21)  But not by the margine that they should have.  My pet report the first time at 19% health after defeating Sparky, and 21% health the next time.  Frankly I'm F&amp;$&amp;%$&amp;%^king pissed about that one folks.  I far more than agree with the other complaints that I hear, and whole heartedly agree that if we're gonna miss out on of the props that the other INT casters get, our pets need to be buffer.  But when a hybrid class gets pets and enough buffs for that pet to nearly take out my pet, Now I'm upset.  And the BL's don't even have to worry about their pets outdamaging them, they Melee's for god sake.  Well, ranting a bit, try the experiment yourself and see if you get the same results.<br>

I would strongly suggest going and playing a beastlord for a while (around 20-30 levels atleast) before tossing out &quot;facts&quot; about a class you know very little about. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As a matter of fact, beastlords have a much worse problem with the pet taking exp bit than any other class... particularly around the time they get new spells.  Also, one of those pet buffs you're talking about is actually just a buff that brings the pet up to apprpriate level.  When the pet is initially summoned, he's nothing but a greenie... and I do mean GREENIE. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117668><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/kimmisc/merlene.jpg border="0"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uthondaman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thon da Man</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 4:07:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tiz a sad day for Mages</span><hr size=1> hehe, beastlord meelee is just duel wield, no double attack if i recall.  so they're like a bard, but just not as useful <p>Thon Tarliser<br>

And considering the choices of armor they can wear, tanking is getting more difficult as Mer gets further up in levels.... hence the exp penalty is becoming a concern.  Playing the role of pet's cleric guarantees an exp penalty when soloing.  Beastlord dots and nukes are quite pathetic.  Their buffs are very minor also, and I won't even get into their heal spells (for players, not the pet heal).<br>
<br>
Not trying to make beastlords look bad.. I enjoy playing mine, but it's not what the fella up there is making them out to be.. not by a long shot. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=117668><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/kimmisc/merlene.jpg border="0"></a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufazzywabbithugger.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Fazzy Wabbithugger</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#333333>(4/9/02 3:12:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=215.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmmm...</span><hr size=1> Here is my opinion...<br>
<br>
Note... I never dueled a beastlords pet soo. this is just an opinion....<br>
<br>
<br>
   From your post i have noted that you are level 21... Level 24 pets are notable upgrade to your present pet as soo they can dual weild. Soo this will give them more damage than the beastlords pet.. Who i believe cannot dual weild ??  <br>
<br>
   After level 24, almost all your spell levels will result in getting BIGGER tougher pet with some nice additions... Either level 29 or 34.. not sure about level.. But your pet is truly becoming amazing...<br>
<br>
  And another thing is that... Certain type of mage pets will be more useful in dueling the Warder than others... 1 pet i think you SHOULD never duel with is....  Earth pet....  Mainly cause he is like a punching bag, and in this case... GETS hit like ALWAYS... lol   Most useful pet in my opinion would be the Water or Air pet....<br>

I know I'm getting myself into a mess by posting this, but being a former 55 Mage in one of my many past lifes I hope I garner a little respect.  1% if any is good.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyhow, I would like to set the record straight...<br>
<br>
1) Yes our pets are not half bad.  More often than not our 60 pet can take out a necro's pet and is an even match for the Greater Voceration pets WITHOUT DS.  With DS the mage pet owns and frankly, with DS is the only way to measure it as I will certainly buff out my pet with all I have.  Then there is the epic pet... no contest there.  <br>
<br>
2) We can melee worth a flip, dare I say as well as a Pally/SK.  Especially at level 60 and with epics like myself.  Anytime I melee I have 80% haste on myself.  I cast my own haste on myself and then my epic has a 40% haste on it.  I think it can be argued that that alone makes up for no double attack.  I sport 1005 unbuffed AC at the moment which is a work in progress.  We have an innate AC bonus (making our AC more like the chain class -- ie. I get roughly 50% more AC than what is stated per item... my AC 28 BP actually renders me about 48 AC when I put it on) so as my guild starts to score some of the nicer ToV armors (Iki's Ancient Hide comes to mind) it will go up and go up dramatically.  One BST over on eqbeastlord already can get 1300AC raid buffed and 5000+ hp's.  I break 1100 AC raid buffed and have about 4300 hps.  Belive when I say we can melee, melee well, and can even tank pretty easy for XP groups.  <br>
<br>
Know those spiders and statues in velks?  I can solo them with just my own buffs and NO pet.  I can even solo the hunters though I end up with 20% health left.  Being a melee that can slow mobs has its benefits.  <br>
<br>
3) High end game... hmm... we could use a little twinking there but not much to be honest.  Perhaps if we had just one more spell that was beneficial to raids. Otherwise, I'm rather happy with our high-end output already, it was unclear at first what good a BST can do, but not now.  The MT always makes sure I am ready with Savagery on all our high-end encounters... getting a buff that adds +100 to ATK and STA (giving him ~300 more hps) and +50 to ALL resists is major.  Spiritual Purity (mana/health regen group buff) has also become a popular buff to be asked for, even by our enchanters.  Then as I stated above, without our pet we can contribute to a raid just fine by melee alone.  Just like a mage can contribute without pet by nuking.  <br>
<br>
Please dont take this as a mage vs bst type of post.  I respect mages and have no beef with any of you unless you make a blanket statement that just isn't true.  This post was made to inform those here just what the BST is about and can do.  Again, I have been there, I was a mage at one time and actually visited here pretty often but that was over a year ago and another time and name.  I went from mage to warrior as I just had to be in the mob's face hehe.  When BST came out I was there, I couldn't pass-up on what was billed as a melee class that could have a good pet (which is why I was a mage... love the pets).<br>

One thing you have to take into account is BL have the pet and there melee dmg...there melee isn't that hot as its only Dual Wield.<br>
We have a Dual Wield Double attack bash kick pet for alot of dmg, where we dont have the melee aspect we have the Nukes, which are powerfull enough to do quite nice dmg<br>
<br>
So we match a BL in different ways <p><center>View my Equip</center>
