Dissertation person...I just don't have the time to do the same. In fact I pretty much just scanned after pets vs war as tanks LOL. When a group shouts out for a tank, do you really think they want a pet? /chuckle <br>
Wake up dude, you got @#%$. Like most sheeple you don't seem to have a problem with it, but some of us would like to see a real change.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I have enough hours racked to have an EXTENDED bitch session if I choose to. No one made you read it. So you can take your insulting tone elsewhere lest I decide to devote a little time to illustrating how poor and poorly made your &quot;points&quot; are.<br>
<br>
Wisbus...LMFAO  &quot;That Immlazen and Dumo...&quot; wuahaha<br>
(pictures lil old lady shaking fist)<br>
<br>
You know Immy and I have played on tunare for a long time and are old friends, why do you think I bothered reading this post to begin with. <br>
I'm still smiling thinking about you posting that. <br>
(That damn Dumo and his cronies...) heheheh<br>
I am genuinely laughing out loud.<br>
<br>
Ok, this is starting to take way too much time so in summary:<br>
<br>
Mages got @#%$.<br>
Immy and I are old friends.<br>
Wisbus, you make me laugh.<br>
Time on his hands person also makes me laugh, but not out loud. Also I think maybe you are sheeple.<br>

<br>
As for the yes it works, you put points into it, the button pops. etc...<br>
<br>
Nice try at sarcasm, but that was not the question and you know it. You also didn't say if you were happy with the 700 extra damage it does now, just that most aren't. <br>
<br>
I know I am not near happy for a skill that takes 23 aaxp points to get for 700 damage. <br>
<br>
As for Goladus you asked who the &amp;^%( cares how long it took to fix it.)<br>
<br>
I care, and so should you. The reson is obvious, when Muzzle was added with Kunark, it did nothing for the magician's pet. Some people spent 1000's and 1000's of plat on it, for no benifit.<br>
<br>
Than Velious came out with Burnout 4, and 1000's more play spent on it by many a magician, again for no benifit at all.<br>
<br>
They have a right to be mad as hell, over spells put into the game for YEARS that did absolutely nothing to help them.<br>
<br>
Your attitude well it is fixed now, is wrong. Again magician's are pointing out Frenzied Burnout is not working, has not worked since day one as advertised.<br>
<br>
Yes you can put the points into it. Get the pop-up key, and press it, but NOTHING happened as it should.<br>
<br>
With the pet haste cap now upped (maybe not removed), it adds 700 whole extra damage. So magician's are pointing it out. In my opinon if not for Cyrcius and his excellent posts and logs, we may not ever have seen the haste cap issued addressed.<br>
<br>
So people should NEVER stop posting about things broken, because that is the only way they will get fixed. Otherwise, they may never know.<br>
<br>
If you remember correctly, <br>
<br>
Spells are dropping in Kunark on release. Took MONTHS before that was fixed.<br>
<br>
Shaman Alcamey: Years to fix.<br>
<br>
Pet haste cap since Kunark: years to fix.<br>
<br>
Mage pets duel wield: remember when were promised a demonstraion to show this? Than an abrupt, your right it isn't working and was fixed.<br>
<br>
Just 4 examples and there are more as you know, where if the players remained quiet, they would not have ever been fixed, because Verant didn't know they weren't working as intended.<br>
<br>
People have to talk about what they see is wrong, others will post to concur or deny it. The discussion goes on. Verant investigates, and at times (not always), finds that we are right and changes come.<br>

me and Rthen did parses of muzzle some time ago, these were rough versus COMBAT mobs, not sitting still ones for precision over time, so errors would be bound to happen, however...<br>
<br>
My parses showed about +18.9% damage. I didnt care about haste i was looking for actual melee DAMAGE changes (since who really knrew the effect for *sure*?), Rthen got 20-25%.<br>
<br>
Were our parses so much in error?<br>
Or was something chnaged in the past year or so that altered pet haste?<br>
*shrugs*<br>

I agree now. Magicians are whiners.<br>
<br>
Proof read the board.<br>
<br>
On our last Vindi fight i did over 20K on nuke damage.<br>
Show me any wiz that can do this without being lucky.<br>
I did not even have SCF then. So now with SCF 2 it will be even more. And this does not account the pet damage as well.<br>
<br>
So you all better stop whining and just go and enjoy this great class or make a war and feel the boardom of doing one thing HIT BUTTON A.<br>

I didn't flat out ask if you were happy with 700 extra damage. The question though was implied.<br>
<br>
So a formal question.<br>
<br>
Are you satisfied with the 700 extra damage that frenzied burnout is reportidly doing?<br>
<br>
Do you think it should be more? If YES what damage do you want to see it add over those 36 seconds?<br>
<br>
If the answer is NO. Than why are you happy with an aaxp skill that takes so much leveling to do for less than one nuke gain in damage?<br>
<br>
Please post a number, you would like to see Frenzied Burnout add up to over that 36 seconds, if your not satisfied with what it is doing now.<br>
<br>
Take into account (as I did) procs and melee to hit a number that Frenzied Burnout should do in total damage over those 36 seconds. <br>
<br>
My answer is 3500-4000 (or more total damage output by my pet in that 36 seconds). What damage numbers do you see it doing?<br>
<br>
I also ask that of all who read this. What damage do you want your pet to do under frenzied burnout in those 36 seconds.<br>
<br>
Total real damage, without any resists etc.. So if the pet starts with 0 damage on a mob. Goes into action andFrenzied lands on the pet, the pet should do how much damage in yur opinoin to make it a skill you would actively pursue as a goal.<br>
<br>
Mine is stated above. 3500-4000 or more.<br>
<br>
What is yours. Be realistic in your numbers. Maybe if we get a consensus, we can broach Verant with that number in mind.<br>

Far ahead of Manaburn most of the time (usefull for more encounters). But it shoudnt unbalancing the game when it comes to what can be killed. It would just be a very good skill.<br>
<br>
Notice that the logs of FB has only included basic melee, not the increased procs or backstabs if using GVW.<br>
<br>
One thing I think should be changed with the skill is that it shouldnt overwrite burnout buffs. The haste doesnt have to stack, it just shouldnt be any need to rebuff afterwards.<br>
<br>
Fixing flurry to work better would also go a long way towards making FB better.<br>

The reason I wouldnt think this would be overpowering is DC lasts until the person zones/dies.  Manaburn can be reused as long as a source of mana is provided.  Now some may say it is overpowering, so what, I should have something that gives me the strongest baddest pet in the raid.<br>
<br>
Now, as far as the proposal i think the pet should do about 6-8k of total damage within 3 minutes with a reuse time of 30 minutes.  Just what i would like to see.<br>

Now you make me confused. What diffrence would a source of mana do for the reuse time of the skill? You dont even have to sit down to regen the mana between repops of the skill. <br>
