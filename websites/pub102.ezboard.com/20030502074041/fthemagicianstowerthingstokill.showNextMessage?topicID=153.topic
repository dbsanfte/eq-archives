Deep Kedge</span><hr size=1> I recently went on my first forray deep into Kedge. We had 2 groups of level 50-ish and one group of lvl43-50. We got all the way to Patriarch's Room and were pulling seahorses from Phinigel's room. No deaths! Which was great, but we were lacking the ability to clear all those seahorses in 18 minutes so we could get to Phinigel. We had a high level Enchanter actually doing the pulling. No monks available. I was kind of led to believe that with 3 groups I should have been able to get to Phinigel, but ... well we missed it by *that* much... <br>
<br>
We got 2 seahorses once and the enchanter went LD. The damn things kept CHealing and it was a real pain, but we got<br>
them. I guess my main question is...<br>
<br>
How do we clear Phin's room fast enough to get to him? I've read Phreekitty's Kedge guide and it says you have 18 minutes to kill all the seahorses and get to Phin. With that double pull in there we had a hard time just clearing the outer 4 in 18 minutes and hadn't touched the guardians. (Maybe we did get guardians.... are the Guardians the only ones that summon? Or do the Swirlspines summon as well?)<br>
<br>
Anyways... I'd like to get enough experience at this that we can do it not only for ourselves but also as guides to take others in there and help them get THEIR fun out of Kedge. So I'm looking for experienced folks to offer up some suggestions on how I can improve the performance of my guild in this zone. Techniques or tricks for getting to Phin and pulling that room.... essential group makeup (I know that varies a bit). Anything you got that I can use for information I'll be most grateful for...<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

There are 16 players in Kedge Keep.<br>
<br>
No chanter, no monk, not even a warrior.  I think we got lucky tho.<br>
<br>
The key to the pull is sitting.  The 4 top swirls will come single if you sit and sink off the ledge above them.  If they cast from their spawn point more than one come.  Sitting makes them run to you instead of casting.<br>
<br>
Once all 4 are dead, 0-4 of the lower guardians will be up(they spawn when you kill the upper ones).  Have your puller swim out into the middle and sit and look down(with ultravis on).  Once you see Phinny casting stand up and swim straight up.  If you are lucky, he will come alone.  If not....well, you need a very high level enchanter to split them or if it is one guard and phinny you can try to split them up by dragging one into the next room and just keeping it busy.  Phinny can be taken down with one group if he is alone.<br>
<br>
An alternate plan is to send in a tank to lead the top guards to the back of the upper lair, then just go get Phinny with a different tank.  Since the bottom guards don't spawn till you kill the top ones, no lower guards will be there(unless someone has been messing with them since a patch).  Now the tank who led the 4 siwrls off will just need to take a death for the team if you don't have CoTH.<br>
<br>
If you have a monk or an SK, you can try to FD split the Phinny pull(use the sit technique for the top 4).  Maybe have a chain puller near the wall to filter it off, but you will not have a lot of time since you have to do all this in 18 mins.  In order to kill 8 swirls in 18 mins you basically have to bring an army AND have an insanely good high level monk.<br>
<br>
PS  Kedge is a blast and the above raid was me helping out a group that was trying to get him.  I was in there duoing with a bard and they had been wiped out.  It was their first time in kedge and their first guild raid too!  The log of this raid is at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.rpgraid.com/logs/kedge.txt">www.rpgraid.com/logs/kedge.txt</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
It makes an interesting read, kinda confusing tho.  It starts with Me and Persecutis(my brother) helpin them to get their corpses and regroup. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uperilbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Perilbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/01 9:42:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kedge tips please...

<br>
Wow... I read that log. Excellent reference. Can you describe to me in some detail where this safe spot is in Phinny's Room? I understand that you sort of inch along the edge and get real careful about not venturing into the room.<br>
Also... about how long after you kill a Swirlspine from the top ring before a Guardian spawns? Guardian spawn almost as soon as the Swirlspine dies? And are the Guardians actually positioned BELOW Phinigel? That deal about sinking down from straight above Phinny is VERY interesting. Sounds also like when you pull the swirlspines you have the puller like just sliding over the ledge and sinking while sitting as he's lined up straight out from a star point with a swirl in it. Am I getting that right?<br>
<br>
There's so much here I feel we should have been able to get to him with the groups we had. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Lots of new stuff to try and getting to a sfe spot inside Phin's room is something I hadn't even thought to try. <br>
<br>
Thanks much <br>

Deep Kedge</span><hr size=1> The safe spot is the multicolored ledge just before his lair.<br>
<br>
Think of his lair as a 2 story building and you come into it about 10 feet above the 2nd floor.  The floor of the 2nd floor has a massive star cut away from the floor.  There is a swirl at each point of the star.  There is a 50%(?) chance that a swirlspine guardian will spawn along the walls of the 1st &quot;floor&quot;  about 20 feet down each time a swirl is killed.<br>
<br>
Phinny is at the bottom in the middle and his aggro radius is pretty large.  I am not a tank so I don't know exactly how to get them out of his hole without pissing him off.  Probably standard monk stuff tho they are all casters.<br>
<br>
I think we just got lucky and out fo 5 swirlspine kills, only one guardian spawned below.  When Phinny came out, he was alone and we whacked him easy.  Only death was a drowning, well the cleric died on the previous swirl pull.<br>
<br>
Definately one of my best memories in the game.  These people had never even been on a multi group raid and never stepped inside Kedge before.  Was great fun goin in against all odds and coming out on top.  Made alot of friends that day.  No robe no staff tho. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uglenfinen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Glenfinen</A> at: 2/12/01 4:21:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucherriedawnblaze.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cherrie Dawnblaze</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://pages.infinit.net/blackx/cherry01.jpg BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/01 11:48:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=150.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://pages.infinit.net/blackx/cherrie02.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kedge tips please...

Deep Kedge</span><hr size=1> We cleared Phinny 2 times this weekend.  First time we had 3 groups, second time we had 2.  All groups had anywhere from lvls 45 - 55 ppl in them.  We had one healer type and one warrior in each group.  We would end up pullin all the seahorses at once.  Put a tank type on each horse (so they can't CH each other) and beat the crap outta them.  They are totally MR (except to fire based spells) and can't be mezzed.  We would kill them all in about 5 - 8 min.  Med for about 2 min then pull Phinny and his guardians (Had 4 guardians one time).  They are easy to mez.  Just tell the ench to take his/her time and mez them one at a time (if he/she AE mezes them, then they will break at the same time and you can forget about mezzin them again).  While the ench is at work mezzing, everyone attack phinny.  He is real easy to kill.  Another way u can do it, is to get a lvl 56+ mage or wiz and sit at zone.  Have that person cast the eye (the one that is invisible upon casting, forgot the name) and take it down to phinnys liar.  He is pretty much the only thing that can see through invis in this dungeon (not counting the other rares).  Once phinny sees the eye, he will attack it, kill it, and come to the zone for the master.  Since the master is a high lvl, it will only be him that comes.  I have never done this, but have read posts where others have.  Hope this helps<br>
