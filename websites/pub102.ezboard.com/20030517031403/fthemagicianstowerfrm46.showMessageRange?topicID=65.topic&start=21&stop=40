<br>
summoning an epic and fully equiping the pet 3.8 hp/mana ratio thats if all spec checks fail and no focus gear for mana pres. <br>
so with summoning efficiency 3 and spec conjuration maxed and scm3 (assuming it still works) <br>
the epic pet is at 340 mana or so. <br>
set of plate mail down around 225 mana. <br>
muzzle at 80 mana <br>
burnout 150 <br>
<br>
total mana 795 <br>
still assuming 4k hp. <br>
now were around 5hp/mana spent. <br>
<br>
chain casting gvoc earth. spec'd conj/scm3/ summoning efficiency 3: no thurg/ss/kael robe or pants<br>
pet 275<br>
burnout 4/5 =150<br>
<br>
for a total cost of 425 mana<br>
<br>
gvoc earth weighs in around 3500 hp. <br>
for a hp to mana ratio of 8.25 <br>
<br>
now tell me how asking for a 3.25 ratio heal is close to asking for it to be anywhere near as efficient as chain casting. you cant tell me that plate and muzzle of mardu doubles the pets effective hp. <br>
tests of gvoc earth against lvl 44ish gnolls in jaggedpine. with out plate pet walks out of fight with 2 bubs of health left. with plate he walks out with around 3. roughly an increase of 33% against melee weak opponents. muzzle of mardu is 11 % haste. <br>
<br>
in fungus grove against shrooms the plate makes means that gvoc earth will survive a solo fight against a shroom where as no plate and the shroom is turning to run as soon as the pet dies. ( no nuking used till end of fight). <br>
tougher oppenent only 15 to 20% increase in pet power from plate. <br>
<br>
sending only the pet against lvl 57 giants in kael, summoned plate results in the pet lasting about 3 seconds longer. or a who cares increase in pet power. <br>
<br>
so if i dont nuke a shroom and i summon him plate and muzzle:<br>
if i use the current 52 pet heal i'll spend 1375 mana healing the pet. if i just summon a new pet muzzle and plate. i'll use 900 or so mana ( minus whatever little i'll get back reclaiming the pet). <br>
if i had just chain cast pets at the shroom with no muzzle or plate i'd have spent 425 mana or so. since the second pet walks out at nearly full health. <br>
<br>
now requesting a 3.25 ratio heal as the lvl 52 60 and 65 heals ( no lvl 65 heal planned so far) hte lvl 52 heal would wind up healing 893 hp. or 25% of gvoc earth. so 3 heals would add ~2700 hp. at a cost of 825 mana still far less efficient than chain casting pets. however it does come close to summoning a completely new pet and all of its gear.<br>
<br>
Now given that chain casting has some drawbacks. you having to time the casts and type /pet back off, possibly get summoned if timed incorrectly, pet takes a couple of seconds to reestablish agro ( ooooooo dificult) and healing the pet does not ( other than currently being rediculously mana inefficient) i think the 2x better ratio for chain casting vs a 3.25 ratio heal is justified. however the current 4x better ratio of chaining is unwarrented. <br>
<br>
recommended modifications to current spells<br>
52 heal 275 mana for 800 hp. 2.9 ratio<br>
60 heal 400 mana for 1250 hp. 3.1 ratio<br>
recommended added spells<br>
65 heal 550 mana for 1800 hp. 3.27 ratio 12 sec cast 12 sec recast.<br>
a pet only celestial elixer would work also i guess.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
quote and answer time<br>
sirrilen: Keeping one pet also means you don't get summoned, which again is huge for bigger mobs.<br>
Answer: currently you get a 4x better ratio for assuming that risk. <br>
<br>
sirrillen: Say pets are 3 times as strong roughly when fully buffed. If you have have to chain cast 7 pets the first one is very effective and the others are trash. (Even if you somehow chain casted the epic, it would pop without it's damage shield.) <br>
Answer: id put it closer to 2x vs a completely unbuffed pet. even chain casting i still cast burnout and sometimes ds the pet. plate and muzzle would add an additional 20-30% effectiveness over not having them. <br>
<br>
sirrillen: So don't argue it on the merit that is supposed to be &quot;exactly the same as summoning and buffing a new pet.&quot; Its not.<br>
Answer: i didnt argue it that it would be exactly the same as summoning and rebuffing the pet in fact i still beleive that it should cost more. however it should be close. to comepletely heal an epic pet from 1hp will take<br>
7 casts of the 52 heal in its current form. that equals 1925 mana no spec/focus to completely resummon an epic and gear it up takes 1050 mana. using the 60 heal its 1600 mana and you wait a little while the pet regens the last 400ish hp.<br>
<br>
<br>
Raz :If the purpose of the heal is to save your pet from death, then in order to be better at saving your pet than a nuke, it has be be a near-substitute for mend companion or complete heal<br>
Answer: why does it have to be a complete heal to save my pet from death a 25% (1000ish hp for epic) or 50% ( 2000ish for epic) heal would equally save my pet. and not infring on other others domains. i dont want a complete heal ( well not true) but i'd be happy with a decent powerfull heal in the 1500-1800 hp range at 65. or at the very least a dowtime reducer that approaches destroying and resummoning/equipping a nearly dead pet. sitting for 10 minutes while my pet heals or because i blew half of my mana healing it is annoying.<br>
<br>
sirrllen and raz: (paraphrased) big pet heals will devalue mend companion<br>
Answer: call me strange but a manaless instant 3000 hp heal is never useless. especially to a pet cleric. <br>
<br>
One last proposal if /pet sit down tripled the pets regen rate all of this would be pretty moot. since verant is probably reluctant to give us a good combat heal and the chain summoning folks dont seem to want anything other than chainsummoning to be efficient. <br>
<br>
ps. if a spell requires the use of a star ruby to cast it wont be used. as a wizard when the last time he disintegrated anything was and that only requires an opal. <br>
<br>
<br>
Tezron<br>
<br>
notice i didnt compare us to bsts or necro's in this comparison. bsts cant chain pets. and necro's pets cost peridot so they dont get chained. none of thier pets have hp approaching gvoc earth or the epic. thus they need better heals to keep them alive. <br>

<br>
By factoring HP out of my model, leaving only DPS and seconds, then barring aggro, a nuke was always better than a heal.  If that was the case, then the only point of a heal is to save the pet from death, and the existing heals do not accomplish that.  Hence, I concluded, mistakenly, that only a near substitute for CH/mend would make a significant difference.<br>
<br>
However, a CH/mend substitute would also be much better than chaining, which would then become obsolete, which is why I proposed a strong limit on it.<br>
<br>
But the simple model is only correct for fights where the pet lives long enough to allow the spells to be cast to close the second gap.<br>
<br>
I am going back to the drawing board, and revising the model to include both mob and pet hitpoints, and not just DPS and see what the consequences are for mid-range pet heals.<br>
<br>
I can tell you this.  Improving the mana ratios on the 50+ pet heals will modestly increase the range of mobs against which sustaining pets is an option, and modestly reduce down time.  Neither will break the game, and both would certainly help those who wish to sustain pets.<br>
<br>
For me, the fire line are cheap substitutes for complete heal.  These would dramaticly increase the power of magicians, eliminate chaining as a viable alternative while conferring all the advantages of chaining to sustaining with no drawbacks, and would allow mages to solo near as well as a cleric/mage duo.  I do not think the mage class is so bad off that it needs such drastic medicine.<br>
<br>
The question remains in my mind, how good a medium heal is reasonable.<br>

<br>
what it boils down to is do we nuke (sirroco is 1800 hp for 400 mana) or heal. 1500 hot for 400 mana. <br>
neither should approach the efficiency of chainsummoning. and neither do.  <br>
<br>
and who's to say that the lvl 52 and 60 heals are balanced properly at this point. since verant decided to basically to shelf caster balancing in order to get PoP out for christmas.<br>

Redo Mend Companion to a one hour refresh and have Hasten Mend reduce time on top of this by 20% / 40% / 60% (instead of the current 10/20/30) and you don't even need a spell.<br>
<br>
My problem with a spell as opposed to an AA is that with current (and upcoming PoP) AA/FT/KEI mana just isn't meaningful anymore. Give me any spell at all and unless its ridiculously expensive ( and I mean 1000 mana or so) then you can cast it all day long. I spam Transons at will now and don't notice the mana cost. MC3 + KEI + Transons + FT3 and your regening the cost of the heal in 60-90 seconds.<br>
<br>
Problem with a 1600-2000 point heal, be it HoT or normal, is that epic mages would become retardedly overpowered. Even non-epic mages wouldn't be far behind. Redoing Mend Companion would keep some form of cap on the situation via its refresh rate whilst still allowing us to either save our pets in extremis or refresh their HP every so often. <p><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com/profile.php?username=Zaniel&charactername=Zaniel>Zaniel Stormseeker</a><br><a href=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>60th Arch Mage</a><br><a href=http://www.afflictionguild.com>Affliction</a><br><SELECT>

I have Quick Summoning 2, Ring of Lightning, SCM2, Enshrouded Veil. That allows me to summon a pet in 5secs. So basically it comes down to I can summon a 3300hp GV Earth pet in 5secs for around 290m or I can heal a GV Earth pet that is at 20% health for 527hp at a cost of 230ish with ODS and spec/SCM2. Either way making a new pet makes the most since. You can do it almost as fast as healing the pet and you get a pet that is fully healed. <br>
<br>
Now yes you can buff your pet with armor ect...BUT Thurg greaves/robe are common. One group or less can do the Arena in Kael. Those items combined with chain casting pets make for good experience.  Healing IMO is only a real issue for mages that have the epic pet. We have no real way of healing this pet in a good fashion. That is why I suggested a heal over time spell. It would allow for good down time healing and a little bit of healing during combat. Then again if you need to heal your pet during combat you are doing something wrong. Fight easier mobs or chain cast.  Healing is only a issue for the epic pet since it can not be chain cast. I have figured out ways to overcome that also.<br>
<br>
A new heal is needed. A Complete Heal or 2k+ heal is not needed. The mage class is about destroying not healing. I think since we have a line of regen spells that a regen heal is more inline with the class then a direct heal. <br>

a mob that doubles for 250 every 3 seconds. will be doing 166 dps. how long is your pet going to last against such a mob? <br>
about 24 seconds. now a 300 hp per tick HOT heals 50 dps. <br>
making the above mob's dps now 116. now that pet will survive 35 seconds. <br>
<br>
now lets talk about <br>
using your mana regen numbers sitting on a horse ( for always med) using mc3 (3)kei(17) ft3(3) and transons(3) 26 from spells and another 24 or so from sitting.  your regenning around 50 mana per tick total.  thats 5 ticks to regen elemental infusion at 250 per cast.  you are healing 17.5 hp/sec doing nothing but casting transon's as soon as you regen the mana. <br>
<br>
now lets look at summoning new pets. at 300 mana per pet. its 6 ticks for a new pet. or 36 seconds. converting gvoc earths hp's to mana you are summoing 97 hp/second chaincasting pets as soon as the mana is available. <br>
<br>
so what do these numbers tell us. that a mage with kei ft3 mc3 transons sitting on a horse can infinitly tank any mob that doubles for 78 or less every 3 seconds. but a mage that is healing thier pet can only heal a pet infinitly if the monster doubles for 27 or less every 3 seconds. or 3 times more efficient to summon a new pet vs healing the old one with current spells. in an infiite senario. <br>
now lets consider a 300 hp per tick hot at around 350 mana. <br>
7 ticks to regen the mana. that would move our sustained tanking to a mob that doubles for 54 every 3 seconds. <br>
<br>
this is an infinite senario assuming the mob has unlimited hp and never dies and your pet and you never should lose any hp or mana. <br>

lets try closer to reality senario. say a 150 max quadding mob every 4 seconds. lets say its average hit on the pet is 120 and 3 of 4 swings land. this puts the mob at 90 dps. and lets give that mob 8000 hp. and say the epic pet fully buffed puts out 60 dps and has 4000 hp. and that the mob does not regen or heal itself.<br>
<br>
 it will take the epic pet 133 seconds or 22 ticks to kill this mob. <br>
the mob will have done 12000 dmg to the pet. if you sustain the epic pet on this mob you will have to cast a 1500 4tick hot 6 times fo 2100 mana. you will also have had to cast 4 infusions since the pet would die 100 seconds into the fight without them for an additional 920 mana .  you will have regened 1100 mana ( assuming all the same buffs/aa's) during this fight for a net loss of 2000m. your downtime will be 4 minutes after this fight to recover your mana + whatever time it takes for your pet to heal . <br>
<br>
now lets look at chain casting pets. in the same senario. <br>
for the sake of this test we will assume you are not bothering to buff the pet at all and just sending them to thier death. <br>
lets give gvoc earth 25dps unbuffed so we are looking at 320 seconds (54 ticks) to kill the same mob. the mob will put out 29000 damage during this time. you will need to cast 8 additional pets to kill it, one every 35 seconds. for a total expenditure of 2560 mana during this time you will have regened 2700 mana with the same buffs. for a net gain of 140 mana. your downtime 0 minutes. <br>
<br>
now lets add burnout 3 as a right click on the pants and convert gvoc earth to 38 dps. now the fight lasts 210 seconds (35 ticks). the mob did 19000 damage. you need 5 additional pets. mana expenditure 1600. mana gained 1750. net gain 150 mana. <br>
<br>
ok now lets try healing gvoc earth with the 1500 hp hot. <br>
it will still take 210 seconds to kill the mob. 87 seconds into fight gvoc earth would die without infusion to back this up. <br>
9 casts of hot 13500 hp for 3150 mana<br>
4 casts of infusion.  2320 hp for 920 mana<br>
total mana expenditure 4070 mana<br>
total mana regened 1750<br>
net loss 2320 mana<br>
5 minutes of med time after this fight. <br>
<br>
trying this with just gvoc earth and infusion<br>
required to kill monster = 210 seconds. <br>
required 28 casts of infusion = 6440m <br>
required cast time per infusion = 7.5 seconds. <br>

<br>
what does this mean? <br>
i have no idea. nuking with sirocco+the pet heal is more efficient than chain petting against this particular mob senario. against mobs with more hp or higher resists. chain petting is more effective. at no time is healing the pet alone more effective than any other method. <br>
<br>
how about just making /pet sit increase the regen of the 57 + pets to 90 hp per tick. so a pretty banged up epic only takes 4 minutes to regen back to full. leave the standing hp of the pets where it is. or the 1500 hp hot added anyway since it doesnt appear to really affect power one way or another. increasing the efficiency of our heals will bascially only cut downtime in this senario it will make us stronger against lower hp mobs that dont hurt the pet much ( ie farming) and will cut downtime while waiting for the pet to heal on harder mobs for those of us that like to keep the pet around for a while. <br>

The truth is, pet heals are awesome. This means as long as you have mana, any mob that have a DPS lower than 85 wont kill your epic pet. You mana will probaly last for like 1.5 mins too depending on you mana pool.<br>
A L54 warrior snake is Ssra have a DPS of about 95 (hit for around 230), pet have a DPS of 60 (proces included) against that snake, DS probaly add an other 40.<br>
Normaly a fight against these snakes end me at 40% mana, pet at 50%-60%, I have around 4k mana. <br>
<br>
This is real numbers.Ofcourse the exp aint worth it since they kinda undercon. <br>
But the point is, this is a snake that I promise will basicly wipe out any melee you can find in like a min and the snake would probaly have 80% health left. I doubt you could chain a pet aginst it, half the dmg come from the DS, one lucky round from the snake would drop an earth pet like 25-30% in one round, basicly you would have to recast you pet a sec after pet spawned. If the mob not rooted either you are dead, snakes in Ssra move at like 2x bard speed with bugged pathing so they warp around.<br>
<br>
Chaining is usefull aginst mobs that just double for max 140 or so, after that it aint worth the risk.<br>
This will become even more true in PoP, then you level up you simply can continue to kill L45-L50 mobs anymore, then you L62 these mobs will be even more lousy exp than now, even the Sunrevs in The grey will only give like 60% of the exp they give then you L60. <br>
Basicly if you want to get decent exp then you are L62+ you must kill L50+ mobs and chaining wont be a working trick anymore, these mobs simply deal to much dmg to make it worth it.<br>
<br>
We NEED new pet heals, there is no doubt about that, the L52+L60 pet heal combo can abut keep up with mobs up to L55 today, this won't be a good enought in PoP.<br>
<br>
There also the class envy issues, if the two other major petclasses get huge upgrades to their pet heals (both clost to 100% upgrade) I see no reason why mages should get those upgrades too.<br>

<br>
Im sitting here with a fellow Eq'er from different server that works with me and he cannot stop laughing about how Magicians dont want a heal to help there on class.  We were just called the only suicidal class in EQ, where we find ways to kill ourselves.<br>
<br>
Now this is coming from someone with a Warrior and Necro.  Do you think that Necros would tell each other &quot;no, I dont want a heal,,,what would others think&quot;.  That is pretty much how some of you think.<br>
<br>
Now moving on, why not a better pet heal?  We get them at low levels.  Why not a higher level pet heal?  Some give the reason that we can chaincast.  So.  Wake up.  You think a Necro couldnt chain cast.  It takes Necros 15 sec to cast a pet using bone chips (2sp).  Wow, a whooping 5 sec longer.  Oh and they get some of the same AA's we get.  So they technically can Chaincast.  But does that stop them from getting a upgraded Pet heal?  No.<br>
<br>
So why do some feel chaincasting should be the main reason Magicians do not get a upgraded heal.  Dont let chaincasting Ego's spoil you.  Here is a quote from a Enchanter on the necro board.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
anyway mage is good for CoH and AE groups. though <br>
id rather have all wiz for dmg. other than that if mages think their pets are so <br>
great then they can just solo and die.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
We are shooting ourselves in the foot by not getting/fighting for upgrades to outdated spells.  A well written proposal should be given to Verant.  And yes, I did send a statement to Verant with figures, so Im trying to do my part.<br>

To my mind then, the question then becomes to make sure that a new heal serves a useful purpose without being better than chaining, which is a powerful techinique.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Why it bothers me is because it is damn elitist. As long as ANY IDEA doesn't encrounch on their idea of the ways things should be done is exceptable, but never even consider another viable option.<br>
<br>
We have one very effiecent technique. Chain casting pets, and those that do it and like it, DO NOT want a second option because they Don't THINK YOU NEED IT.<br>
<br>
So very nice of them to TELL the rest of us what we do and do not need. <br>
<br>
Thank you but I disagee with people with those attitudes.<br>
<br>
One other posted saying they chain cast pets, and because of it nothing needs changed, to paraphrase them.<br>
<br>
Well if we got a new heal or a heal over time, that made substaing an existing pet almost as viable or as viable to chain casting a new pet does it hurt you at all? Maybe yes in now you may heal and not chain a pet. WOW you changed play styles, but you are NOT forced to as chaining was not touched and is as viable.<br>
<br>
Remember all the heal spells talked about are not complete heals, and take more mana than creating a new pet with even more hit points. It just leaves anything you lavished on your pets intact.<br>
<br>
We are a pet class, if we want them as dispoable fodder, chain them, then with elemental pack, you can chain and be full mana damn fast when the mob is dead.<br>
<br>
If you lavish items on a pet, and chain heal them. your pet lives, but you WON'T reclaim it, to chain a new pet to goto full mana. Nope you will regen it medding, taking longer.<br>
<br>
So a draw back in that reguard.<br>
<br>
AGAIN:<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
To my mind then, the question then becomes to make sure that a new heal serves a useful purpose without being better than chaining<br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Thank you again for posting this, as it shows the real reason your opposed to a viable heal. It is not ballance it is because you like your play style and that is how you want it to stay.<br>
<br>
THE REAL REASON some people are against a better heal. They  feel threatened that their game play style they advocate may not be the best one any longer, of course they forget it takes NOTHING ZERO NADA away from them at all, it just gives EVERYONE more options, and ways of defeating a mob. <br>
<br>
Also chaining pets/healing pets is a thing you only do if no melee in your group. As soon as a melee, your pet takes almost no damage as we all know. <br>

<br>
There is NO valid reason why a pet heal should not be better then chaining, other then some mages not wanting to lose the 'powerful technique' (aka gimmick) they like to use if they don't have an epic.  A good pet heal would accomplish the same ends and does not 'disallow' you from continuing chaining non-epic pets if you wish. I take pride in sustaining my pets; why should I be restricted because you do not?<br>
<br>
I would like to see the 'proof' that is so often demanded that we shouldn't be allowed to heal almost as efficiently as we can chain.<br>

You are against Root, you are against heals, you are against anything that will improve a Magician.  What are you?  Anti-Mage.<br>
<br>
What heals will overpower us?  If a Necro can get a 1000 Heal for 125 Mana, and it takes 4.5 sec to cast...wouldnt that overpower a Necro?  If not,,why?  How is it you think every class can get nice upgrades because expansion is coming out but Magicians cant. <br>
<br>
Then someone said the level 60 pet heal is good.  Now I know Everquest have people from all over, but even those in grade school can see the difference.  So here it is again:<br>
<br>
Based on casting the spell in 27 secs:<br>
<br>
Beastlord: 3 casts (6300hp) 27 sec<br>
Necro: 6 casts (6000hp) 27 sec<br>
Mage (currently): 2 casts (1800hp) 29 sec<br>
<br>
That is a difference of 70%.  Let me spell that for you SEVENTY percent.  WTF.  Wouldnt that make us Underpowered?  <br>
<br>
My proposal is for Magicians to have:<br>
<br>
Mage: 5 casts (5000hp) 25 sec<br>
<br>
Why not?  It is not as high as Necro or Beastlords.  Plus we wont be getting this gap thats already happening in the Nuke department.  Im tired of not getting upgrades to spells because some are to blind to comprehend.  But numbers dont lie.  And after all those comparisons...now<br>
Beastlord/Necro pets are close to Greater Voceration pets in damage, and hitpoints (Beastlord has to buff theres,,,but not Necro).  So we should be able to have a spell similar to there heal spells.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, bump chaincasting.  If a necro wanted to, they could chain cast also.  So that shouldnt even be the reason.<br>

How about the ones we have</span><hr size=1> There is a risk to chain casting pets. With no pet up for even 1sec a mage is at risk. If a healing spell is introduced that would allow a mage to heal a pet so good that it would be more powerful then chain casting then that would be bad. Reason being it would allow you to fully buff a pet and solo summoning mobs very easy with nothing more then heals. Chain casting doesn't work this way. When you resummon, even if your first pet was buffed the second pet is not and you would have to rehaste/DS to get that pet back up to standards. If you are using Thurg robe/greaves it could take 30secs to get that pet rebuffed while you still have a mob beating on it because you just chained. Also if a heal can compete with chain casting then you are able to allow the pet to kill at maxium power while having no drawbacks or risk like chain casting haste.<br>

How about the ones we have</span><hr size=1> Wez no one is asking for a complete heal on a pet as you know. Just a very effective heal.<br>
<br>
Look as mentioned at a necro healing there pet now.<br>
<br>
1st with Darkness/Fear/Root do they really need to heal there pet? Not if the mob is feared. Now if their pet dies they can ROOT the mob and make a new pet (non Spectre Pet so no peridot). They can they do it safer than any magician. Of course the damn mob is rooted and not chasing them.<br>
<br>
Necro's also have superior mana regen DURING the fight, and can life tap and have a heal over time dot on every mob they fight. So the higher cost of remaking a pet is offset partially, but why would they chain a pet, when they can HEAL IT very effectively.<br>
<br>
So as pointed out, WHY do magician's suffer in the heal department, when our closest counter part (The Necro) have a heal that is less mana and heals for more than we can.<br>
<br>
The fact is when it comes to a battle a Necro has so many options to help them live AND there pet live, that magician's lack.<br>
<br>
Again they will darkness and fear. Pet damage 0.<br>
They will pull. Darkness. Root. Dot. Send in pet ONLY if root drops and they want time to get a fear off, as a second option.<br>
<br>
We have one ability they don't. Cheap pets to chain cast, BUT like the Spectre Pet, chaining an Epic pet is not feasable do to the cast time. So a necro has many an option to keep his pet alive, and a very effiecent heal is one of them.<br>
<br>
A lot of people playing a magician want a simula option. <br>
<br>
NOT a complete heal, but one as effiecent as a necro so we have that option.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to post we have that option in chain casting, read again, if you use an EPIC PET you can't effectively chain them, and WHY should an epic magician be penalized for wanting to use the best pet available to them?<br>
<br>
If you have the epic, you worked damn hard for it, and your soloing ability should raise, BUT not if your best option is to BACKPACK your epic pet and chain the Greater Vocerate Pets.<br>
<br>
If you say, the epic pet is great in a group, Of course it is, but as shown use the level 60 water pet, position it correctly and you get a ton of damage also, without spending all that time on the epic.<br>
<br>
Remember ALSO if you don't have the epic pet, and you get an improved heal, you GAIN an ability, you lose NOTHING. <br>
<br>
You have an epic pet, and chain pets, YOU LOSE the ability to use the epic pet effectively.<br>

How about the ones we have</span><hr size=1> I am getting pretty tired of being accused of being anti-mage, when in fact I am a dedicated and successful champion of the mage class.<br>
<br>
Remember the pet upgrades from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> The Great Patch</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?  These were:<br>
<br>
1) Neutral Faction Pets<br>
2) Stronger Pets<br>
3) Removing Pet Experience Penalty<br>
<br>
Did these happen by accident?  No, they took a concerted effort by the mage community to voice their concerns, propose remedies, and present arguments in favor of those remedies.  My part in all this was, since I am a professional writer, to gather and summarize <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>all</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the various opinions about what mage problems were and how to remedy them, to compare the various proposed remedies, and to summarize the best arguments and counter arguments for each proposed solution.<br>
<br>
First, I classified and summarized the major schools of thought on how to improve the mage class:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=42.topic">Step 1: How to categorize class balance issues?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=71.topic">Classifying Proposed Remedies to Magician Class Balance</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
I slogged through dozens of threads and hundreds of posts to extract those ideas that were repeated by multiple mages and which seemed to enjoy at least some support <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>regardless of whether I agreed or not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.<br>
<br>
At the time, the general consensus was that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> considered mages to be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>overpowered</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, and that therefore, no significant remedies would be forthcoming.  Thus there was a great burden on the mage community to express our ideas clearly with persuasive arguments in favor of our proposals.<br>
<br>
One popular school of thought said that pets needed to be made stronger.  Although I had a different agenda, I still summarized and compared all the various method for making pets stronger:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=82.topic">Increased Pet Strength, Summary Pro and Con</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Notice this includes arguments for <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> against increasing pet strength.<br>
<br>
Another school of thought was that the penalties that mages paid for having pets were entirely too much for the benefit gained:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=90.topic">Petition: Reduce Pet Penalties?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
There were also many outstanding bugs which effects mages, which I gathered in:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=86.topic">LIST: Bugs, flaws, and minor fixes</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
At the time, I was of the opinion that pets were likely already strong enough, and that most pet penalties were probably justified, but that the central problem was that because of bad pathing, pets were unusable in entirely too many places.  Make our pets available everywhere, I reasoned, and mages would be powerful enough.<br>
<br>
First I argued that bad pathing was the responsibility of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and not the responsibility of mages to deal with the consequences of a serious design flaw:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=97.topic">REQUEST: Reduce Pathing Costs</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> maintained in response that first, bad pathing could not be fixed except an enormous expense, and second, that there was really hardly any bad pathing at all.  I collected a list of places where pets were not allowed due to bad pathing:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=85.topic">LIST: Where are Pets Not Allowed?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
Looking at the various proposed solutions, I concluded that making pets neutral faction would eliminate most of the risk of having pets near bad pathing, and would take little programming effort.  However, this was a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>radical</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> change to game mechanics, and would have profound effects for every mage in every zone.  Almost everyone agreed that that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would never do such a thing, and that neutral pets were probably abuseable.  So I posted to several forums including this one inviting players to come up with ways that neutral faction pets could be abused:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessage?topicID=63.topic">Brainstorm: List Consequences of Indifferent Pets</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
What was the result of all this?  Pets were made stronger, the pet experience penalty was removed, and pets were made neutral faction.<br>
<br>
None of this was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>accomplished</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> by crying <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;gimmee gimmee&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and seeking the most powerful upgrades, but analyzing various alternatives and putting forth the best arguments on their behalf, as well as countering the counter arguments.<br>
<br>
Mages are now more powerful than they have been at any time since before <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Kunark</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I am sure I am not alone in being suspicious of asking for any major upgrade for mages beyond that.<br>
<br>
Giving mages <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Root</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is one example of an extraordinarily powerful upgrade, a pet heal that was too good would likewise be a powerful upgrade.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, mages are no longer in need of powerful upgrades.<br>

I dont really know if we *need* another pet heal.  I mean, honestly, the only time I use heals are in emergencies or I dont feel like doing much.  You can solo much much better not healing pet at all and having improved reclaim<br>

<br>
A big difference between the 2 actually.<br>
<br>
What many are advocating is a heal that makes healing a pet as valuable as chaining a pet. <br>
<br>
The more you lavish on a pet, the more incentive you have to keep it alive, even if it means you expend more mana doing it, AND lose the ability to chain pets when the mob is dead to &quot;fill up&quot; your mana bar.<br>
<br>
So there are a few draw backs, but the increase in pet power by equiping your pet, and maybe getting it buffed for plat/focus items is worth it to some, especially if you have the epic pet.<br>
<br>
The lack of a &quot;GOOD&quot; heal, makes a soloing magician with an epic pet have to choose not to buff it, or add weapons to it, as you will chain GV pets as soon as it dies, because healing really isn't an option if you want to take on harder mobs. Chaining pets is the only real choice you have.<br>
<br>
Those against a better heal have said it clearly that they don't want a seconds viable option to the very powerful ability of chaining pets.<br>
<br>
I and many DISAGREE and want that option, the same way a necro has gotten a better heal and that new option. Remember when it comes to soloing power, a necro with SO MANY escape spells as well as soloing tools from FD/FEAR/Runes/DARKNESS/ROOT/ and the same 3 options we have. PET/RUN/GATE , now the necro arsenal contains a very good and effiecent pet heal.<br>
<br>
I would like the magician class to have that same option they do. HEAL the pet effeicenly. <br>
<br>
People say prove WHY you need it, as you can chain pets.<br>
<br>
When a lot people say You can not chain epic pets effectively, and also like to lavish weapons/armour etc.. on a pet to make it that more powerful.<br>
<br>
It seems they gloss it over, as unimportant, because they don't like the idea that something would be as good as chaining a pet.<br>
<br>
It still boogles my mind. They lose nothing, some of us game a new option. What the hell is wrong with that. <br>
<br>
I am done trying to convince people who DON'T want a new heal spell, who's only point is that we can chain pets, it is a very powerful ability. So ANYTHING else is not needed. To them it may not be, to me it is.<br>
<br>
The entire discussion trying to convince some is mute anyway, as shown in the one suggestion on a different thread dealing with a new heal spell, requiring a Star Ruby. <br>
<br>
That alone should tell any and all who read these threads that some are not seriously considering a new heal spell.<br>
<br>
So what happens is a suggestion is made for a new heal spell but with a cost that makes it such a joke, no one would ever mem it or use it over chaining pets. <br>
