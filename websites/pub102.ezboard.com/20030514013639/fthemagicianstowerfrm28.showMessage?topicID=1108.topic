I stripped my 29 wizzie and gave him some noob gear but it definitely needs to be upgraded. <br>
<br>
Now I know we could go farm HG's in RM for cash but that is a real pita on TZ because of PvP and we are both so sick of killing Geonids in CC that neither of us wants to go back. What I'm looking for mostly, are suggestions for quests and camp locations to upgrade virtually every item slot on the Mage. We don't mind killing greens as long as trivial loot code doesn't apply. I know almost nothing about Mage gear and he unfortunately has almost no time to search for stuff. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyphyr>Zyphyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 710<br> <font color=#333333>(12/6/02 5:09:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1108.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: 49Shaman/51Mage Duo need suggestions for aquiring Mage g</span><hr size=1> Without knowing about possible zone-control issues (since I don't play on TZ and have no clue as to what areas may be terminally unsafe for you to enter), or what your friend actually has:<br>
<br>
1) The (relatively recent) newbie zone quest armors are actually semi-decent.<br>
<br>
2)Great Oowomp (sp?) in TD. Drops batskull earrings and some other semi-usefull items.<br>
<br>
3)At least 3 slots (earring,bracer,ring) should be occupied by summoned foci and as such you don't need to fill them. Neck and Shoulder can be filled by foci until something better is aquired. Elemental Blanket makes a tolerable temporary back-slot.<br>
<br>
4)Pick up a Supple Scale Armband and a Kunzar Cloak(if the mage is of a race that can wear the cloak) in Karnor.<br>
<br>
5)Maiden's Eye : You probably won't be able to hunt here effectively, but there are several mage-only items that drop here and you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>might</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be able to pick up the 2 no-drop ones for free. On non-PvP servers, it is pretty much guaranteed that you could do so.<br>
<br>
6)The Hole. Hunt the elementals at the zone-in for Loam armor.<br>
<br>
7)1st 3 Coldain Prayer Shawl quests. Perhaps even #4. Beyond that, you start having to deal with Tailoring.... <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:medium;">Zyphyr Runnersbane</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

<br>
Here is a list of most of his gear:<br>
Primary: Stein of Moggok <br>
Secondary: Crystal Webshield <br>
Ranged: Orb of Echo Ore<br>
Ear: Orc Fang Earring <br>
Face: Sheer Bone Mask <br>
Shoulder: Frozen Mantle <br>
Finger: Obsidian Ring of Quintessence <br>
Wrist: Polished Bone Bracelet <br>
Wrist: Wolf's Eye Golden Bracelet <br>
Chest: Blackened Crystalline Robe <br>
Back: Giant Needlite Wing <br>
Feet: Wolf Fur Slippers <br>
Legs: Mammoth Hide Leggings <br>
Waist: Braided Cinch Cord <br>
<br>
The slots not listed are either empty or I simply couldn't remember what he has equipped. As you can see he is woefully underequipped for 51st level play on a PvP server. <br>
<br>
When providing suggestions please assume that we have full access to any zones. I know I said that RM is a pita and it is but that doesn't mean that I wouldn't camp for an item there, rather, I would prefer not to sit and farm coin there as coin can be looted in PvP on TZ.<br>

I think they would be decent upgrades.  I doubt the two of you could solo efficiently here, but maybe some higher levels might not mind letting you loot them.  I have no clue how helpful people are on red servers.<br>
<br>
Cloak: There is a quest cloak in Stonebrunt.  Something like 9 int.  I don't know the stats for his current one, but I thought I'd mention it since I believe all you have to do is kill one mob the two of you should have little trouble with.<br>
<br>
Ring: I'm not sure about red servers, but on mine there are some fairly nice rings for every little money.  Just takes a bit of time to search them all.<br>
<br>
Bracelet: Supple Scale Armband from Karnors would be very nice.  I'm not sure the two of you would be able to duo it though.  Another option would be a golden chitin bracelet from Sol B.  I doubt the two of you would have much trouble in this area and you would also be getting experience.<br>
<br>
Sleeves: Transient from ME are fairly nice.  They are no drop so see my comment about that under necklace/earrings.<br>
<br>
Gloves: Imp Skin are quite nice.  They are a rare drop in Sol A.  Either of you could solo this area quite easily as long as you don't get careless and get too many mobs at once.<br>
<br>
Helm: I didn't see one listed, but here is an idea.  An elemental binder (think thats the name) is a common drop in the Hole and has decent stats, though it is quite heavy for a caster.  They sell for very little.  Another option might be a runed cowl from Lower Guk.  I don't remember how nasty the mob is though, so I don't know if the two of you could do it or not.<br>
<br>
Robe: Maybe a shiny metalic robe.  It is a rare drop off the Arch Magus in Lower Guk.  Like the runed cowl, I don't remember what he is like at your level, so be careful if you go this path.<br>
<br>
Face: An enshrouded veil is very nice.  It drops in Howling Stones, so you can't duo for it.  They aren't that expensive though.  Check the bazaar.<br>
<br>
Primary: A sorcerous bowl is a decent item.  It drops on the 5th floor of the Tower of Frozen Shadows.  I used to visit this zone a ton while I was 60 and the first 5 floors weren't that bad.  The two of you might be able to do this if quite careful.  The downsides are it takes time to get the keys you need to progress through the floors and if you die, getting your corpses can be a pain.  Make sure to read up on this zone before giving it a try.  There are trap floors on the 4th and other surprises that can make this zone dangerous for the unknowing.<br>
<br>
Ranged: I don't know the stats on what you are using, so here are two ideas incase they are better.  A student's homework or teacher's syllabus would both be nice.  They both drop off the key mob on the 2nd floor of ToFS.  The homework is common and syllabus is the rare.  They are of about equal quality though.  I think the two of you could handle this area if careful.  All of the mobs on the 2nd floor are casters, so watch your resists.<br>
<br>
Shawl: I agree with the recommendation to start the shawl quests.<br>
<br>
Pants: There are some quest leggings in Stonebrunt, similar to the cloak I previously mentioned.  They are pretty good for casters low on INT.<br>
<br>
I agree with the suggestion to use your focus earring, ring, and bracelet.  I still use mine, though I'm looking to replace the ring.<br>
<br>
There are two sets of armor that are quite nice that you might look into.  Loam encrusted is the first set I mention.  It drops in the Hole.  The better pieces of loam drop past the initial drop off, so you would likely need a full group for this.  The second set is netted kelp.  It drops in Siren's Grotto.  It drops off the walrus like creatures.  You would likely need a full group for this zone too, but the advantage here is you can set up camp near the zoneline since any of them can drop netted kelp.<br>
<br>
If you need better resists, don't forget your summoned items.  The blanket is 15 FR/CR/MR and fits in either the back or shoulder slot.  A shard of the core is good for the ranged slot, 15 CR/PR.<br>
<br>
Good luck to the two of you.  I'm not much for PvP, so my gear suggestions mostly reflect a blue server attitude.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, a suggestion to make it easier for other mages to figure out item upgrades.  Create a magelo profile and put a link to it in your post.
