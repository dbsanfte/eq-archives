an enchanter saying a group of mages doing 7th island overpowered is a laugh. the high end game wouldnt exist without enchanters.<br>
<br>
now if it was one mage, or only 5 mages, i would agree with you. how are 30 mages any different than 2 enchanters, 4 clerics, and 24 melees? ps: less enchanters could probably have acomplished what the mages did with charm. the difference is everyone knows how powerful enchanters are so they feel no need to show it off to the world unlike mages.<br>
<br>
edit: btw they also had clerics. do you honestly believe 30 warriors and a few clerics couldnt have done the same thing only more effiicently? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 58 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61427" target="new"><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 45 Erudite Enchantress<br></a> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 5/16/02 2:26:03 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzebanar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zebanar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#333333>(5/16/02 2:12:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=207.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Noone..</span><hr size=1> -Noone I don't think you are wrong in your judgement of the charm line. It is indeed powerful when it works, probably the most powerful ability of any class, not only in EQ but in other RPGs as well. The way you presented your opinion struck alot of readers I think, however. There is of course, a bias toward mages who post about things like this too, we are seen as 'whiners'<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the risks would be worth taking as a magician, because well, running is something you end up doing 90% of the time if the crap hits the fan anyway. Apparently, Enchanters think having to zone is too much of a drawback. Enchanters probably aren't used to that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Mage accidentally pulls two blues, boom, he's off and running,At least in my experiance. Thank God for Jboots or else I wouldnt be the level I am today.<br>
<br>
With Kunark and Velious expansions soloing became a chore honestly, harder than it should have been. I'm not debating that it shouldnt be hard. But sitting in Skyfire all those months ago, after (barely) defeating my Wyvern, I sit down with my customary sigh of relief (that i survived) and regret (10 min downtime sucks). I look to my left and see...necro soloing insanely faster than me, oh well, I've learned to except that. Then I look to my left and see...the chanter that wouldnt give me clarity when i offered to pay or any assistance i could give for it, soloing like mad with his charmed &quot;a wurm&quot;, no downtime whatsoever that I noticed, and apparently little risk.<br>
<br>
Maybe said enchanter was smarter than most (still a jerk tho) but he seemed to have the charm soloing down pat with no problems.<br>
<br>
I cant give an opinion on if its Overpowered or not, for I'm not sure if jealousy would be affecting my judgement on said decision. Dire Charm on the other hand...I'm going to stick my head into the fire fight and say, Yeah it is. <br>
<br>
Long Post, I apologize, just got kicked out of my xp group in Upper Kobalds, because my pet broke the enchanters mez once ( he didnt die, and pet was off it immediately, and said mob was remezed) and he demanded that either I go, or he goes......guess what happened next.<br>

<br>
With that said, what I'm about to say isnt going to make some people happy. I'm sure most monks aren't going to like what I have to say, but I'm pretty sure no one else gives a crap. But like I said, I'm honest, and honesty and fairness means more to me than not upsetting people.<br>
<br>
So I might as well say it: my 35 Human Monk is extremely overpowered. Okay, so I'm talking a fungi-tunicced, 19/20 2hb staffed, SoS hasted from my epic 60 ench on another account, but nevertheless, she is way way way too broken.<br>
<br>
Let me paint a picture so you understand. Today in Guk, I was soloing stuff with SoS on. I'd like pull, beat the shiz out of mob while regening all damage from fungi during the fight, and continue. I had like no downtime, except every 20 minutes to run to zonein for my SoS click. I was like &quot;OMG, this is pure roxor, I cannot die!&quot;<br>
<br>
Now, I know what your thinking. &quot;your only level 35, fungis arent as good at higher levels!&quot; Well, here's a liddle secret- I have this skill called instill doubt to fear stuff and not take dmg! So I can still solo nonstop! And if I do manage to get  seriously hurt, I have a skill called mend, meaning I get free health! At over 100 skill, it never fails! And if somehow, during those high level pulls, it still goes bad, I can feign death like a necro or sk, only it has no cast time, and succeeds 99% of the time, making it nigh impossible to kill me!<br>
<br>
Why am I saying this? Mostly my concience. When I'm killing stuff in &lt;insert zone here&gt; twice as fast as any other soloer, including the idiot chanter with the hasted pet, I feel bad. I feel bad that I can kill non-stop with no risk and negligible downtime. And how can i be able to do this? 'Cause of a liddle thing called a Fungi Tunic. Also, cause of my class skills as a monk. Also, cause I have such ubar weapons I can get. So really, the problem here isnt that monks themselves are inherently overpowered; thats just part of it. When you throw in all the stuff they can use, tho....They become gods.<br>
<br>
So, in conclusion, I believe monks need to have all weapon skills max out at 10 skill, remove FD and mend as class skills, and make them unable to equip any weapons. Then they will be balanced, and the game will be fair to all again. Then my conscience will be at east.<br>

I need to chainpet to kill a single coterie legionairre and even then go oom occasionally. That druid holds 2 camps and has spare mana / time to kill wandering mobs as well. <br>
<br>
Now I know druids are good soloers, but him charming that animal raises his efficiency with more then 300% at least.<br>
And with his snare on the mob the risk of getting beat on when charm breaks is negligible.<br>
<br>
Sure it only works on animals, that's their turf, but we don't have something that increases our efficiency with dozens of percents when there are summoned critters in a zone... <p><br>

Several, actually.<br>
<br>
1. Charm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> is</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a very powerfull tool, with very lethal side effects. This cannot be disputed, as at some point or another, an enchanter/druid/necromancer will bust out their charm spells, and fry things with greater ease than they can do straight up. In fact, Charm is better than Mezing, as you turn the damage around on the add and kill faster than before.<br>
<br>
2. Dire Charm is quite powerfull, almost overpowered (and would be if it were given to any character under 59). After all, how often does one come up against a dispelling mob that will target your pet in order to dispell a charm? How about comming across a dispelling mob in the first place? Those're about as rare as Magicians, it seems.<br>
<br>
I had more, but got distracted. Basically, it's been my experience that many enchanters are Prima Dona's (however it's spelled), and to discount Charm's strength so blatantly is as bad as a Magician ignoring the fact that once charm breaks, the enchanter will be recieving a beatdown unless he/she has cover. However, as level 60 enchanters solo quite effectively with charmies that're level 50+, even taking into account charm breaking, it could be used if so desired.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you felt bullied into removing the post, Noonie. Charm itself is not overpowered due to the drawbacks and unpredictability. Dire Charm might be, but that's a topic hashed and rehashed quite often. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886">Rhasin Firestorm</A><BR>

Noonie being 'bullied' into removing her post? She posts a controversial trolling post filled with misfacts and exaggerations into trying to show a skill as overpowered and not expect to get some negative feedback from the class she is bashing? She is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> an enchanter.

She even thinks our <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   animation pets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are overpowered, because she believes enchanters shouldn't have any offensive ability at all and is only played for crowd control and buff whoring.  Sorry but I can't take a person who thinks our animations are overpowered very seriously as a knowledgeable EQ player. If Noonie was not a mage, she wouldn't be getting the support she has been getting from some mages here for her constant nerf calls of other classes. If she was a druid main with an enchanter alt instead, would her comments be listened to by mages?<br>
<br>
As for the so called n00bie enchanter talk, check my level and the levels of most enchanters that posted in defense of their class. Most are higher level then your mage and even your bard. You have a 59 bard. Charm for bards and enchanters use different mechanics, and can't be really compared eye for eye.<br>
<br>
Now for the real facts about its power instead of biased mumbo jumbo. Charm is the most powerful offensive skill in the game. It has always been that way since the spell was introduced. Used properly, there is no other class then the enchanter that can kill a mob as quickly as a charmed mob can. The enchanter is not known as an offensive oriented class, but in situations becomes a great damage dealer with indirect damage. Charm is so powerful in fact, that I used it to kill an even con at level 58. Simple fact is, the enchanter is one of the premier solo classes after about level 44, and with practice, can outsolo a mage in the 50s. Yes, I am telling you under the right circumstances I can outsolo a mage of the same level. Charming does become more efficient as you gain levels.<br>
<br>
Now here is what the risks lies. The main issue with charm is that if you are charming a mob, you have to face the possiblity that you will at some point end up having 2 mobs on you at any time. If you want damage, you have to realize that the damage you are dealing with your charmed pet can be turned into damage dealt to you in a second. If you choose to haste a mob that hits for 100s, you do so knowing that at some point, you will have to face that hasted mob along with the mob you engaged. If you choose to make the pet dual wielding you have to face the fact that one resist or on a spell or a bad charm break means you die in 5-10 seconds as you can be dealt 400+ damage in one round. The higher the damage you want, the higher the risk of death becomes. Charming requires quite a bit of mana, and chances are your charm will not last the full duration. There are more chances of blowing 1200 mana for casting charm 3 times on a mob that broke 15 seconds after casting then there are for a mob to stay charmed for 8 min.<br>
<br>
When charm soloing you have to take into the fact that the game has the tendency to have charm and root on a mob break at the same time (every enchanter can attest to this). And you won't always have open fields like Dreadlands (which I add is a ridiculously easy zone and should not be used as an example for charm soloing since every class has it easy here) and sow to avoid mobs when it happens. You are not garanteed of not getting any resists on your spells. There is no afk break when charm soloing. You have to be ready for anything that can go wrong and have an escape plan.<br>
<br>
Just as an FYI, the way that Noonie described for soloing is not an effective way to gain solo exp. You kill mobs very fast yes, but you take a 50% exp hit on all the mobs. The mage can outdamage his pet if he wants, the enchanter can't. So while the enchanter can kill a mob fast he has to kill 2 mobs faster then other classes can kill one to match the exp. This type of soloing is mainly used for farming, holding camps or taking on large targets. The real way to gain exp while charming is to charm a mob, send it against an even strength mob, have the mobs fight each other until both only have a sliver of health left, break charm, nuke mob 1, nuke mob 2, get full exp on 2 mobs. Much more efficient. Druid and wizards quad kiting still get more exp per time spent though.<br>
<br>
Charm is a powerful tool when used efficiently, but it simply cannot be compared to a mage pet, because they both have very different strengths and weaknesses. A charmed mob can outdamage a mage pet by far, but remember that this 'pet' can be very volatile and doesn't like his master much<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   . The mage pet won't turn on you at least.<br>
<br>
Still can't believe I needed to defend charm here. What's next, animations again?  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4356">Turonyen - Level 60 Enchanter</a><br>

Why should an enchanter be given group priority over 85% of all classes, and yet still have the option, the capability of soloing a level 58 mob. <br>

I certainly know as a magician, I don't get to become some 'uber' group class, no matter how much effort/time/risk I put into trying. The same holds true for the other pure soloing classes as well-wizard, druid, and necromancer. <br>
<br>
Its the option that makes it overpowered. Not the drawbacks.

<br>
I do understand what you were trying to say.  I've seen you make this argument many times on my normal board; I'm very familiar with your claim.  My blue chanter has been level 60 for about 8 months.  I have two other chanters on red servers.  I've been playing chanters for about three years now, and have never been PL'd or twinked.  I still learning some zones, but I know the class well enough to spot the problems with your argument.<br>
<br>
Yes, my SK had clarity and you were &quot;soloing&quot;.  But every chanter who has ever charm soloed will immediately recognize a few key points:<br>
 - you had a zone line at your back<br>
 - you had access to heals and rezzes and SoW<br>
 - you had room to move around<br>
If you don't think that these are advantages, then head on out to the middle of Skyfire when there's no clerics in the zone.  Start charm soloing without SoW (I can hear every chanter laughing now).  Watch your exp bar move quickly to the left.<br>
<br>
It's you who missed the point.  You take a single situation (charm soloing at the KC zone line in DL), have one run of very unusual luck (one Drol soloing 10 mobs without a charm break?), and then go off on some rant about how Charm is overpowered, without mentioning Tash, Slow, Haste, Root or anything else that made the session possible.<br>
<br>
I took a similar case (fear-kiting low-MR, low aggro radius mobs) and showed how one spell (clarity) made it possible for me to get the same levels of exp that your chanter got, and I got it with lower levels of risk.  I then followed your logic to claim that:<br>
 - my Erudite SK is overpowered (ha)<br>
 - Clarity needs to be nerfed<br>
It's SUPPOSED to sound ridiculous.  It's SUPPOSED to be flawed logic, and you're SUPPOSED to see that calling for a nerf to charm based on your example sounds just as silly as calling for a nerf to clarity based on mine.<br>
<br>
Are you getting ANY of this?  If not, then do what I suggested.  Head on out to the middle of Skyfire  - wait, screw that - head out to the middle of DREADLANDS with no SoW, no Symbol or Hero, nothing but your own buffs and then start charm soloing.  You will learn the truth VERY quickly.  If over the course of 4 hours you manage not to lose your level I'll be impressed.<br>
<br>
You seem to think that because enchanters can, on occasion, solo better than mages that chanters are somehow overpowered.  I can see how you might think that, given the things that chanters can do from time to time.  But until I see you over on the Wizard or Druid boards crying out for a nerf to quad-kiting, your sense of moral outrage regarding chanters and charming is uncalled for.<br>

I'll be honest. I didn't think of using this strategy as I haven't soloed much since the mem blur upgrade as I don't solo for exp anymore. Before the change though, this did not work as mem blur very rarely worked at all, not to mention that mem blur takes up a valuable spell slot.

<br>
You are still comparing how a bard charms solo with how an enchanter charms solo. Notice the 4 ticks, thats a set duration, the enchanter charm is random. You can prepare for the break, enchanters can't. That is a huge difference right there, not to mention that you can recharm right after. You can charm while running also, which is a little easier then what an enchanter needs to do . This shows right there you have absolutly no clue about enchanters and thus shouldn't comment about enchanter charms from bard charming experience.<br>

When did I say it that this way was inefficient, or slow for that matter? It's pretty quick, and if you want to make it quicker just haste both. It's also the way a lot of enchanters prefer to solo exp. I don't exactly get what your rest of you post means since it makes no sense.<br>

LOL I played several other classes at a good levels before, most notably warrior, rogue and necro at higher levels. The necro was what got me playing the enchanter because I used ST a lot and wanted the full deal with crowd control. Just because I don't post as  them (as they are not active characters atm) doesn't mean I only played an enchanter. Why does it matter how a mage solos or can't get groups? That's a different issue and is not relevant to what enchanters can do. This is about how enchanter charm is 'overpowered' remember?<br>
<br>
Anyways I'm beating a dead horse. Some mages unfortunatly will not be happy until either they get huge upgrades or have everyone else nerfed, and will believe that skills from some classes are overpowered without taking in account everything about the skill. Enchanters obviously won't win a debate on this issue on a magician board. Believe what you will about charm. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=4356">Turonyen - Level 60 Enchanter</a><br>

You are still comparing how a bard charms solo with how an enchanter charms solo. Notice the 4 ticks, thats a set duration, the enchanter charm is random. You can prepare for the break, enchanters can't. That is a huge difference right there, not to mention that you can recharm right after. You can charm while running also, which is a little easier then what an enchanter needs to do . <br>

<br>
Nope...1 second to 4 ticks max.  It can break right away, just like an enchanter.<br>
<br>
However;  I will grant you the &quot;running&quot; part is a good advantage, but so are J-Boots, stun, rune, root or mezz.<br>
<br>
Rune buff, while expensive, probably wouldn't hurt to keep up.<br>

<br>
Levels mean jack diddly.<br>
<br>
I've had level 60 magicians ask me at level 56 about whether giving their pets weaponry does any good. This information I learned around level 30-40.<br>
<br>
Comparing levels means nothing about the person's game/tactical knowledge. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886">Rhasin Firestorm</A><BR>

<br>
To those flaming encs:<br>
<br>
I'll say it right out. Charm is the most powerful ability in game. Hell, have a mob use fd to give a mob two weaps, then i dictate and another hits it with VoG as spell lands, I can do around 600 dps if i get the right mob. then I have 48 GURANTEED seconds of that.<br>
<br>
Do a little math, thats nearly 30k dmg. <br>
<br>
Of course, then charm breaks. Now, we have a highly enraged mob kicking my ass. Im dead before I can do jack @#%$.<br>
<br>
So you see, charm is very powerful. BUT YOU FRICKING DIE 99% OF THE TIME IF ONE LITTLE THING GOES WRONG!<br>
And if you don't haste or quad it, then you lose efficiency. its all RvR. The thing with ye mages is your pets never turn on you. Ours do...they do so quite often in fact. Thats why we have more powerful mobs.<br>
<br>
But really, as someone said earlier, its not the ability thats broken. Its the fact that mobs can hit for so damn hard to balance player level. A chanter charming a Guk mob compared to an OS mob, theres a huge difference in power. Theres the real issue.<br>
