<br>
ok, I am about to join the legions of mages angry about our classes developement over EQ's life. I'll cover Nukes, Pets, Mana regen, Spells, and the BEASTLORD.<br>
Nukes<br>
Has any1 noticed that mages are getting nukes that make it hard to compete with the other classes in damage, even with our pets? the order was wizard, mages, and then druids, but now verant has seen it fit to move mages to 3rd in nuking power, as if the ability to dot, snare, sow, port, buff, and debuff WITH the bonused nuking power isnt making druids a tad over-powered. Mages are supposedly MAster of the Elements... we cant nuke with ice water wind or earth, we cant summon a wind to stun our opponent as our air pet can, and we cant root or snare, is it too unrealistic for a master of the elements to be able to make mud? or quicksand?<br>
Pets<br>
Mages were once the masters of summoned things for lack of a better term. However, with SoL around the corner we are seeing that other classes once reported to never get a pet are now recieveing one (wizards) and the Beastlord is simply a slap int he face to mages around the servers. Wether or not the Familiars will attack or cast is not the point, the point is that wizards are already the best nukers, without getting any bonuses from a pet, the least verant could do would be give mages the familar as well, or forget the idea completely.<br>
Beastlord<br>
ok.... has anyone seen the spell list for this class? Thier pets get stronger with every level the gain (the spell that makes the pet a llv comparable to the beastlord) they can be completely healed (i do believe mages asked for a better pet heal a while back) and they recently decieded to give the beastlord the ability to enchant thier pet with procs (fire, air stun, ice, poison, disease, lighting.... umm... lets see.. a pet with fire ice and airstunning procs?? where have we seen this before?) and the ability for the pets to be able to travel form zone to zone with them is something that mages asked for long ago, but was denied because verant claimed it could not be done.<br>
Spells<br>
With the nerf/repait of the sword of runes, mages have asked for a new item to be able to summon for thier pets with a proc. Verant has responded with summon spells for armor and items that MAGES CANNOT USE (IE. quiver of marr, bandolier of lucin, pouch of quellious) then, to add to the insult of making mages vending machines, they give the ability to cast these spells to items that classes that can use thme can access.<br>
Mana Regen<br>
here's another gripe topic... Necros-lich series. Druids-Form of the Howler (or whatever buff they have that gives mana regen, and ther eIS a buff that gives it to them). Shamen- Canabalize. Clerics-a new SoL self only buff that gives mana regen. Wizards-Harvest. Enchanters-Clarity. Beastlords-Spiritual focus. Mages-modrods? you're kidding me right? one, it costs about as much mana to cast as it does return. two it smacks us for 255 each time we use it and we cant heal ourselves to regain the lost hp. why are we the only class to not get some sort of mana regen? even a hybrid has gotten one!.<br>
Escape<br>
In the event that a mage is soloing and more than one mob aggroes, we can.... gate? run at normal speed while the mob runs at its speed? We cannot Root, Fear, Stun, Snare, Mez, Feign death, Fade, Shadowstep, Divine Barrier, or do anything else but gate or die if we get into trouble.<br>
Balance<br>
Ok, Verant is constantly going on about its need for class balance. How does the ability to summon a staff of warding add to my class being balanced? oh no... Summoned beer, cake, fireworks, and a funny bottle... look out Cazic. Honestly... fun aside.. mages have been continually neglected in the useful spell department. If you wish to talk of balance, how about how a wizard or druid can quad kite a mob, and be ready to do it again while i'm medding up, or letting my pet heal after one or two? (i'm not trying to steal thier thunder, its just a tad aggrivating. but WTG druids and wizard) Master of Elements... howa bout a spell similar to Divine Barrier called something like Earthen Shroud? why cant we summoned the earth itself to create a protective layer over us for 18 seconds? we can summon fire to do it, why not earth? it would be far from making mages over powered, and would shut a lot of us up. Our nukes are limited to fire and magik, what about the other elements? air earth ice (druids air, wizards ice, druids earth (some class has an earthquake type spell, i think its druids).<br>
well.. i've done my ranting... i do hope that someone in verant takes the time to read this, and takes my wished into consideration...<br>

<br>
and damn, enough bitching about mages.<br>
<br>
Nukes - God we're damn comparable, 700ish at 53 with char(unless char's 52, i can't recall).  450 and super fast cast with scars of sigil.  machine gun those out if ya want.<br>
<br>
dmg wise, our nukes + pets we outdmg any-@#%$-one in a standard group(well other than rogue, they're insane).  get 54/60 water pet, put it to mob's back, and let it loose.  there is no wizard or druid or anyone that can keep the nukes pumping to provide anywhere near the dmg were gonna do with some nukes and pet.  they'd get aggroed, summoned, and beat on.<br>
<br>
as per Soloing i've soloed most of my lvls from 1-56.  Though i have spent quite a bit of time in groups recently, and did group as i was lvling up.  we can solo fine, which many classes can't.  Those that can solo really well, better than us,  arn't as needed in a group, or raid.<br>
<br>
don't bitch about our spells please.  we have good nukes, awesome pets, nice DS's, and the Mala line, not to mention CoH/mod rods.<br>
<br>
and btw, it's 225 dmg, not 255.<br>

First off Beaslords getting proc buffs for there pets, Good for them our pets proc automatically with spells stuns and roots, whereas they have to keep buffing there pets and waste a spell slot, we can just summon and forget as long as our pets dont die. <br>
Second, Beastlord pets being able to cross zones.  Remember,SoL is stillin the developmental phase, this may be changed before release, and in all likelyhood if Beastlords can do it they will change our pets to be able to do the same thing. Just because the havent said they will does not mean they wont. <br>
Third, Beastlords pets being the same level as the PC.<br>
This does not mean that their pets will compare to our pets stat wise. Mage pet levels are so importanat to us because our pets are based on the same stats system as PCs of the class the pet represents, I.E. Earth is based on the Warrior, Water = Rouge, etc. So it may be that a Level 34 Mage pet can waste a 44 Beaslord pet while we are getting drunk and laughing at the Beastlords pittiful attempts at hitting out pet. And as for The new Wizard familiar, I have seen some of the preposed stat buffs these bestowe on the Wizard, nice buffs and a neat way to personmalize the wizard class, but not a pet in any sence of the word, I dont even think these new familars can attack at all! So dont worry,  Mages will always hold the title of Masters of Pet Summoning!  <br>
Lastly, Mages not getting root or stun spells. I also used to think that we got shafted by not having these type of spells, but giving us these spells would be a real screw over to Wizards. As it stands now Wizards basic solo tactic is the Root and Nuke. Now if Mages get root spells we could do the same AND still have a powerfull pet backing us. So i dont see Veriant giving us these, however the lack of any help in escaping a bad situation is a big problem so my suggestion is this, how about a earth based quicksand line of spells that slows a target? That way we could cast it on the mob,then retreat to a safe distance and gate.<br>
<br>
But this is all immaterial, I personally love playing my mage, and have no desire to switch to another class no matter what abilities they get, if you are so donw on Mages because you see other classes getting spells you want then go play as one of them. I love my Mage and will keep playing him no matter what other classes get!<br>

would be nice to have a lure based nuke to be to be able to actually deal damage (when pets are not allowed, ie, most fo the time) on raids other than be a mod-rod-bitch.<br>

In either case I am level 53 now and pretty happy to stick to mage it still the most fun class and best class for farming and one that can make or break it for the group/raid during a bad spawn or pull.<br>

Btw Beastlords get next to none damage spells so almost all damage from them will be melee if they want to solo AND they don't get bind, or gate or any other escape spell except sow.<br>

WTF are you talking about you moron!!!??!!!!!<br>

EVERY CASTER CLASS has a mana regen spell and an escape spell. Even a #2#%#$%! hybrid is getting a mana regen spell.<br>

WHY CAN'T MAGES HAVE ONE!!!??<br>
<br>
Is that so hard for you to understand?? We have no escape route, no good buffings (against melee!!). EVERY CASTER CLASS has a dmg absorber spell, except mages.<br>
<br>
Well, mages have pets!!! OOOOPIIEEE DIIII DOOOO!!!! SO DO NECROS, CHANTERS, and now WIZARDS!!!!<br>

We're going to recover 3 points of mana now.<br>
<br>
Wow, what a difference.<br>
<br>
C'mon people. Let's stop this stupid argument (and yes, sorry about my reply. I'm a hot head. Ok? Sorry y'all.)<br>
<br>
But am I the only one who sees the irony in this?? I mean, every pure caster class has a GOOD mana regen spell, except mages. Now even a hybrid is going to have a good mana regen spell, and we (mages), as usual, are getting crap spells. I mean, I can really see the use in the veil of invisibility (or whatever it's called), cuz lets face it, we all hate using Invis, and see the message &quot;You feel like you're about to appear&quot; when you must not appear at any costs. That's a good spell, but c'mon, every other class is getting at least 2 or 3 good spells that I wouldn't mind having it.<br>
<br>
We're masters of the elements. How hard would it be for a mage to control the earth bellow someone's feet and root them?? It's simple things like that that makes me raging mad. It's obviously Verant hates mages (have you ever noticed that there are not even one GM that plays a mage??). <br>
<br>
Really, I get extremelly angry because of this. It's not the point if our pets are better than others (which they are). But lets examine who should have a pet. Mages can summon pets. So that's ok. Necro's can animate the dead. So that's ok too. Chanter are masters of illusions. How does that make them SUMMON a pet?? And now wizards. C'mon, isn't it enough that they have the best nukes in the game?? Isn't it enough that their very powerful nukes have really fast casting times?? Isn't it enough that they can port?? How cheap is that?? Cheapness is the main reason why I will never ever start playing a Wizard or a Druid, and I tell that straight up to any druid and wiz that get in my face. They're cheap and that's that.<br>
<br>
Now druids are, well, simply put, pathetic. I hate their guts with a passion. Let's see here, they have: Fear (on animals), root, ports, 2nd best nukes in game (sad but true), powerful dots, snare, damage shields, healing spells, buffs, harmony, etc. Am I missing something? I probably am, since they have every frigging spell on the game. Oh yeah, they also get pets. WEAK pets, but nonetheless.<br>
<br>
You guys gotta face it, mages keep getting screwed over and over again, and the last thing I wanna see is someone kissing Verant's ass, and saying how &quot;GREAT&quot; the mage class is, cuz again, lets face it. We used to be great in terms of power, but not anymore. <br>
<br>
::sigh::<br>
<br>
I remember playing this game back in day, where I could beat almost any class with my mage. Now I can count with one hand the classes we can beat in duels.... and I'd still have a few fingers left. This totally sucks. Mages should be one of the strongest classes in the game (and not because I play a mage, cuz I also play a Necro, who is higher lvl than my mage btw), but when you think about it, they really should be the powerhouses in the game. We're the MASTERS of all 4 elements, how many other classes can say that?? Too bad they're almost all stronger than us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umisstyofprexus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Missty of Prexus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(11/9/01 9:21:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=135.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: lvl 54 Mage wants to Rant about Mages </span><hr size=1> Thanks Esper for starting this.  A lot of things have been running through my mind lately.  I will never stop playing my mage.  I'll quit EQ first.  But here are my rants.<br>
<br>
Do beastlords and wizards even need regents for THEIR pets?<br>
<br>
Why the hell can't we self port?  Hell wizards get familiars now (even with a mana regen at high lvls).  A mage can't port to the plain of AIR?!  Did I miss something there?<br>
<br>
Lets got to sol b nd NOT nuke something cause we are fire based (with the exception of the stupid far in between 'weapon' nukes) but are master of the elements?<br>
<br>
Die pet while I zone or log. *hint*<br>
<br>
Amazing we can't summon a horse.  But a paladin can.  I would love to ride my griff at least.<br>
<br>
Of course the mana regen issue like everyone else<br>
<br>
No root or snare is bull.<br>
<br>
And I still think we get hosed in our research.  I understand and think we should have a more intricate one but the rarity of some components is ridiculous.  That skill costs enough to keep up as it is. <p><P>/ooc Group 1 is fine.  Jibober is negotiating with extreme prejudice.

You can bitch all you want about root, its not gonna happen, its called balance.  As for being able to beat others in a duel, oh no!

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  have you ever noticed that there are not even one GM that plays a mage?? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Do you know every GM in the game?  I know a GM who's main character is a level 60 mage.  Of course, maybe you're also under the assumption that the GM's actually make the game we're playing, rather than the college age part time employs that they are.<br>

Root: unusable on raids, pointless on mobs that summon<br>
Snare: see root<br>
Ports: yeah, druids love being port whores<br>
Nukes: slightly better, but most druids that raid specialize in alteration for heals, not nukes, which probably gives us the edge<br>
DoT's: If they land on uber mobs, and I think they now do, only 1 druid can put on the DoT, the rest just stand there<br>
Damage Shields: mage DS's are used on raids<br>
Heals:  Nothing better than to come on raids to do the most boring job (healing) and not even get to be appreciated like the clerics!<br>
Buffs: PotG/resists are all they have that gets used.  And PotG is only used on casters<br>
Harmony: not used on raids<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Am I missing something?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yep, you're missing the fact that the balance problem is on raids, not &quot;who can solo/duel/group the best.&quot;  Everyone can get to 60, not everyone is useful once they're there.  Though personally, I feel useful on our raids.  We could use some minor fixes (preferably slightly increased pet damage to uber mobs), but overall I'm pretty much pleased with my class.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We're the MASTERS of all 4 elements...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
That could be debated, and I will.  Regardless of what the bloody manual says (VI has a communication problem, the class designers don't talk with the quest designers, whoever writes the manual, etc. very often).  Personally, I view us as the masters of summoning, not the elements.  We're so good at summoning that we can summon elementals to fight for us, even an elemental made of all the elements.  Or we can summon monsters.  We summon blades to strike our enemies, or balls of fire.  We summon shields of fire to protect ourselves/friends.  We summon piles of junk that are sometimes useful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well, druids have more right to it than us...<br>
Wind: They ride the wind (Kunark evacs), and can stun/damage their enemies with the wind.<br>
Fire: They can burn their enemies.<br>
Water: They can freeze their enemies, and can stop the rain.<br>
Earth: They can root their enemies, and can cause earthquakes.<br>

Why do we need root, personally I'd be pissed if they gave us root.  We have no problem soloing/grouping, and thats the only use it would have.  I'd much rather get a spell/skill where its needed, on raids.  And it would be unbalancing to give us root, we already have a pet that roots and enough hp to allow us to cast gate if you accidently pull multiple mobs.  The point of balance isn't to make everyone the same freaking class.  Its about being equally useful to a group/raid, but in DIFFERENT ways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oh really? Wow, if you hadn't tell me that, I wouldn't know!!! I actually thought the GMs were the makers of the game. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
You're the one that claimed that VI hates us and that it was obvious because no GM's play mages.  Which implies that the GM's some how have control over what is done to our class.<br>
<br>

Your welcome, I guess...  Perhaps you were reading a different post though.  What I said had nothing to do with what the spells do, it had to do with the effectiveness of those spells on raids.  My point being that you claim that druids have it so great, but ultimately they become caster buffers/healers and get to port people around for raids.  You think CoHing late comers is bad, what about the people that have to get those people to the raid in the first place.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Oh yeah, balance again. So first you talk about how ALL classes are balanced, THEN y ou say some classes are useless on raids??? Oh yeah... balance. Very balanced indeed<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
The only places the classes are balanced is in grouping situations.  On raids there is an extreme inbalance between classes, worse for some than others.  There are two parts of this game, or 3 if you count soloing.  The single group hunting for exp, and the raids made of many groups accomplishing a goal other than exp.  The game was originally designed for only the first, however turned into the second and the classes weren't designed for it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Uhhh, no. That cannot be debated. Mages are the masters of SUMMONING AND ELEMENTS.... or at least we're supposed to be the master of elements. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
According to Verant:<br>
<br>
M A G I C I A N<br>
Magicians are the summoners of the arcane world, with the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread to a huge fire elemental to fight for them. While not as adept at offensive spells as wizards, magicians still wield considerable power in this area. Magicians, like enchanters, are found among the more intelligent races and worship a variety of deities.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/classes.jsp">everquest.station.sony.co...lasses.jsp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
And when you start a mage it says that they can summon exrta-planar beings to fight for them (or a variation on that depending on the race).  The only exception is the DE mage, which doesn't talk about the class at all.<br>
<br>

NP, after 9 months of being level 60, I still don't mind helping new mages.  Perhaps when you actually get high enough you'll realize what the real (though imo, minor) problems with the class are.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You call that balance?? Go over your own list of what we can do and what Druids can do. Go over it carefully and if you tell me that all classes are balanced again<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ok, I will, the game is balanced in non-raid situations.  The druid class is considered &quot;the jack of all trades.&quot;  Transportation, damage, healing, buffing, etc.  However, they're not the best at any of it, except transportation which they share with wizards.  So on raids they're pretty pointless cause you can get other classes that are especially good in that department.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways, I'm done here.  I've read enough rants to know that people like you will keep putting words into my mouth.  So I'm gonna finish here and let you have the last word so your ego isn't hurt. <p>~~

People who constantly bitch about the mage class are people who need to realize that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no class will ever be a god class.  No class will ever be able to do anything.

Deal with it</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  <br>
