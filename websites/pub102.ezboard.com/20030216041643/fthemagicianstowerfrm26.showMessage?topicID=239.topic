<br>
I've seen more going back and forth on the epic pet issue than almost anything else I've ever heard of here.  <br>
<br>
I do have to point out one thing - something that's been avoided by just about every poster I've ever seen talk about it on either side.  It's pretty simple.  The epic in it's current form IS A HUGE MISTAKE.  It always has been.<br>
<br>
Before you flip out on me read further and think.<br>
<br>
It's really pretty simple folks - they created an epic for mages that is absolutely DEFINING.  A mage with the epic is far far far better than a mage without the epic.  Even at level 60.   No 1 or even 2 items should define a class's power like that folks.  It creates a system of haves and have nots the likes of which is not seen for any other class bar perhaps clerics and their rezz sticks, and even then they CAN duplicate their epics effect with a spell.  <br>
<br>
The epic wasn't intended to be a NECESSITY, nor is it for any class but mage, barring perhaps once again raiding clerics and the rezz stick, and that's still shaky compared to the power difference between an epic and non-epic mage.  That's not good design, and it does not promote intelligent class balancing.  Hell in my opinion it almost precludes class balancing.  Sure, it kicks butt, but not in a good way for the mage class in general.  Just creates an eternal dichotomy between 2 segments of the class.<br>
<br>
How is that fixable?  I don't know.  I'm not calling for slapping those with epics in the face.  But I will tell you that I truely hope to high heaven that PoP pets completely outperform the epic pet - allowing once again that dichotomy to fade.  It's the only way I can think of it make it disappear.  It'd be kinda sad because they we'd be the only class with a useless effect on the epic - but..<br>
<br>
Lord have mercy tovarisch - they messed up in the first place by making that effect a pet, and it has to stop somewhere.  <br>
<br>
I repeat - no one item, difficult or easy to obtain, should create a sub-strata of one class that is uber-capable compared to those that don't have it.  Better sure, but not THAT much better.  It doesn't happen for any other class to that degree, it's just not bright design, it's not bright gameplay.  Period.<br>
<br>
Don the asbestos armor and sits back waiting for the misunderstandings.<br>
<br>
I remain,<br>
<br>

<br>
What is really the difference between a mage with epic versus one without, and lets say a shaman with epic and one without. Hum Shammy with epic can solo a dragon... Shammy without can't.. How about Druid with Epic versus one without?? Same diff the epic druids can kill a H$$$ of a lot of stuff. Im not up on there latest and greatest achievements. What am I saying? Im saying that YES a person with there epic is way more powerful (generaly, really depends on what the epic is) then one without.  <br>
<br>
Now the point of neccessity? I really don't understand this comment. Sorry I did it the old fashion way, may not have been stellar, ubah, or what ever. I first leveled to 60 (OMG I really used all of my pets (water rocks!)) and then after dinging 60, I got my epic. I still play with and without the thing. No I didnt get it a ton of years ago, I just got it this year. Its not a &quot;neccessity&quot;, its a really nice item for me, again I could solo before epic, and dang I can still solo after epic. <br>
<br>
As to the dificulity/timesink factor of the epic, I'm not going to touch this. Frankly its been riddled on the board, just go read other posts I would end up saying the same thing.<br>
<br>
As to the new pets in Pop, /shrug, I will see when they get released. Its really pointless to argue at this point on the pet power, versus epic pets power. Ideally like it is now, you will pick the best pet for the best situation. Exactly what I do now, heck before I got my dr up, I was using earth in FG because it resisted more, now with more DR I use epic.  <p><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD>

So mages with the epc get a lot better pet than those with the epic.<br>
<br>
By better let the epic increase the new pets by 2 levels, add attack/haste/hit points/ac. The amount would be up to Verant, but make it so that any mage with epic gets a demonstratabily better pet.<br>

<br>
Your post does make sence in it's own 'twisted' way, it DOES have extremely valid points in it.<br>
<br>
Warrior epic-melee w/procs that can REPLACE other garments, not overly defining and rather useless w/ end game loot available.<br>
<br>
Cleric epic-clicky rez, sure dupable with spell and mana.<br>
<br>
Druid epic-Clicky DoT, dupable for the most part with mana, not nearly as powerful or needed as most other epics.<br>
<br>
Monk epic-perma haste, ummmmmm sure 1 of 20 or so haste items but this one stacks with items(?), still it's not that bad of an epic.<br>
<br>
etc etc etc, Yes the mage epic does &quot;change&quot; some things for a mage BUT........<br>
<br>
Mage Epic still is:<br>
Unable to hit some mobs<br>
RESTRICTED<br>
Unable to hit worth a hoot on most end game bossmobs<br>
RESTRICTED<br>
Worse than the spell T-rod<br>
RESTRICTED<br>
<br>
*restricted=unable to use on AoE mobs, fearing mobs, in alot of zones, has a 5minute recast (druid, cleric, etc don't have a 5 minute recast), costs 500mana (druid, cleric, etc don't costs mana), etc etc.  Quite a bit of restrictions for an epic (the only one that has these restrictions).<br>
<br>
I won't deny, mage epic-vs-xp mobs is GODLY, but 1 lvl difference isn't cutting it-vs-end game content.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rest be assured, I am sure you will see PoP pets are&gt;current epic pet.  Since Gvoc's are 48 and epic is 49, theres not a whole lot of room to squeeze those 60+PoP pets inbetween them, meaning they would have to either make them =to or &gt;than.  1 Month til I bag my epic (so to speak) like those melee did, I am glad I got it when I did as it GREATLY shortened &quot;my&quot; road to 60, but all in all it wasn't so much of an &quot;improvement&quot;-vs-normal pets (assuming you look at gvoc-vs-epic, where it's 1 lvl difference, a little more dmg, some kick ass stuns/procs and that OoOoOoo DS, but NOT as defining as some of us make it sound), it still does jack squat-vs-end game content.<br>
<br>
Course epic 2 years ago w/ Kunark's end game would have been EXACTLY what you describe, in SoV, and SoL it's just not as kicking as you are lead to believe.  Thats why you lvl in the &quot;Old World&quot; and/or RoK, since it's 50000 times easier to kill those mobs.<br>

Ask Raz, he can speak that the Epic is not a &quot;necessity&quot; as you claim, it's nice but not a &quot;necessity&quot;.  Voc's can tank low 50's mobs and gvoc's can tank mid 50's mobs, sure you &quot;might&quot; need a healer to do some but you can heal or chain pet instead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwoonx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>woonx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 248<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 6:15:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Epic Uber Alles</span><hr size=1> ***<br>
No 1 or even 2 items should define a class's power like that folks. <br>
***<br>
<br>
Except the game is full of items like that. It was less noticeable for casters before because pre-FT/focus items, there was little to no difference between a high end caster and a casual level 60 caster. Verant finaly realised this was a bad thing and put ancient spells, FT items, effect items and focus items for caster to also gain power from their equip. Mage epic is nice, but in no way is it essential or &quot;defining&quot; for the mage class. You can use water pet fo similar offensive capacities, you can use earth for similar HP, you can use air for similar tankin/stun, and you can use fire if you wanna laugh. Epic, while being nice, doesn't define the class (even less when new PoP pets will be out). <br>
<br>
It's normal that a casual player have less gear, less power and less capacities than the power gamer, there's no way around that, in any game. A lvl 60 war with 5k buffed hp wielding a frostbringer and a jade mace is MUCH less efficient than a lvl 60 war with 7k buffed hp, 100 AAs, ntov/ssra/VT gear, weilding blade of carnage and a bloodfrenzy. A rogue with a 16 damage piercer is much more damaging than a rogue with a 15 dmg piercer. Any melee with a primal has a huge advantage over a melee without. A mage with a SoA is much more efficient at making mana than a mage without. Examples like this go on and on. There's tons of items in this game that will make you better than those without. Epic is no different.<br>
<br>
Epics are not even epic no more, they are pretty much mid-end quests nowadays, more time consuming than difficult. If you don't have the time to invest, well, though luck for you. But if they made epic available to everyone, where would be the fun in that? Joe Sebilis mage CAN get their epic, the fact they have to work for it is normal. Many mage have completed their epic, if you still haven't you have to accept the fact that maybe your play style don't fit with higher end EQ game and that you would be better off focussing on other thing than epic. Make friends, chat with people you meet, do a small group in a zone you never explored before, etc. Epic is not required for that.<br>
<br>
Would you expect to get handed 5 queens in a chess tournament because you don't have the time to invest to become a master at chess? Would you expect a Ferrari handed to you because you don't have the time to invest and the job to afford one? Would you expect the NBA to recruit you and let you play on 10 inch heels because you can't reach the hoop without them? Maybe hockey players should shoot softer on goalies with less talent, after all, it isn't fair that Mario Lemieux shoot the same way on Patrick Roy and some no name out of AAA leagues? Life isn't fair, EQ (and most games) aren't eighter, and honestly, it's a huge part of the fun.  <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</A>&nbsp<A href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&ltTDE&gt</A><BR>

You agree with? Original poster? 1 of the 10 other posters?  <br>
<br>
Honestly, we can safely assume that pop pet will be =to or &gt;than epic pet.  It's simple Gvoc's=lvl 48 and epic=lvl 49.  This benefits you :0)<br>
<br>
You won't have to /waiste time camping, or pp buying MQ's.  I for 1 applaude ANY upgraded pets that come out with PoP, I just don't see the epic as &quot;that&quot; much better than regular pets as to be &quot;necessary&quot; or &quot;required&quot; in todays game (maybe 2 years ago).  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, epic is an awesome pet for xp mobs, but not necessary.  I have used gvoc earth alot and have found him useful in certain situations, as I had even used voc earth several times and even saw him as useful.  I was able to chain pet lvl 51 mobs with voc earth at lvl 51 (prior to that dang xp change dang it, that could have been sweet xp).  It was a &quot;look what I can do&quot; experiment, and it was fun, but eventually I went back to the easy blues and the epic so I could advance just a little faster.  <br>
<br>
I drooooooooled over the epic my whole mage career until I actually had one.  Sure I droool once in awhile using him, but after seeing and using each of the gvoc's a few times, I don't feel that the epic was all &quot;that&quot; much better overall.  Besides it's just a 1 lvl difference. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rhasinfirestorm>Rhasin Firestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1088<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 7:05:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Epic Uber Alles</span><hr size=1> While the Epic for Magicians does provide a significant increase in power, an Epic for a Magician is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> absolutely <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> required</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for a magician to exist in the world, and to exist well.<br>
<br>
Thing is this. The Epic for Magicians, so far, is still pretty powerfull a weapon. Something that truely (for the moment) is Epic. Sadly, because of the expansions, and because of VI's submission to Mudflation, those weapons that should be hard to get and very powerfull are easily outdated by yard trash drops from the new worlds.<br>
<br>
A Magician without their epic is still lethal. A Magician with their epic is a real powerhouse.<br>
<br>
P.S. While the epic does indicate a significant boost in power, it is achievable by most these days, if they are determined. Far from the days where you had to kill Innoruk for one of three drops for that year. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utainsumnr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tain Sumnr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 181<br> <font color=#333333>(9/26/02 7:41:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Epic Uber Alles</span><hr size=1> I was under the impression it was the jbb , gotten from seb, that was what helped shamans solo dragons-not the epic..which can only be cast 1 time every few minutes.<br>

Nevertheless I would still do the quest if they are. Epic is also a question of fun and status. The greatest thrill I have experienced in this game was when my guild went to PoS and got me my crown.<br>
<br>
I think the mage epic is a good and balanced quest now. It is very harsh, but so are mages with a grudge =). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ushadowmagildire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ShadowMagi LDire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 3:11:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=239.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Solo vs Group/Raid</span><hr size=1> I didn't get my epic until I was already 60.

<br>
However, in a group the epic doesn't make nearly as much of a difference.  To be honest, rods sometimes make more of a difference.  Picture this:  You are on a raid with 40 people.  If the clerics go oom, do you think they want a rod or you epic pet?  Which can turn the tide?  When the entire force gets mana drained rods can mean success.. nothing else in game can do that.<br>

<br>
But &quot;in a group&quot; &lt;&gt; &quot;in a raid&quot; - I agree he doesn't often make any difference in a raid encounter, he's a lot more useful in an xp group or solo.  <br>
<br>
But he has saved the raid bacon on one or two occasions.<br>

Why refuse more power if VI is willing to give you?  Like someone else said GVocs are 48 and epic is 49.  Only one level difference.  If PoP pet is stronger, hell ya! I'll take that over epic.  If they come out with epic pet upgrade, even better.  <br>
