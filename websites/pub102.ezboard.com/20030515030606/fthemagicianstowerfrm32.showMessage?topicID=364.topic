<br>
I propose the following simple model of pet-mob fights in order to help evaluate when a better pet heal might be necessary.  This is in a solo situation, but can be extended to groups.  I assume a single pet for the fight.<br>
<br>
It takes a lone pet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mob HP / Pet DPS seconds</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to kill that mob, pet DPS here including melee, damage shield, and procs.  Likewise, it should take the enemy <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Pet HP / Mob DPS seconds</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to kill the pet.  Whoever dies first loses, so in order for the pet to win unaided:<br>
<br>
HP mob / Pet DPS &lt; HP pet / Mob DPS.<br>
<br>
In general, a mob will kill an unaided pet sooner than that pet will kill the mob.  We can look at the difference as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;the second gap&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, that is the number of seconds the pets life must be extended, or the mob's life shortened, so that the mob dies before the pet.<br>
<br>
Mages have four options for intervening in the fight in favor of the pet: nuking, healing, tanking, and chaining another pet.  For this discussion we will only consider nuking and healing as options.<br>
<br>
Heals close the second gap by effectively increasing the hitpoints of the pet, extending the time the pet can fight.<br>
Nukes close the second gap by reducing mob hitpoints, bringing the mob that much closer to death.<br>
<br>
A heal extends the fight by HP healed / Mob DPS seconds <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (i.e the pet can endure that many more seconds of fighting)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
A nuke shortens the fight for Damage Dealt / Pet DPS seconds <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (i.e. the time it would have taken the pet to deal the same amount of damage)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Both close the second gap between pet and mob death.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> First Conclusions:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The effectiveness of healing a pet instead of nuking depends largely on two factors.<br>
First, the relative magnitude, time, and mana efficiencies of the available spells.<br>
Second, the ratio of Mob DPS to Pet DPS.  The more relative damage the Mob does, the less efficient heals are as opposed to nukes.  In contrast, the stronger the pet is relative to the mob, the more likely heals are a better idea, barring the relative efficiency of heals and nukes.  Note that nukes may be limited by aggro, while heals are less so.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Concrete Examples:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> NOTE:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  At first, I tried to use a 57th mage with GV:E and the 52 pet heal as an example, but I could not find enough parses and references to come up with a believable DPS range for GV:E.  I would <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>guess</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, based on what I remember reading previously, that including 33 pt. DS, BO3, and muzzle, DPS should generally range from 25-45 DPS?  Although that would be inclusive of more mages, it would also likely being biased against healing and in favor of chaining pets.  Could you give me some real numbers to play with, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Cyricus</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
As many of the strongest advocates of a super pet heal are epicked mages, and it is far easier to find numbers on the epic, I will use as my example an epicked archmage with specialization conjuration and common focus items, but no appropriate AA.  While not as inclusive, its makes a sharper example.  For the epicked mage, chaining is awkward and distasteful, and the clear preference is to preserve the pet.  If heals are broken for the epicked archmage, then they are broken for mages with weaker pets.<br>
<br>
So our hypothetical epicked archmage has BO4, muzzle, the 52 pet heal, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Transon's Elemental Infusion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The epic pet has 40-80 DPS, call it 60 for now, and 4,000 hit points.<br>
<br>
How many seconds does one cast of TEI close the gap by?  TEI heals 580 damage, but the answer depends on the mob DPS.<br>
<br>
For a 50 DPS mob, it closes the second gap by about 12 seconds, about as long at takes to cast and recover for another cast of TEI.<br>
<br>
For a 100 DPS mob, it closes the second gap by only 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
What about the rare 60 pet heal, TER?  As it heals 900 damage, for a 100 DPS mob, that closes the second gap by 9 seconds.<br>
<br>
Barring resists, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will do about 1100 points of damage with a damage focus.  This is equivalent of 1100 damage / 60 Pet DPS or about 18 seconds of pet DPS.  That is, it shortens the fight by 18 seconds.  It also costs about 50 less mana to cast than TER, with specialization and focii.<br>
<br>
From the point of view of reducing the gap in seconds between the mob and the pet, nukes are vastly more efficient than heals.<br>
<br>
But then most mages already knew that.  What limits nuking relative to healing is aggro.<br>
<br>
However, let's compare the 52 pet heal to the 55th level mage damage over time spell, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wrath of the Elements</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which has more aggro than the pet heal, but much less aggro than a straight nuke.  Also, WoE costs about as much mana as the 52 pet heal.<br>
<br>
Barring resists, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wrath of Elements</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> deals 800 damage in 30 seconds, which is equivalent to about 13 seconds of additional pet fighting.  To reduce the gap as much as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> WoE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, TEI heals 580 points / 13 seconds or about 44.5 Mob DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> In other words, against mobs that deal more than 45 DPS and barring resists, casting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wrath of Elements</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> closes more seconds than than the 52 pet heal.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
How does <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> WoE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> compare to the 60 pet heal?  TER heals 900 damage / 13 seconds =  69 DPS.  So for mobs doing at least 70 DPS, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wrath of Elements</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is better than TER, and costs less mana.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> So what?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Except against weak mobs, and ignoring resists and aggro, nukes are dramatically more effective than heals for intervening on behalf of the epic pet.  The higher the mob DPS, the less appealing pet heals are compared to nukes.  Although aggro limits nukes, smaller nukes and damage over time spells can be used to manage aggro.<br>
<br>
When are pet heals called for?<br>
<br>
If nukes are being highly resisted, then you are likely soloing the wrong mob.  If aggro is highly sensitive, then heals may be prefered.  If the pet is low on life, must not die, but the mob cannot be burnt down fast enough to close the gap, heals are prefered.  Indeed, for most times during most fights, the only time a heal would be clearly best is when the pet is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;close&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to dying, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mend Companion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would be appropriate.  Pet heals can then be seen primarily as a weak form of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mend Companion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which matches the various proposed pet super heals.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What I ignored:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I did not explicity take into account mana and cast times.  The original version of this analysis did, but was more complicated, and anyway heals look even worse.  The long cast time of heals makes them even favorable than nukes, as they take longer to cast and recover than the number of seconds they buy.  Chaining the two pet heals does not improve matters much.  I did not take into groups, but this analysis would be useful there, especially in the presence of enemy AOEs.  I ignore chaining pets, and players tanking for pets.  I ignore the desirability of class interdependency.<br>
<br>
I also do not address the question of whether nuking is a far more appropriate response thematicaly than healing, and whether healing is properly a marginal capacity for mages.<br>
<br>
However, if mage pet heals are intended to be viable spells against stronger mobs, then the existing heals appear to fall short of that goal<br>

I'm sure Lobaner might have an opinion on this. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Great analysis though. If we carry the discussion on a bit farther to the end of the battle, healing is once again 'discouraged' by the current array of spells. <br>
<br>
A few thoughts, from an RP perspective, if we can freely summon the most powerful of elements, then we should be able to infuse (heal) those elements for the same type of ratio with which we summon them.<br>
<br>
If you look at the cost of creating a new pet:<br>
eg:<br>
level 53 air pet has 2350 hp and costs 300 mana to summon.<br>
BOIII = 150 mana<br>
Plate armor = 300 mana<br>
<br>
Level 52 pet heal costs 250 mana per cast, and would take 4 casts to fully heal a pet.<br>
<br>
For those scoring along at home, thats an extra 250 mana down the toilet, where you would actually regain a bit of mana by simply reclaiming, resummoning, and re-equipping.<br>
<br>
For those aspiring to get the Level 60 pet heal, it would take two casts to heal most of the pets hp, and would also take more mana than simply summoning and re-equipping a new pet. <br>
<br>
They way the system is currently set up, these facts do point to nuking/chaining/reclaiming as the way VI seems to want us to go. Its just much tougher for epic mages to do this on a regular basis, and just a lot of extra work for us non-epic mages to do after a fight.<br>
<br>
My suggestion: Add a component based pet heal spell, for the cost of a piece of malachite (okay fine, peridot so as not to infringe upon those with mend companion) , 700 mana, 5min recast, you can CH your pet and allow it to keep its gear/buffs. Also, switch mend companion to a 20 minute timer.<br>
<br>
My Question: I've heard people suggest that VI does not think chaining pets/chain reclaiming is 'appropriate'. Is this hearsay? Or did someone from VI actually post about this at some point? <p>Naladini <BR>

Obviously it was (and still is) the opinion of a majority of mages that heals are a good thing to use (quote: &quot;I just tag a mob with burst of flame, then keep healing pet&quot;).<br>
<br>
Now looking at your analysis it appears that healing is only efficient if the mob is quite weak compared to the pet. Otherwise a nuke (or better dot) seems to be the better choice.<br>

I came to the same conclusions, Raz.  The pet heals are sub par for mana/time/damage/safety ratios then straight out nuking is.<br>
<br>
Being able to summon 3000+ hp worth of pet for 400 mana, it seems odd that we are constrained to a far, far worse ratio when summoning that same energy to infuse the pet with health.<br>
<br>
What I propose is this:<br>
<br>
Transon's Resurgence of the Elements<br>
Increase pet hp by 1500(61) to 1700(65)<br>
Mana Cost: 400<br>
Cast time: 10 seconds<br>
Reagent cost: 1 Malachite (Elemental Pact would remove this regent)<br>
<br>
This essentially gives us a pet heal that would actually come very close to the nuke in balance of your above ratio.  It is similar to the shaman's new heal in mana cost and time, but not quite as good, and has a reagent cost to represent the greater energy we need to use to bring forth that much elemental power and to balance it VS chainsummoning.  Our version of 'complete heal'.  This spell would also by its very nature reinforce our PoP pets to make them that much more viable in a harsh environment (going by the SpData, PoP is going to have some insane mob AoEs, keeping pet alive will be very hard).<br>
<br>
I always thought it was very odd that a priest could heal an unliving minion of pure elemental energy better then a mage could.<br>

<br>
This one should go to the library.<br>
<br>
My meager contribution, regarding pet heals in a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> group</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
In accordance with the above, I believe that pet heals are only usefull in the (not so) rare occasions where smelly stuff hit the fan, and the pet is tanking an add. <br>
<br>
In this case, we are not interested in closing the gap, because the pet might have no chance to actually kill the mob. The only thing we want, is the pet to survive long enough so that the tanks can engage the mob.<br>
<br>
Assuming that you need to buy 30 secs for the main tank, and <br>
(the hp of mob &gt; 30*petdps + magenukes for 30 secs)<br>
and<br>
(mobdps*30 &gt; remaining pet hp)<br>
<br>
then each heal buys 500/mobdps seconds to close this gap. It might be called &quot;The Third Gap&quot; ? =). For a mob with dps 100, it is 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
This is of course basic practical knowlegde to any mage, but I just thought it was fun to have it formalized a bit =). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalanzsonofanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 1986<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 8:00:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Model for evaluating utility of mage pet heals</span><hr size=1> Sigh...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I want a better pet heal&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is assuming the conclusion, once again, sadly.<br>
<br>
What's required is an analysis along the following lines.<br>
<br>
What purpose do pet heals in general serve?<br>
What should one be able to expect from pet heals?<br>
Do pet heals meet those expectations?<br>
If not, how do you fix pet heals?<br>
<br>
What the advocates of the super pet heal seem to be saying is that they expect to be able to save their pets with a single cast of a pet heal, assuming they have the mana and time to cast it.<br>
<br>
In other words, they expect a pet heal about as good as mend companion or a complete heal for pets.<br>
<br>
Is this reasonable?  I still think the answer is no.  First, because it isn't needed, and second, because it would be too powerful.<br>
<br>
An epicked mage chaining existing pet heals can solo the dragon <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yeldema</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, see: <br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=6565.topic">Be wery wery quiet, I'm hunting Dwaguns-How I Solo'd Yeldema</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and other similar threads.  That is close to the top of what can be soloed by any class, and is far better than most other classes can solo.<br>
<br>
Clearly, therefore, a pet complete heal is unnecessary for a solo mage, who already has adequate tools available to him.<br>
<br>
One of the most powerful partners for a mage is a cleric.  One of the chief abilities a cleric brings to that duo is complete heal.  An ordinary pet can be sustained indefinitely using complete heals.  A pet complete heal would allow a mage to fight mobs almost as well as a mage with a cleric partner.<br>
<br>
Thus a simple pet complete heal is too powerful.<br>
<br>
In order for a complete pet heal to not be too powerful, it needs to be limited in a significant way.  Not only should it probably cost a lot of mana, but require an expensive component, such as star ruby, which is used for Banishment, the inverse of a pet complete heal.<br>
<br>
I do see two cases for improved pet heals.<br>
<br>
First, I think it is fair to argue that the 144 minute refresh timer on Mend Companion should be cut in half, without the expenditure of any new AA.  It is an extremely limited form of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Lay on Hands</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which has a 72 minute timer.  I can see no way that this is overpowering or subject to abuse, as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mend Companion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is an emergency spell.<br>
<br>
Second, I think it possible to derive from this model a DPS threshold for AOEs that would force mages to chain pets instead of either healing or nuking.  If such encounters are ordinary on the Planes of Power, then many mages will be forced to rely almost exclusively on a single tactic in those zone, which reduces choice and would make the game frustrating for many mages.<br>
<br>
Some improved pet heal might be a solution to that.  Another solution might be to fix pet immunities, so that most of those AOE's are highly resisted by the appropriate pet.<br>
<br>
With existing pet heals adequate to solo Yeldema, and existing nukes twice or more as efficient as pet heals, it seems mages do not need better pet heals.  Indeed, the model proposed at the top of this page suggest that those who wish to preserve their pets to the end of the fight should try dealing more damage instead, and depend less on pet heals.<br>

<br>
Earth must probably be the worst pet to use heal on because of its low damage mitigation.<br>
<br>
If you rethink this with air (Stuns+high AC) in mind, the heals will come into a different light.<br>
<br>
Mob dps goes down significantly when using an air pet (to some extent the DS dps too) which should put the heal in a better position using your equation.<br>
<br>
This is of course if the Mob does meele damage ...<br>

<br>
At 63 or 65 an improved healing spell is certainly not out of line, I would tend more towards a percentage based heal instead of a straight number of hitpoints though. <br>
<br>
A 40% pet heal at 65 would be quite nice, and an upgrade to existing heals on the new pets (assuming here that they will have more hp than GVoc) but it wont be overbearing when used on older pets.  <p><hr>

Is this reasonable? I still think the answer is no. First, because it isn't needed, and second, because it would be too powerful.<br>
<br>
First of all, YOU think it isn't needed. That is OK. I think it is needed.<br>
<br>
Your view is exactly that. Yours. Mine is mine and as valid as yours.<br>
<br>
As for being over powered, No it isn't as a better heal is still LESS hit points than chaining a new pet, but retains buffs. A fair trade off.<br>
<br>
It is all about giving magician's new options in any situation, and THAT is a very valid reason to evaluate it, and in my opinoin get it. Less cookie cutter style of play style. Heal/Nuke/Chain and a combination. Yes we can heal now, but it is woefully inadaquit on a 4000 point epic pet.<br>

<br>
1) Nukes are more efficient than heals in closing the second gap.  We have already have strong nukes, and strong nukes are an established feature of mages.<br>
2) We can fight strong mobs with the existing pet heals.  When I solo I already have the choice of sustaining a single GV:E pet with the 52 pet heal and intervening with nukes, or chaining pets.  Sustaining is faster, but takes more mana.  Chaining is slower, but takes less mana.  Epicked mages can solo strong opponents without resorting to chaining pets by alternating the two heals.  Between my personal experience of fighting mobs, and the reports on this board, it seems to me that in most circumstances, we have a choice between chaining and sustaining pets, with reasonable tradeoffs between the two.<br>
<br>
From this, I conclude that a better pet heal is not required pre-61.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Calebe:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  It is all about giving magician's new options in any situation<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Lots of things would give mages new options.

<br>
I think this is an excellent example of using pet heals &gt;in combat&lt; but pet heals are also useful outside of combat.<br>
<br>
In a combat situation it is almost always preferable to nuke as you have shown, but I think an improved pet heal could be justified if it were not a combat heal.<br>
<br>
Very often I find myself waiting for my Epic pet to regen his hp so I can fight again.  It isn't so much a question of surviving the fight as it is downtime after the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
A viable solution would be one of the following:<br>
   a) Innate increase on pet regen<br>
   b) Focus item that causes an innate increase in pet regen (Something a bit more accesible than the VT gloves)<br>
   c) Summoned item that has the effect regen<br>
   d) A heal over time spell<br>
   e)  A direct or HOT heal with an adverse component such as torpor<br>
<br>
I agree with you that we do pretty well in surviving a fight, but where we have historically not done so well is how much downtime we have AFTER a fight.<br>

<br>
The first is simply, with those dps numbers on the epic I assume you included its 50 pt ds in the dps.  What Ive noticed is that mobs that hit harder and faster also beat themselves to death more on the ds.  Also they tend to have more hp.  Now, in those situations it seems to me that an unresistable pet heal will do more damage reliably than a nuke might, or close the gap more to follow your line of thought.  So, though I see you chose to ignore resists and of course had to use some dps number for comparison purposes for simplicity, the conclusion is nevertheless different under those circumstances.  Im not trying to say 'oh there is one time when you are wrong', I am trying to point out that against higer dps mobs the value of heal versus nuke tends to shift towards favoring heal.  That doesnt mean heal is better, just that its closer to better.<br>
<br>
Secondly, Id like to see if there was some way to include resists .. or just account for them within a range perhaps.  Doing something like casting malosini to pull with lowers the mobs resists to the epic procs and stun.  For that mana you may well shave off more time by preventing dps to your pet and causing more dps than either nuking or healing.<br>
<br>
Otherwise I see your point.  Pet heals serve me best when Im soloing easier mobs, or when a pet has to tank add in a group.  Against harder mobs nuking is usually more effective in terms of ending the fight fastest.<br>
<br>
But that also brings up a point.  Sometimes Id rather the fight last a little longer to gain more mana and hp medding.  I know it seems wierd, but if the rate you gain resources back is even to your expenditure then making the battles faster will cause you to suffer a net loss of mana, resulting in downtime.  After trying several times to type an explaination for this Ive decided I cant, either youve experienced and know what Im talking about or Im going to sound a bit strange.  But in some areas Ive soloed, casting one heal during the fight or between fights has allowed me to fight faster than casting one nuke per mob.  This is probably because the dk blues are low enough to shift the scale in favor of pet heals.<br>
<br>
Anyways, a good analysis.  Ive thought of things from this point of view in my head many times and wondered whether or not it was better to nuke or heal to finish the fight .. whether I would do more damage by giving pet more time or by nuking flat out.  Seems to me that the numbers favor nuking except that then you deal with resists.  Maybe adding the malo line to the equation will reveal that using it to increase your pets dps and yours via nukes is the most efficient use of mana of all (soloing anyhow)<br>

<br>
Of course with the current heals, they don't measure up. That is the whole point, nuking (barring a resist is better), but why are you dead set against a heal that is meaningful, and would tip the ballance towards healing a pet over nuking unless you need to kill the mob a lot faster?<br>
<br>
Mana used in chaining or healing, is still mana used in a fight and not saved.<br>
<br>
So if the pet was healed for say 1700 hit points for 450 mana. Than the results change to favor healing over nuking, but maybe NOT over chain casting unless you have the epic pet.<br>
<br>
Once again, your tests PROVE what many in favor of a new heal are saying, it needs to be improved.<br>

What I was thinking and meant was that against higher level mobs where resist is more likley healing seems to be at least useful.  Since it has a longer recast its easy to cast a nuke between.  I seem to do better that way than nuking alone.<br>
<br>
I think I will try nuking more and healing less next big solo run I make ... this topic is of great interest to me.  Now I am wondering how worthwhile is it to get a healing focus 3 or mana preservation 3 item ... like will the effects be noticable enough and big enough to change the numbers?  Any mages out there with em that can speak on it?  Also, with SCM 3 this would seem to shift to nuking even more.  I dont have that yet, so I cant say, again any older mages have anything?<br>
<br>
One last thing, if you chain nuke Id imagine you can do more dps than your pet of course ... but then agro is an issue.  As you say, this would be a prime time to heal, agro reasons.  Is the 60 pet heal in conjunction with the 52 just a way to maintain low agro on tough mobs at the expense of mana?  The numbers seem to suggest it ... but that makes the heals seem so less good... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zyrexxshadowfyre>Zyrexx Shadowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 332<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/02 3:05:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Please make proposals here....</span><hr size=1> Raz you have yet to show why we don't need new pet heals. Yes Heals with an &quot;s&quot; as lower level Mages need it too concidering how far apart our heals are after the second one.<br>
<br>
You have proven why you don't need a new pet heal but as stated by others thats your play style.<br>
<br>
Yes some times its better to get a nuke off to help kill faster but what about those times the pet would be dead before your nuke finishes casting ? We need a heal in there to make up for that short fall if you are not the chain petting type of Mage.<br>
<br>
Make the heals cost enough that you do have a choice between chaining or healing at the level you get the heal but don't make it an idiotic cost since we are never going to C-heal our pets.<br>
<br>
This is not about weather we need it for your play style but if other play styles need some help. <p><center><TABLE><TR>

<br>
The question is, are the heals nearly useless?  Or do they do their proper job adequately?<br>
<br>
Are the heals only intended to reduce down time for vested pets <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (epic, equipment, buffs, etc.)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?<br>
<br>
If that is the case, then first, that is a pretty marginal role for those spells, and second, there is some disatisfaction expressed by mages.<br>
<br>
Are the heals intended to intervene during fights on behalf of pets?  This seems obvious, as it the purpose of heals generally <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (one does not usually wait between combats to heal if one can avoid it)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  If this is the case, are they good enough?<br>
<br>
This model shows that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>if</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> you can nuke, then against most stronger mobs, nuking is better.  Since nukes are faster and more efficient than heals, the limiting factor appears to be aggro.  Heals are much less aggro.<br>
<br>
If heals are an aggro management tool to help intervene on behalf of pets, then are they adequate?  The idea being that chain nuking would get you aggro, but that alternating nukes and heals does not, and is better than simply pausing between nukes.<br>
<br>
I have found that against most but not all enemies I solo, if I so chose to, I can sustain a single GV:E pet through the fight by alternating heals and damage spells.<br>
<br>
So I conclude they are adequate for me.<br>
<br>
While I mostly choose to chain, I have the choice to sustain instead.  Chaining pets is more mana efficient, but takes longer, and allows me to solo somewhat stronger opponents, but at greater risk.  Sustaining pets takes much more mana, but is faster and safer.  It is a more conservative approach.<br>
<br>
Seems like I have a choice of fighting styles then, both of which are adequate, and both of which involve trade-offs.<br>
<br>
Seems balanced to me.<br>
<br>
If the purpose of the pet heal is to save the pet from death when the fight goes ill, then the existing pet heals are not adequate.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mend Companion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> serves that purpose.  However, it may not be sufficient.<br>
<br>
While I remain unconvinced of the need or appropriateness of a super pet heal, it is clear that many magicians would like such a spell.<br>
