According to the post below &quot;after the patch&quot; sure looks like it. No worries now they will need more mages on raids to supply even more rods. For all the healing debuffing on partial and full hits from mobs that were resisted prepatch. This will undoubtedly make mages popular with groups in places with charm casting mobs. You do get xp for rogue pets don't you? <br>
 As an FYI if you and or your friends or pets are getting hit<br>
by spells more than you were prepatch. Please list the mob<br>
the  resist check IE FR, MR, CR ,DR, PR. The level of person and their resist at time of spell landing. Name of spell or effect<br>
to. If we collectively can come up with some hard resist numbers postpatch that will be extremely helpful to not just<br>
mages. But to the whole player base of everquest.<br>
Just a thought but if pets are deemed hazardous in encounters<br>
your DPS just went way down on raids. And a petless mage in<br>
an xp setting is more useless than a &lt;insert cliche of choice&gt;<br>
.<br>
 If it continues on in the same vein how many of you are going<br>
to be able to meet the resist numbers to xp and still have decent stats.<br>
 You know mana pool, hit points, AC etc.<br>
 I know if I had to wear a full raid resist set and them some<br>
just to xp. Thats just as bad as the xp nerf in and of itself.<br>
My xping would suk hard. Another thought on Graffes the show<br>
ep xp parse shows a 25% reduction for stuff most post 50 mages are going to be able to solo. <br>
 No worries your friends will understand that your petless DPS<br>
 suks and invite you along right?<br>
 No worries your friends will understand that your DPS suks even more cause you have to wear all that resist gear right?<br>
 No worries your friends groups will want you for COTH and Trod's and summoned focus items right?<br>
No worries POP is right around the corner and they will fix things right?<br>
The resist change is a silghtly altered version of the BS they tried to slip in a few months ago or worse.<br>
This is a nerf for all players  IMO across all playstyles and levels. This is even worse that they are playing the smoke and mirrors game with first the xp nerf and semi unnerf.Break<br>
the xping and resists at the same time and just fix the xping<br>
somewhat.<br>
Have fun<br>

<br>
i see people posting things like this and it makes me laugh..<br>
<br>
hey,, on expn'  ,, just wear some dam resist gear.. remember when your pet Didn't resist spells??<br>
<br>
I sure do..<br>
<br>
I LOVE the pet holding our resists against casting mobs.. why??  because if ,,  IF,, i don't have enough R in something,, the PET takes the dmg,  not I..,,  <br>
<br>
it's not hard to tailor your R gear to the mobs your hunting for exp.. and on any Raids,, yes they said R's were changing.. for the better I think,, before it was silly having same hits on you , if you had 150 or 350..<br>
<br>
if your pet eats some hard resists on a Raid,, it means YOU don't have enough,,   just make another pet.<br>
<br>
<br>
standard hunting gear for a mage, with tov,, NOT uber mob, nor uber Lucan stuff, nor N tov.  you can easily hold your resists to 150 each  without other people buffs.  and it is very easy to push any said R over 200.  Poison is prob the hardest for most to get up,, and with only a little pp spent in the bazaar you can push it to 200 without DEVESTATING your other stats.<br>
<br>
use your pets HP&quot;s to your advantage..<br>

I dunno I'm going to log in and examine resist gear but regardless I have 210 magic resist and my Pet was charmed.., My shaman with 150 cold was hit by something 10 levels below it for full dmg from a cold spell everytime, My Warrior 200 fire on a naggy raid and slaughtered.... and because of that I think this resist thing needs more work..  Perhaps pets like familars can add a boost to the casters resist, as I am not confident in the ability to achieve good stats int/ac/mana/hps and resists at the same time. <br>
<br>
If you have some suggestions for good balance resist and stat gear post them. i'D like to know.<br>

A resist of 200 seems to have minimal effects post-patch, and yet a resist of 200 is above and beyond what most people will ever see.  While it's standard on raids for third-tier guilds, it's certainly not for xp groups roaming around doing their thing... or the majority of guilds doing raids in Everquest.  I've seen posts referring to resist levels that even most high-end players will never, ever... EVER see having absolutely no effect.  As I said on Caster's Realm under another alias, it's as though they simply took Resist gear out of the game... as though the numbers just don't mean anything at all anymore.  Levels either, at least when it comes to mobs vs players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujazzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#333333>(9/8/02 12:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=673.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .. well...</span><hr size=1> VI is pretty much destroying the game. There need to keep people playing is just going to drive more people away. I was reading a website a few weeks back and it was saying how EQ is losing people daily and new subscrition rate is declining. Also people that renew are at a all time low. I think they are trying to keep the game alive for another year or so but I honestly believe they are breaking the game. Clerics soloing? Druids/Shaman casting CH? Mages Mana Whores?<br>
<br>
The List goes on and it is a shame. When I started playing this game right before Kunark was released it was so much fun and so much potential. There were really few uber guilds and even the ones that were uber didn't break the game. Now there are uber melee running around with super weapons killing anything in there way. <br>
<br>
Mana Burn teams are driving people away from the game. I know of a number of people that have quit on my server because they couldn't get a white scale, green scale ect....because manaburn team kills Sev and Gore every time they pop. It is really a shame but VI chooses to do nothing to fix the problem. <br>
<br>
EQ is dying and VI/SOE knows it. That is why they are working on EQ2 and they also know once SWG is released alot of people are going to leave EQ in droves. EQ is in the cancer stage of it's life. The doctor has just said &quot;You have cancer and there is nothing we can do to get rid of it&quot;.  Basically they know EQ is dying they are tossing any bandaid, miracle cure they can at it to squeez as many more dollars out of it they can.<br>
<br>
I would expect maybe one more expansion after Planes of Profit at the most if that even happens. Eventually we will see a announcement saying it is no longer finacially beneficial for us to upgrade Everquest. We will maintain servers ect...but content will not see anymore upgrades. We encourage those that do want to see new content and new beginings to try EQ2..<br>
<br>
It is just a matter of time.....<br>
