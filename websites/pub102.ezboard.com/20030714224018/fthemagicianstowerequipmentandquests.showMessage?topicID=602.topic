First, I got the stone marker from MM.  Next I went to Lake Rathe and went to the tower in the south-east corner.  I saw one stone skel and it's pet (both blue) so I thought I'd try it.  After CR, I decided that I needed to do this with a group (I am, er.. was 32).  <br>
<br>
Actually it turned out that there were two skellies and two pets.  I was wondering if this tower is the only place to get the heart of stone.  Is there some place where I can get this solo?  I know I can't solo the Tonta Knight, but I'm hoping that it will be easier to find a pickup group in Guk. <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~tabb/XtalName1.jpg">

The skellies are severly under conned.  Back when I did this, we had a full group of late 20's and a couple high 30's and we all died or zoned.  I suggest you enlist a high-level friend to help out.<br>
<br>
As for the knight, when he pops he always drops the boots.  It's a specific knight, kind of in a corner, in an area up the stairs I think.  He has a PH, so your main wait will be the PH.<br>
<br>
But get these boots.  You'll never wear them, but they are your &quot;petkillers&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usampox.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sampox</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/01 11:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   actually</span><hr size=1> Just finished this quest the other day, here are my notes:<br>
<br>
Glyphed guard: easy, no problems<br>
<br>
Stone Skeleton: mean bastard with annoying pet. i was able to single pull since im level 47 but he was still able to take a mean chunk of health off of me AND my pet...maybe i was doing something wrong but this guys DD was smacking me  /shrug<br>
<br>
Tonta Knight: does not always drop the boots, i had to kill three before i got them. the little camp at the top of the stairs can be rough. you WILL aggro things at the bottom of the stairs (and shamans frogs standing around will heal the other ones) i decided to brute force my way in and summoned a pet right there at the stairs. I had to gate on my first try because the frogs jumped me and interrupted casting of the pet.<br>
<br>
this quest is a tad harder than it seems solo especially at level 30ish<br>
<br>
i would say get some friends or wait, the boots are great to have but you dont really need them for the effect until you get to places like karnors and other dungeons.<br>
<br>
they give the same effect look as jboots...which made me happy until i got my jboots the next day... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uquezzy.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quezzy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(3/16/01 7:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: actually</span><hr size=1> I was wandering around in Guk (still hadn't trashed my faction) when I ran into a helpful Troll (red to me).  He showed me where the Tonta Knight spawned and in a few minutes (before I had finished summoning my pet) the Tonta Knight spawned.  My pet was beating on the Knight and I was casting when the Idealist spawned behind me and was trying (rather ineffectively) to beat on me from behind.  I don't think he interrupted me even onece (man I love channeling).  Anyway, I took out the knight and looted the boots (they dropped on the first try), but the Troll out damaged me on the Idealist (it was his spawn after all).  When my pet went chasing out of the room after a third frog, I decided to Gate before finding out which friend he would bring back.<br>
<br>
Now I need only the heart of stone.  I'll try to get a chanter or Druid to go wiith me to break that camp.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone here for your help.<br>
<br>
BTW: Flobin, not all knights drop the Soiled Boots, only the Tonta Knight who spawns in one spot.<br>

So second time around I cleared all the frogs up to the tonta knight room and I sat in the room and waited for him to pop.  He popped the next round and I got my boots.  The other mage that was there with me (lvl 45) got her boots on the next spawn.  Then we headed to lake rathe and killed some skeletons... pretty easy at 46.  But those skellies just don't drop 'em at all, we killed at least 15 of 'em before they dropped 2.  And now we both need the glyph marker (she's 53 now and I'm 51) and we terrorized mistmoore yesterday (I charged in like a n00b and died. WOOT!... lesson learned, don't charge in like a n00b) and we didn't get any stone markers.  She's been there 3 times previously, after about 15 dead glyph guards, still no marker.  We are so sad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hopefully we can go back and terrorize again.  We got our power of wind, an advisor robe and a sacrificial dagger, so it wasn't a total loss.  And when we left, I think we caused the biggest train I've ever seen... about 7 gargoyles, 10 or so of those DE guards, 20 more that we trained on the path out to the zone line... that was funny.  Train to zone just doesn't describe it well enough...  lemme just say, Mistmoore has the worst pathing I've ever encountered in EQ.  Especially the ball room.  Make sure you have a puller that knows what they're doing, and my god, don't EVER charge in there like a n00b and get killed like I did. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
oh and I had another point, there's a ring that drops off of goblins in Loio, it is all/all and clickable effect is invis vs. animals.  The trick is that you gotta be wearing the ring.  So if you have a finger spot open, just go get one of these rings and you'll be set until you get your boots.<br>

I was able to explore the dungeon without fear since I hadn't messed up my faction yet.  I was lucky enough to encounter some high level powerleveling someone and they had cleared the little room with the tonta knight.  They left right when I got there but when I found the room there were 2 frogs in it.  I summoned an earth pet(didn't want runners) and had it attack the two.  It wasn't too bad, I got a coupled named(got the vial of eg whites) then the tonta knight spawned and I got the boots.  I think I spent about 45 min to an hour there.  I'd say breaking the room would be the worse since I think there's 4 spawns in there but after that, it's not too bad.  I am level 31 btw.<br>

I am not underestimating the difficulty of these.  They were very tough.. and as you can imagine with a group of low-mid 20's, they were very tough.  But, we got good exp there and we did okay.  Sometimes you get lucky and end up in a good group... this was one of those days.<br>

With a full group it was suprisingly easy.  Breaking it was difficult, but with everyone nuking (we had 3 pet classes I think) it was fine. Once broken we just pulled them as they popped.  I can't remember the con, sorry :(  The stones dropped with regularity, and after a few minutes they were just left to rot on the corpse.<br>

Did the rest of the quest at level 35 (I think).  Got boots on second Tonta spawn, and tagged along with a guild Dire Wolf raid in Mistmoore to get the marker, which was quite common. <p><TABLE WIDTH=290 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>

The uguk part took me about 45 min.<br>
The rathe part was easy.. I just pulled with a nuke<br>
and if I recall only one skell came at me.<br>
I got lucky on the MM part, someone trained a ton<br>
of stuff up near the zone and I just looted the item..<br>
<br>
All in all I think I spent around 3 hours total..<br>
All magi's should do this quest.. The boots as wearable are<br>
useless, ut the pet killing invis is very needed...<br>

<br>
I did the whole quest during the last 2 days when I was lvl 40 (and still am ;-) )<br>
<br>
Started with the Stone Marker off the Glyphed Guards in Mistmoore. I think even at 40 that hardly would have been possible solo. There are too many things that will aggro you.<br>
Anyway...my guild had a raid there anyway for some items, so I was able to convince them to camp the Graveyard for a bit. The 3rd guard we killed dropped a Stone Marker.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I then moved to Lake Rathe. Now as all the people say, there are 2 Skellies and 2 Pets in the tower. Now, I didnt think i could take them alone (and didn't want to die because I was bound in Timorous deep).<br>
So I decided to do it the &quot;safe way&quot; and waited until there was someone of appropriate level in the zone. Finally found some lvl 36 warrior who was willing to help me. He didn't know the place (why should he? ;-) ) so he told me &quot;but I'm only lvl 36&quot;. I told him that my Pet would probably do the main work, and he only had to step in after a while when my Pet is probably dead but all enemies already hurt.<br>
Now...it was a bit of cake. Pet didn't die, warrior lost maybe 40 health (hehe...at the end he didnt want to serve as &quot;backup&quot; ,-) ). For his help he wanted a few Rings of Flight which I gave him gladly.<br>
Afterwards I had to kill the spawn 3 more times (which wasnt a problem: The skelletons were solo then and didnt have a Pet yet...) until the Heart dropped.<br>
<br>
Then I went over to Upper Guk.<br>
Now, I didn't know the place really. I was once in there with a small grouped (which got wiped ;-) ) in my early 20's but that was enough that I already had a bad faction with them ;-)<br>
First I went in invis and scouted the way to the Tonta room.<br>
Even they were all green I didn't think I could make it: 3 Frogloks in the room plus 1 nearby on the stairs.<br>
Now, all guildmembers were pretty busy, but I just didn't want to wait anymore and decided that it was a good day for dieing ;-)<br>
So I went in...summoned an earth pet in the entry room and tested it with the 2 Frogloks at the entrance. It was a 38-hitter, so that was fine with him. Gave him everything I could (Coldstones, Rings of Flight, Plate Armor,elemental defender,... maybe it helps ;-) ) and parked him there.<br>
(earth Pet because I thought being able to root the MOBs might prevent some trains ,-) )<br>
Now I couldnt go through the dungeon invis...but I hoped the Frogloks wouldnt jump me until I'm in or near the room.<br>
It worked almost out...got to the stairs without being jumped.<br>
But there 3 Frogloks decided that I went too far.<br>
Started to cast Summon companion and at 4th try ot so I got it through. was at 50 health at that time and didnt think I would make it. But the Pet killed them quickly, so I didnt even get under 40 health.<br>
Afterwards I killed the 2 remaining Frogloks in the room (only the placeholder was there) and then waited about 20 minutes for the respawn. Tonta Knight pop'ed, was killed, had soiled Boots...happy Mage ;-)<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
I think MM isn't possible solo even around lvl 40. (maybe possible, but you will need some luck at least)<br>
Rathe Mountains...was too cowardly to try it, but I think with 2 Mages and 2 Pets on your Pet it should be hard, so you might need some help to break the spawn.<br>
Guk: no problem to solo if they are all green to you.<br>
<br>
and there's another happy mage in town, who could finally switch his raw silk sandals with some &quot;real&quot; booties ;-) <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uambrosiapancakes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AmbrosiaPancakes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(5/28/02 1:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   asd;flkj</span><hr size=1> the hardest part for me was the waiting for the soiled boots to drop... thats about the extent of the toughness though... just bring a full group of 35's and youd do this easy <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uizarek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izarek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#333333>(5/28/02 2:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: asd;flkj</span><hr size=1> I did this quest at 51 (woah REALLY late <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

That hot key is in the upper left corner of my first panel of hot keys so I can cast the boots while running.<br>
<br>
When I go into a dungeon where Jboots don't work anyway, I exchange the Jboots for the earthen boots.  Earthen boots are my instant kill pet books, clickable, when the damn pet goes amuck.  No mana, no mem'ing of an invisible spell which takes up a spell slot, and pet doesn't have to be within ear shot.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showPrevMessage?topicID=602.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showNextMessage?topicID=602.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=602.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.threadControl?topicID=602.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=602.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=602.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests>Quests</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
