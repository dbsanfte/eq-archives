<br>
Secondly any charm that can charm a mob hitting for 400+ and be used to help gain exp is a bit absurd imo.  <br>
<br>
I don't care if its mages, BLs, or warriors that get it.  Its absurd.<br>
<br>
For those enchanters posting here saying that CoD isn't all that...obviously it must be for most that have it because they use it and gain a lot of EXP.<br>
<br>
So you take a death and no rez and lose some exp.  Well that exp is going to be gained back pretty quickly soloing things right?  So I don't think that death is a valid arguement to 'oh, CoD has risks!!!'<br>
<br>
Funny that you don't see many chanters successfully charming and soling for EXP until 60+ (I'm talkin as a new char, not a twink with 255 int and 200 cha).  Why not?  Because charm breaks pretty often at lower levels and then you will probably die well over 80% of the time with 2 mobs beating on you.  <br>
<br>
The same risk applies with CoD but I don't think we need to go into great detail on the spell choice differences between a lvl 45 and a lvl 65 enchanter.<br>
<br>
However the thing is EXP gained.  So what if you lose 3, 4 blue.  You can make it all back with very minimal time.  At lvl 45 try eating 3 or 4 blue and then going back out trying to solo again.  You'll find yourself going backwards at a quick pace.  Losing 3 or 4 blue at 45 hurts anyone, solo or not.  The EXP gained at these levels just isn't all that great.<br>
<br>
Death is a pitiful excuse as a 'risk' in PoP.  The EXP is too high to say 'Oh I won't use this spell because there's a chance that after I make half a AA point of EXP, I might die!'.  Who cares if you die?  Eat the EXP loss, grind for an hour (being generous =P) and then you're back at where you started if not more.<br>
<br>
I'd say make CoD completely random and can break at any time, regardless of skill.  Still very powerful but now you take the chance at dying a lot more unless you're very good.<br>
<br>
By making it random, it becomes much harder to control but the really good chanters should still be ok if they play smart.<br>
<br>
Or have a few 'token' mobs around that can be charmed that do maybe 150 max dmg and have about same hps as mage pets.  That way they can be used for raid-type mobs for some extra damage but won't be able to be used to farm EXP at an extremely high rate. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wrathen@themagicianstower>Wrathen</A> at: 12/20/02 5:21:58 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wezloc>Wezloc</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#333333>(12/20/02 8:08:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: re:CoD</span><hr size=1> When a enchanter with the help of a cleric can charm a pet and haste it to do more damage then 3 or 4 roges something is wrong.

There isnt anything to debate, if youve seen cod you know what we are talking about, if you havent please kindly dont offer discenting opinion or at least admit you come from an unknowledgable standpoint, because you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>dont</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> know what youre talking about.<br>
<br>
These are the facts:<br>
-Enchanters, a class which <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be doing roughly paladin level damage, should not be doing chain-nuking-wizard, chain-nuking-mage and pet, or end-game-rogue-vs-green-trash damage. <br>
I dont care how risky you pretend it is, the fact is it cant be all that risky if you are charming pets for most of the duration of most of your experience groups can it?<br>
<br>
-No class should walk into pop with 100 aa, and about a month later have 340 (yes an enchanter on sz did this). It trivializes the game and experience.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>No class</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should have access to an ability which trivializes so many roles (damage dealing and tanking) to the point where you can exp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>better</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than a group <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> do it with the assistance of just ONE (1) class. In fact even a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>solo</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> enchanter probably could exp as well as a group.<br>
<br>
-A class which is easily one of the most group friendly should not also solo better than a well put together exp group makes exp.<br>
<br>
Charm breaks <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of those above outlined basic properties of balance, to the point where there is no reason to play any other class besides an enchanter. They have the best damage mitigation (tanking, mezzes, slows, runes, stuns, root, ect), the best supportive abilities (haste and c), and the best damage dealing (380 was the highest furor claims to have logged). Litterally the only thing enchanters cant do is heal, in fact they probably can even do that if they charm a cleric pet, lol. <br>
<br>
Lets be honest with ourselves, you cant say thats working can you?

As for what are we going to do?  No idea, probably the same thing we did about Dire Charm.  Whine and moan and then just give up because obviously it doesn't matter.  Frankly I'm more willing to except the CoD charm than DC, at least it breaks every so often.  DC pets &gt; mage pets in some zones, which is mildly irratating.

thats not true at all - there are many dc pets that can outdamage a mage + epic pet easily.  The dc pet also tanks way better since it has like 4 or 5 times the hps as the epic pet as well. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=412980">Lorcann</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

Can anyone explain in what way the risks involved are any worse than the risks that solo mages face? Sure, we mages can't solo in the new planes, but if we could, in what way is a broken charm worse than a simple add that we might see? In fact given the huge variety of tools to deal with the situation that enchanters have, I'd say that enchanters have less risk involved than a mage.<br>
<br>
Broken charm means dealing with a mob that may hit for 500? That's not a danger of charming, that's a danger of soloing.<br>
<br>
I don't want to see charm taken away, but it should be tuned down some. A long recast on charms might be appropriate. A charm limit per mob might be appropriate (can't be charmed more than once per half hour?). The continual use of mana like bard charm isn't a bad idea. Charm should be a great way to turn an add into an ally, but not a mainstay tactic of a class, unless it was thier sole gig.<br>
<br>
If chanters can do that kind of damage as a primarily support role, how much damage should offensive melee and casters be doing? or how much utility should damage classes be given to help even out the roles? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fassade>Fassade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(12/21/02 1:44:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What are we to do about Command of Druzzil</span><hr size=1> [quote]Funny that you don't see many chanters successfully charming and soling for EXP until 60+ (I'm talkin as a new char, not a twink with 255 int and 200 cha). Why not? Because charm breaks pretty often at lower levels and then you will probably die well over 80% of the time with 2 mobs beating on you. [/quote]<br>
<br>
Charm breaks no more often or more quickly with Beguile than it does the higher level spells, and the death ratios are roughly equivalent, as well.  Enchanters have always charmed -- I have aggressively charmed, solo and in groups since level 20 and my second color stun.  (I was and am not a twink - I am only partially ashamed to admit I wore 3 pieces of cloth until level 46.)   Smart enchanters would pick the proper mobs to charm, and use whatever tools they could (speed, distance, runes, berserker, root, mez) to minimze the risk, but it was always there.<br>
<br>
The equation has always been the same -- buy yourself enough time to regain control, or die.  Without a dedicated healer, it is in fact more difficult to recharm a CoD pet than it was a Rockfiend in the Grey, a Guard in Kael, a Frog in OS, a Spectre in Oasis.  (Not being one the 200AA enchanters myself, I cannot vouch as to how easy or difficult they have it in PoP -- there are not many of those around.)  With a dedicated healer and an alert group, the enchanter has always been able to add significant damage with relatively low risk, as long as the group paid attention.  If the group slacked, they died.  CoD level mobs are at least as risky as the corresponding mobs were to corresponding enchanters from earlier eras.  This begs the question -- why does charm seem so much more popular now, even among enchanters who rarely used it?<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the answer is not that CoD is suddenly so much easier, it is that the downsides of death are not nearly as severe as they were in earlier eras.  There are two reasons for this:<br>
<br>
1) PoP experience yeilds.<br>
2) Graveyards.<br>
<br>
In earlier eras, if you charmed and hasted an Illis Knight in lower OS or a Fire Giant in SolB, you could outdamage a group, but, if you wiped your group, you were in for some pain.  As a result, people did not often do it.  (Yes, some still did, but pickup groups were far less tolerant.)  In PoP, the pain is almost nonexistent.  Did a charmed Hobgoblin wipe you deep in the Tunnels?  No problem -- CR is a 15-30 minute proposition, with all equipment, guaranteed.  Did you die three times in a row in PoV?  No problem -- 25 minutes of grinding will return ALL the experience lost, and then some.  <br>
<br>
PoP therefore encourages high-risk play, and it does not come higher than charm.  The risk of death is the same as it ever was for charm enchanters -- high, but manageable under certain circumstances with the proper backup -- but the penalties for failure are so mild that enchanters and groups are getting bolder in using the ability.  As groups become bolder about using charm, as the initial poster indicated, some have built groups around it to reduce the risk further.<br>
<br>
As long as the penalties for failure in PoP remain so minimal, people will keep angling for the highest reward behavior they can find, regardless of risk, and that is likely to remain charm, unless the skill is nerfed to near uselessness. <p>&lt;font size=&quot;-1&quot; face=&quot;Arial,Hevetica,Sans-Serif&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52833&quot;&gt;My Magelo Profile&lt;/a&gt; |<br>

There's always SOMETHING that enchanters do that you have to whine about. I've been lurking on these boards since before Luclin, and there has to be at least one thread every 2 weeks on some type of enchanter abilitity that has to be 'nerfed' for the good of the game. From regular charm to animation pets, to insanity to animation empathy (yes there was actually a rant on this board about enchanters getting the ability to attack with their animations with an aa /boggle), and lately to Command of Druzzil, all have been asked to be nerfed on these boards. And most of the time, it's always because of some reason like &quot;Enchanters are a support class, they shouldn't have any offense&quot; or &quot;Mages lose their identity as pet classes&quot;. Never mind that a lot of people seem to ignore the fact that enchanters have always been situationally the best damage dealers in the game since charm was implemented back in beta, with the always omnipresent risk that this damage could turn against you at any time. It just  wasn't as glaring back then as very little people chose to take the risk and mobs weren't hitting for 500+.<br>
<br>
Just an FYI, as you probably have seen, other classes have the exact same 'overpowered' discussion about mages and their power in PoP. And it's not like if mages don't know about those 'discussions'.<br>

<br>
As you are trying to find ways to get enchanters nerfed, other classes are trying to find ways to get mages toned down. Of course each of those discussions get laughed at by the mage community as penis-envy or how they don't know anything about mages. I know that mages simply love to laugh at druids or rogues when they make such threads. Also remember the whole Firebolt of Tallon thing with wizards? Yet how are those threads different then threads such as this one? <br>
<br>
Don't say 'Oh but it's different in this case'. Other classes genuinely believe that mages need nerfing just as much as mages and some other classes genuinely believe that charming needs nerfing. The threads are more similar then you think, yet because 'you' (as mages) bring it up it's somehow more valid then some other classes concerns about mages? C'mon who are you fooling?<br>
<br>
The thing is, these types of threads rarely solve anything other then to create bad blood between classes, or brand a class as a bunch of whiners. The safehouse is often branded as the nerfhouse due to such types of threads. The mage community unfortunatly has also received this type of 'infamousy' with threads such as this one.<br>
<br>
Oh and for points on CoD? I don't have to make them. Canatatus has already made a number of them already. And anyways, they will just fall on deaf ears by those who will always believe that enchanters should be nothing more then buff whores. At least I am pleased to see there are some mages who don't follow the angry mob and don't believe that charm needs nerfing.<br>
<br>
(BTW I became a heavy charm user in my late 40's early 50's. Things haven't changed at all from back then with how charm works other then the fact that now mobs give insane exp in PoP which makes any zone in any other expansion pale in comparison. So much so that death is no longer a fear. The problem is PoP design, not charm.)<br>

The squeaky wheel consistantly gets the grease with Verant.  If people are complaining about charm, Verant will likely nerf it.<br>

There isn't always room to run around a mob without fear of aggroing more.  You need to get pretty far away to cast a 5 second casting spell, but I suppose an Affliction Haste item helps with that (believe it brings it down to 3.1 secs).<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> Evidence, well my first post is not a fabrication. But it is only ONE situation, and one that personally impacted me. I was pass for an additional cleric in a 6 person group. That is the point of my post, it's more effective to have 2 clerics in this particular situation. 1 cleric for the group and one for the enchanter. The only time prior to CoD that you wanted multiple clerics was to setup a CH chain on the MT for boss mobs. This is no longer true.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, I meant concrete evidence.  I'd love to see parsed logs of fights with 600+dps since I've never parsed a charmed pet as doing over 250dps.<br>
<br>
As for having 2 clerics in a group, I think a lot of clerics would say that is great.  As you stated, it's hard for a cleric to get a group if all clerics already have one.  However, I can say without exaggeration that even 2 clerics can't keep an Enchanter alive if charm breaks at the wrong time.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I honestly think people should stop asking to be nerfed - this includes other classes wanting Mages nerfed - instead people should be asking for Verant to relook at the balance of the game.  If something is out of whack, they need to fix it.  I can't believe people are upset because Enchanters have utility in and out of a group.  In my honest opinion, Verant should be balancing other classes against the Enchanter class.  Having the ability to be useful to a group in so many different ways shouldn't make a class overpowered, it should be the way all classes are in my opinion. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

You dont understand how the game works do you? <br>
Theres a reason there are so many damage classes and so few healing-capable classes. That is because there is supposed to be roughly a 1:3 ratio for healing:offense in most groups. <br>
<br>
Almost all full groups have this make up, even ae groups:<br>
1 class whos primary job is to heal<br>
2 classes who primary job is to mitigate damage<br>
3 classes whos primary job is to deal damage.<br>
<br>
The most common set up is 1 healer (cleric or druid usually), 1 tank (pal/shd/war), 1 slower (ench/sham/bard), and 3 damage dealers (mag/rog/wiz/nec/rang/bst)<br>
<br>
Some classes are less specilized, and have distinguished secondary roles. They can be paired up with other less specilized classes to reinforce these secondary roles to make them as strong as a specilized classes primary role. For example a good shaman and druid together through slowing and kiting/root parking, and hots and quick heals can simulate the healing of a cleric and the damage mitigation of an enchanter (both respective specialists in their fields).<br>
<br>
You see if groups take as many enchanters as they can get and 2 clerics, not only are you trivializing the game through broken experience making, but you are making it harder for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>me, and players of other classes like mine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to get exp. The pathetic 100-160 dps that offensive classes do is absolutely pointless when for a nominal risk an enchanter can do well over 160 (plus perform the real role the enchanter was designed to do primarily: damage mitigation)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> As you stated, it's hard for a cleric to get a group if all clerics already have one.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Tough cookies clerics. Thats the price you pay for having a group slot practically all to yourself, whom your only real competition is druids (who are only taken when acleric cant be found). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 12/21/02 2:58:30 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2491<br> <font color=#333333>(12/21/02 3:13:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Does CoD = 300+ sustained DPS?

<br>
The question is, is or isn't it a real problem?<br>

<br>
Mages are well advised to remember the last time charm got out of hand.

This hurt mages far more than it hurt enchanters.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is unlikely to demonstrate much insight into the actual nature of the problem, and any remedy they may implement is likely to be worse than the original problem.<br>
<br>
It seems fairly clear that any class being able to sustain in excess of twice the DPS of the next best damage dealer is overpowering.  Is this really the case?  Do enchanters with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Command of Druzzil</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sustain over 300 DPS using with only a priest to aid them?<br>
<br>
How much risk or cost would balance 300+ DPS?<br>

<br>
Is it unfair for you to offer actual proof that charm is overpowered?  This makes no sense.  How can you all just sit there and spout knee jerk reactions to things after all the crap mages have gone through over the same thing?  A mage said it was overpowered, its up to that mage, or others who take up that cause, to prove it is so.  Do it already.  If its so freaking obvious ... DO IT.  That does not mean post about your feelings, or the obviousness of the situation,or 4 out of 5 dentists chose crest so it has to be the best.  Do the work if you want to complain about it.  And Judging from your past history...your more then capable of doing it when you are so inclined.  <br>
<br>
As for this:<br>
<br>
&quot;Broken charm means dealing with a mob that may hit for 500? That's not a danger of charming, that's a danger of soloing.&quot;<br>
<br>
Come on?  I'm going to be nice here....I'm really going to try.  But this is getting frustrating.  Read what I quoted.  Do you see anything wrong?  <br>
<br>
There is a vast difference between the risk a mage takes soloing and that an enchanter does.  The difference may not necessarily imply greater, but it is incredibly different.<br>
<br>
Think about what happens when you charm.....you charm a mob, you then use the MOB to fight another mob.  Ok, now...charm breaks.  What do you have? Not one mob that hits for 500, but most likely TWO.  Yes, enchanters have ways of dealing with it..and most likely the second mob is slowed already..but 2 hard hitting mobs coming after you with no pet to hold agro&gt; one mob on your pet.<br>
<br>
Please, come on guys, I'm begging you.  If you think charm is overpowered, fine, thats perfect.  Please, atleast do not embarrass the magician community by whining with no proof and then stating obviously faulty arguments as your backing.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I find it highly laughable that people have problems with someone gaining xp quickly.  The casual player base has long been moaning for high end gear without high end effort for awhile..and whenever things are made quicker or easier for someone , everyone else gets their panties in a bunch.  <br>
<br>
Bleh, gonna let this post ramble some because its frustrating and I have time to kill.  <br>
<br>
Level 61 nameless mage with crap gear is equal or greater then an end game rogue, true or false?<br>
<br>
Mages JUST went through mindless melee knee jerk idiocy over our dps.  They refused to offer any hard evidence..just their feelings.  We saw first hand how respectable those feelings are.  They do not work, most people just can't see past &quot;oh wow pet did 90 dps to a level 1 mob&quot;.  Bleh, Noonie, you of all people should see why this whole post is horsehit and NOT because of the topic..but because of how mages are handling it.  <br>
<br>
If we made a rule that you had to thoroughly examine anything you want to complain about from every angle..and come up with convincing evidence for your feelings prior to posting...alot of this crap would stop.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and, Interesting that enchanters are supposed to do paladin damage.  Could we get a link to where that is stated? or is that text lost with the one that says mages aren't damage dealers either?<br>
<br>
Please guys, prove this crap if you want to say it..otherwise why not just cut and paste the whine threads from the safe house and Monkly business about mages and sub enchanters in everytime you see the word &quot;mage&quot; for the sake of speed.  <br>
<br>

Its just not something you can do and maintain any sense of dignity.<br>
<br>
That said, its hard to take one of the two most group friendly support classes (and to be honest all classes), and just pile on incredible DPS and consider this even remotely appropriate.<br>
<br>
I'm not, and I won't call for a nerf. But it needs to be looked at. Charmed pets out damaging <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>every single class in the game</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> including damage specialists is quite simply out of control.<br>
<br>
An Enchanter towing a single Druzziled mob can do <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that I can do but just a lot better. Speed, slow, crowd control, clarity and the best damage dealing ability in the game really just staggers you when you think about it. It makes the Magician requests that were around here a while ago for slow seem tame by comparison.<br>
<br>
Comparisons to the Monk and Rogue whines are inappropriate. Maybe if a Magician had slow and was able to conjure 2-3 Servants of Marr it would be in the same ballpark, but its just not. The difference between the two is enormous, on the one hand Mages (a damage class by design) were treading on the toes of the first-tier damage dealers and vying for the place of first, here a class with an undisputed position as a premier support class invalidates all three damage classes.<br>
<br>
Again, no nerfs. <br>
<br>
No nerfs.<br>
<br>
How in the world do you fix this though? Having read and carefully digested every single post here, I don't see a solution. The combination of extremely powerful PoP mobs, very powerful PoP and otherwise spells such as Ancient Rune, incredible experience rewards and no-mess corpse recovery makes any solution that is not a nerf turn the game on its face.<br>
<br>
My best friend in the entire game is an Enchanter, so I would desperately love to be able to come out and say that a nerf is emphatically <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the solution, but I don't have one to offer. I have avoided this thread for that very reason.<br>
<br>
But I just can't get my head past the idea of an incredibly powerful support class having this kind of offensive potential. This is why Warriors don't have Complete Heal, its why Mages and Rogues are like babies in the woods without the correct group environment around them. <br>
<br>
Someone please give me a solution that doesn't involve invoking a nerf. Cos I just can't see it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

- mages who agree with my proposition (of charm being out of line) being labeled as nerf beggers from enchanters trying to shift focus from the facts...<br>
<br>
- newbie mages and players who dont understand the game very well, saying that the dps &quot;is balanced because of the risk&quot; (as they do not understand how little risk it actually is, and really cant unless they understand a 60+ enchanters spells and tactics, and 60+ experience getting and zones in general)...<br>
<br>
My reactions are far from knee jerk tain, ive seen cod and understand its power well. I say your reaction is knee jerk, as you are basing your beliefs on your personal feelings that speaking negatively of other classes abilities is pety, not on the facts of the situation. My beliefs are based on facts i observe practically every time i exp.<br>
<br>
Heres an example of just how crazy cod is. I got into a pickup group today, we werent perfect really but we were ok. It was comprised of a cleric, shaman, paladin, ranger, myself, and a druid. We were in bot, trying to kill a named lightning giants. We did not have clarity or tash, so when we finally got to him we failed. This was because of the fact we could not stick malosinia or magic based slow, due to lack of advanced debuffing (tash, ect). Since it was not slowed well nor did we have clarity our cleric ran oom (btw, both enchanter abilities).<br>
As we wiped, an enchanter with cod and a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>dual boxed</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> cleric (which is more out of convienance and saftey than necessity) ran over there and soloed him with ease. Ill give you 1 guess how he did it, and what tool he used.<br>
<br>
So basically, what a full group of reasonably intelligent players has difficulty doing, an enchanter with a dual boxed cleric can. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>How much more obvious does it have to be</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Oh, and, Interesting that enchanters are supposed to do paladin damage. Could we get a link to where that is stated? or is that text lost with the one that says mages aren't damage dealers either?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Come on tain. You know what i meant by that statement. I meant that enchanters are the paladins of casters, meaning they are supposed to be mostly support/defense and light offense. If we dont agree on this point, why bother talking further?  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 12/21/02 5:09:59 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2492<br> <font color=#333333>(12/21/02 6:08:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=399.topic&index=78>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What are we to do about Command of Druzzil</span><hr size=1> One idea it occurs to me to explore is this.  Originally, summoned pets acted as NPCs, and this was changed because the rules favor NPCs too much.  Now summoned pets arc more like a hybrid of PC and NPC.<br>
<br>
That seems to be the root of the problem with charm.  The charmed mob, being a powerful NPC is just too powerful.<br>
<br>
Maybe charmed NPCs can lose some of the advantages of their NPCness, and be more comparable to PCs.  Alternately, special rules could apply to charmed pets.<br>
<br>
The risk or cost associated with charm does not appear balanced.  If all that is required to sustain a charmed mob is one priest, and the charmed mob outdamages multiple PC damage dealers <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(who require their own support)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then how can you avoid the conclusion that it is unbalanced?<br>
<br>
I want to see more concrete data on the benefits, costs and risks of charmed pets.<br>

If you cant figure out that a pet hitting for 400-500 with 25k hps isnt overbalanced then you must be an enchanter.  It doesnt matter that it only double hits, it still far and away outdamages any class in the game.<br>

<br>
The real problem as I see it is that unlike summoned pets, charmed ones do not suffer from the PC power curve flattening that occurs as you move into the upper levels (actually for most of the game this happens). The game is carefully tuned such that as you advance, it is required that you overcome more and more deadly opponents.<br>
<br>
This requires a certain gathering of skill and experience, friends and allies, as compared to mobs every player continues ot lose ground and to continue to advance you have to deal with this.<br>
<br>
Charm's power comes form this very fact. The very fact that you can take a monster that will take a group to dispose of and turn it into a weapon is really the core of the problem.<br>
