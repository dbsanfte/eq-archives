<br>
I can think of nothing from the original EQ that would be drooled over, no maintanance nightmare there.  <br>
<br>
Kunark, 1 item the epic (even though it will eventually be less drooled over, unless epic2 comes along).<br>
<br>
SoV, maybe a total of ummmm wait didn't our loot tables here suck? Ok, maybe 5 items come to mind, no I think I upgraded every SoV slot. (ok, I have 2 SoV items I am wearing sue me)<br>
<br>
So really, they'd only be looking at the NEW gear in PoP, what maintanance nightmare? They know which gear in PoP will be /drooled over, there is some sweet items to be gotten and to be short, you will look at SoV quest gear as &quot;newb&quot; armor.  Seriously, even SoL gear won't compare to the PoP gear we will be getting (or could you get 300-350 in most stats wearing top end luclin gear?-sure 1-2 stats easily, but 4-6 stats, nope).  There is a reason we get stat cap increases and why we can aa for even more stat cap increases, and it's not so that we can wear luclin gear and not reach more than 1 of the new stat caps.  I am sure when we start seeing MORE of the PoP end game gear you will realize that it's not a maintanance nightmare to tag previous expansions as all tradable, and current expantion as no drop.<br>

<br>
While Playerauctions might benefit from the removal of the NO DROP tag, wouldn't the level restriction hinder them again? A person may be able to buy an item for real life cash, but they at least need to work up to a level to be able to use it. Just becasue they can afford it dosen't mean they can use it.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of losing the NO DROP tag but ONLY with the replacement if it with a level restriction.<br>
<br>
And I play on FV and the FV economy is very tight (at least in the low levels I've played). There are a lot of hand me downs and guild owned items. Nice hand me downs too. But it also tends to be a more social server.<br>
<br>
Plus with the inability to have more than one account on the server and no transfers into FV from other servers helps keep twinking to a minimum and tends to discourage playerauctions type folks (not eliminate mind you, just make it much more difficult). <p><p>&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=474342"><img src="http://www.inktank.com/images/eZsig.gif" height=150 width=508 border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=incubosem>IncubosEM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(1/7/03 6:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8375.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Everquest's Failing Economy</span><hr size=1> I agree.

<br>
I don't think people should really worry about the stuff thats going to happen outside of the game, motivated folks will always find a way around the system. Any way you slice this situation its going to cause an initial flood of items and cash to the market.<br>
<br>
There are two primary questions that go with this situation:<br>
<br>
1) Can a player(s) who has saved up enough plat, start up a guild, buy a bunch of primal weapons, some really good armor for 2-3 tanks, and then start skipping content like HoT/NTOV/ST before heading off to fight SoL and PoP encounters?<br>
<br>
2) Since the answer to 1 is yes, would this be a good thing or a bad thing?<br>
<br>
My feeling is it would be good, as it would help eliminate how linear the game has become. <br>

<br>
The stratification of guilds would disappear.  My guild is still at the HoT stage.  If we could purchase everything we would move on to NToV or SSRA or PoP stage of the game, and so would many many other guilds, where we would all start bumping heads.<br>
<br>
As it stands now, guilds are stratified across a range of capabilities and are limited by gear and the only way to get the gear is to spend time farming it.<br>

How many times have we urged a change to PoSky? How about fixing problems with Kunark? Pathing bugs? SoE had decided to go for gold, and screw any kind of quality or good form or anything that might make the game more appealing, and simply make it addictive. That next level, that next batch of spells, that next drop of loot.<br>

Besides, you miss the point of.. if they took out nodrop flags, that drops a large chunk of the timesink factor. Can't xps in PoP well because you still need to go get ToV gear, or Luclin gear? Oh well, go back to Start and let SoE collect your $200 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  SoE's intrest is not even shrouded anymore, and 'time sink' is the way to go. Anything to eliminate that would be like.. a waste of money. It's just too bad that we (the majority of players) will wind up quitting before we ever feel accomplished, still wearing Raw Silk or something equally blah. <br>

<br>
Right now with the way the No Drop items are set up, you do not have to be in an Uber Guild to make money if you want to. If they were to implement this, it would devalue most everything that a non Uber can get his hands on. The best items in the game will always be only attainable by an Uber Guild and if they were able to sell those items they would command the highest price.<br>
<br>
This would end up making the game very 1 dimensional because everyone would have to fit a certain mold (uber guilded) to be considered sucessful in game. Currently that is not the case.<br>

<br>
The game has become linear. The maintanance would be minimal, new expantions would have NO DROP tags, Old releases would lose the tags. <br>
<br>
To say it would be a maintanance nightmare is to say: <br>
All expantions have the same end game gear, just with different names..............<br>
<br>
Which is incorrect, the gear has progressivly gotten better and better, with VERY FEW exceptions.  Or are all the &quot;top tier&quot; guilds pharming Kunark/Velious because it's armor is better than Luclin/PoP? I think not.<br>
<br>
I don't know about your server, but I have NEVER seen the top guild on TT in kunark, or velious, sure I saw them in Luclin a little, even a little after PoP but I stopped seeing them in Luclin, maybe thats because I went to the Planes but I highly doubt they are sitting there pharming Luclin especially, when I am seeing 20 of them pharming parchments, drops and such in each PoP plane I am flagged for (and I am not talking the entrance trash that I am killing).<br>

There is a bit of awe and respect with coming across someone that has some of these Mid to High level items. They are uber. You cant get them that easily, usually with a group/guild's help. But being able to get an item by questing it or killing the proper MoB is part of the game and adventure that EQ is set up for, not jsut for the economy of buying and selling everything. Go to Ebay for that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=omegasyphon>omegasyphon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 688<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 12:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8375.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   comment</span><hr size=1> i think one of the bigger problems is the shee amount of items that only vary in stats by 1 or 2 points yet people want 10-20k in price range variance then what you payed for. i know pop is somewhat new and all but hell most of the stuff people sell is so god afwully overpriced if you just did a some shopping and comparing around.<br>
<br>
case in point<br>
<br>
2-3k for an ornate rune shield<br>
3-4k for a dreamweaver sheild<br>
10-20k for a firebrand notebook or tomb of the windwisdoms yet these 2 books are what 1 to 2 + stats more<br>
<br>
course then again im one that thinks all armor should have been player made to begin with. theirs just to much armor thats better then what you can make and most of the diety stuff is crap. <br>
pop implemented descent tradeskill armor but thats what should have been done since day 1 <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=naladini>naladini</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://img.ranchoweb.com/images/naladini/pills.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 739<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 12:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8375.topic&index=34>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: comment</span><hr size=1> For those of you that are against this idea, lets try looking at it from another angle.<br>
<br>
How do you feel about MQ's? <br>
<br>
Isn't farming a bunch of plat to give to some bozo(aka druid) who got the drop and then having to spend time with them to do the turn-in somewhat frustrating? Why not remove the NoDrop tag, so you don't have to deal with the item farmers for any longer than you possibly have to?<br>

<br>
On VZ and TZ, we could do away with the Nodrop tag as well because pvp loot codes were changed long ago from Item loot to simply Coin loot only. I can't say the same for RZ which still has Item loot, or SZ which I admittedly know nothing about. However, on VZ and TZ, removing the Nodrop tag would certainly be a boon for us zekkers  <br>
