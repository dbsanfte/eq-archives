But lately it's just becoming a drag on EQ.<br>
<br>
When you log on, god knows how long you have to go LFG or how far you have to travel before you get a group.  Sure guilds help, but not all the time.  This is not just about mages mind you, but I am pretty sure some other classes have harder time finding groups than others.  Why should we pay for a mistake we made picking a character half a year ago ?<br>
<br>
If I find a group within 10minutes, it's great fun, but if I don't it's a pain.  And thanks Verant for making travel so easy for everyone.  If I was in ME and couldn't find a group and decides to goto KC without a port, it'll take me up to 30minutes to get there.<br>
<br>
The only thing I find interesting to do at high 50s now is to attend raids and do quests.  And it's just great that most of the quests involves camping for a specific spawn.  Woohoo, great brain teasing fun. (note the sarcasm), and raids are just as repetitive as the normal groups, MA pull... bring back everyone kill... repeat and rinse.<br>
<br>
They say they're gonna do a caster balancing project and so far we have not heard anything, all they say is be patient and everything is being looked at by the development team.  Why aren't we allowed to have some kind of feedback on what they are thinking ? and instead they'll prolly implement it, get a huge negative response from players and nerf it, isn't that more a waste of time ?<br>
<br>
Well maybe they'll improve with PoP and caster rebalancing, but until they do, I don't see why I have to pay the increased monthly fee to play a product I don't find fun playing anymore.<br>

WHY are you even looking for one! It sickens me when I notice all these mages have to find groups just to exp. IMO mages should not be in groups. We have the power to solo and as far as im concerned we can get where we want, exp wise, faster. Hands down.<br>
But perhaps you play the game specifically to group and leveling your character is just and added bonus. You should have been a warrior a cleric if ya wanted to do that. <br>

<br>
The moment you realized you made a mistake..why didnt you drop the game or choose a new class at that time!<br>
<br>
Is there anyone out there that truely enjoys playing a mage? Or is actually good at it? 100 percent of all the mages that didnt like the mage class, were basically of the lower intelligence when it came to Magery <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Infact most of people that post on these boards dont know much about the Magician, wether they are level 60 or not. Its simply stunning how most of the people that play MY class are basically morons and should have played something else. The day I meet a Mage that loves what he does, and is actually GOOD at it, ill be shocked. <br>
I constantly see Magicians whining, but I must be the only one that cringes with disgust when I see it. <br>

If I can't find a group, oh well.  I stopped playing my warrior because I couldn't find groups and I couldn't solo that well.  I have a mage and when I can't find a group, I solo.  I find soloing sometimes more fun espcially when I have some idiot ninja looting like when I was in FM.  The Tank looted every giant that fell.  When I complained he handed Me about 100 gold and said shut up I told him to f**K off and kicked him out.  I was the group leader.  So now I spend some time in Thurgadin.  If I die, there is usually a high lvl cleric or pally that can rez me.  If you don't like playing a mage, start a new character.  If being in a group is so important start a new char that everyone wants.  Wait until this class balancing is over as you play your new char.  If you don't like what they do, continure playing new said character.  This is only a game don't get all wrapped up in it.  The best thing is that you can have up to 8 chars.  Experiment, maybe you will find you like another character better, I have and I keep coming back to my mage.  Maybe a mage just isn't your cup of tea, I am not saying you don't know how to play a mage but maybe you will get more joy out of playing a nother character,  Give it a try and find out.<br>

At level 54 I am a little stalled.  But once I find a new guild I hope to do more grouping.<br>
<br>
A few things I did to make it worthwhile/easier:<br>
- Start an alt.  I turned a bard mule into my favorite alt.  Twinks are fun.  Mages have the powa to make them happen.  Mages pharm gooood <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
- Convince other mages to join an all mage Chat channel.  Do all mage groups.  Right now Tarew Marr's all mage group does the toilers in The Maiden's Eye often.<br>
- Not sure if you like soloing, but that is always a possibility.  I still do Cobalt Scar at 54.  But you said you were bored.<br>
- Bind in the nexus.  Makes travel a little easier.  If you are lucky you can find a wizard to TL to someplace useful.<br>
- Switch to AAXP and get Run Speed 3 (if you don't already have jboots).  Makes traveling much easier.<br>
- Start your phenocryst focus quest.  I've been waiting to finish it, but the middle was interesting.<br>
- If you like trade skills, do the coldain shawl quest.  Just make sure you go to CC and get ingredients for making thurg gate potions.  If you are bound at the nexus, you can flit over to thurg when you want to do pieces of the quest.<br>
- Go out and buy dungeon siege, or DAoC or something else.  Seems to work for some people I know.  EQ can turn 1 dimensonal on you, but people I've talked come back and start having fun again.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>

My mage is now only used to summon the focus items for my friends before they start out for the night. That seems to be the entire usefulness for the class from everyone else's point of view, so now they have a personal vending machine. <br>
<br>
I can only hope caster balance will change that. (LOL)<br>

I went out and bought DAOC and then I came back to EQ for one reason only.  I was in an excellent guild before I left and came back to it.  They welcomed me back with open arms and a friend of mine started talking to me, the one person who helped me get back into it.  I enjoy talking to the people in my guild and I like to solo because, well it passes the time.  Maybe you need to get in a good guild, maybe that will help.  I have seen people leave guilds but I have never seen anyone leave this guild except to leave EQ.  Maybe that is all you need.<br>
