Lately when I’ve asked for a focus bracer I get rude replies or am completely ignored.<br>
<br>
Its not like it’s a huge inconvenience. Takes 160 mana to summon and takes no component cost. Is that really THAT much for a 54+ magician? Heck I’ve had magicians sitting at their bind point waiting for a rez refuse to help and  summon a focus item.<br>
<br>
I play a wizard so I’ll compare this to my class. TLs take 255 mana and most require a component. Said component is cheep but is only sold on one merchant who I happen to be kos to and since you go through so MANY it’s a nuisance to keep in stock.<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is this: I never refuse or charge for TLs, long as the person comes to me I’ll always help them out. Same thing with clarity when I’m on my enchanter. So when a magician refuses to return the favor it really makes me mad.<br>

It would seem that mages are fairly mistreated on some servers.  It is possible you got a grumpy mage from one of those servers...<br>
<br>
what server do you play on?  I surely hope it is not Brell.  Our complaint is getting people TO use them, not that they ask too often. <p>Klakk Klokk,<BR>

I would venture to provide my own comparision/experiences with a port/TL or C2/KEI.  I've personally asked many wizards/druid for ports and get the old &quot;sorry I'm busy right now&quot;, so I stopped asking and stick strickly to /ooc paying for port to blah blah.  If a porter is not busy or afk they will answer me, an exchange of money takes place and poof, I'm ported.<br>
I would suggest doing the same thing, /ooc for focus items, if a mage isn't busy he/she will make them for you.  For the most part though, I think most mages are happy to make focus items, probably about an equal ratio to the number of wiz/druids that are happy to port. <p>Master Caldywen Lebeau <BR>

<br>
a) I am running between zones<br>
b) I am fighting or doing something else and I already have a focus of that type on me that I am wearing.  THEY ARE LORE.<br>
c) After a long day of being the only magician at a raid.  Summoning mod rods for everyone before each fight, then summoning mod rods non stop durring the fight, summoning focus items for everyone, then having people who came late or who werent paying attention send me a tell for focus items after I have summoned myself my own and unmemed the spells, CoHing everyone, then having to drop my group, miss most buffs and have to get them singlely, having to miss all fighting besides the actually raid mob because im cohing, and then having to CoH people who some how @#%$ up and need to be coh'd again.  I CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH OF THAT IN ONE DAY.  If you come to me asking for focus items after I have done that for multiple mobs, I probably will not summon you focus items.  Some days I go so crazy I dont even summon some of my own guildmates focus items on a raid after I say 50X to not send me tells for focus items until I say I am summoning them (IE after im finished with rods/cohs), and when people say right before we engage 'sorry iwasnt paying attention earlier can i have 3 focus items plz'.  Focus items are just a nice thing to have.  They will not change the outcome of a fight.<br>
<br>
Oh and I hate when people compare stuff to mages summoning stuff.  Like focus items to TLs.  Well first off, TLs/Ports are like CoHs, not focus items.  Secondly, mages have more to do than just say CoH or focus items or whtever the class is comparing whatever they do.  There is COH which is like porting (have to miss out on parts of raids to go get late people and @#%$), mod rods are like buffs (and buffs arent even as bad as they used to be for some classes because so many group buffs which contain every decent buff they have combined have been added), and focus items/othersummoned @#%$ are like nothing else.<br>
<br>
I dont know why people would respond rudely though.  When im not in the mood for focus items or dont have the time to make htem I will just say im busy, or about to be rezed, or OOM or whatever.  I only respond rudely to koldfyre and frondar and buzzap (the 3 most active raiding wizards in my guild <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
When I get ported or TL'd or buffed etc, I do summon any focus item that person wants. <p><center>

They're based on my experiences.<br>
<br>
If you want focus items<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-send tell, ask specifically for the ones you want<br>
-don't ask for more than 2. If you're a wiz, you probably want the earring, then either the ring or the bracelet depending on what you're doing. Don't ask for a mod rod along with, that's just cheesy.<br>
-Offer what you have in return when you send the tell (clarity, buff your pet, whatever)<br>
-Donate. No one has ever donated for my focus items yet, and I kinda don't appreciate that with the amount I make them for people. For a TL, I donate 75-150pp depending how much I have on me (obviously sometimes i have a measly 37pp and 12gold, so give it all)<br>
-ask a mage your level. I have no idea where my level 20 focus item spells are in my book, and which is which, so i just don't make foci for level 25-47 wizards, sorry.<br>
-come to us, don't make us go to you. duh.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't be a prick. One time, a wiz asked me for like all 5 focus items 'to test'. I was soloing at SD, you know, the platform which sucks and you only hunt there to say you've done it once. I was always lom there because it sucked. I make the wiz all these focus, he does not donate, probably didn't even thank me, and proceeds to steal and quad kite my camp. ...<br>
<br>
<br>
Are your replies really rude? Sometimes, if i can't or don't feel like it, i say 'no.' IMO that's better than just not answering, and I'm not obligated to give a reason... am I? I suppose it could be seen as rude, but that's not how  it's intended.<br>

The only problem I have with summoning focus items is that they're <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> LORE</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Really, that's the only problem aside from the recast time (they really should have a 0.0 recovery time, there's no point for them to have 6.0 seconds recast).<br>
<br>
We summon a ring, bracer, and earring for ourselves, and get a tell every 10 minutes to do the same for someone else. This means we have to put our existing foci in the trade window, sit down and mem all three spells, and resummon them for ourselves, knowing that we'll have to do it again shortly. It's more of an inconvenience than anything. <p><br><center><font face="tahoma, verdana" size="1">[ <b>Baron</b> | <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90407" target="blank">Odibil Lauxes</a> | <b>Arch Mage</b> ]<br>Pain and Suffering tries to strike YOU, but misses!</font></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrezark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trezark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/02 3:57:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=245.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/ezhmage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tired of being refused Focus Items</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> What it comes down to is this: I never refuse or charge for TLs, long as the person comes to me I’ll always help them out.

A 50+ caster is gonna want a 50+ focus item, that would mean asking the time and mana of a high level player.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that a high level player is less inclined to be helpful, but sit there and med up a bubble and just see how long it takes.  It takes a long time (you knew this obviously).  When you're soloing as a caster, mana is pretty much the only variable as to how quickly you gain experience, and spending it on something else is quite frankly just a pain in the arse.<br>
<br>
The lower level folks who port me are most likely either newbies enjoying the game or second account port ho's who have nothing better to do with their mana.  In a mage's shoes, or a wizard's shoes, or whoever else, quite frankly your 100 plat isn't going to get me that next level or AA point any faster, but my mana *is*.<br>
<br>
You can hope for an act of kindness, but you can't expect people to expend their time for your benefit.  Some folks take this game (yeah, it is a GAME) a sight too seriously, I'm afraid, and this means they are after the utmost efficiency rather than the nicest way to spend their time.  For the price of a modrod and a few focus items, that mage could probably have half a blue of AA.<br>
<br>
Put it in pure terms of money vs. experience:  If I could pay 100 plat for half a blue of AA, well, I'd be buying myself a few dozen points RIGHT NOW and I wouldn't look back.  If that mages summons up 10 people a set of items, he's lost a yellow of experience with very nominal gain (what is 1k gonna do for a mage?  A few stacks of pearls....)<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd never refuse anyone anything as long as they send a polite tell without any abbreviations (&quot;drag me plz thx i died by sumthing mean an i cnt get my bod dude&quot; WILL NOT recieve a response).<br>
<br>
The other issue I see is possible competition for spawns, if you pick a place like FG on a weekday evening...There are only so many shrooms to go around, and I wouldn't want a group of which I am not a part of killing 20% more because I loaded them up with focus items using my own mana.<br>
<br>

<br>
  As a fellow drinal player and oddly enough, a fellow member of your guild, I figured I would stop lurking and post on this.<br>
<br>
  I have a funny feeling I know where your hearing the gripes about people having to summon those things.  If its in guildchat, its just a running joke between a few people started after a raid.<br>
  <br>
  Now to answer your question as I see it.<br>
<br>
  If its someone waiting for a rez, I see no reason they shouldnt be able to get you a focus item unless they are afk while waiting.  After all, aside from the mod rod they may make, the rest of the mana is gonna poof when they get a rez.<br>
<br>
  However, when you ask a mage who is all alone (as are most mages I know most of the time on our server).  You are literally asking for the gear they are wearing as well as putting them into a bit of extra downtime, normally not a big deal for most classes until you factor in a few things.<br>
<br>
   Focus items are of course lore, so anything we give out is the one we are wearing.  We can't keep a stock of spares sadly.  So we do have to summon more.  Most people I know never ask for just one, they ask for 3.  The ring, earring and bracer.  Some even ask for a trans rod too on top of that.<br>
   Thats almost half of my mana pool when I get done.<br>
<br>
   Mage mana regen is slower than snot flowing uphill in winter, against the wind.<br>
   Having to regen half of my mana pool at normal med rates, (aka no clarity, kei, familiar med bonus and no aaxp med bonus). So a person I am in direct competition with for say, golems in the grey, can quad kite more efficiently while I med up sucks.<br>
   I do it though if asked.  Ive done it many times and have NEVER once gotten a rune, tp or tl from any of those I did it for when I asked. <br>
  Instead I either walk or some poor bored guild member comes and picks me up.  Which is totally messed up given that the response I get is &quot;sorry no spare mana&quot; or &quot;I will have to charge you for that&quot;.  Nice way to return a favor.<br>
<br>
   Mages take a huge xp penalty most of the time due to pets, so every moment we are sitting is that much less xp from the already minisicule solo xp we are gonna get during the couple hours we have to play.<br>
<br>
   I have yet to tell a person who asked me in person no.  Nor do I know any mages who would do so. (granted my circle of mage friends is limited).<br>

   Another thing.  People play the game differently. I would never send a tell askin  for a port ( I may have in the distant past).  I /ooc that I am paying for port, porters can answer or not. The same could be said to apply to focus stuff.<br>

I will generally summon items at the beginning of a raid and if you're AFK or late you're screwed unless you're really nice to me.<br>
<br>
When I'm not on a raid, I can generally accomodate anyone who is polite.  If I'm soloing, it would be nice if you'd offer compensation for the time and effort I'm giving to you.  Make sure to get into the habit of trading ports/cash for focus items.  Find out which mages are most accomodating and keep up the relationship. <br>
<br>
The inconveniences of focus items are not that much greater than TLs... although keep in mind that there are many wizards that regularly refuse translocate requests too.<br>
<br>
Issues with focus items, and why some mages hate summoning them:<br>
<br>
1.  First, and by far the worst, is the number of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> different</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> summoned item requests we get.  Imagine being asked by 3 different people for TLs to Gfay, Tox, and NK.  If you're busy soloing, that means you've got to stop and memorize 3 different spells..  When a caster wants ring earring bracer, that's 3 spells I need to cast.  I don't know about wizards,  but unless I'm doing a boring camp like brownies I use all 8 of my spells slots while doing anything, and one of my absolute least favorite things to do in EQ is memorize spells.<br>
<br>
2.  They are lore.  What usually has to happen is that the mage gives you the ones he is wearing or roots around in his bags looking for them, then has to summon new ones for himself.  Not a big deal when not on a raid, but another annoyance.<br>
<br>
3.  Casting the spells isn't enough, either, I need to open a trade window too.  On a raid this can be a royal pain in the ass, and in general it can just be irritating.  This is a lot different than just /target, /cast 8 or whatever for something like clarity.<br>
<br>
4.  They are nice, but not essential.  If you're a warrior on a raid and you need a TL out... you need one or you're going to have a corpse stuck in a really bad place.  Focus items are something of a luxury, and many people don't like the feeling that they are being taken advantage of.<br>
<br>
Again, a mage has every right to refuse you their service.  If it means that much to you, you'll offer something in return, be it pp or a free teleport or something.  A lot of mages are nice and will summon items for you free whenever, just as you offer free TLs, but a lot of mages won't.  It's something you'll have to live with, because a lot of mages hate summoning focus items, just like a lot of wizards hate TLs.<br>

I have no problem handing them out. Although there was one time I did refuse someone.
