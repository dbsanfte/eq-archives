I tried to solo an SG last night but it didn't go too well.<br>
<br>
I have recently solo'd the AC (woohoo!), and that went pretty well with chain-summoning.  So, I thought I'd give a platinum-laden SG a shot.<br>
<br>
Sicked my buffed up earth pet at the giant, and I malised him.  Nuked 2-3 times with Cinder Bolt, they all hit for full damage.  Med.<br>
<br>
Time for another earth pet, sick him in.  DS the pet (burnout too?  I forget now).  Med a min or two.  Time for another earth pet.  Sick him in.  But here's where it went bad... the SG ignored my pet and beat the living crap out of me.  My pet got him off me after a bit, but I was down to 1/8 of a bub of life, so I gated away regardless.<br>
<br>
I think I had about 1.5 bubs of mana left in the end, so I'm not sure nuking more would have been healthy.  The giant was at about 25% health.  I would have taken at least 2 Cinder Bolts to finish him off.<br>
<br>
What am I doing wrong here?  I know necros can solo SGs at 29 with difficulty, and with ease at 34.  I should definitely be able to solo an SG at 40.  Please provide feedback.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

The pets at 39 have quite a bit of hit points, to the point that the heal spell is pretty ineffective.  By the time of your second heal, the pet will be at about 50% health.  Your heal will only add 10-15% health.  By the time of your third heal, the pet will be around 20% (assuming you don't agro the SG onto you with your nukes!).  There won't be a fourth heal.<br>
<br>
Your pet will be dead, the SG at about 50% health, and you'll be around 40% mana.<br>
<br>
SGs hit for around 90-100pts of damage a whack.  They have about 2500-3000hps.<br>
<br>
I'm beginning to doubt that a 40 mage could consistantly solo an SG.  In any case, good luck in your attempt.  Be sure to have a SoW in case it goes badly.<br>

But I will try it anyway.  I know HGs and SGs can be tough.  I have been killing dozens of HGs grouped and I know they hit hard.   Still, even my Level 34 Fire Pet can act as <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> primary</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tank for me and a level 40 Druid, with it buffed with Skin like Diamond and Strength of Stone.  The HG dies pretty fast with three or four Blaze spells and a DoT from the Druid.  We do have to throw a couple heals on the Fire pet during the fight, but that innate fire shield does wonders.  With a pet upgrade at 39, that may give me the edge I need to solo the beasts.<br>
<br>
So, perhaps I'll even try to use the water pet, if Earth dies too fast, with damage shield of course, as it has better AC and will take less full damage 90 point shots <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And I will have SoW (in a bottle) so I don't care if it aggros on me, I'll just kite it about while the pet smacks it for free damage.  Its gonna be fun!<br>
<br>
I don't know about you all, but I love the stand up, toe-to-toe fights much more then the darkness-fear tactics of our dark cousin Necromancers. <p><b>Seek Pyremaker</b><br>

Necro's solo SG's at 29?  I think I'd have to see that.  SG's are what? 40th?  Necro wouldn't be able to cast darkness or fear on it... theyy *might* be able to lifetap but their pet would be dead within a short amount of time.   Dunno, maybe they can, but I'd have to see it done before I'd believe it.   <br>
<br>
I didn't try to solo an IG until 52 so I can't help ya much.. was busy in Kunark.   I've never much cared for using the chain-summoning tactic myself, found it to be too inefficient.   I spent 40th in the FM/DL area beating on stuff and going to Kedge Keep when I could get a group up. <p> <br>

<br>
Last night at 4-5:30AM EST I roamed Oasis to solo my first Sand Giant too. (I'm level 39)<br>
<br>
My story?  I never saw one!  Not for the whole 90 minutes, hehe.  But I had fun roaming around Oasis listening to the sounds (I have a SB Live! and my sound has been broken since Feb, but this last patch got it back)<br>
<br>
I love the madman when they stop they look around and say in a British accent, &quot;May I please have a copper?&quot;  and when I give them a copper they say, (well, they type) &quot;junk!&quot;<br>
<br>
But I talked to a level 44 Mage who said she soloed sand giants farily well by buying sow potions and using, get this, a Fire Pet, and letting the Sand Giant run after her, in other words, she kites them.<br>
<br>
Not sure if that would be easy or not, but she said it was, I'd of course worry about training him onto lowbies.<br>

So yes, Necro's can solo SGs at 29, but only the low ones.  And then with difficulty.<br>

I've been reading on the EQ boards mages complaining about soloing SGs at 44 without JBoots/SoW.  Looks like Kiting is the way to do it.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So if you manage to solo a SG at 39/40 without JBoots/SoW, hold your head high!  Unless you just got lucky and found a lvl 29.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The first two times I got a top-hitting (hits for 40) Fire pet.   Burnout II and SoRs.  Sent it at the SG while I casted Malaise.   Once giant was meleeing pet, I backed away to nearly maximum range for Cinder Bolt and let them fly.   No pet heals.<br>
<br>
The first time, pet lived with about 10% health left.  Used 5 Cinder bolts.  Giant started to charge me on the third or fourth bolt, but he turned around in the face of all that incoming fire (I loved it).  All bolts hit for 333 damage.<br>
<br>
The second time, pet lived with about 30% health and I used 4 Cinder bolts.  Obviously a weaker giant.  Again, all bolts hit for 333.<br>
<br>
The third time I tried the /pet no taunt / kite method with a 38 hitter water pet.  Problem was, I do not think my pet got the /no taunt message, because I could not get the Giant off the pet.   After 3 Cinder bolts, pet was dead, and an angry giant with 40% health chased me about for a while.  I tried to get enough range on him (was SoWed of course) to cast some more DDs, but giants run to damn fast.  Had to zone this one.   Still, I had plenty of mana left, so the only reason this did not work was the pet death due to taunting.<br>
<br>
Balasarius is correct that this is sufficiently risky to warrent a SoW.  But I think the kite method is very do-able.  Funny how the old fasioned sic pet and burn method worked for me though and kiting did not <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    And with the fire pet, no less.<br>

At 39 I think the wave spell we get is 3 of 170(or close to that). Now giants absorb all 3 waves and that could me a single spell output of 520 damage. I am aware they will ot all do full damage and some waves maybe resisted, but Its worth a shot if the chain nuking isn't bringing the desired results. Plus less aggro created from 3 waves of damage instead of 1 big blast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanamarinfernostorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanamar Infernostorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 124<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/01 3:11:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/windkull/SMRPhotoNanamar.jpg width=149 height=227></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soloing SGs at 40</span><hr size=1> Actually AOEs have way more than normal agro, also, I managed this with alternate nuke and heal at 40, so it is possible but too much downtime.  Don't do giants until 49, and at 49 do the ice giants hehe.  exp in 51 sucks, its way too slow.  also, I still need J boots. <p><body text=50/100/10> <hr><b><IMG SRC= http://www.geocities.com/windkull/nanamarSig.jpg></b><BR>

With SoS and the new pets we can eaisily solo these guys.  You may need to throw your pet a heal on occaision but 2 maybe 3 SoS's should do it.  I must've killed 50 of em on my 15 hour camp of the AC in S Ro.  Wait till lvl 44 and you'll be able to kill all the SGs and HGs you want without having to chaincast pets.<br>
