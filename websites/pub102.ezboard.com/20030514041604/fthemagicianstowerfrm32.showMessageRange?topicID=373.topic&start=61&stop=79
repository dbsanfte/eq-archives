<br>
the ideal guild would probably have 6 warriors, 2 monks, 2 shadowknights, 1 paladin, 1 druid, 1 beastlord, 1 magician, 2 shaman, 2 enchanters, 1 necromancer, 1 bard, 10 clerics, 9 rogues, and 9 wizards.  48 people, 8 groups, all geared to produce the maximum amount of damage for a guild.  in this scenario, no one really cares who you are, but rather what class you play.  a shame, it is.<br>
<br>
jaytee, i hope that fires of heaven is able to look at you, the person behind the character, and find value in you to want you in their guild.  i hope that they don't look at you as a coh person, or potential lag at their raids; but rather, as a good, knowledgable player that contributes to the guild.<br>
<br>
if they don't, and all that they care about is getting the best and &quot;right&quot; pixels in the game... then i am sorry.  i really am sorry for you.<br>
<br>
note- this is not meant to be a knock on fires of heaven, or any guild for that matter.  but it pains me to see people not care about the person behind the character, which seems to be commonplace lately with all these nerfs and changes and fears that guilds won't want magicians anymore...<br>

<br>
The issue with high level guild recruiting is that those guilds are almost automated, no one really matters just the class you play.  Even the officers are easily replaceable since most of the players know what to do already, so you dont need someone telling you.. So many people quit and others rejoin atleast in my guild I rarely know many people anymore since its a *constant* stream of people joining and others leaving, but we still clear everything because it's like a huge machine<br>
<br>
Gets sorta frustrating at times, there is very little friendship anymore.  Just cleric01- 12 needed to kill X mob, need warrior01-06 as well.  Class is all that matters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and mages dont bring much without mod rods <p><a href="http://www.bladesofwrath.com">

Class is all that matters. Most people arent into experimenting with different group combos. They want tank, cleric, enchanter, shaman. puller, and one more class. Ive had successful groups with 3 mages and a shaman. Now i think a lot of people are moving away from the more traditional groups to a more dps oriented groups in places like UP because of mob level and hps so you will see like Tank, healer, slower and 3 damage dealers. Sometimes if you have a shaman you dont need a healer if hes high enough then you can have 4 damage dealers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sirellyn>Sirellyn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/02 12:00:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> Gah!   We get a busted ability, and then lose it because it's so busted and then some of us want it back because it's the only way into raids?<br>
<br>
I feel like we are driving around in a car thats been held together by duct tape, and as soon as our roll of endless tape gets taken away we start crying because our car is going to fall apart again.   Why don't we find the right peices for it in the first place?<br>
<br>
Ok fine, I guess I'll start then.<br>
<br>
Assuming all the pessimists are right, and mages need a serious place inside raids or be left by the wayside what can we get as a unique factor we can give to raids?<br>
<br>
Well lets see what common responses are.. Damage!  We want to be able to do damage!  Well thats about vanilla as you get get, and the problem is that if classes were simply rated by damage then only one class would be invited to raids.  The most damaging one.<br>
<br>
Fortunatly it doesn't work that way.  Damage in EQ is actually situational.  Strong resists equal low spell damage, high AC equals low melee damage.  And thats only one layer.<br>
<br>
So it is SOME kind of damage we want to make us of use in raids right?  I mean the other option is of course utility.  Now I'm assuming if I took a poll right now, more would favor more damage, with emphasis on having some utility in a raid too, just not enough that we have to pass up some uber damage for it.  <br>
<br>
Well, another speed bump is the fact mages won't be able to do their best damage all the time.  Because again, if any class could do super damage all the time, what would be the point of any other classes touting they can damage stuff?<br>
<br>
So fine.. to the meat.. Suggestions.<br>
<br>
Sugg 1:  Change mage expluse summoned nukes to be a lot closer to or even on par with wizard ones and make them resist at about the same levels as wizard ones that are comparible GENERAL nukes.  (Not talking the anti dragon or giant ones.)   That is.. if the highest wizard lure does 1200 damage for 400 mana, give us one that does similar damage, or perhaps a tiny bit less and only works on summoned creatures.<br>
<br>
Also.. and this is very important.  Change all gods to summoned creatures.  With the advent of PoP there will be enough end bosses around that mages will be welcome to combat.  Do not give the same ability to druids.   If you did, you'd wipe out the whole reason to give it to mages in the first place.<br>
<br>
Sugg 2:  Remember my Raid Pet idea?  Well the same thing works with host of the elements.  (even if I don't like it as much.)  Whats that?  Wizards can do very good short term magic damage, specially with manaburn.  Allowing us to do very good short term melee damage  would give us an advantage over magic resistant creatures.   That is.. if you want really intense short term damage on a magic resistant creature you call a mage with host of the elements, or some other heavy short term raid pet idea.<br>
<br>
The first two ideas really don't help mages solo at all.  And I'm told soloing shouldn't matter at all when you reach these high raid levels enough people complain about it anyway so..<br>
<br>
Sugg 3:  Summoned charged items.  I mentioned this a few threads back.  Wands that held a few DDs or whatnot.  This isn't bad for a bit more of a total DD pool when soloing, or even at raids, but do you really want to be summoning a bunch of these things for everyone at a raid..?   I like the idea, but I'd perfer those things be no drop in some ways..<br>
<br>
Sugg 4: Combining pets and utility perhaps.. How about guardian pets.  That is you summon a pet for someone else.. like a cleric.  If the PC gets attacked the pet attacks and taunts the mob until the protected PC is not the immediate target of hostile intentions, and then goes back to the side of the PC.  In other words as it fights every round it adds a bit more of mem blur against the PC it's trying to protect.   While the pet is up of course the mage can't summon another for himself.  Nor can either player actually control the pet.<br>
<br>
Sugg 5: How about a special kind of pet that can actually outtaunt players who aren't taunting (melee players that is.)  And easily at that.  This could be done simply by defaulting all pets to not taunting.  And then the mage would turn it on.  I'm sure you all could see the usefulness of adding 4k runes on the main tank when needed.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll post some more ideas later.  Hows about coming up with some more yourselves though?  General abilities are killers, they take away functionality from all other classes.  Try thinking away from the mana rod. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulofwyr123.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lofwyr123</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(10/14/02 5:01:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=66>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Ok, the reason that the person doesnt matter is very simple.  Once you get past thepoint of those people that dunno what the heck they are doing (remember them, back in some zone like LoIO where they were responsible for killing your group?) and everyone knows the score and what to do and how to do it and what part there class contributes, then the 'quality' of the player doesnt matter.  They dont need to be told what to do, they know and they do it.  It does indeed become automated.  They dont do it to be nice, or because they want to help, but because in order to 'win'and enocounter that is what they do, what everyone does, and like a lot of ants working together stuff gets done.<br>
<br>
Point is that once you get to the point of the upper guilds where everyone knows their spot it becomes a matter of 'what class are you' in terms of winning encounters.<br>
<br>
They look at it by class not because they dont care about the person, but because they want to win the encounters.  Good people are still liked, while the rotten apples get by because their ability is needed to win the encounter.<br>
<br>
This leads back to mages ... what ability to we have that makes us needed in the win encounters equation.  'Cause our dds and pets dont seem to be cutting it form what the uppers are saying in terms of high end raiding.  CoH coverd by bot better than by person because of the point JT made.  Melee and caster bots would do the same to, but are more difficult to run in such a way and less practicle, again the points why have been made.<br>
<br>
So, back to the starting topic of the thread ... wheres the needed mage role?<br>

So I looked over Jaytee's posts.  (He did start this thread after all..)<br>
<br>
This I don't get..<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>
Mag are in the same boat. The damage we do is replaceable by: Wizards, Warriors, Rogues, Shadowknights, Paladins, Druids, Rangers and Monks. So beyond out MageBot abilities, what do we offer? <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Some of those I see..  But why would a raid leader say (in general) Ok between the paladin and the mage.. um.. ditch the mage.  What would the paladin have that would make him that much more perferred?<br>
<br>
Say it's a super long fight and the paladin can dish out more damage than the epic.  Then perhaps..  But thats situational isn't it?  Even then if the paladin dies he has to be ressed.  If the pet dies a resummoning is quick and pretty much painless.<br>
<br>
Same argument for rangers.. What do they have?  Decent DPS?  Do they beat us that badly?  Do they beat us at all?  Is it in like 90% of situations?  (lol forget they have that archery crap for a sec.)<br>
<br>
Monks.. they can FD pull an do pretty good damage and they do way more than mages?  I mean is it fair to say in almost all raid count situations monks would be perferred?  And if so why?  All you really need is one monk.<br>
<br>
Warriors... geez..  One to three main tanks at most is enough.   Would you ever pick them for the damage?  Seriously?  And again why?  Why the heck would you ever pick them over a mage if theres one there already?<br>
<br>
I mean I know you have a point Jaytee.  If asked to go to an encounter I get.. &quot;ok this mob needs a lot of nukers..&quot; and if necros, clerics, and enchanters can now beat us out as well as druids it's fairly silly.<br>
<br>
But most of those classes you listed don't really have a unique role.  Well at least nothing that only one of them could do just fine, and no more than we do.<br>
<br>
I admit I'm worried about DD status in PoP too, but I'm also eager to see how everything balances out.<br>
<br>
Am I missing that nukes + pets over a long time is less than even warrior melee damage?   I'm personally fine with that.. However.. if this isn't ok then whats the use for wizards?   Theres no way over a long period of time they can maintain their impressive DPS.<br>
<br>
So I'm just wondering how you measure all this up, and what unique abilites these other classes have where a number greater than one would be taken over a mage?<br>
<br>
I also renew the challenge to come up with ideas as well.  I mean if you think somethings missing, please at least suggest some sort of solution.

<br>
You miss the point.<br>
<br>
The people matter enormously in all guilds. But, the EXTREMELY high level guilds that raid VT and SSRA one must assume contain the best of the best. These people could play any character and do very well at it. The basic problem is why should FoH have JT keep playing a mage? Why not say, listen here JT, you kick ass, and we don't dispute that, but your class is now lame. Reroll a Wiz and we will help you get re-equipped quickly. Keep JT on a seperate acct and we can use him for our Mage Bot as needed.<br>
<br>
What can he possibly contend? Can he say, but I do more damage than a wizard? I am more versatile? I have more damage over time? I am a better utility character?<br>
<br>
He can't say jack schitt. Fact is, we are outdated with this change. If PoP comes out and the new pets are pointless on high end raids, I will have the same question to answer. Odds are, I will keep Tarqal in retirement, and keep levelling my bard. The bard surely cannot outdamage a mage, but his other features make him desirable.  <br>
<br>
JT, sorry for using you as an example, but you started this. :P<br>

My friend raided VT with the guild name Hoss on Druzzil Ro.  Even as an SK (first gnome to 65 btw), he was putting almost 100dps to the forefront with the new planar AA abilities.  If pets want to keep up with FoH equivalent players, they need to start hitting more and not be limited to just 4+1 attacks.  Hell, warriors can now hit up to, what, 7 times using a 2hs weapon?  <br>
<br>
They burned through Vex Thal (skipping the front yard) in about 8 hours.  It's NOT easy, but with the new 65 level cap, mezzing most of the mobs is now possible.  Gear is really nice.  <br>

Your complaint is that your pet can't easily outdamage an uber shadowknight?<br>
<br>
Mages are the most damaging class in the game, barring very few exceptions.  Sure, their damage is &quot;replaceable&quot;, but only by adding two other characters for a lost mage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=373.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=373.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=373.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a> <b>4</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=373.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=373.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=373.topic&index=79><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=373.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=373.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=373.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
