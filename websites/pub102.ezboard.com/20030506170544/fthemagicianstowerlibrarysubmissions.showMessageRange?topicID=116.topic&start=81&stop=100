It really helps you a lot. <p>nmee - commander of mudhills<br>

At lower levels your dmg shield probably only lasts for one fight, so cast it on Goner right before you pull your opponet.<br>
<br>
Dmg shields are more effective, mana-wise, than nukes when soloing.  So they are very important, just like always wearing the summoned bracer and bauble, and casting burnout on Zoner. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azzabarr@themagicianstower>Azzabarr</A> at: 2/13/03 7:01:11 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tsayid3@themagicianstower>tsayid3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/03 5:47:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need a Dracca update!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Yes, that is what I mean.

Dracca if you will hit your pet follow button and then spam pet back off this will usually get the pet to come back to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erun>Erun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 112<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/03 8:42:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need a Dracca update!</span><hr size=1> After about 10 Dracca-related posts, each one reaching several pages in length, Im starting to find this Dracca obsession quite fascinating.<br>

Takes us back to a time when we were discovering all the new wonderful things that EQ had to offer. It helps all us jaded people to look back and rediscover the simple joys of the game. A lot of Dracca's experiences other people have had, and we can all smile about EQ for a moment or two. I find magaicians tend to be a very helpful class, have not run into one mage yet who I would consider a jerk.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Another thing it gives us all a chance to remember how we resolved these problems she is talking about and share our knowledge.

<br>
THANK YOU for all of your help, guys!<br>
<br>
I was directed to this board before I got the game.  I had been emailing a player on Pover after I found her guild board.  I put a TON of time and thought (while waiting on my game to arrive) about what class and race I wanted to be (from reading at EverQuest.com where she first directed me to).  At that point, I did not know that you could have more than one character and I saw the name and character change service they had that cost $45 a time to do, so since I thought that I could only have one, I though LONG and hard about the class, race and name for my character.  I did NOT want to pick a class that I didn't like and have to pay (maybe several times) as much as the game cost to change and try other areas out.<br>
<br>
I asked her where to go, like what newbie forums were availiable in EQ, etc.  She told me that since I was set on being a Magician to come here to ask questions.  <br>
<br>
Well, I came here...but I did NOT understand ANYTHING you guys were talking about, I also saw from your sigs that MOST of you are lvl 50+ and I did not want to bug you with basic game stuff when you were all talking about WAY more complex things.  <br>
<br>
I finally got so frustrated after a week of playing that I just posted...LOL!  Because of YOU all I am in MUCH better shape now and I am enjoying the game a LOT.  I see from you guys too that I have a LOT more to look forward to in the future and that makes me happy.<br>
<br>
I played my first &quot;game&quot; of EQ on New Years Day.  But before that (like two - three days before)...the game came in the mail and I LOADED it.  It took me FOREVER to load this, I almost threw it away.  I put the disk in and it said I needed DirectX 8.1 or higher (I had DirectX 8.).  After THREE HOURS of fooling with THAT (DirectX 9 from the MSN site failed after TWO full hour and a half download attempts) I did a search for DirectX 8.1 (MSN no longer had a link to downlaod 8.1).  I finally got that.  <br>
<br>
THEN...by the time I set up my Sony acccount and PATCHED it (almost four hours and that was just the first disk with EQ Classic and Ruins of Kunark on it) it was 2 am on a work night.  But I HAD to get on and see what it was like.  Well, I saw THERE that I had 8 spaces to use (and I was told later on, right before my game arrived that I had SIX spaces and MAKE SURE to use them all).  So anyway, I had no idea that you could delete a charater OR make a new one later, so I set up ALL eight, thinking that if I did not go through that all right then, that I would lose them.  It also kept rejecting my names, so ended up just making up weird stuff, lol.  My main character on Povar was going to be Dracca...but I did not realize that you could not have a last name until lvl 20, so I messed THAT up too, I did &quot;Draccaviir&quot; all together, since it would not let me put a space.  <br>
<br>
Anyway...after coming here, I was elfnapped to Solusek Ro and I did REGULAR &quot;Dracca&quot; there, so NOW when I get to lvl 20...my name will be how I wanted it.  I also learned that I could delete characters after I went back to Povar to give my stuff away there, I just wiped them all out, since I am no longer on Povar and those characters had WEIRD names AND I never even went on them.<br>
<br>
The first time I logged on to EQ, I saw the mage guild banner (that is where I was born) but it was SO late...I stood up, looking around to SEE if anything would attack me and then tried to figure out how to log off.  I didn't know that I was supposed to sit and camp, so after trying to CONTROL/ALT/DELETE out of the full screen mode, pushing ESCAPE, etc...I just restarted my computer.<br>
<br>
NOW...when I went back on...I was on that hill outside of Felwithe.  I had no idea what I was supposed to do, so in my book it said how to put spells in your spell book (I came with two) and for experience to kill things.  So, I  tried to attack the guard (luckily I did not do it right or I would have died).  I clicked on my dagger, THEN on him...he just said he did not want it, lol.  <br>
<br>
People kept trying to talk to me too and I was typing away and they did not hear me.  I guess I was in some filter?  IDK, chat thing is still complicated.  Anyway, I did not know to right click in there to bring down the list of channels, filters, etc.<br>
<br>
So, I went inside and ran into the moat and drown.  Now, I DID learn from my booklet that came with the box set how to do a few things.  BUT, I was still really messed up.  I could not sell, it does not tell you in the BOOK to HOLD DOWN right click to view stuff (I just quick right clicked and nothing ever happened)...so I just kept throwing stuff on the ground.  I did not know where my guild was...I did not know to go AROUND the bait shop area to the OTHER part of Felwithe, I had been on that flat part but I didn't know there was a path over there.  After jumping in the MOAT thinking IT was a dark pathway, I was scared to go close enough to the water see the path over there.  When you guys told me to go around, I though you meant OUTSIDE the city, like there was another DOOR leading in.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, my elfnapper took me to Solusek Ro and taught me how to not MOVE while casting...WHAT a differance, lol...it does not tell you that in the book.  He tought me how to pull stuff too, to put training points in and SO much more.<br>
<br>
You guys have taught me a LOT.  I am in SUCH better shape now and I am really having fun.  I really appreciate you ALL taking the time out of your online day to help me with the basic stuff.  I still do not understand a LOT of the threads here, but I do read through them and learn a lot.  I have made a lot of dear friends here too.  Thank you for helping, for you PATIENCE with me and for letting me hang out here.  <br>
<br>
EQ is absolutely wonderful.  It may not have been the BEST game to START with...because it is WAY complicated but I am glad that I did becuase it is SO much fun. <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><font face="garamond" size=4><b>Angel in Devil's Boots<br></font><font size=3 face="garamond"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 2/14/03 2:21:40 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=intriguethemagician>Intrigue the Magician</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 39<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/03 3:02:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need a Dracca update!</span><hr size=1> Ho, Dracca is our baby sister.

The only thing that had confused me back then was swimming.  Ended up drowning my first character (iksar monk), reappearing outside Cabilis completely confused to where I was, and how I could get back into town to find my guild, and besides my guild note was gone.  So I deleted that one and remade it. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;">Neewon Triumphant</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Minstrel of the <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;">51</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->st Song<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Jharin Apprentice<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:purple;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=447681" target="top">Himemiya Anshy</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Elementalist of the <!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;">51</span><!--EZCODE FONT END-->st Trial<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;">Members of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.flamingshrine.com">Order of Flaming Shrine</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Erollisi Marr<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:blue;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Zettai Unmei Mokushiroku...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>See?

LOL...I almost destroyed mine.  I didn't know you were supposed to give it to someone because it said in my book to right click but NOT to right click and HOLD down.  Since it would not go in my spell book and I could not read what it said, I figured it was useless (shrug).<br>
<br>
Finally, at lvl 5 I got to my guild, but THEN, I still did not know how to read what lvl spells were for until later, I kept buying stuff and it said I could not use it, so I sold it back.   <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><font face="garamond" size=4><b>Angel in Devil's Boots<br></font><font size=3 face="garamond"><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>See?

<br>
Log in and make my character.. I had no problems up to there.  Then I get ingame and can't see much (it's night.. and I decided to make up an erudite paladin.. cause I like smart people) so I figure out how to move and I figure out that I have to equip my weapon (played many rpg's in my day.. just not any other online ones) I walk up to a guard and hit a...<br>
<br>
loading please wait...<br>
<br>
then I appear in a completely different area.. I still can't see anything and start wandering aimlessly.. end up finding the river.. and couldn't figure out how to swim.. and drown.  Then I figure out how to kill things and manage to get to 2nd level after many many hours and a helpful player or two.<br>
<br>
After all that I log off for the night (also just reset my computer.. I couldn't figure out /camp) and the next morning I decide to go back on and try playing again.  I log back in and my character is gone (didn't realise that the different names I pick from are independant servers) so I have to completely start from scratch.. I got frustrated at that and didn't play for about a month.. <br>
<br>
This was all back in march 1999.. so there weren't many boards and such for me to go look for help <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I started playing again the end of that month and figured everything out pretty quick.. then changed to a brand new server in early april when it came up (Emarr) to get a fresh start with everyone else <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
