I dont mind people giving opinions on what they think or things to help...but when the ratio is 100/2 infavor of people not being able to solo what do you think the answer is.  Statistically speaking that is.<br>
<br>
I play a Magician.  You say you can solo to 65 is partially BS.  Pets are not gonna last long enough for you to kill any mob in POP...well in Tier 1 planes there are some.  Once you become 63 those mobs become light blue.  At 64 you can still solo in places like Umbral.  But that isnt the issue of this thread.  The key word here is POP.  <br>
<br>
What?  You gonna tell me you can solo in Tactics, BOT, HOH, POV, POS?  Hell no!  Dont even try to BS people on this board.  Give factual information and dont try to make people feel like they cant play there Magicians.  Kids only do that (try to make themselves seem bigger).<br>
<br>
Now as I said efficiently no you cant solo to 65 in &quot;POP&quot;.  If someone can show me with facts then do it.  Other then that...nice thread. Some good ideas here.<br>
<br>
I think sometimes these ones that come here and say I can...I can...I can, hurt the Mages as a whole.  Verant will look at them and forget about the other 100 post and key on 2 post.  Dont hurt the Mage community.  Hell, dont say nothing at all if you dont have a suggestion.<br>

Im also tired of that being the crutch for those who do like to chaincast. Its like a one track mind with blinders on. <br>
<br>
We were given items by Verant to give to pets to make them stronger and better. Chaincasting does not allow this. Therefore, why would we try to get all those swords, and belts, etc if we are not going to use them and keep pets alive?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Verant also gave us tools to make chaining better as well. Improved Reclaim, Quick Summoning, Elemental Pact, and even the one shot Frenzied Burnout help chainers.  The new pets naturally make chaining more efficient, costing no more mana than a Greater Vocarate.  We have Burnout 5, also costing no more mana than Burnout 3.<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;one track mind&quot; comment, pet tank/mag nuke has been the standby tactic of every magician, myself included, from the time we reached level 4 and summoned our very first pet.  It's old.  It's inefficient.  It's all about mana pool, and how many nukes/heals you can get off before you are oom and running.  I don't know about most casters, but oom is not a place I want to be.<br>
<br>
That being said, I totally agree that magician soloing in the new zones has been more than just a little disappointing.  It has forced me to recruit others for groups and apply our talents in coordinated ways in order to accomplish what we used to be able to do without so much assistance.<br>
<br>
The good news is, if there are enough magicians lfg, and appropriately flagged, even a minimum of 2 magicians can group up and take advantage of the XP gold rush that is Tier 2 Planes and beyond.  You can trust me on that one.  I have done it....  over and over again. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2629<br> <font color=#333333>(2/7/03 3:15:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=143>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Brainstorm: How to fix PoP Mage soloability</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Once you become 63 those mobs become light blue. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Light blue mobs give xp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=immlazen>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#333333>(2/7/03 6:33:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=144>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Brainstorm: How to fix PoP Mage soloability</span><hr size=1> Goladus<br>
<br>
Why are you trying so hard to prove that Mages can solo efficiently?  The point that alot of Mages here are saying is we should be able to solo dark blue the same as the other classes just like we could before POP.  <br>
<br>
Yes light blue give experience.  But why do we have to settle for light blue when others are soloing dark blues easier then we can solo a light blue.  We were once very good at soloing and it is the reason alot of us chose to become Mages.<br>
<br>
Does it personally hurt you to see the Magician class get fixed?  If not, why try to go against the grain when every single Mage has already pointed out that we are not the soloing class we once were.<br>

<br>
First, Raz asked me some questions and I'm doing my best to answer them.<br>
<br>
Second, I may be misinterpreting you but my argument is closer to &quot;the effeciency with which we can solo is fine,&quot; rather than &quot;mages can solo effeciently.&quot;  The ambiguity of the word &quot;effecient&quot; causes this confusion.<br>
<br>
Third, part of the reason I seem to be as contrary as I do is the extent to which people are pushing to have solo abilities added.  I believe you said something like &quot;that we can solo to 65 is bull @#%$.&quot;  Extreme positions, especially extreme positions that seem prone to exaggeration trigger reactions.  When I percieve something to be an exaggeration I question it, and in that questioning I frequently get misunderstood as being deliberately contrary.<br>
<br>
Fourth, I have said little about the ability to xp 63-64 as I have not been through these levels yet.  With Servant of Marr, Ward of Xegony, and Burnout V to play with I am content to stay 62 and catch on up aa for the time being, and that includes xp gained from light blue mobs.  I prefer soloing dark blues, but light blues in PoP still give what I think is a considerable amount of xp.<br>
<br>
Fifth, I will say this:  Our soloing is risky enough such that with my old p366/geforce2 machine I found it extraordinarily difficult if not impossible to solo in Poop.  Make of that what you will. <p><center><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Does it personally hurt you to see the Magician class get fixed?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->&quot;Fixed&quot; is one of those exaggerations I was talking about.  Our class is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">not broken</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> except Servant of Ro, maybe Frenzied Burnout, and maybe Pet Cannibalization.  &quot;Not as powerful as you think we should be,&quot; yes; &quot;broken,&quot; absolutely not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If not, why try to go against the grain when every single Mage has already pointed out that we are not the soloing class we once were.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Every single mage has not pointed this out.  Again this is an exaggeration and is why all my answers seem to be against mage improvements.  There are certian things I am definitely against.<br>
<br>
I am against adding more summoned pet weapons period unless they come as raid-level loot.  Weapons that proc snare, slow, or stun are totally out-- although I would not mind seeing a zone where mobs commonly dropped useful pet weapons.  I am also against adding more summons because summons are somewhat of a pain in the ass to deal with.  <br>
<br>
I am against adding more pet buffs on the basis that it discourages interaction between mages and buffing classes.  Of any of the ideas I've seen, though, this is the one I like most.<br>
<br>
I am against a straight buff-up of pets because they are generally already strong enough relative to melees.  Any generic pet upgrade would have to accompany a similar upgrade to all melee classes.  If that happens, ok, but one of the biggest problems with Luclin was that melees took too little damage from xp mobs.  That made xping very low-risk with acceptable rewards.  <br>
<br>
I am against doing anything just because every mage says so, because every mage might just be too scared to risk soloing something difficult and actually learn how to do it right.<br>
<br>
I am against anything that intentionally increases mage solo <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">effeciency</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> for the following reason:  As a mage levels and increases his aa, equipment and spell selection the mage fights more effeciently.  Balancing &quot;effecient soloing&quot; on mages with sub-par equipment will lead to a soloing overbalance in the future.  So long as a magician is capable of killing a mob in a reaonsable amount of time with a reasonable amount of mana (2500-3000 max probably), then I think soloing is fine.<br>
<br>
I am against anything that intentionally increases solo ability for <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">any class</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> because of the risk of unintended consequences elsewhere in the game, the game that is based on grouping and player interaction.  I am not against mages being the best soloers, however I do not want that ability to come at the expense of the rest of the game.  For example, I don't want the old Mod Rods back, even though it would mean I could dual box a level 45 cleric for greatly increased effeciency, because the old mod rods would make raiding suck again.  Nor do I want to hurt any other classes enjoyment of the game because of abilities we have.  Having a pet that cast snare would infringe on snare-casting classes.  Pets proccing snare may be balanced for a solo mage, but they are not balanced for the game as a whole so I am against it.<br>
<br>
A change to the con system is not something I am immediately against, it just feels risky and advise caution and discussion before making such changes.<br>
<br>
I see changes to pet heals being the most likely method of improving soloing because it would allow them to maintain control over our effeciency.  I mean.. give us snare and our effeciency would skyrocket, tune our heals and you could adjust effeciency slowly and carefully.  That said I am still not convinced that any changes are necessary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2857<br> <font color=#333333>(2/7/03 7:43:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=147>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Brainstorm: How to fix PoP Mage soloability</span><hr size=1> First, regarding <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>chaining pets</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I use it as a criteria because in my experience it forms an upper limit in soloing power.  That is, in a simple fight against a mob without special powers, a mage can defeat a stronger opponent by chaining pets than they can by alternating nukes and heals.  Therefore, if a simple opponent cannot be defeated by chaining pets, it cannot be defeated by alternating nukes and heals.<br>
<br>
I am <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> suggesting that chaining is or should be the only viable mage solo strategy, but that it represents a definite limit to mage power.<br>
<br>
In response to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Goladus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s observations regarding chaining, I agree overall, but differ in my conclusions.  Chaining pets allows a mage to trade time for mana.  The fights are longer, but the down time is less compared to sustain and nuke.   It is my experience that on a given mana pool, a mage can defeat a larger opponent by chaining than sustaining and nuking.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Goladus:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I'm curious, too, what you mean by chaining pets &quot;not cutting&quot; it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well, in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>SkyFire</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, my upper limit for practical chaining was 8 pets.  Can't kill it with eight <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Greater Vocaration: Earth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then its not practically soloable.  I never killed anything that required ten pets, but I would consider that acceptable as well.  That means, in the time it takes for the mob to kill one pet, me and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gobaner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ought to be able to deal at least 10% damage to the mob.  When I hit <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and starting testing various mobs, it seemed that even yard trash lost more like 5% health or even less per pet.  20 PTK <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Pets To Kill)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?  I don't think so.<br>
<br>
I will do some more numerical-type analysis, but my gut reaction was to give up on those mobs.

Mages currently enjoy a relative peak of power, and proposing that mages should be made stronger is unlikely to be a priority for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  There are other classes which probably have more serious problems.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Immlazen:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  why should Magicians be the only one penalized<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The logic is hard to escape.  With mobs hitting harder than ever, tankers, who keep the enemy at bay by taking damage, must necessarily suffer.  However, kiters and charmers, who avoid or take advantage of mob melee, do not suffer or even thrive.  If mage <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> soloing is deficient, then I really see only three alternatives:<br>
<br>
1) Make mages better at tanking, e.g., tougher pets,<br>
2) Allow mages to kite, e.g., adding snare to post-50 fire pet spell repetoire, or<br>
3) Bypass <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mobs, e.g., allowing adequate soloing outside <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The third option does not involve making mages stronger, and allows others to solo as well.<br>
<br>
However, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Goladus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s observation that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Luclin</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> soloing was <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">too</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> easy should be born in mind.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Adori:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I start wondering if i play a completely different game than some of you...So get used to harder fights again.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Alright.

<br>
In general, I find that objective and considered discussions of mage strengths and weaknesses pay off in the long run.  While transvergance was nerfed, mages as whole have become stronger in the last two years, primarily as a result of an open discussion of pet advantages and disadvantages.<br>
<br>
Besides, it makes little sense to argue in favor of an unneeded upgrade.  If all mages really need are better tactics, then we can solve <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">that</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> ourselves with this forum.<br>
<br>
I am in agreement with the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gospel of Improved Reclaim Energy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> according to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Brother Jochan</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

There may in fact be no problem here, except ignorance.  But then, sharing information is what this forum is for.<br>

Consider your statement,<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>When I hit PoP and started testing various mobs, it seemed that even yard trash lost more like 5% health or even less per pet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->In other words, the damage per pet had decreased.  If a yard trash mob has 15k hitpoints, then 5% is 750 damage.  750 damage for how much mana?  400.  That's a 1.875 effeciency.  I realize focus items and such factor in but consider Firebolt of Tallon's unspec/unfocused effeciency: 3.84.  That's a 104% improvement!<br>
<br>

<br>
power = dps*hp<br>

Healing mage hps = 3500(pet hp) + 2300 healing<br>
<br>
I estimate that would take around 3600 unspecialized mana. That could chain 9 unspecialized pets.<br>
<br>
Chaining mage dps = 30(pet)<br>
Chaining mage hps = 3000(pet hp) + 27,000 (9 chained pets)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MageHealer Power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: 215*5300 = 1,139,500<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hypotetical mob</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: 75*15000 = 1,125,000<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chaining Mage Power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: 30*30000 = 1,050,000<br>
<br>
Healing wins, chaining loses.  Of course the chain-petter can just keep chaining pets, but then he's spending more mana on a longer kill which won't necessarily get faster xp.  Realistically specialization and other factors will enter in, but this is just to point out the danger of assuming a positive trade time for mana.<br>
<br>
And the mobs I kill are nothing special really, just yard trash in tier one zones, PoD in particular-- but not the baby fly things.  Yes some mobs are light blue but they give significantly more experience per kill than dark blue luclin mobs did.  I also figure that killing these will give me practice for tackling mobs in PoV and PoS.<br>

Also consider that Chaining pets need not be a solo tactic.  If you were to group with a slower, chaining might very will move back in front of sustaining, or rather, sustain+burning.  <br>
<br>
I don't think it's right to think of enhancing pet heals as turning us into a pet-cleric.  Our primary strategy has always been burn-down.  Aggro is a large limitation in burn-down.  Healing lets you do something productive in the time that you can't nuke.  I agree that chain-healing pet should not be the most viable option, I think that it should work as part of the traditional burn-down method.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 914<br> <font color=#333333>(2/7/03 10:52:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=150>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Brainstorm: How to fix PoP Mage soloability</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I estimate that would take around 3600 unspecialized mana.

You did address specialization, and obviously the Spell Casting Mastery AA in your dissertation, but if you add in the concept of meditating while the pet fights, it will generally skew the results in favor of chaining.  This is with or without considering Specialize.<br>

I could also mention reclaim chaining, where each new pet was made with the mana reclaimed from the last pet.

Level 64 drastically increases soloing speed outside pop back to FG speed and that is from my experience compareable to tier 1 group speed. Even then of course group setups/places widely vary so that there will always be faster and slower exp groups. So how fast do we need to be able to solo?

However, the only point in mentioning slow at all was to show that sustaining and chaining can exist side-by-side even if one solo technique is generally favored over the other.  <br>
<br>
It does not need to be slow, necessarily.  Maybe you are grouped with a wizard who alternates in stuns to decrease mob damage output.  Maybe you are duoing, two mages with air pets.  Maybe the mbos have a strong magic attack that your pets are resistant to.  Maybe the mobs are lower dps higher hps mobs.<br>

and btw just soloed a planarian larvae in plane of disease(hit for 28<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  The pet enraged and I had stepped in to take a few hits(remember doing that anyone?) but I did manage to win.  I think if I had a healinv III item or the level 60 pet heal the fight would have been won fairly easily.  Seriously, playing my mage now feels just like it did back when I was in my 20s and 30s.  Fights are a tad longer, stakes are a tad higher, and I have a few new toys but otherwise my strategy is very traditional. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=immlazen>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 202<br> <font color=#333333>(2/9/03 5:17:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=456.topic&index=159>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Brainstorm: How to fix PoP Mage soloability</span><hr size=1> Excuse me, but Im at the point where I am &quot;VERY MUCH&quot; against chaining be a tactic to say we are on par with other soloers.<br>
<br>
YOU chainers just dont get it!!.  WTF!  Im taking it you are very intelligent.  So read my LIPS<br>
<br>
You cast pet, pet last 12-14 seconds on Tier 2+ mobs.  That means as soon as you cast a pet, you are casting another one.  Not BOV...nothing.  That is the problem with chaining in POP!!<br>
<br>
Yes in the world before POP you had time to do other things that made chaining acceptable to some.  But POP took all that away.  Ive tried Chaining...Ive tried Heal pet/Nuke.  IM telling you from FACTS...not what I think...or hypothetical, chaining does not work on Tier 2+ mobs.<br>
<br>
Then someone says &quot;well if you have a slower&quot;.  Hello??  We are trying to see what fix POP Mage soloability...not duo.  <br>
<br>
Now, seeing as chaining doesnt work and keeping pet alive dont work,,,,what would help Mages solo to lvl 65?  What ideas?  Or is it hopeless?<br>

However:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Goladus:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You may be right about chaining not always forming an upper limit on soloability.  Some initial back-of-the-envelope estimates support the idea that against mobs with of a sufficient DPS, chaining breaks down.  However, in my pre-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> experience, I was always able to solo stronger mobs with less mana by chaining.  Also, without analysis, it seems hard to believe that healing a pet could be nearly as efficient as chaining <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(it ought not to be)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so how could alternating nukes and heals work?  But the analysis awaits.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Immlazen:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You seem to consistantly read some position in my posts that is more extreme than I intend.  First of all, I see chaining as only one strong mage tactic, albeit an important and powerful one.  My past experience with it suggested to me that it was a good estimate of the upper bound of mage-mob solo power, but as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Goladus</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> points out, I am probably mistaken with high DPS mobs.  As you also point out.<br>
<br>
Also, analyzing chaining is illuminating, because it is simpler to analyze.  The pet is probably un-buffed, or at least under-buffed, and unequipped.  It is a good estimate of raw pet power.  Sustaining pets is harder to analyze.  First, a greater variety of pets can be sustained, and in my experience, only earth is a reliable pet for chaining, especially as PTK <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(Pets To Kill)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> rises.  Second, because the choices the mage makes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(nuke, heal, or wait)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dramaticly effect the outcome.<br>
<br>
I do not think it is reasonable to demand that mages solo as well as kiters post-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, although many mages clearly want to.<br>
<br>
Besides chaining or tanking, I am having good success with a technique I call <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Yoyo Rooting</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I use an earth pet only to root, not to tank, and alternating nuke and re-root.  Thus the pet mostly avoids the mob's high DPS output.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Improved Reclaim Energy</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> helps enormously: pets do get wounded during these kind of fights, and I get to reclaim most of them.  To pull it off, I need distance from the mob, so a long, narrow safe spot, running back and forth between the two safe ends.<br>
<br>
The fights are long and dangerous, but I am beginning to get the hang of them, and death is paying me fewer visits.<br>
<br>
Lastly, if a mob chews through pets in under 15 seconds, then neither chaining or sustaining is going to cut it.<br>
<br>
If non-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> experience is un-nerfed, and the consequences of doing so are not unreasonable, then I would think mages can solo steadily to 65 outside <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
If mage pets are made effectively tough enough, by whatever means <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(greater hitpoints, better pet heals, slow or stun shield)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then this will probably make mages significantly more powerful, and I am not sure that can justified.<br>
<br>
Or, perhaps as is being suggested, what mages need to do is summon themselves some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cajones</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, put on their thinking caps, and master new tactics in order to solo from 61 to 65.<br>
