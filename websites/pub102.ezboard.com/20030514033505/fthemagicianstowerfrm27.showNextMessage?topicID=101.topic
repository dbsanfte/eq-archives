<br>
Secondly, this is NOT advice for duels.  Perhaps some of the things that I say here can be used in a duel, but I have general PvP in mind when I write this.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Okay<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>General Advice on PvPing </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
1.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Resists, Resists, Resists, and oh yeah, Resists</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes, I know, you may have heard this a billion times, but its so important to have good resists.  Magic Resistance by far is the most important, as it keeps people from getting snared, rooted, and any other immobilizing spell.  Rooted/Snared Mage = Dead Mage.  <br>
<br>
&quot;Good Resists&quot; are (if you can), breaking 120 on your resist tables.  I understand how hard it is to reach that magic number, but unfortunately, if you want to be able to PvP effectively in your level range ( 8 levels), 120 and above will allow you a decent chance to resist spells cast on you by those (much) higher then yourself.  Generally, I have always tried to keep my resists at least 100, but you can always mix and match your gear to get the best results.  Remember, MR is the absolute most important.  If nothing else, raise your MR.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some cheap (under 2k pp per item) suggestions for gear<br>
<br>
Froggie Crown<br>
<br>
Blue Diamond stuff (with PoP out, BD gear is getting cheaper and cheaper, on Vallon, a BD bracer sells for about 1.3k)<br>
<br>
Golden Diamond Mask<br>
<br>
Hollow Bone Bracer<br>
<br>
Shaded Shield, Dagger, etc<br>
<br>
Vellum Jacenth (can't spell) Ring (14 MR is always a good thing)<br>
<br>
Diamond Wedding Band (not sure if it is this, but I mean the  8 vs all ring)<br>
<br>
Student's Homework<br>
<br>
Stein of Moggok ( 25 to disease ain't something to laugh at)<br>
<br>
Sorcerous Bowl (actually not sure of the price, it might be expensive..but its darn good)<br>
<br>
Cloak of Ice Bear<br>
<br>
Don't forget your summoned stuff!  <br>
<br>
34 Shard of the Core,  15 to Cold and... Poison?  ain't so bad if you don't have student's homework<br>
<br>
39 Dagger of Symbols,  5 to MR PR DR<br>
<br>
49 Elemental Blanket, very very uber  15 to MR alone is great and it also blesses the FR and CR as well, I can't think of a better shoulders slot.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Know your terrain</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I cannot CANNOT stress this enough.  For mage PvP, terrain is the most important thing (other than resists) you can possible have.  Height, Hills, Trees, Buildings, Water, and Corners are essential to the PvPing Mage.  Use them to their greatest effect.  Terrain mainly comes in handy for Melees, but sometimes helps against casters too.<br>
<br>
Hills and Gullies and Height<br>
<br>
They are probably the greatest things since sliced bread for Mage PvP. Nothing confuses a melee type more than running around, circle strafing, going up a hill and back down, and all other things.  Actually, one of my favorite tricks to use against melees is to have levitate on myself (see below for more on buffs), run up a hill (preferably a tall one, but any tall object will do. the Spires are excellent examples of non-hill tall things you can climb) and immediately go off the hill and into the air, the melee will either not know where to look, or will be unable to hit you, this allows you to sneak in a nuke while jober beats down on the mob.  <br>
<br>
Against a caster, the Hill loses some of its potency, as nukes do not necessarily have to be in LoS (line of sight) to hit you.  However, you can still use hills to great effect to go out of range of nukes (if he can't see you to follow you, you can go out of range of his nukes without him knowing), or to hide when initiating an attack.<br>
<br>
Water (max out your swimming!  Mines at 190 right now)<br>
<br>
If hills are the bread for Mage PvP, then water is the butter.  I know its an exploit, I know some people call it cheap and cheating, but yes, water allows you to totally negate any spell effects cast on you if hes on land and your underwater.  Strafing in and out of the water allows you to pop off a nuke then hide again while he, in frustration cannot cast on you.  Also, you've got Jober to beat down on him, so even if you don't cast on him, you still got Jober (assuming hes not rooted...more on that later)  <br>
<br>
Also, water can be used very effectively like hills to confuse melee types as well, since water allows all of you to be submerged, you are virtually invisible to the melee who can't hit what he can't see.  Also, if you have good swimming, chances are (not 100 percent of course) that the other guy won't, so water also allows you to run away (which is good, because you won't be dead)<br>
<br>
Yes, I know what people say about water, and to them I say: this is a PvP server, you knew the risks when you signed up.  The goal is to win (or not die), if Verant accidently put the bug in, it still is part of the physics of the game and thus, is a tool to use.  <br>
<br>
3.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Buffs</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Levi<br>
<br>
if your  39, there no reason that you should not constantly have levitate and a billion levi rings on yourself.  We have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>insta cl</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> [/b] levitation by virtue of the levi ring.  Levitation should not be ever off your character during a fight for more than the 2 seconds it takes to activate another levi ring from your inventory.  Why?  See above.<br>
<br>
Sow<br>
<br>
I know it sounds preposterous, but actually, SOW isn't as important to us as levi is when it comes to vs melee.  If you're higher (in height) than the melee, he can't touch you, sow or not.  Still, if you have SOW, it makes life very much easier, especially if you don't have favorable terrain (hills, water) to work with.  SOW lets you run away too, and pet kite the PC more effectively as well.  (although, if your good, you can pet kite the PC melee without SOW, I have killed idiot warriors and paladins this way).  Vs casters, SOW becomes very much more important as it will allow us to outrange the caster's nuke much more quickly.  Also, although its kinda iffy if your around hilly terrain or if theres a height difference, your bolts, by virtue of outranging traditional nukes, can be used much more effectively than standard nukes.  However, a lot of skill (which i don't have) goes into perfecting the technique of maximizing your bolts on PvP, so using bolts is situational at best.  (unless your in a really flat place like Overthere, in that case, let em fly).  However, when in doubt, standard nuke. <br>
<br>
As for how to get, run3 is always good for general occasions, plus it can't be dispelled, JBoots are good if you're willing to spend the time (and aggravation, and also willing to risk being PKed in SRO) to get them, going to nexus and other populated areas and donating for sows helps too (a really underhanded tactic, is to bank/put all your gear in bags, walk up to a guy naked, and ask for a CR SOW) SOW potions are also a solid investment.   <br>
<br>
Elemental Line, Shield Line<br>
<br>
As mages, there is no reason NOT to have these two spells constantly on you, an extra 20 or more boost to MR, FR, and CR is good stuff.<br>
<br>
Focus Items<br>
<br>
Essential: Ring (haste)<br>
<br>
Optional: Bracer (depends on your style, I personally use the bracer, but its not as essential as the ring)<br>
<br>
Pet buffs<br>
<br>
Expedience/Sow/Velocity/Burnout/Damage Shield.  Nuff said, no reason not to have any of em on your pets.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
4.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Initiate/Prepare</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
  Its a sad truth, but Mages, when caught flat-footed, are sucky at PvP.  Even if you take all the necessary preparations (buffs, resists, etc), if you get jumped, you lose surprise, first strike, and other essential things necessary to mage PvP (losing first strike = loss of a free nuke).  Run away and come back when hes not ready is an optimal solution.  Likewise, running away and leading him to more favorable terrain is a good alternative to this solution.   <br>
<br>
 Also, pick your battles carefully, if you don't think you can take the guy, then don't take the guy.  If hes got too high resists, or if hes just simply too darn good for you, then walk away.  Theres a guy on VZ named gruffer (duno how to spell his name offhand), hes a pally(?), and I honestly believe that to kill him, a &quot;raid&quot; of more than 2 full groups of balanced PvP classes of necros, clerics, shadowknights, and others are necessary to kill him.  This is not because hes uber twinked, (actually, his gear is defiantly NOT the best on VZ), but because he is simply, a VERY good PvP player.  People like that, walk away from.<br>
<br>
5.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Basic Tactics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
  Run in circles! Run Diagonally! (hold down right mouse button and depress 2 arrows to do so) Great for confusing melees, let the melee follow you (which he will do unless he can't see you, or hes really stupid) and watch Jober beat down on his sorryness.<br>
<br>
 I'm not positively sure on this one, but I think that the summon companion spell breaks fear on pets, I've cast this spell a few times when my pet was feared and he wasn't feared when he showed up..  i'm not sure though if they've fixed this, or whether it was just coincidence.   Nevertheless, summon companion is extremely useful,especially if you've got a rooted/snared pet, for bringing the pet to you (and probably to the enemy).<br>
<br>
 Mem your pet spell!  Believe it or not, summoning a new pet if the old one gets ganked IS a good idea, being petless is VERY VERY bad during a PvP match.  Likewise, if the pet is unsalvageable (dotted, rooted, snared, debuffed, and has 2 percent health left), don't be afraid to /pet get lost and make a new pet!  The pet is half of your attack power, use it.<br>
<br>
 Bolts vs Standard DDs, already talked about this in the &quot;Sow&quot; part of this&quot;<br>
<br>
Multiple Targets:  Fighting these takes patience, skill, and luck.  First off, you shouldn't do it.  Taking on one person by yourself is hard enough.  Multiple Target PvP is more the domain of SKs, Rangers, Druids, and Necros.  Basically, my best advice to this is hit and run tactics.  Run in, send pet, nuke someone then run away and hope to god that they don't track you ) if they do, zone.  Underhanded, yes, but thats the only way you can conceivably win.  You won't win in a straight up fight.  <br>
<br>
6.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Advanced Tactics</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Ok, this is where it all gets dicey.  I don't know how you play, but this is what I've done in the past.  Some of it may work for you, some (perhaps none) of it may not.  Also, these things are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>situational</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Use these only if practical (many times they won't be).  I make absolutely no guarantees on this that they will work...  Also, Keep in mind that all my tactics are used for initiating PvP and offense.  If you get attacked, run and come back to fight another day.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>pincer</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This will only work if target is relatively stationary (medding, sitting, or otherwise occupied with doing something).  It takes time to set up, so move quickly. <br>
<br>
 Park your pet near them, and invis it or camouflage it behind something in some way that they can't see it.  Forests, or other places with visual obstructions are good for this.  Put it close enough so that your target(s) are in the pet's agro range.  Then quickly move to a different location from your pet (opposite great but any direction thats not in the same general direction your pet will attack him(them) from is good).  Have pet attack target, wait for pet to engage target, then nuke (i like to bolt because graphic is gone so they can't see where it came from, and its got a good range, better than nuke).  If you do this right, and with a little luck, the guy will think that your hiding in the general direction your pet came from, so he'll face that way and run that way.  Hopefully, this'll allow you to get an extra shot (or debuff attempt) (aside from the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>standard</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> first strike).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Pet Proxy</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This ones a little underhanded and dishonorable, and your pet has to be good (do decent PvP damage) to do this.  I think pets do roughly 2/3 of their max damage to Players (probably/could be wrong on this one), so judge your pet accordingly.  <br>
<br>
The tactic is simple.  Target the victim, hide, send Jober in (SOW/Expedience/Velocity is absolutely necessary), monitor jober's health/status.  When pet gets rooted/snared or killed,  summon pet back to you (if salvageable), debuff the hell out of it (or make a new pet), resow it, send it back in.  After doing so, change hiding spots to ensure that the guy does not catch your hiding spot   Rinse/Repeat.  When confident, come out and smack him down with everything you've possibly got.  If you do this right, you'll be a good distance from him and will have the luxury of multiple nukes (bolts if applicable) before hes able to close distance to circle-strafing/casting range).  This tactic works best in places with (duh) alot of good hiding places.  It will not necessarily kill your opponent, but will (again, if you do it right), eventually succeed in driving him away from the zone (and thus away from your camp/experience farm).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>MOB Shield</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mostly only good for dungeon use.  (PvP in dungeons is baaad for mage's health)<br>
Only works if you have good faction with the MOBs.  (lguk is a prime (and only one I can think of) example of this.  <br>
<br>
MOBs are visual obstructions too!  Use em the same way you would use any other tree, rock or obstruction.  <br>
Also, if you have faction with them, and the other guy doesn't, then by running into the mobs, you've just given yourself free Guards against him. (as long as hes in their level agro range). Use the Mobs as &quot;safe zones&quot; (just make sure you don't use bolts, AEs, or anything else like that around them).  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>PvP Agro-Pet Kiting</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Only good for fighting melees.<br>
<br>
SOW is a must (although if you do it right, and he doesn't have sow, and hes fairly stupid you can live without SoW)<br>
<br>
l33t Skillz at a FPS (first person shooter i.e. Castle Wolfenstein, UT, Quake III, Half-Life) also very important.  <br>
<br>
Very simple, but deadly.  I've probably killed most of the melees I've ever fought this way with this tactic.  Circle strife and Diagonal run around the guy, making best use of hills, gullies, valleys, and height and have the guy follow you around trying to hit you.  If your skilled enough, he'll never touch you. If your resists are good enough, and with a little luck. he'll never snare you either.  Eventually the pet will beat him down enough to cause/force him to turn on the pet (maybe).  When that happens, pop off a nuke/debuffing action.  If he stays on the pet, and you know nuking (be conservative when you think about your nuking capibility) isn't enough to kill him before he takes the pet out, run away (hopefully he'll follow you and get off the pet), and if/when he kills the pet, make a new one and send it after him.  Repeat until hes dead.  <br>
<br>
Well thats it, I suppose.  Good luck and good hunting out there to all you PvPin Mages!<br>
