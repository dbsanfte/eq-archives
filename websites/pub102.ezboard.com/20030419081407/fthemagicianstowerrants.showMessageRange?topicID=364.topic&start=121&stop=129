Some points<br>
<br>
1) Actually this debate has picked up again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Thanks very much, enjoy good debate with folk who know their stuff. Disagreeing with someone doesn't mean they are wrong, nor does it mean they are a &quot;bad&quot; person, then again think you know that, just wish more did.<br>
<br>
2)  Well as for intelligence and &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, I used to have an IQ over 170, no kidding, cannot lay claim to that now however since a while back whatever caused long term chronic illness also caused 2 weeks of extremely low bloodsugar resulting in brain damage :/ Ask a diabetic what 2 weeks of hypo would be like that left you just able to perform basic human functioning. Hence I now have a sort of reverse dyslexia, WRITING is difficult for me, not reading. Total pain in ass when you used to have genuine reason to be proud of your diction and lexicological knowledge *sigh*. Also I hate this damn keyboard but have refused, so far, to pay for a better one for purely stupid reasons (hey, I can be stupid and reserve the right to do so! :&gt;)<br>
<br>
2) Ick, you were in Bosnia, for what it's worth you have my sympathy, and I'm sure folk are alive and happy now who otherwise wouldn't be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Man that place shows how moronic, wasteful and insane bigotry can be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Can't stand idiots here when they go on about Ireland, Protestant, Catholic...all that crap, ugh.<br>
<br>
3) I trust any politician, regardless of type, about as far as I can p*ss in a hurricane :&gt; <br>
<br>
4) Bush does have two points of personal gain if Iraq's invaded, you just can't ignore that in any questions of his personal desires for war there. Same with any other politician, hence in the UK there is the Register of MPs Interests, I'd guess there's similar in USA and probably better worked. Pfft, sleaze bags politicians here, one Tory MP was either major shareholder or member of 290 companies, how in the hell canhe be said to be non-biased in almost *any* area involving trade? Also, isn't it a tad ridiculous to have many profit making or political external interests when your job is *being* an elected official?<br>
  Regardless of whether or not the rest of the Administration has possible bias, the President *does* have very definate areas of personal gain if Iraq is invaded. That's terrible for international credibility.<br>
<br>
5) Would you care to bet that there are not many political conspiracies going on today that will be discovered some time in the future? No I dont mean weird far out stuff like &quot;The Illuminati&quot; and that kind of X-Files stuff, I mean yer usual dirty rotten political crap. Whether it be backing for terrorists, political bribes, wars being set up or such like. To ignore the fact that &quot;conspiracies&quot;  go in politics, and anywhere there is power such as big business, ignores *history*. Start from Julius Ceasar's murder and Anthony's smart sound byte, and work up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heck, work back even! Lot of Greek's had to drink hemlock...<br>
<br>
6) I view &quot;socialism&quot; from a moral stand point and not from strictly political one, I am not in a political party and don't *want* to be in one, the goal of politics is to make *people's lives better*, not the ones who are actually engaged *in* the politics--a distinction I wish could be branded itno politicians :&gt; Many of my family were crippled, maimed, cheated and some even killed because of rat bag vermin who made a mint off them. I was unemployed for years and my region devastated because of greedy, moronic Capitolism of the worst sort. I saw the morals and decency of my community ruined by it. To put it mildly, I freakin' HATE rat bags who profit from the misery of others. I don't care if they are poor people who now deal heroin, or politician's and big business men who shut down companies for asset stripping, degrade workers' rights and pay, downsize, cut health service budgets but reduce business tax so that *their* companies save a fortune from, etc etc. Oh downsizing can be a legitimate need of a business, but is usually a short term act of utter stupidity that harms their profits. <br>
  Ask most people in the North fo England or Scotland what they think of Margaret Thatcher and her government and you'll get an idea :/ yeech, union and industrial laws *did* need updating and certain things fixed, but what went on then was foul. it came close to mass civil unrest, and if had gone further, violent uprisings, and that's *not* a joke, had enough riots as it was, ick.<br>
  Unregulated Capitolism is a *horror*. So to is stupid, bureacratic, inhuman Socialism. I just really resent this attitude that Capitolism is a political and *good* thing. It's a form of economics, if you take that as morality or politics, God help you! Without some form of regulation and humanitarianism, it's stark brutal Law of the Jungle, and in human settings, that simply does not work, 'cause it creates catastrophy.<br>
<br>
7) I dislike Blair or several reasons, too long winded to go into. However, if he is under taking the current actions from genuine concern, yup that is something surprising and admirable. I don't know if it's genuine or whether he sees profit long term though, hm...GOod thing to ponder and it had occured to me after one interview with him lately. I just wish if there was a specific *international* threat they could simply say so and thus prevent all this uncertainty with the UN, then again even if they did they may have good security reasons for *not* saying it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's unfortunetely true that the UN often is pretty damn stupid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Then again it's humanitarian efforts have been very important.<br>
<br>
9) American military and political actions have been damn stupid at times (Somalia). Then again it's humanitarian efforts have been very important.<br>
<br>
10) Please remember belarkan is probably not writing in his native tongue, unless you are very fluent in another *written* language that causes problems which may get both sides undually heated.<br>
<br>
11) Caenn, you are right to point out that yes, some folk who are anti-war may well be so for less than decent reasons. I am not going to bother searching the Net for the groups of right wing thugs who are for the war, the companies who back it for monetary reasons, the media owners who are bought by one side or another or have major financial interests (again UK is bad currently in that regard), the US governments many shadowy organizations it has backed or used to support it's own ends. If you are an adult with decent understand you will *know* that crap goes on, regardless of sides, just he who has more gold, often makes things look more shiny *cough* <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
  Some parts of America still have the &quot;Reds under the Bed&quot; mentality, enough is enough for Pete's sake :/  Same as twerps going on about &quot;imperialism&quot;. Globalism could be good, but seems to have many bad points as there seems to be  a lot of crap and anti-ecology or humanitarian items going on with it: i.e. it's being pushed by Big Business and some of the things about it stink. Sooner or later we really DO have to go &quot;global&quot;, and trade will likely be a major factor in that, but this current stuff seems &quot;iffy&quot;. Then again violent riots against it are counter productive and no good for poor sods who get caught up in it or clean up the mess, sheesh.<br>
<br>
12) Powell, lol true enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Who knows *sigh*, guy actually did some smart and decent things, can only hope he still can or will. He did try to get UN involved, thenagain if you wish to *really* take a bad look at it..erf.... Some times hope is all ya got.<br>
<br>
13) belarkan, Caenn does have a point: death is not pretty, far from it. In regards to war all I know is images and stories from many family who were there, personally I've seen a family get squished under a truck, and another guy get knifed (actually truth be told I don't KNOW that guy died for sure, just he had a flick knife length of butcher knife stuck up high under his ribs, and I think the papers said there was a killing in that area, gah). I didn't see many relatives and friends actually die, but I did see in many cases how they deteriorated and suffered, and I miss them a whole bloody lot. Death is *bad* to put it mildly, think most of us agree on this.<br>
<br>
14) Foreign investment in the USA, ah, the glorious stupidity of Thatcher and Reagan! Ok so they sold OUR public utilities to FOREIGN companies?! has anyone heard of &quot;treason&quot;, &quot;cholera epidemics&quot;, &quot;fire bridgades, arson and insurance&quot;...Other things to, but some of that stuff seriously ranks as treason. Sounds silly, but if you study histroy you KNOW why public utilties WERE forcibly brought under government control. having soem private company dealinsg with such may not be a bad thing, but selling them off totally....omfg...*DUMB*, and any government minister who makes profit off such should be hung...ok life in jail I'm against the death sentence <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
  Go check up on rail crashes, problems with water treatment, epidemics historical and current in regard to such.<br>
<br>
15) Some folk do protest against war just to be *trendy*...oh boy...*rolls eyes*<br>

116 countries &quot;non aligned&quot; published a common letter, in which they stated that they are against a war, 6 of those countries are in the security council.<br>
<br>
Russia still officially supports France and Germany.<br>
<br>
And 75 per cent or more people in EU are against a war, at least without further proof from M.Blix inspectors.<br>
<br>
France is really only the convenient visible part of the iceberg.<br>
<br>
You seem to be comfident that anyway USA will get support from those countries (at least China and Russia) at the last moment, and to be honest i would tend sadly to think the same, for the simple reason that noone is fully honest in this affair, countries will do what suits better their interest.<br>
<br>
But...what will happen if anyway those countries stick to their initial opinion, and deny USA a UN second resolution, and ask for more time to inspectors?<br>
<br>
USA stated that they will invade Irak anyway, and noone is silly enough not to believe those 210 000 soldiers could go back home without a fight.<br>
Many people already stated that this huge army is the very reason S.H would really disarm, under such a threat.<br>
I would /bow before your president if such thing was to happen without pouring any blood.<br>
<br>
Still, how is it possible for a country to destroy what it doesnt have?<br>
<br>
What do exactly USA see that almost the rest of world is failing to see?<br>
<br>
Let me state it again: your country is isolated.<br>
<br>
When i read you above, talking of boycot, and when you talk about the reasons why Russia and China wont veto a second resolution, this is the same leitmotiv, you couldnt stop it for your life.....power, money, power, money, power, money......Power, money.<br>
<br>
UN are far from perfect, but this is not the Nations Society, nor S.H is Hitler, lets be serious, this type of language is only for the masses.<br>
<br>
So, your powerfull country want to apply democracy in Irak, but when the same democracy is applied to it, all of a sudden you are reluctant to admit this is democracy; it becomes useless.<br>
<br>
You prefer to imprison your mind in a binary vision of the world (manicheism if you would like).<br>
<br>
Yes you are isolated, and let me tell you: you enjoy every single minute of it.<br>
The lonely power, standing right in its boots; knowing what everyone else has failed to understand, as the sun goes down over Alamo...hehe.<br>
<br>
UN becomes all of a sudden a useless tool?<br>
Dont you think that, even with all its imperfections, it could be an international democracy?<br>
<br>
And in democracy like everywhere, any power needs its counter power.<br>
I think this is the essence of the present issue, USA have atm, no counter power, nothing that would refrain it even a single bit.<br>
<br>
Nothing but UN, this fragile institution.<br>
<br>
If you can't see, really, that your country is more and more seen as a major threat for peace in the world, then im sorry for you.<br>
Not a threat because you are bad guys either (Rumsfeld and co are), but for mechanical reasons; if for any cause, things goes wrong in USA (internal policy, rise of fanatism, whatever...) there is nothing to counter balance its power at the moment, and this is scary.<br>
<br>
You should realise that your former presidents were more moderated during the cold war.<br>
This new attitude should give you a hint.<br>
<br>
People are aware enough that balance in the world is a fragile thing, you cant simply just step in and say you will change it by the force, that would open the doors to too many horrors, and it wouldnt be the first exemple in History.<br>
<br>
<br>
You seem to think UN will fade into history; i think it will have a great fate.<br>
<br>
Do you know what is sad?<br>
We can credit your President for his tribute to the European Construction, for it seems his hot head behavior will have the side effect to help Europe to build a foreign policy...at the expense of our old friendship with USA.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, this was (i hope) the best explanation i can give for my feelings on this situation.<br>
Onto the details, there are a few things i cant really let writen here! =)<br>
About peace demonstrators and boycott:<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;it's a whole lot more effective than running around in the street singing &quot;koom-by-ah&quot;.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
Not always, and ill try again to link this matter, with another war: you do remember right, that M.Milosevic had to leave the power, as a last solution, not because of NATO bombings (which barely scratched him), but because of demonstrators in the streets of Belgrade?<br>
<br>
Im aware that some people may be manipulated, especially by those leftists you dislike so much, but most of the time, when things cant change, the street can shack the tree very effectively.<br>
Thats what is starting to happened in Italia atm btw, people are lying on the railways to stop weapons going to Irak, of course its linked with internal policy, but still...streets can change thing, why do you think M.Berlusconi has started to change his mind.<br>
<br>
Also, you seem to think that boycot would be a good idea to &quot;punish&quot; france.<br>
First of all there is nothing to punish, we are all democratic friends, did you forget?<br>
We can talk.<br>
Thats my take on it, and if really you think that power and money will make it for legitimacy, i can only advice you to read Rousseau.<br>
<br>
And then we got this, as a proof of your good understanding of free market (isnt it ironical in such a thread) and international affairs.<br>
<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;What would happen to France without the United States? Conversely, what would happen to the United States without France?<br>
<br>
You see my point? Ok, good.&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
France, this little country, also appears to be a decent part of the European Union, this minor entity. <br>
Mostly for economic, historic, and cultural reasons.<br>
<br>
Now if really, you dont see what i mean, just ask yourself why you eat hormones beef full of antibiotics while ill never, even if i wanted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Bush and Blair know the horror that we are going to find when we get there. That simple. And they know that once we do get there and the entire picture is laid bare for the world, all of the detractors - yes, even you Bel - are going to be swallowing their tongues trying to explain away their former positions. &quot;<br>
<br>
You have absolutely got to be KIDDING ME! He is a dictator Caenn, not a @#%$ clown. WTF would you expect from a dictator for Christ's sake?!?<br>
<br>
Hehe, sorry i couldnt resist.<br>
<br>
He wouldnt be the first one to be invited in The White House or at L'Elysee either.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I for one, would be very disapointed if no torture chambers were found under Sadham castles.<br>
<br>
Really.<br>
<br>
And if we can throw here and there:<br>
50000 &quot;insert religion or ethny here&quot; women were raped night and day in special camps by Sadham soldiers.<br>
Will will also hear some stories, that S.H is having every sunday a bath with blood from young girls.(an actual information some US specialists have tried to sell us, but they finally changed they mind after people start laughing).<br>
<br>
S.H is of course not an Angel.<br>
<br>
But disinformation is a weapon during a war, do you remember Pentagon braging they destroyed Milosevic army when actually not even the tenth had been actually touched?<br>
<br>
Or this story, during the first Golf War, media were claiming and repeating everywhere like sheeps that Irakian soldiers, before they had to leave Koweit City, had turned off the maternity hospital's incubators, and young babies were of course inside.<br>
<br>
Information which turned out to be totally false.<br>
<br>
Or this picture suposed to show the last remains of the victims of Serbs genocid, picture that was in fact showing dead soldiers from UCK.<br>
<br>
So, no S.H isnt an angel, and i bet we will have lots of horrors stories to feed us.<br>
I can see it from here : we will have the same movie of this house burning somewhere in Kurdistan, over and over, until the picture replace any actual thinking.<br>
And conveniently, little will be said about civilian death in Bagdad.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that S.H or Milosevic are innocents, they are monsters, but i dont really expect to have the last words on this before several month after its done.<br>
<br>
If you want to read an excellent author about Disinformation as a weapon during war, i really advice you to read Vladimir Volkoff and his various analisys of propaganda, including the NATO actions on Yougoslavia.<br>
<br>
<br>
Af for what Redorious said, well he explains my own feelings about capitalism much better than i could.<br>

We claim that he is one of the worst Human rights violators that’s pure BS, Ever hear of the genocide that’s going on in Africa ATM? No because why would America care about what's going on in Africa.  More people are dying there by murder then total in Iraq.  And with the WMD issue, we claim he has the will to use them, ok he has aginst his own people but nothing on a HUGE scale and by that I mean attacking another country.  Who's the only country that’s used a WMD on another ohh could that be us. Ok the way we used them was to end WWII we didn’t want our little Soilders to die so we thought hell why not kill thousands of civilans of Japan instead… So I ask who’s the real rouge nation here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverbladetheenchanter>Silverblade the Enchanter</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magi Draconis</span><br>  Posts: 2313<br> <font color=#333333>(2/25/03 5:24:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=124>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> neoje,<br>
<br>
Reason the A-Bombs were dropped on Japan was pretty complex.<br>
1) TO save the lives of probbaly hunreds of thousandso soldiers you beter freakin believe ANY leader with half a brain woudl have dropped the bombs.<br>
<br>
2) There wee plans to secretly ship captured german nerve gas to use on Japan if that was needed.<br>
<br>
3) Large part of why they were used was to do with preventing the Soviet Union taking over Japan and togive Stalin a clear warning.<br>
<br>
4) Although Japan was close to collapse, and there were hints of surrender being possible, Japan need *HAMMERED*. This is something a lot of folk won't talk about, but to put it bluntly, the Japanese due to centuries of isolation and then the insane government and its propaganda, had become nationally racist and arrogant to a terrible degree. <br>
  You have to understand that while the majority of German soldiers were not personally involved with the horrors that went on, a majority of the Japanese army *was*. At the end of World War 2, there was public desire for nuking Germany and Japan out of existance, folk were that disgusted and angry. So there was an element  of thinking that Jpaan needed to be *humbled*, it was not enough that dignified surrender happen, they had to be utterly CRUSHED and humiliated. Otherwise that arrogance and racism would not be checked.<br>
  if you think I'm talking crap you need to read up on the histories and personal experiences. While some Japanese protested about the horrors, particularly in the Navy, most whole heartedly went along with them, this was *intstitutionalized mass murder torture, rape, infanticide etc* It was not somtheing to be tolerated and frankly the Japanese military got off too damn lightly, and still HAVE.<br>
  The A-Bombing was to act as a slap to the nation's pride and arrogance.<br>
<br>
5) More folk died in one fire bomb raid in one night on Tokyo than died in both  Hiroshima and Nagasaki.<br>
<br>
6) It's one of the great, sad, bitter ironies of life that while the children there certainly did not deserve that fate, nor did many of the inhabitants, what the heck can you do to a *nation* to make them understand *personally* that war is horrible, that acts of horror on others *are* horror, and that someone who is not of your nationality is not inferior, except by causing absolute devastation? It would take decades, centuries of education to get that into folk, and by which time there may have ben another war started by them *points at Germany WW1 and WW2*<br>
<br>
7) WHile it's fine now for folk to say &quot;Yeah they woudl have surrendered&quot;, that's with hindsight and that may not be *correct*. The fanatascism and insanity of the Japanese regime at that time cannot be taken lightly. The convinced thousands of civilians to commit suicide rather than be taken alive by the Americans. Despite being short of munitions and food, they fought on bitterly, causing severe casualties to the Allies. Even if Japan as a nation had surrendered, how many woudl *not* surrender and would have fought on to the death? Remember, the fanaticism was *extreme*, the Emperor was a God and the Japanese were not normal humans, but a blessed race--it was like religious fervour. Fanatacism and desperation made the Battle for Berlin carnage that the Western Allies never saw, but knew of, they did not want that on a much larger scale.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  if you wish to debate immoral crap, the worst thing the Allies did in WW2 came afterwards, when the butchers were given immunity for secrets and technology, or were let back inot the communities because they wer leaders or wealthy. *sigh*.

<br>
Kill people in order to give them a lesson, can be highly discussed, for we have to assume that people will remember history, and thats not sure at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
Japan was already about to surrender, and it didnt really  needed to be hammered, since as you pointed out, any night &quot;regular&quot; bombing in Hamburg, Dresde, or Tokyo would kill more people.<br>
<br>
And as a matter of facts, bombings have never help to win any war, it kills civilians, but if we take Germany Exemple, its moral and industrial capacities were left intact by bombings, victory had to be achieved though ground operations.<br>
<br>
Heck, a destroyed weapons factory was rebuilt the day after.<br>

My take on Japan bombing, it that USSR needed to know USA had the nuclear weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caenn>Caenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#333333>(2/25/03 11:30:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=126>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hmm</span><hr size=1> Bel and Silver, you are both right.  Japan would have lost eventually (assuming they'd refused to surrender)...it was just a matter of attrition at that point.  The reason we dropped the a-bomb was two fold.  One, we had a means of ending the war without losing thousands more of our people in the Pacific.  Again, it was a different era.  Killing civilians was a tactic used on all sides - not just by the allies - and while it may not have been right, it was accepted.  Two, it sent a very clear message to the Russians:  We have nukes, we will use them....don't do anything stupid.  Which set the stage for the Cold War.<br>
<br>
Though I don't see how you can say bombing doesn't help to win wars.  Two bombs ended WWII in a matter of days.<br>

Can you say, in all honesty - put the political bullshit aside for a second here - that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will change in Iraq without the removal of Saddam Hussein?  Can you honestly say that?  In the same way, can you honestly say that you believe he will just step down of his own volition?<br>
<br>
I've said it before...the world does not run on hopes and dreams.  You can hope he will change his ways all you want.  The reality of the situation is that you nothing will change without the use of force.  You have to know that.<br>
<br>
Belarkan, even you admit that the only reason he's doing anything we ask him to do now is because we've got 200,000 troops knocking on his door.  The question has already been asked, but I'll ask it again: What do you think will happen when those troops are gone??<br>
<br>
Better yet...let's just pull out of Iraq all together.  Let's stop flying patrols over the north to protect the Kurds and the countries to his north.  Lets stop flying patrols over the south to protect the Shi'ites and the countries to his south.  Hey, I know!!  Let's lift the EEEVIILL sanctions so he can &quot;feed his people&quot;.<br>
<br>
Excuse me, I have to vomit.<br>
<br>
Can you even imagine what the consequences would be if any or all of that were to happen?  <br>

Saddam Hussein understands one thing and one thing only: naked force.  That is the kind of person he is and that is the kind of regime he runs.<br>

Germany suffered a long, on going humiliation, and that's what caused part of the problem. Also it was hard for many to understand or accept *how* they had been defeated. &quot;It was the Jews! the Socialists! the Wealthy! The Poor! The Ups! The Downs!...&quot;<br>
