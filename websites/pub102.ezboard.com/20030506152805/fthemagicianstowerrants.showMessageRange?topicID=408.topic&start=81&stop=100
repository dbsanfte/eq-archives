I suppose the recast change could be done for the right clicks...<br>
<br>
But Earthen Boots do work as they are. The spell does have a 6 second recast time yet it still casts instantly on the boots.<br>
<br>
I guess in short, I don't know what will happen, but using Earthen Boots as an already in game insta-click item with an effect that has a recast time, I would expect all other insta-click items to work the same way after this change. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60465">Xerphanis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arch Convoker</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cantatus>Cantatus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 7:05:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/face.gif height=103 width=50></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: No..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> They do nothing but hurt the enchanters who liked to uses hasted pets in groups that didnt involve killing mini bosses.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Which basically seemed to be most people's problem with the spell.  Everytime someone pulled out a parse of a charmed pet doing 400-1000dps, it was a pet that was hasted everytime.  Hasted pets were also what helped Enchanters to duo bosses.  Faster damage allowed you to get a mob down before charm's duration would fade.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> They did NOTHING to really change Enchanters solo ability, so they didn't nerf this ability with chanters at all.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
So unless it makes it impossible for Enchanters to be able to solo, it's not a nerf?  You don't think making it so charm will be resisted a ton more often (and I know how much more since my mezzes have the same resist adj as the charm on Test) or having charm fade more often isn't a nerf?<br>
<br>
I honestly don't understand why so many people have such a huge problem with Enchanters soloing.  It's not a new ability we were given with PoP.  I soloed in the original game and Kunark and Velious and Luclin.  <br>
<br>
I suppose all the exaggerations of Enchanters getting 2-3 AAs an hour would upset some people, but being an Enchanter that solos in the Planes, I honestly don't think these claims are true.  None of the other Enchanters that solo that I know have even come close to getting an AA this fast.  If it is true, it probably has to be under perfect, unique circumstances and with a hasted pet.  Honestly, I'd say unless you've sat and watched an Enchanter solo and AA firsthand, you've probably been fed a lot of exaggerations (by other classes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Enchanters) on stuff.  Just to give you an example, I had a Wizard in HoH tell me he gets almost a full AA per quad, which I know isn't true since I know how much exp each mob gives solo.<br>
<br>
Regardless though, I see Wizards and Druids quadding in PoP.  I've seen Mages, Rangers, Bards, Necromancers, Shadow Knights, Beastlords, and Shamans all soloing in PoP.  Why shouldn't Enchanters be allowed to solo too? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>The original reason that Necros were such great soloers was primarily because they were such crappy additions to groups. Their entire spell line was self-serving and thus, they were rewarded with great soloing power.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, this relationship no longer seems true, where is it possible for one class to be nearly essential for groups but can also be the best soloers at will.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Necromancers were also given a lot of new spells that made them more desirable in groups (group lich taps.  Clerics, another good group class, were given a lot of useful tools to help them solo.  I think instead of trying to get a class nerfed because they are good in groups and can solo, you should perhaps focus on trying to get Sony to balance out your abilities to solo and benefits in groups.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>
<br>
I'd have to say though that I think a lot of people are reading too much into things.  Lucy <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> shows <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>spell changes</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  You have no clue if things were retooled to fix issues people had.  For all you know boss mobs in BoT now summon 4 giants to help them everytime you engage.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>EDIT:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> All you can see is the spell side of things.  When mobs in AC were made immune to stun so that people could no longer AE them, there was no indication of that on Lucy's.<br>
<br>
IMO there were a lot of areas where the problem was less to do with Charm and more to do with the encounter.  Fpr example, you shouldn't be able to zone in and out a few times to kill a mob b/c it regens extremely slowly. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

I am sick of reading you self-righteous nonsense.<br>
<br>
As to the nerf - class envy aside, anything that reduces my xp rate pisses me off. Not every enchanter relishes soloing and bragging about the power of charm. I regularly group with enchanters and the added DPS provided by a charmed enchanter pet has ALWAYS been welcome.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with you people? Why do BoT minis matter that much - their loot isnt that great - sure they drop the occasional rune etc, but often times they drop nothing at all - RvR? Most enchanters I know that use charm to solo the likes of minis do it as much for the challenge as for the loot.<br>
<br>
Next time you zone into BoT try counting the enchanter corpses...<br>
<br>
The only enchanters I have contempt for are the ones who contributed to all this nonsense by bragging about their kills.<br>
<br>
Bottom line - charm nerf slows down xp for me and for many others who actually like grouping - enchanters, druids, bards and wizards included! That sucks and you class envy losers calling for nerfs ends up hurting everyone.<br>
<br>
One other thing - I may be wrong, but it appears to me that many of the major encounters in PoP are designed and balanced with high level charm in mind. Maybe the likes of Jaytee could comment on this without giving out spoiler info.<br>

Mages discussed the chanter charm ramifications here and it's bearing on our own charm issues because they are related.<br>

For me, the changes seem reasonable even though mage charm is more nerfed than chanter charm as a result of these changes. <p><table width=100%><tr><td width=33%><font color=blue><i><b>Sage Svenuce Summonstuff</b></i></font><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Clerics, another good group class, were given a lot of useful tools to help them solo.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Those enhancements were done Pre-PoP. I'm fairly certain clerics can't solo anything now in new PoP zones.<br>
<br>
My major problem with Charm soloing (of all kinds by all classes) is that it provides a more preferential experience method than traditional groups.<br>
<br>
Let's for this example, assume that there are 100 Enchanters online and 1000 other classes online at any given time. Let's also assume that there are 50 Bards and 50 &quot;Root classes&quot; that can ghetto mez. Total population, 1200 people.<br>
<br>
1200 people = 200 6 person groups scattered about Norrath.<br>
<br>
Consider Charm, which allows 30 of the Enchanters to solo... You're left with 1170 people, which translates to only 170 groups of 6 people, or 1020 people. This leaves 150 people LFG. (Insert argument here for &quot;Unique&quot; groups different than &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; etc etc).<br>
<br>
Yes, it is true that Charm soloing was possible Pre-PoP. However, for the moderately equipped Enchanter, Charm soloing was NOT more efficient than grouping. Groups provided MORE experience than Charm soloing did, so there was still an incentive for Enchanters to group.<br>
<br>
However, since PoP experience modifiers are now so insanely high, the incentive for an Enchanter to solo now greatly outweighs grouping.<br>
<br>
When much of PoP content is designed with balanced groups in mind with appropriate crowd control and slows, the sudden drop in the available Enchanter population due to Charm soloing negatively affects everyone.<br>
<br>
Of course, in your mind, you're asking, &quot;well what about Mage Charm? or Wizard Snare Kite? or Necro Charm Soloing?&quot;. The point is, Enchanters were designed as a grouping class since the beginning. Therefore, much of the content is designed with them in mind. Thus, Enchanters serve a &quot;unique&quot; role in a group that is not easily replaced with the same amount of resources. Mages, Wizards, Necros, however, are fairly replaceable with comparable DPS.<br>
<br>
Recap?<br>
<br>

<br>
There are plenty of elementals and summoned mobs in tier 3 and up zones and us having some form of control over those mobs kinda made sense to me.  Imo if its gonna be nerfed to uselessness take it out totally and put something worthwhile there.  Otherwise like Ylaine said we get like 1 65 spell thats decent, vortex, and I guess earth pet...<br>
<br>
With all the summoned mobs some GOOD spells that were leaning toward summoned line might be nice.  I like destroy summoned it is pretty handy in the elemental planes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 317<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 7:28:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=91>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Massive Changes on test</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Let's also remember that their Pre-PoP main soloability, Fear Kite, was basically taken away due to the level cap on Fear.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, to be perfectly fair, necro soloing was given a huge boost rather quietly when damage was returned to normal for all dots, even if the mob was not feared or in combat.  So, darkness... load up on dots... send in pet... and run around while the mob chases you and dies is an extremely good strategy right now, and doesn't depend on fear at all. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=haxtk>Hax TK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 7:33:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=92>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.covad.net/~malcolmo/images/orb.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Massive Changes on test</span><hr size=1> Jaytee,<br>

What I was asking about in terms of major PoP encounters was the use of enchanter charm, not mage charm - I never expected mage charm to be good for anything but grinding AA <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
Again - no spoiler info needed, just does it seem that encounters with multiple waves were balanced expecting enchanters to use charm to provide massive DPS.<br>

Youre all ingrateful @#%$, and its a shame its tooken me as long as it has to realize it. I could have saved alot of time<br>
<br>
Im gonna be like hax, that guy with 68 posts, wildet, and the rest of the nameless masses ive encountered in my months at this forum. Im not going to post anymore ideas, im not going to put anymore effort into thinking about the class or the game from a community standpoint, im not going to share anymore parses. In fact, i think im even going to remove my ui from the ui section. After all who needs the burden of all that?<br>
<br>
Never have my efforts been commended. Im not asking for a gold star, all im asking for is at least an ounce of respect. But no, thats too much. For every one person who says they apprecate my opinions (even if they may not agree with them), i meet 5 like wildet. And all for *daring* (gasp) to have (sometimes) non-mainstream opinions, as in doing so &quot;i make the class look bad&quot;.<br>
<br>
From now on im just going to sit back, jump on the lazy wagon, and attack forum regulars (that is whenever i do post which will be sparingly). If balanz, cyricus, ylaine, wezloc, goladus, or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> who does or will contribute to this forum signifigantly now or in the future says something i dont like, im going to not hestiate to let them know what i think. <br>
Now keep in mind, im not going to be constructive at all. That is, i will never say &quot;I disagree with your idea, and heres why. This idea i think is better&quot;. Im just going to say &quot;your idea is stupid&quot; in 5 setances or less.<br>
<br>
So, see yas, i wont burden you with my &quot;self righteous&quot; opinions and posts anymore.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyricusbloodbane>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1371<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 7:41:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=94>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Massive Changes on test</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Youre all ingrateful @#%$, and its a shame its tooken me as long as it has to realize it.

<br>
Now back to the &quot;topic&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd be surprised if there are more than 20 mages per server that are really effected by this. I rather clearly remember the posts about Call as being a waste of a spell slot.. how we (mages) didn't WANT a charm.<br>
<br>
Now its getting &quot;nerfed&quot; and its a huge deal? <br>
<br>
As I said before, I think the accross the board changes to cast times will have a larger impact on the game as a whole rather than the charm changes.<br>

Share opinions? Sure - you do plenty of that and it might be acceptable if you stopped there instead of constantly playing the attention whore.<br>
<br>
Think? A matter of opinion, but to me, your brash style completely mitigates any positive role you play in this community.<br>
<br>
Just because I dont &quot;share&quot; my opinion every 10 minutes doesn't make me lazy or whatever you accused me of, but you see I dont seek approval and some artificial sense of importance the way you do. I enjoy playing my mage - always have regardless of how broken we are. I have played my mage from 8:30am on the day of release and it is still my main. I come here to read what others' experiences are and I contribute when I feel I have something worthwhile to say.<br>
<br>
Today I broke my rule and for that I apologize for that, but I am sick of seeing Noonie insult anyone who has an opinion that is not in agreement with his/her point of view. It just gets old.<br>

Noonie - take a pill - no one really cares that much.<br>
