<br>
They are not Class Balancing issues per se.<br>
<br>
Here is the thread:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <br>
Thanks for finally responding to Mages Absor.<br>
<br>
Needless to say Mages have been a little on the heated side since some of the comments were released from the Fan Faire.<br>
<br>
I don't know if you've followed the thread on the Mage board at all, but the issue that sparked this latest round of &quot;disgust with Verant&quot; was a the comment from Abashi that he still saw mages as overbalanced when it comes to soloing.<br>
<br>
Needless to say this got us going, because post 50 mages are not good soloers when compared to other classes, Monks with average gear are much better than we are, and I would not consider Monks as good as Druid, Shamen, Necros, Wizzards or Enchanters. To watch a monk lvl 58 be able to farm the entire Lava Duct Crawlers area in SOLB by himself is amazing, spawn after spawn. We are great for farming greens and light blues (better than any other class imo), but not xp soloing. I could go into detail about mages not being able to divert enough damage, but I'm sure you understand the game mechanics better than I do post 50. <br>
<br>
My point is post 50, mages are middle of the road soloers, and for Abashi to make a comment like that really got mages questioning if Verant really knows what?s happening in the end game when it comes to mages.<br>
<br>
Please don't read this as an endorsement for more high end soloing abilities, because I hate soloing. <br>
<br>
I would really appreciate it if you could comment on this issue because I think it?s why many mages think that Verant has it &quot;out for them&quot; as of late.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>

Well, let me start by apologizing for sounding rough. It's just that I get frustrated when I get a bunch of commentary that is vague and angry. Obviously there are issues that folks want to talk about, but I can't address unspecific anger.<br>
<br>
As for Mages and their solo ability, they are indeed one of the best solo classes. Up until 50 they can be considered among the top 3. After 50 perhaps they fall more toward the middle of the pack.<br>
<br>
If you look at the life of the class, this places them pretty much third or fourth in over all solo ability, by my estimation. I know that it's tempting to only look at the end game, especially when you're playing it. But the life of the character is more than that. <br>
<br>
And if I seem like I'm rattling your cages a bit, maybe I am.<br>
<br>
I really need you folks to be more precise and less emotional when sending in comments. It makes it much easier for me to present your ideas to the team.<br>
<br>

 I agree with what you say, top 3 pre 50 and middle of the pack post 50, but how is that &quot;Overpowered&quot;?<br>

Alan,<br>
<br>
I know you said that we were not overpowered. But Gordon did. I admit this is hearsay, but it was from a fairly respected member of the Mage community (one that has been Very supportive of VI in the past) so I would have to assume that it was said. I also assume that you would have publicly denied<br>
this comment considering the rukus it was causing amoung mages had it not occurred.<br>
<br>
I know Mages are very divided right now. But it seems as if Verant is too, if you feel one way and Gordan feels another, what are we supposed to respond to? Many mages right now are trying to come up with proof that mages are not overpowered soloers, when I'm not sure that gets you anything.<br>
<br>
Sorry to sound so passionate, but a comment like &quot;Mages are overpowered soloers&quot; would be the equivalent comment to a real life comment like &quot;Road workers are overpaid&quot;, most of the time a comment like that would tend to get a much more passionate and angry response something along the &quot;Road<br>
Workers have to work such and such hours, do not have to work overtime (making this up as an example), get 50 hollidays a year, but yet make much more than some occupations that have the same conditions&quot;. To apply this<br>
to mages, I think the more appropriate comment might have been &quot;Mages have very little risk when soloing light blues, and are able to do it with no physical interaction with their PC, and we think that makes mages oerpowered soloers<br>
in certain situations.&quot; I hope you see my point. We get angry when an open ended comment is made that we have nothing concrete  to really respond to.<br>
<br>
I think one of the greatest things that Verant could do would be to Oficially define the classes more. If this is too much (becaue of the mystique it would remove from the game), at least post your official view on heated topics so that we can react to it. For example, Call of the Hero allows too much content to be skipped (which amazingly most mages agree<br>
with) and as a result it will never be able to be used for upper end dungeons in the future. At least that is something that we can respond to, I would guess the response would be but that's our &quot;special sauce&quot;, we will be somewhat invalidated in the upper game because our Guild views this as our primary job for the Guild, but at that point, the topic can be turned what can we add to keep mages important to Guilds. In this way when a class feels that they are underbalanced they would have a document or comment to react to, rather than attempting to react to sporadic generalizations that are made about them. Also, when public comments are made, be sure to not over generalize when making what could be seen as negative comments about a class.<br>
<br>
Although I am very frustrated by all this, I am very thankful that you've opened it up to discussion so that maybe things can get better. Thanks for doing your job. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I can imagine how stressful your job would be, and it frightens me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I think we try very hard not to 'officially define' any class.  It never helps, and almost always leads to arguments about either the fact that we've chosen the wrong definition or that we're not fulfilling that definition.<br>
<br>
It's far better to just make a class good and fun to play.  Definitions be damned!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Alan,<br>
<br>
How can you ever hope to have balance if there is no definition of what role that class fills within the eq world? You say that you strive to make a class &quot;good&quot;, but what does that mean? In my thinking there would have to be some definition to strive for, in order to make that class &quot;good&quot;? Not all classes can be &quot;good&quot; by being able to control crowds or act as a primary tank, they all inherantly have some definition of role associated with them, whether thats the intention or not.<br>
<br>
Without knowing our true role, how can we show you in concrete ways (which you are asking for) that we are not &quot;good&quot;?  Prior to level 50, we were great soloers, post 50 should we assume that we are not &quot;good&quot; because we are no longer as good of soloers as we were before? Should we assume that we are not &quot;good&quot; because the thing that got us into groups before 50 (raw damage) no longer get us into groups as easily because the game dynamics change so radically to needing to fill more roles in a group?<br>
<br>
When you made the comment about things changing for mages, when referring to mages being better soloers before 50 than after 50? There would have to be some inherant definition there that we don't know. Something like &quot;Pre 50 mages were seen as top 3 soloers with the most dependance on their pets, post 50 they are still dependant on their pets but not as much so (the lesser scaling of pets) and are more dependant on...&quot; I'd fill this in but I have no idea what it is, at one time I would have said COtH when it more easily worked for aggro changes. I can't say its Nukes, because those have also not scaled as well. My point is. Your comments have inherant definition attached to them that we don't know and therefore cannot respond to, so we get frustrated and spew forth loads and loads of crapola. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Another point, if your only purpose was to make the classes &quot;good and fun to play&quot;, I would think that your only method of means testing would be to look at the number of players that play those classes as a whole, and as you approached an even distribution of players in each class you would have balance. As you know of active 50-60 characters, there is most definitely not an even distribution amoungst the classes. So then we must assume that many classes are not as &quot;good and fun to play&quot; as others, or the numbers would change.<br>
<br>
I would fully understand not wanting to make the full definition public (because that is your intellectual property), but I still think at least posting your true opinion about a particular topic, rather than making generalized comments about that topic would give the classes something concrete to respond to, rather than vague generalized comments that are negative about the class.<br>
 <br>
I know &quot;official definitions&quot; are a pain to live with because they have to change, and you will catch heat from some players every time they change. But at least that heat at that time a reason can be given for the change, and players can respond to it, rather than attempting to respond to some percieved definition of &quot;good&quot;.<br>
<br>
I am glad that you want to make classes &quot;good and fun to play&quot;, but I think you would not be happy if I told you out of the blue that the class is &quot;bad and not fun to play&quot; you would have a problem with that because it's not concrete.<br>
<br>
Thanks again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I was very thankful that Alan responded, but it does not look like he really thinks is wrong for Verant to make generalized comments and in turn not want generalized responses from the player base.<br>
<br>
I'll let you know if I get anymore responses.<br>
