This post will get long, I will add a (think Spaceballs) short, short, short version after this one, so scroll down if you don't want the long, long version.  And this thread isn't a flame, just my wandering thoughts.<br>
<br>
I started playing in Sept '01, so I can't really say anything about RoK or SoV, so I won't.  But when SoL came out, I wanted to buy it because I saw value in the expansion.  We had the spires to help us travel, the bazaar to help us sell our wares more eaisly, and the introduction of aaxp.<br>
<br>
With PoP, 5 more levels and the fatser xp in the planes was a large chunk, but for me it was PoK.  I am more or less a casual player and the movement from one point on Norrath to another is amazing.  I would have bought PoP if it had just that one zone, yes, I am that eaisly pleased.<br>
<br>
With both of these expansions our spells (and others) became more rounded for our class, we had lots of places to go, and maybe too many places to go to now.  (Look at all the zones where no one plays in anymore.)<br>
<br>
In short, both of these expansions added to the game measurably.  Again, I wasn't around for Kunark or Velious, so I don't have the prespective to say that for those expansions, they were simply 'there' when I started playing.<br>
<br>
So now we have before us LoY.  I think this is not a good idea.  First I'll list my personal exclusion criteria for not buying it, then I'll list my personal inclusion criteria that if later added would incline me to buy this extension.  <br>
<br>
1)  New race.  Big deal.  No mages, and the class that begs to be played (monk) isn't a choice atm.  The frogs don't regenerate, and you couldn't play an 'evil' frog.  5 classes and 1 diety.  Again, not a reason to buy the game imo.<br>
<br>
2)  More bank space.  This one is short, ever hear of a mule?  With 15 plat and a friend you can have 80 more bank slots.  Not a good reason to buy here either.<br>
<br>
3 and 4)  LFG and Guild tools.  I don't see this as being a huge problem.  And the 'tools' added are really to vague to speculate on anyway.  This point is a draw.<br>
<br>
5)  Mapping feature.  Well, now that they made Muse over at eqatlas.com mad, we get few high quality maps.  What they should do is give Muse a job, paying him to map out all the zones in the game and make these downloads optional.  <br>
<br>
This is subject to debate and Lots of opinion here, but my 2 cp anyway.    I don't think we play EQ to make maps anyway.  If you do love making maps, well this may be a good point, but I think most see this as no big deal.<br>
<br>
6)  New slot.  Well who could resist more resists?  I kinda like this idea.<br>
<br>
7)  Customize your look.  I really don't care.  I don't see my charachter  playing anyway.  If someone is that narssisistic (spelled wrong) well then this is a good idea, but still no big deal.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   New creatures.  Who cares?  We will still kill em in the same manner.  So the mobs look different.  BFD.<br>
<br>
9)  New zones.  How many zones are not used now?  Not the best idea.  Make over the older zones instead please.<br>
<br>
10)  New spells.  Really?  Like what?  What gap is there in our spell line?  (Can't talk for other classes here =/.)  Maybe an upgrade to scars?  But really, is there a glaring gap in what our class should be doing?  Or is this 'feature' going to more so blur the distinction between classes?  This is the best reason for a warrior to buy this expansion (sarcam).<br>
<br>
So I find no compelling reason to buy it, but why should I say that we, as a group, should not buy it?  Well, I think that 'acceptance is approval'.  <br>
<br>
What I mean is that if this extension sells to 80 or 90% of all EQ accounts, we can be sure that a new 'extension' will be comming in another 4 to 6 months.  I don't like that idea.  If the legends server sold like hotcakes, there would be more than one server dedicated to that crappy idea, but it didn't sell well enuf for a second server, so they didn't make a second server.  If this idea sells very well, you can bet lots of coin that there will be another coming at us very soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
What would help me to be more inclined to buy LoY?  <br>
<br>
A real post 50 fire pet would do it.  (No epic for me.)<br>
<br>
Drop the price by about 10 bucks. (How much money does it cost to press the CDs, print the boxes, or ship the game to the stores?  I can only guess at the profit margin here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :o --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/embarassed.gif ALT=":o"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
<br>
Ability to change in game religion would be nice, but I would need the first 2 things to happen for me to look again at buying this, or other things that I can't think of atm that I am sure other more creative people see to add the extra value to this 'extension'.<br>
<br>
Summary:  I don't see anything included in LoY as of now making it worth my coin.  (I hope I will be wrong though.)  I do see reasons not to buy it, as large sales would increase VI/Sony/whoever to make more of this sort of thing more often, instead of reworking the original zones.<br>
<br>
Your input and thoughts would be cool.  Again, I want to be wrong here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liffthemage>Liff the Mage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 115<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/03 4:27:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8502.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I don't think we should buy LoY</span><hr size=1> Short, short, short version. <br>

<br>
$14.99 at Walmart, the day before it was released.  Installed while patch servers were down, and patched up as soon as the patch servers came up, repatched again when they brought the servers up.  Was first one in my guild to see PoP (they were all waiting for their coppies that they had the foresight to preorder /laugh).<br>
<br>
Hmm I got PoP for $14.99?<br>
<br>
and they want 17.99 to preorder this??<br>
<br>
/shrug I guess the walmart I went to screwed up on my price, I got a neat little FV doll + an expantion for cheaper than this extention.  <br>

<br>
I would buy this expansion for that functionality alone.  My bank box is nearly full of NODROP items most of the time.  Resist and other situational gear,  items for quests, etc.  I have several mules to hold my tradable tradeskill supplies and a couple of bazaar vendors...  When I made the NODROP armor for the 8th shawl quest I had to carry NODROP items from my bank box on me to make room for the armor in there.  (the NODROP items were lighter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>
<br>
However, the same as some of the Pop functionality (the raid function as an example), I should NOT have to buy LoY to get more bank slots.<br>
<br>
They should do that for everyone.  Exisiting customers included.<br>
<br>
But they didn't.  And I will pay my $18 US to get that extra capacity.  OK, so it comes with new zones to hunt in, new quests, new spells, new items.  All good...  New spells add spice to the game... options.<br>
<br>
I DO like the download vs CD purchase of this expansion.  I realize that the narrow band users will suffer, but for broadband users like myself... I will not have to wait for my preorder copy to arrive on opening day.  When the servers come back up, I will be able to login and begin to explore the new zones (in theory - theory is a wonderful place).  The last several expansions, I was unable to obtain a copy locally, and had to wait for an internet site to ship it to me...<br>
<br>

1.  Bank space-  If you don't want more, then you aren't a tradeskiller.  Mules work, but they slow the process down.<br>
<br>
2.  LFG tool.  Doubt this will do much, LFG problems are largely because of class stereotyping and time zone issues.<br>

<br>
But no, I don't think it will really help with getting groups that much, but I do like the feature.<br>
<br>
Bank space seems cool...nothing that great though...<br>
<br>
Guild management tool would be great I'd imagine. Would be nice if it was also available to guild members (as opposed to only leaders/officers). This way you could find guildies (even in anon) etc...<br>
<br>
I don't care about the new race, though.<br>
<br>
For $18, I couldn't care less if I don't like the expansion. It at least gives me something to do, and if, perhaps, it provides and alternative to PoV/PoS exp, then it's going to be great. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dalrenfieryblade>Dalren Fieryblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/03 5:54:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8502.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I don't think we should buy LoY</span><hr size=1> Also, as for it being expensive, get a job.

I for one am buying it cause it EXISTS!

<br>
Bank Space - Great feature...I HATE having to find people to help me transfer stuff to my mule.<br>
<br>
LFG Tool - Not sure what this is going to be...but Fal was right, class stereotype is the main issue.  Heck, when I go into PoD and shout LFG, I usually get passed by for a second or third tank.  I can deal out more DPS with my nukes and tanking pet than a second or third tank in a group can...AND the Cleric does not have to heal my pet...I take care of everything =)<br>
<br>
3. Guild management tool- This is very intriguing...and I do run a guild...so this alone may be worth the money.<br>
<br>
4. New content- I have never complained about new content yet.<br>
<br>
5. New race- Frogloks...you can take 'em or leave 'em...I might create one just for fun...<br>
<br>
6. Keeping EQ alive - I agree with Fal, Raz, and Jaytee.  <br>
<br>
Really, how much will you be put out by spending $18.00?  And to say that it doesn't matter what you look like...well, I can respect that if that's how you feel.  However, saying it doesn't matter what the mobs look like because you kill them in the same manner as every other mob??? Well, why not make them all look like round blobs of light...no real form or shape..no graphics at all.  Heck, why not just make EQ a text based MUD... (insert sarcasm here =)).<br>
<br>
I have put quite some time into EverQuest...a game I truly enjoy playing...with people I truly enjoy playing with.  I will spend the $18.00 and support EQ.  The designers and programmers may not get everything right...but we are all still here playing and for the most part, enjoying the game...so they have to be doing more right than they are wrong....and I look forward to these new features.<br>

<br>
1. Frogs are cool as hell.  And if you already have a mage, would you really want to level up another mage just for the sake to be a frog?  Not me, I might try a shaman for a nice change.<br>
<br>
2. More bank space = good.  More expansions = more quests = more junk to take up space.  Right now i got a bag full of VP key components.  Please explain how one might put no-drop items on their mule?<br>
<br>
3. = 4.  No idea if this will be any use until i see it implemented.<br>
<br>
5. I am anxious to see the map feature the most.  If it has something like an auto-map feature, they sold me a copy right there.  The maps I want are not on eqatlas and i hate trackin down 50 sites with just ok maps.<br>
<br>
6. Who wouldnt like another slot? mmmmmmmm good!<br>
<br>
7. I think that if a person wants to have yellow boots, then GDI they should get to have yellow boots!  I think the way dyes and such work in game suck atm, this is a good change.<br>
<br>
8. New cretures I dont care too much about.  If its new creatures that give great exp at 65 and look like pacman or they are more gnolls, makes no difference to me.  I'd rather they spend more time revamping unused zones and giving more places for lvl 65 people to exp than to make new mobs in some lvl 20 zone in some off-beat location.  There are enough of those already.<br>
<br>
9. see above.<br>
<br>
Now, when LoY comes out buy it and make a frog and be happy.  Then have everyone makes a frog trader in the bazaar, just rows and rows of frogs for days froaking and jumping and runnin around, froaking each other and making tadpoles and such...oh the humanity! Oh ya, i think being a sarnak dude would be cool as hell too or a gnoll.<br>

Darn.  Anyways....<br>
<br>
Just to reply to a few barbed comments.  Yes I do have a job.  No $18 wouldn't hurt my finances at all.  But I don't think it is an 18 dollar question.  More later.  AND, no I am not whining.  Sorry.  I just want opinions as to what the benifit of LoY is.  Sorry if the tone of my post sounded like, or resembled in any way, whining.<br>
<br>
I completely didn't think of no drop items, and you are right, I am not a tradeskiller.  I see how the larger bank is a good thing now, thanks.  If the bigger bank is 8 more slots, I would like this also.<br>
<br>
On to money.  This is not an $18 dollar question.  This is a $7,200,000 dollar question.  If 90% of the EQ community (I think about 430,000 of us) buy this, Sony makes about 7.2 million dollars.  (400,000 x 18 = 7.2 mil)  All they have for overhead costs is the programming.  No manufacturing of anything really.  No advertising costs, no shipping, pretty much no costs involved.  With PoP, they had these costs, and if they made $18 for every unit sold I would be amazed.  They probably made closer to $10, if that.  <br>
<br>
More content in PoP, less content in LoY, so from the Sony prespective, less content=more money.<br>
<br>
I think the way to keep EQ alive is to keep it fun, not throw cash at Sony.  If this extension helps to keep EQ fun, sign me up, I will buy it.  (I wanted to be wrong, remember?)  But if this is just a last ditch effort to milk seven point two million dallars from the EQ community, I don't think that is a good idea, or will help out EQ in anyway.  Sony execs on the other hand....<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START  >D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/grin.gif ALT=" >D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dalrenfieryblade>Dalren Fieryblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/03 6:41:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8502.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I don't think we should buy LoY</span><hr size=1> HotSamoan, my points exactly, especially with the new mob thing.
