From graffe's</span><hr size=1> Mantria ,<br>
<br>
  I don't understand your point of view actually. <br>
<br>
  Yes if pets were beta neutral, than yes they could chase a fleeing mob (as would some players), help kill said mob and return with no train in tow.<br>
<br>
  A lot of people forget a fleeing mob WILL bring back friends if it is not killed, so people will chase it, as will a pet. <br>
<br>
  Why is it, if the pet chases it, with the rest, that it is the pet that will run back to it's guard point, AND not care if a mob is in the way, it runs right past it, and train to camp begins (some players do this also, but the good ones, will see said mob, and detour around it. A pet can't detour, it follows preset pathing). I know I will hear again, that is part of pet control.. etc.. Yes I know that as well, and after 60 levels it is getting OLD. I want my pet to attack ONLY what I tell it to, Never to switch a target unless I tell it to, or at least GATE back to it's guard position after the mob it is told to attack dies.<br>
<br>
  Summon companion was put into the game because Verant realized that pathing is not the fault of the players, and they admit there is little they can do to fix it.<br>
<br>
  That doesn't alter the fact that in some raids or certain zones, I can make a pet, and sick it on a mob 2 feet away, and the pet starts running away from the mob, loops around and heads back, this causes trains as we all know. <br>
<br>
  I don't want to hear about pet control in that situation, what kind of control is just killing off your pet. It just shows you ran a Earthen Boot quest. I sick pet, it zooms off the wrong way. Click boots. Wow 60 levels to learn that? Nope run the quest as soon as you can, because job one of a magician is to KILL their own pets when pathing makes them a liability. <br>
<br>
  Great pet control, I know how to click earthen boots. Sorry, that just made a pet in that place unusable where you just set up camp. So me playing my magician, just became 1/2 as useful as I was. <br>
<br>
  Also if this is your 1st trip to that dungeon or zone with that bad of pathing, you have no idea what will happen, the 1st time you sick ole Goner on a mob 2 or 3 feet away. If it heads right too it, great. If it loops a little, but not too far. OK I can deal with that. If it loops a larger radius, where mobs may spawn, or wander it is a liability, and I don't want to kill off a pet, for no fault of my own, but do to game mechanics.<br>
<br>

<br>
Writing this made me think though of a good option. I will start a thread on it for discussion. Why not have a pet GATE instantly to it's guard position and immediately be in Pet Hold mode when the mob it was attacking is dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umantria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mantria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 164<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 8:27:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up! From graffe's</span><hr size=1> I can understand the frustration of pathing. TRUST me I can. But in the same token <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> players</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> also exploit pathing problems too.  <br>
Maybe they can't make a pet neutral faction because the pet summoned has the faction of its owner?<br>
I'm assuming you mean by a gating pet to pet hold spot you are talking of where is was last /pet guard here, and not the AA skill?<br>
Also I'm sure verant, even though pathing is know, won't change the faction siply because pets ARE the single most effective use of mana in the game. After all what other spell can you cast for 500mana(my epic) and get virtually unlimited damage from it?  <br>
<br>
Honestly I don't see the problem with pets and faction, sure I'd like them to be neutral but will it effect how I play? not really. Sure I'll probably not care where he wandered off to as much that's for sure but otherwise. shrug not sure.<br>
<br>
Oh well I wasn't meaning to upset anyone.<br>
<br>
I do like the gate idea though<br>

<br>
He does post well.   Thanks Rich!<br>
<br>
Some of the preposed mage pet additions are very welcome!  I just hope he won't forget about a few things..<br>
<br>
- 50+ fire pets.   You really gotta make some change to it specially the 52 vs 58.  The spells they cast are the same and the hand to hand damage is 10 points higher.   Which goes from 20s to 30s I believe.   The best parsings the mages have seen so far on very low resist mobs make the fire pet to be &quot;not bad&quot;   That isn't really good enough to use.  &quot;Not bad&quot; gets us using our other pets instead.  Because it's assured they will be good on any situation.  If the fire pets were very situational, please make them a heck of a lot stronger to warrent using in that situation.  And definitly create a far larget gap with the 52-58 ones.<br>
<br>
- Rage of Zomm, be kind and show us some data on this, since no one around seems to think it that useful.  Even if it doesn't get hit in combat and immune to ramaging, it still seems to hit really low.  (When it's all added up.)  Not really a pet, but we'd really appreciate a response at least on it.  Just to even say &quot;yeah we looked at it.  You guys are right, it does suck, but we aren't going to do anything right now about it.  Sorry.&quot;<br>
<br>
- More HPs for higher level pets.  With luclin AA additions to warrior HP those warriors can take one heck of a beating.. which means the monsters are much better at dishing it out.   I don't want to make our pets the new warriors,  but quite honestly, jobober should be as easy to hit as the broad side of a barn, just has a lot of HP to compensate.  Doubling their current HP still wouldn't put them close to dire charmed.   And doing this I'd recommend taking down their AC a fair bit.<br>
<br>
- We know you won't but just reminding you.. Dont' forget about air pets and monster summonings. =)<br>
<br>
- For duels especially.. hmm I know you are upping pet resistance, but can you  make them immune to charm?  Theres already a bad bard bug with it, and not to mention how much it hurts us having our pet charmed.  Basically we go from pretty good to dead, as we have no crowd control.  No other class has anything like that horrible when a monster uses a certain ability on them.<br>
<br>
- Could you change pet faction to ally why players look at their pets? ^_^<br>
<br>
- Very minor.. but it was pretty cool back in the beginning when pets actually said &quot;Thanks for the &lt;insert item name you just gave pet here&gt; Sirellyn!&quot;<br>
<br>
All the rest of the stuff you are doing.. Wow. Thank you VERY much.  It is noticed well and just letting you know feedback is soo appreciated from you guys as well!  In fact.. We need it even more than you do!  Many of us are eager to know whats going on and even telling us that it won't be looked at or we aren't going to do anything about it is way better than not hearing anything on the subject as well.   Thanks for your cander and thanks for your hard work Rich! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucaldywen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caldywen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#333333>(6/2/02 12:14:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.nc.rr.com/kvernon/images/face2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Some thoughts</span><hr size=1> I look forward to the future changes that are &quot;in the pike&quot;, but I've learned to take it all with a grain of salt.
