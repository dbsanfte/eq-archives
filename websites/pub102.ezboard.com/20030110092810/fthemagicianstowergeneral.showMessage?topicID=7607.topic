I got a really bad experience</span><hr size=1> Hi guys,<br>
<br>
First of all this is not a flame. I am quite pissed about something that happened to me yesterday but I dont flame or bug SOE about it. It is an incident that is linked to lag not to SOE.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I was duo boxing my druid/monk combo in OoT. A nice druid give me gornit camp. I needed plats to upgrade my monk weaponry.<br>
<br>
After let's say 10 kills, I had a bad lag on the computer running my druid (Maxiniu). Such a bad lag that after starting to cast a heal, I had no response from the computer. Nothing even ctrl+alt+del worked. Monk died and druid still dont respond. After let's say 30 seconds, I take the control back on the druid. I was running for my life and a fellow good mage kill gornit. I was unable to cast but I was able to control the druid movements. After Gornit has fallen to the ground, the magi ask me why did I get the exp. I responded I was bugged and my monk falled lacking of heal and had a bad FD (fallen to the ground if you know what I mean). Also note that I had absolutly no lag on the second computer running my monk. So it is really linked to one computer running EQ. I never have problem with the computer running my druid. Only happened yesterday.<br>
<br>
Where it becomes to be very strange, and you'll see from the SS, I had 2 instances of my druid living in OoT. I was able to take screens shots. Also the druid I was controlling had no equipement but the graphic showed my shield and my orb. Even so she had nothing on her except the money she was olding before the incident.<br>
<br>
Here are the SS :<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ifrance.com/sebmichel/ss/bug1.jpg">www.ifrance.com/sebmichel/ss/bug1.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.ifrance.com/sebmichel/ss/bug3.jpg">www.ifrance.com/sebmichel/ss/bug3.jpg</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I petitionned but no responses. Now you'll see in the SS that there was one gm online. I want to say it CLEARLY, the guy was occupied with other peeps having problems so I don't blame him, just I was not caution enought to take the SS without him on the chat box. I was pissed off and didn't checked the chat box when I did the SS. The guy was working hard and deserve my respect. I wish I had the reflex to check the chat box before taking the SS. <br>
<br>
After one hour I had to log for RL issues. So I sit and hit the camp button. Message in response of the action, your camp operation is interrupted, or something like this.<br>
I had to press the reset button on the computer. After I try to log back and only one instance of a naked druid with the same graphic, nothing on her and of course no corpse. <br>
<br>
So as a personnal conclusion, I have lost everything on my druid, her equipment, her banked equipment and of course the equipment I always store on her for my monk. Essentially weapons. I strangly kept the money, near 800 plats. I still don't understand why. I will have to refarm equipment for her. <br>
<br>
As a conslusion for the magi community, be carefull guys if there is lag, DONT play. My druid was not ubber equiped with NTOV gear, so I didn't loose that much, but it hurt anyway. Be also carefull when you play in raids where lag sudently appear. I still have to figure out how to turn off spell effects since pop launch, but that's the first thing I'll do when I'll log Mininiu.<br>
<br>
As for SOE they really need to bring more GM, I was waiting for a petition 2 times one hour, so no support. I gived up and I will refarm her equipment.<br>
<br>
That's it, be carefull. <p>Mininiu CrazyMagus <br>

I have seen some strange things happen in OOT as well, but that was related to the boat. I was coming from BB side and wanted to go to the seafury island. So I stepped off at &quot;brothers island&quot; and began running (with levi). The boat left the dock there about the same time, and I was running next to it for quite a while. When I arrived at seafury island, I summoned pet and began to fight, however went laggy and nonresponsive (as you described), and went LD finally. After coming back I found myself in FP, so I assume that I was somehow stuck to the boat when I ran next to it.<br>
<br>
Anyway, good luck getting your stuff back.<br>

<br>
2) If your going to go the email route, I'd suggest the &quot;contact a GM&quot; link on the main Everquest live technical support page<br>
<br>
3) Don't forget that if you don't get a response from a GM within a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time that you can drop from the game itself into &quot;Chat&quot; and patiently explain to the CSR what's going on. This option takes a lot of patience as the poor person is usually getting spammed by 100+ people at once but has worked for me before.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope some of this helps you. Good luck with the return of your gear, and yes strange sht like this has happend to me before in OT and SolB.<br>

OMG about your equip, that completely sucks.  As far as the lag you were experiencing goes, these &quot;lock up's&quot; have reared their ugly head since PoP release.  Guildies have reported that sending tells to and/or from the affected computer seems to disrupt the &quot;lock-up&quot; temporarily (like for 5ish seconds, then you lag back down and become unresponsive).<br>
<br>
If you need a backup voice to the GM's let me know, I'll /petiton your circumstance and back your words and SS's up.  Oscarin is a good understanding GM, you might find your stuff mysteriously placed on your toon when you log back in.<br>
<br>
If GM says, theres no way to return your items (which I seriously doubt, since you are legitimate), I will give you my druids gear, I never play it anyway (it's not especially good gear, I haven't even loaded it in over a year, so obviously I wouldn't be missing it).<br>
<br>
BTW, thanks for saying I was a descent person :0)~ I was afraid I KS'ed ya and felt bad about that.  Then you saying your character had duped, completely blew my mind to the point of unable to comprehend much of anything.<br>
