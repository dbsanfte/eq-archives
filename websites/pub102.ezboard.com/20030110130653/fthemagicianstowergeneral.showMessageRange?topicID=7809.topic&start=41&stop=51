<br>
First how is 10 hours a week addicted ??<br>
<br>
When I was 13-14 and had just hit puberty (or puberty had hit me you pick) I think I probably spent more time masturbating or at least trying to (had to share a room).<br>
<br>
 Was I addicted …NO… did I like doing it …Yes… Did it ruin my life did I miss school to do it …Hell NO… there where girls at school. Did it stop me having a healthy relationships and a good sex life later in life …NO… <br>
<br>
<br>
Point Two<br>
<br>
A kid is a stuck up brat when he feels he can ask for a car that cost more than most people earn in a year. <br>
<br>
A kid is not a stuck up brat when he ask for a toy that cost less than even most poorly played people earn a Hour.<br>
<br>
But leave farting alone <br>
<br>
or you see people blowing up all over the place just like <br>
Mr Creosote.   <br>
<br>
Messy<br>
<br>
P.S. I dare any one to say they have never masturbated. <p>Zanp&lt;br&gt;<br>

<br>
Weight gain / loss has to do with a change of diet. In my prior post I provided a couple reasons why an average football player may lose, or gain weight during the course of the season.  I illustrated this as you made a point that many similarities can be found in looking at a star QB and someone that plays EverQuest.<br>
<br>
An EverQuest player:<br>
-1. less dependence on quality food, seeks quick accessible food: i.e. potato chips, pizza, Chinese delivery.<br>
-a. Eating manufactured foods like the examples above coupled with little to no exercise (most people sit in their chairs) one can expect to gain weight.<br>
<br>
If we have an EverQuest player, that plays more than 30 hours a week while in a resting position and consuming food quantities with little to no exercise, then one can expect that individual to gain weight over a period of time.<br>
<br>
In regards to <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://spiritofrecovery.com/exercise.html,">spiritofrecovery.com/exercise.html,</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <br>
<br>
Yes, there are a group of individuals who do &quot;over-do&quot; their workouts, be it at the gym, or on their own accord elsewhere. There are many differences between an individual that works him, or herself moderately and gains benefits, and another that overdoes their regimen.  A number of things to observe: Is the individual on a routine observed by a qualified weight trainer? Does the individual work out alone, or with a partner or group?  Does the individual make his area unsafe for others, i.e. posing a risk to others.<br>
<br>
Over the course of a weight lifting session, our muscles fatigue. The amount this takes depends on how conditioned the lifter is and the type of workout he, or she undertakes (there are other variables, but those are the big 2) Eventually, the muscles become so fatigued that their level of weight lifting is no longer possible.  There are still, however, other options to pursue when this happens: one can swim, or, can run on a treadmill, for example.<br>
 <br>
&quot;Working out&quot; carries the potential to be addicting on more than one front. Motivation by a team, friend(s) and the opposite sex can compel one to engage in a rigorous workout; the motivation may come from ones self, too. A “well oiled” body has many advantages over a sluggish, out of shape body. Does this mean that we hold one over the other?  Possibly, yes. An in shape body doesn't carry some of the risks that its counterpart does; high blood pressure, risk of heart attacks, diabetes.<br>
<br>
Weight lifting is also an excellent anger and stress sink.  It can take the mind off its current task, being angry or stressed over something in life, and compel it to focus its energy on doing other tasks at hand. What would have been neutral, or detrimental energy has the potential to be transformed into positive energy, and the stress level can be reduced.<br>
<br>
Now, the kicker in weight lifting: <br>
<br>
An individual that hasn't gone to the gym in months is finally guilted enough to go. He's somewhat out of shape, and a bit frustrated with how things are going for him physically; he's putting on a gut.  Because this is a conflict with his prior youth experiences (no gut) he sees this build up as an &quot;enemy&quot; that needs to be removed. What's he do? Well, he over works himself at the gym. He works himself so hard that the next day he has ounces of lactic acid flowing all through his body. The basic movements are difficult and painful, and it will be a few days before he can return to the gym, let alone walk without feeling like he's tearing himself apart.  <br>
<br>
If this individual returns to the gym after a recovering, then he may consider toning his regimen down a notch or three. Pain is a motivating factor - if he wishes pain, over and over, with other possible complication, that’s his choice, even if it's not a rational one. <br>
<br>
<br>
Unlike weight lifting, ones body doesn't necessarily tell you &quot;I'm tired, lets rest&quot; in response to EverQuest. There may be some individuals that say, about 10:00pm &quot;I'm done for tonight.&quot; but that's more likely in response to their circadian rhythm. <br>
<br>
Coordinated body movements in an active environment are at odds with little to no body movement in a resting environment; this means one can engage in EverQuest for longer period of time due to the nature of how the game should be played (in a familiar environment, in a resting position). Of course, one may stretch, and remove themselves from their area of play, but how many individuals do this often. (I believe every 20 minutes is recommended)  There are instances where 12 hour sessions of EverQuest are not uncommon, a good chair helps alleviate support the back while continuing to be comfortable.<br>
<br>
In regards to time allocation,<br>
<br>
Not all humans have a desire to be social with others. EverQuest is allows them to be around other individuals, which may have the same likes / dislikes but it keeps people separate. (no faces, no voices, no body shape - just in-game avatars that show text) For them, EverQuest may be their niche in society, that's fine. <br>
<br>
In regards to friendships online, I wont challenge that many people do hold online friendships as true friendships, but are they the same as real friendships?  Because one isn't presented with a face, or a voice, or in their environment, it's hard to say. I know several people in game that I've known in life, and they come across differently to me than they do in first person.<br>
<br>
Now, if we hold online friendships as equal to real friendships (EverQuest to say, a group of buddies) then which is more important?  Is it okay for you to tell your friends, &quot;sorry, not going out with you guys tonight, gunna kill Aten again and maybe the Emp if he's up.&quot;<br>
<br>
People that don't play EverQuest may wonder, &quot;We're all old friends, and he wont take one night away from his computer over going out and having fun as buds, geesh.&quot;<br>
<br>
How many would willingly trade real life friendships, or relationships for the equal in-game experiences?  I'd bet a few would. Not everyone has pleasant life experiences, some are probably down right horrific, and EverQuest has been a shelter away from that; a posititve experience away from the negativity.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Someone before mentioned that an EverQuest addict would spend less time with his friends so that he could play EverQuest just to fit his guild's &quot;winning attitude.&quot; Why is it okay for a football player to do this and not an EverQuest player?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, that's a tough question. I'll use personal experiences to share in my own light. I joined some of my friends on the football team back in high school. I had friends who didn't like athletics, and some that lived in the weight room every chance they had. Eventually, over time I molded myself into a more agile, faster and stronger individual than I could have been before - my friends helped me get there, as I helped them. Eventually we made it to the playoffs, something few get to go to, and even fewer make it to the state championships. <br>
<br>
Face to face communication, a collection of youths with different background and life experiences, cliques and whatever else are put aside to make one team and face challenges with.<br>
<br>
EverQuest is text to text communication, a collection of people of all ages, with different backgrounds (or similar) that follow their own way and do their own things, be it joining a raiding guild, or work on tradeskills. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to critize people that choose EverQuest over anything else. I too, have played the game since July '99.  It's peoples own choice to do what they will in their lives. <br>
<br>
I see two different points in this post:<br>
<br>
1. Bein Stein being an awful father for shipping his brat of a son away to a boarding school; EverQuest isn't the problem, it's the parenting.<br>
<br>
and, <br>
<br>
2. Is EverQuest addicting?  Do people need to be warned about possible complications that could potentiall arise by playing EverQuest for an extended period of time?<br>
<br>
a. Is a warning needed to inform &quot;at risk&quot; individuals who haven't purchased the product, or <br>
<br>
b. Is a warning not needed, people can commit suicide and fall over dead all they wish; it's their own faults - not ours or SOE's; leave us be.<br>

I think as the internet grows, we must begin to consider it in equal light to our life experiences.  The people I speak to online are just as real, and just as important as those I meet face to face.  The difference between face to face communication and text communication is meaningless. Both mediums do the same thing. <br>
<br>
Consider the way a blind person experiences the world. Does his lack of sight mean his relationships and experiences are something less than a sighted persons experiences?  <br>
<br>
I prefer the online world to the real world. It's happier here, and I am free to be myself in every single way possible, without having to constantly second guess myself. I have little care for what others think of me, but it's impossible to ever really be yourself when you are around other people, even when the comfort level is very high. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:perpetua;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=421973">Turzem Setanta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->--<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Arch Mage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyrexxshadowfyre@themagicianstower>Zyrexx Shadowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 485<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/02 3:32:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7809.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Thats one of the problems with the net, most people have no fear of reprisal for being a jackass.

Though it can be a good thing too, you can get to know someones real views on things that in real life they wouldn't mention because they are fearful of reprisal.<br>
<br>
I do find it odd at times how different people are when you meet them in real life after knowing them online because personally how I act online is how I act in real life. <p>Zyrexx Shadowfyre<br>

Yes, let them fall over dead.  I'm tired of halfwit twits litigating the world because they don't have to be responsible for themselves.  We shouldn't have to protect people from themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=turzem>Turzem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/02 9:44:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7809.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/personal.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I do find it odd at times how different people are when you meet them in real life after knowing them online because personally how I act online is how I act in real life. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Many of us censor our personalities and opinions when we meet people face to face because we have to deal with the aftereffects should we offend them.  I don't, but most do, anyway.<br>
<br>
When we're online, we rarely have to deal with this, so we are free to be ourselves.  I believe that a persons online personality is &quot;real&quot; to a greater extent than their face to face personality. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:perpetua;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=421973">Turzem Setanta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->--<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Arch Mage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ibelink>ibelink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 120<br> <font color=#333333>(11/13/02 1:40:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7809.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:.</span><hr size=1> What i dont appreciate is my family tells me i should spend all my time watching TV or exercising or playing outside or hanging with my friends rather than play EQ.

Oh he's addicted, he'd rather play EQ than go running for an hour. Oh, he's addicted, he'd rather play EQ than playing mindless video games with his friends. Oh, he's addicted, he'd rather play EQ than read a book. Oh, he's addicted, he'd rather play EQ than spend 2 hours talking on the phone to a girl that has no real interest in him. Oh, he's addicted, he'd rather play EQ than watch TV like a normal person.<br>
<br>
ETC ETC<br>
<br>
My point is i believe many people use the term addicted when describing EQ because althought it is a very enjoyable passtime to me, someone who couldn't stand it sees it as a waste of time. Such intolerant people make me sick. <br>

People who have not found that thing in life sit around bored, turn to drugs/crime, think about only sex all day, are frustrated with life, etc. I know that any time I want, I can log on to EverQuest and enjoy myself. Other people...well, they go do something and pray that they have a good time.<br>

I am fortunate for having been able to add EverQuest to my life. Just being able to do something I really enjoy a lot makes me a happier person. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Yup, pretty much sums up my thoughts. Very well put Rhion.<br>

I like playing EQ, its fun to me. I also know some people that smoke. One in particular cant stand smoking, she hates it more than anything. I asked her why didnt quit and she right off said oh I can't. <br>
I knew Everquest costs money when i started it out, i knew there was a montly fee, i also knew i could afford it. There was no reason for me to continue this service unless there was a reason i wanted to, IE the game is a lot of fun.<br>
That's an addiction, spending the majority of your free time on something that is enjoyable to you is not.<br>
<br>
EQ does not ruin lives, people ruin lives. Making EQ a scapegoat doesn't solve any problems. Once again the media has failed to impress me. <p>Trylan Error<br>
