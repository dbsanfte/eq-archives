<br>
Go to the Spectre Island in OOT (get great maps from EQAtlas.com). The Gargoyles spawn around the lower part of the island, the spectres spawn at the very top. As far as I could tell, Greater Skellies are Placeholders for Gargs, so kill them as much as you can also. The Gargs sometimes drop gargoyle eyes, which are worth 8pp at a vendor. Good loot, good exp. <br>
<br>
Problem: I only camped them a couple of hours to get the eyes for Focus Item quest, and I went from being the only one there to having that tiny island swarming with 5 people.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umatches475.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Matches475</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(3/8/01 6:02:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gargs in OOT</span><hr size=1> I went there at lvl 16 and was fine.  At that level you have to be willing to melee with your pet, but the xp more than makes up for the dmg that you take.  The loot is very good and so is the xp, but the downside is the island's size is very small.  I was by myself when I got there, and by the time I left there were 6 other people there (all trying to solo).  Of course, when I jumped in the water to start my swim back to sister island, someone went to the top and the spectres came out to play.  Everyone died but me, so I guess that I picked the right time to leave.  If you can get the island by yourself or with one other person/group, then it is a great place, if it gets busy, save yourself a CR and leave....  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kildayin>Kildayin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(4/7/01 1:00:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gargs in OOT</span><hr size=1> As a veteran gargoyle hunter, here's what I have to say about Ocean of Tears:<br>
<br>
1. The key to this camp, all the way from 16 to 25, is patience followed by more patience.  You'll reach a point, around 24-25, where all the gargs are low blue cons and you can take two at once and have HP and mana left for a third one right away.<br>
<br>
Don't do it.<br>
<br>
Sit and rest.  Recover your mana.  The object is to leave at least one gargoyle alive at all times.  Why?  Well, as most of us know, the greater skeletons are placeholders for gargoyles.  The beautiful part of it, though, is that the gargoyles will kill the skeletons!  So, while you're resting, the gargoyles are doing your schlop work for you.  Every time a gargoyle kills a skeleton, there's a chance that a garg will spawn in place of the deceased skellie.  That makes two gargoyles running around killing skeletons.  Pretty soon, you'll have an island full of flying statues.  That's when I consider the island &quot;broken.&quot;  It's ready to be hunted at that point.<br>
<br>
2. Which leads me to a note about etiquette.  On my server, virtually no one hunts here, and I imagine that's true on the other servers as well.  So leave it ready for the next guy.  How?  When you're ready to log off, make sure there's one gargoyle still alive.  That way it'll be full of gargoyles for the next person.<br>
<br>
3. You'll be surprised how close you can get to the spectres without waking them up, but it's not something you want to be wrong about.  So be careful, but you don't have to circle the island with one foot in the water.  Don't be afraid to climb a hill, just do it with some discretion.<br>
<br>
4. For necros and SKs: Don't attempt to fear-kite here unless you (and your pet, if applicable) are levitating.  When gargoyles run, their path takes them right through the middle of the spectre camp.  Not good.  They won't wake up the spectres, but your pet will.  On the other hand, if you are levitating, you can pull WAAAAY off the island and fear-kite them back onto it.  Just don't kill them until they're actually over the island, otherwise you'll lose all those nice eyes.  And isn't that why you're here?<br>
<br>
Fear-kiting is more trouble than it's worth here.  Just stand there like a man and take your medicine.  The loot is worth it.<br>
<br>
5. Gargoyles have a narrow aggro radius.  You can almost walk right up to them before they see you and attack you.  On the other hand, they have a wide assist radius.  Be careful if you have more than one in your field of view.<br>
<br>
Which leads me to my next point...<br>
<br>
6. When they run away, DON'T LET THEM, especially if you're on the low end of the scale for this camp.  Root them, snare them, hit them with darkness, do whatever you have to do, but kill them fast.  The rough terrain can hide a nasty surprise or three.  And if you're especially slow, they'll reach the spectres.  See 4 above.<br>
<br>
7. If you're a caster, don't bind yourself on the island itself.  Bind yourself out at Sisters' Island (by the rowboat at the SW corner if you're KOS there).  That way, if you bite off more than you can chew, you can gate back there and camp before the gargoyles and/or spectres chase you down.  And it's a very short swim back.  Beats waiting for the boat again.<br>
<br>
8. Faction hits for gargoyles are as follows:<br>
Your faction standing with MayongMistmoore got worse.<br>
Your faction standing with KingTearisthex got better.<br>
Your faction standing with AgentsOfMistmoore got worse.<br>
Your faction standing with LeagueofAntonicanBards got better.<br>
Your faction standing with RingofScale got better.<br>
<br>
Make of that what you will.  King Tearis Thex, for those of you who haven't read Norrath's history, is the ruler of the elves of Felwithe.<br>
<br>
9. One final point.  Certain race/class combinations WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEAVE WITHOUT HELP.  I note this because I, as a Teir'Dal shadowknight, fall into this category.  I am fortunate enough to have a wizard friend who can keep me invisible long enough to get on the boat.  Another way to do it is to be levitating and simply run onto the boat.  A third way is to be GG'd out, but that'll be tough to come by.  No higher-levels are going to leave their nice ancient cyclops camp just to ferry your lowbie butt around. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Depending on your race/class combination, you may be able to board a Freeport-bound boat at Brothers' Island.  I haven't tested this myself, so attempt at your own risk.<br>
<br>
Well, that's about all I have.  I hope this guide helps keep you alive and makes you all rich beyond the dreams of avarice.  Some of you, anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'm not saying what server I'm on because I don't want to attract people to my island.  Didn't I tell you?  It's mine!  If you find that you ARE on my server, keep out.  I will KS you and then I will train spectres on you.  Consider yourselves notified.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Just kidding.  In all seriousness, though, this island is one of the better-kept secrets in all Norrath.  Let's keep it that way.<br>
<br>
If you see me out there, say hi.  I'll be there for a couple weeks, but if I'm not, say hi anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
A relatively new phenomenon here (on my server, anyway) is that high-level cyclops hunters will train their visually challenged targets right through the middle.  Then they'll gate out, leaving your nice clean island overrun with jolly green giants.  When this happens, don't panic.  You'll be safe at the pull point, which is the little peninsula with a tree on it.  With some luck, you'll still be able to grab a gargoyle or two from around the cyclops, but I wouldn't plan on too much success until someone cleans it up.  Best to log off at this point and get some sleep.<br>

These are also not hunted on my server. I went there when I was 18, was rough for my High Elf non-hitpoint butt. I died twice at this lvl trying these. Of course I was still learnig how to solo with my mage. I only got 2 eyes this 1st time, and killed around 6-8 of them. So I decided to kill Ogres in TD until more exp at soloing. <br>
Lvl 19 came back It was much easier. I dinged 20 real quick, and was able to take 2 evens with full/full. I stayed till I got a bubble into 20. I got 10 gargoyles eyes this time. Now I want to point out something here, gargoyles don't drop coin. They drop the eyes and some words and spell components. Out of the 10 eyes I kept 2 more for my focus items just incase and sold the rest. 8 eyes got 53pp + . After just buying my 20 spells this is a big relief to you. The eyes stack, and very low weight. I plan on going back while I still get exp. Should be much easier with 20 pets, and spells. <br>
On tactics here, fire shield your self and your pet here take some damage away from your pet here they wont die as quick. Gargs hit hard 40+ dmg. I had a nice little spot on the island. I noticed one guy said the tree spot. Well if anyone is hunting Specs this is thier spot. There is a better spot on the South East corner of the isle, it's a little part of the island that is mostly in the water. You'll know what I'm talking about if you go there. I sat here while Had my pet guard up on the island a little bit. I had him /pet guard here, right there for a reason. When I got through medding I watched him where he was looking, that told me where the closest Garg was. Pets do that when you give them that command. Then fire shield both of use, and pulled to him.  I hope this helps anyone that wants to go here. It's alot of down time but exp and loot is nice, and soloble too. Hard to find both loot and exp in the same spot. Let us Magicians stick together on this and keep it our lil secret spot.  <br>

The gargs were awesome for me for 23-24. I did 21 doing the hermit in SK and compared to gargs, the hermit blew (no gnolls to contend with, no opening doors, no tricky targeting through a closed door etc.). I did 22 doing Aviak groups and the Aviaks blew (I've got your resist right here An Aviak Avocet!). There will be times when you see way too many skeles, but you'll see plenty of gargs in the long run.<br>
<br>
The spawn points for the skele/gargs (or 1 spawn point at the very least) is located straight east of the specs, about a bolt or so away. Camping a little further east of the spawn point may be a good idea, but I didn't want to try it without a partner.<br>
<br>
My first time there I camped the north end of the island, but someone trained Seafuries over to us (a necro was hunting the island also) and when I returned from my /q, one of the Seafuries had taken up residence on the island. His pathing was limited to the eastern part of the island so I camped the tree on the southwest corner and never had any problems with him.<br>
<br>
XP was pretty good, but it would have been much better had I gone there earlier. The loot was great, I came out selling 42 eyes for about 8.2pp each as a gnome with about 70 cha.<br>
<br>
The gargs could be hunted pre-20, but to truly own you should be at least 20. Evenso, if you don't come do gargs sometime pre 25, you should delete your mage as you may very possibly be an idiot.<br>

Also when the get low they run, so you could try using earth pet, but thats a bad idea cuz they will only get beat up more, or better yet nuke them at the point right before they run away so pet doesnt have much left to melee down and help pet melee a bit if you can <p><p ALIGN=CENTER><a href="http://ddl.dyc.edu/~felix/tests/legit.htm" target="_blank"><img src="http://ddl.dyc.edu/~felix/tests/legit.jpg" alt="I am 23% legit"></a></p>

In one night I made 3 levels and collected around 16 eyes that sell for a tad under 10pp each (gnome with 120 cha in FP). They were 98% red at 16, but I was able to keel them with ease. At 19 they were anywhere from dark blue to yellow and they are a push over now. I am guessing that at 20 with a new water pet that I will be able to take a nap while Jajober gets his killin on.  <p>Nuitarii Caligatio<BR>

Gargs in OOT are terrific.  I went there at 22 (just finding out about that place from this thread) and cleaned up.  Only had to run once (when I pulled three by accident OUCH) but ported to sister isle and camped out to remove agro (and that with 2 beating on me while I am casting.  I was amazed I got the gate off)  The only problem I had is that when I logged back on and sat to med I started getting whacked on Zyle Bensmill.  I didn't realize there were bandits on this island.  So be warry of him.  He is easy if you are ready but after almost dieing and logging back on and sitting there medding because I am down to 2 bubbles of health to have this guy come out of no where to kill me...UGH!!!   He doesn't hit hard and I may have been able to take him with full health and mana but I had none of either so I died.  But that was the only trouble I had.  Was there for about 3 hours and got 18 eyes.  How you can be there 3 days and only get 16 I don't know.  Seemed like I would get about 6 eyes per 10 kills.  Would get 2 eyes off several.  <br>
The gargs and skels are hard to see though.  To me at least.  So be ready to stare hard at the screen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42>Levels 20-23</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
