So I recently got level 29, and it's been great so far. Got my Swords of Runes, new Burnout, new pets (well, the ones I can buy, since I'm failing earth a bit <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), things are great. So with my newly acquired skills I went down to the Temple of Cazic Thule.<br>
<br>
Since my main character is a rogue, I am used to combat being very rough and tiring. Running after mobs, grtting backstab positioning, etc. Now with my magician, it seems a LOT easier. This is my first caster actually. And in a good group combat seems VERY easy for us.<br>
<br>
Here is what I have been doing so far. I don't want to feel like a TOTAL loaf and just /pet attack and med all day. I usually summon arrows for the puller, dim pockets if people's fine steel loot gets heavy, stuff like that. When a mob is pulled, I hit everything with malise, send in the pet, and nuke when the mob is about dead. In big battles I damage shield all the pets/fighters (minus monks and shadowknights, in case they have to Feign Death for some reason). I'll nuke more or not at all depending on mana. <br>
<br>
I say a good group, because some groups i've been in, people forget to snare, which results in pet chasing the mob into a bunch of its buddies, which isn't pretty. Others have people switching targets constantly, often leaving my pets to fight a  mob solo. Some people still don't get how impossible it is to pull a pet off of a mob that is aggroing it. <br>
<br>
I bring this topic up because I was asked many interesting questions in a group in the Tae Room tonight. I was asked why I am not doing anything, why I wasn't casting area effect spells, and why I was hardly nuking (when there is a monk, rogue and wizard in the group there isn't much for me to nuke). But I figured I'd ask the people who know, those being you guys. Is what you guys do in everyday combat (or the basics, don't know how higher level spells change this) any different? <p>Adelphi Etrigan

<br>
With enough melee power, lots of nuking usually isn't required. It may sound cheesy, but your pet is pulling a good amount of your weight during these fights, and is virtually resource-free -- no mana required other than the initial summoning, and any damage the pet might take (if any) will be recovered naturally before the rest of the group is ready for the next fight.<br>
<br>
Typically, breaking a room/camp is when the big guns get used. After that, you can start to be more subtle. Here's what I look at in group situations when deciding how much to burn:<br>
<br>
- My mana status<br>
- Healer(s) mana status (usually they're good about letting us know)<br>
- Melee health status<br>
- Main target's health status<br>
- Number of mobs remaining<br>
<br>
The way I look at it, if I'm full mana and the front-line guys are low health, I'm doing something wrong. The opposite also holds true. If I'm low mana and the front-line guys are basically untouched, I'm doing something wrong. This is different when playing my enchanter and we get big pulls, as it's then my job to trade my mana for melee hit points, since I'm never doing damage to the mobs anyway.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, I'll normally lob a nuke in once the mob is half health or below. Depending on the factors above, I might nuke more and earlier, or not at all. You just want to make sure that you're not unprepared for the next fight by being out of mana or having your melee folks more beaten up than they needed to be.<br>
<br>
Sure, there are times when you will want to open up your cannons, especially on named mobs or if the fight isn't going as well as you would have liked. But for the bread-and-butter mobs, try and keep your group resources (mana and health) balanced as best you can.<br>
<br>
I don't have an answer for you about the AE spells. My main character is the enchanter so of course I frown upon their use in a dungeon situation, and my mage's regular group has a really good enchanter so I never get to use them myself. So if you're without an enchanter they may have a good use, though I'd have to defer to someone who's used them in that kind of situation to explain their effectiveness, aggro considerations, etc. <p><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

Artie's post is very good.   In a full group you want to keep up with the pace of the group.  I usually let my mana bounce between 20 and 80 percent but try and keep it about even with the group's pull speed.  In a lot of battles it boils down to malise, dmg shield, and one blast (maybe two on harder creatures).   If you look at the dmg output of the dmg shield, pet, and 1-2 blasts you will definately be pulling your weight.  Overblasting just tends to slow down the group because they have to wait for your mana to go back up.  Having a bubble or two in reserve comes in very handy when a bad pull happens.   <br>
<br>
During the mid levels your priorities should be to malise the MoB and cast dmg shield on the tank who will take the most damage.  Damage shield is the most mana-efficient damage spell we have and it really does rack up good damage.  The trick is to not be the wizard... you aren't the big finisher, but you are the high damage output caster.. your pet, dmg shield, and 1-2 blasts are going to contribute a *lot* to the party.   <p> <br>

Once the camp is flowing smoothly, the pulls are regular and one at a time, I rarely cast anything except Malise at the beginning of the fight, and Inferno shield on the tank just before he goes to pull.<br>
<br>
If it's just me and my wife, then I'll sometimes heal my pet, but all in all, I don't do much casting while hunting. My wife, on the other hand, is a necro and uses quite a bit of mana casting DoTs, stuns, and so forth. Fortunately, she has her Allure of Death line of spells so that she always regains her mana quickly.<br>
<br>
If I'm full of mana and the pet's healthy, then I'll start tossing the occassional nuke, for lack of anything better to do. But, like others have already said, I generally conserve the big guns for emergencies. (Heh, the other day, camping the WC druids, I would occasionally use Cinder Bolt, which at my level does 322 damage. The wizard in our group was jealous, because none of his nukes did that much damage. At this level, his damage output is higher than mine because of lower casting times, but my nuke was bigger.)<br>

It's very situational.  I also only group with an enchanter.  If she's not on, I don't bother playing, luckly, she is usually on at the same times I am.<br>
<br>
First off, I usually take care of summoned items for people to start with; arrows, coldstones, and shurikens.<br>
<br>
I always use group damage shield, which doesn't effect FD one bit.  (If a mob hits an FD person, it's only because 1), it cast a spell, or 2) it wasn't fooled, so either way, the DS didn't effect the outcome).  I use group DS.  Most people are under the assumption that if you are hit with a DS up, it adds to your agro, but it's not true, so putting a DS on your enchanter is actually a good idea.  (you are aware that no one is assigned the damage of a DS, there for no one is assigned the agro from it either).<br>
<br>
When mobs are pulled, I put malosi on everything if they have medium to high resistances.  However, I don't always put malosi on, sometimes it's just wasted mana, since no one is getting resists anyways.<br>
<br>
If we get 4 or more mobs on one pull, we then go to our AE strategy, sometimes begging for large pulls.  With AE, I and another wizard, possibly more will AE nuke in the middle of the crowd while our enchanter AE stuns.  We handle anywhere from 4-8 mobs this way in a single group and boy does it add excitement.<br>
<br>
If we have a strong tank, I will nuke enough to keep myself at about 70% mana, and feed the cleric mod rods when or if (s)he gets low on mana.  The reason I use mod rods more than nuking, is that your tank can take one hell of a beating and the mana used to heal him is more effecient, than how much you shorten the battle.<br>
<br>
When in a group with a weak tank, I'll try to manage my mana to equal what the healer has.  Both of us are going to have to med after the battles, so being even makes us ready at the same time.<br>
<br>
Should our cleric or enchanter run low on mana, I always make mod rods, and ask our hybrids to heal them when they can.  I've helped hold a position many times with mod rods where most groups evac.  Sometimes, should we just have a weak tank, then I'll try to nuke things down fast instead, if I feel I can finish off what we are doing.<br>
<br>
Now, if we happen to loose our enchanter on a large pull, for what ever reason (not prepaired for AE, LD, or just agroed on before she can stun), I switch my gears.  At this point I mana burn as fast as I can (without getting agroing the mob) to eliminate mobs fast.  I'll drop to 20% mana just as fast as I can.  This reduces numbers in the fight, which will save your clerics mana (less time spent with 4+ mobs attacking everyone).  At the same time, I usually put my pet on it's own mob, but not always, sometimes our cleric or paladin will use root to effective take a mob out of the fight.  Other times all the mobs are focused on the tanks and won't fight the pet back, at which point I just put the pet on the tanks target (to quickly eliminate a mob).<br>
<br>
I'm sure I've missed a lot, but that mostly what I do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ureaperrp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ReaperRP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#333333>(11/10/00 5:52:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Strategy</span><hr size=1> Artie summed it up very well... <br>
<br>
One thing, I almost never use AE's in a group. Rains are plain useless, and the point blanks cause a big aggro effect and thats not usually a good idea for us frail magi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The only way I could see myself using it is if we're clearing greens, or have another 2 or 3 Mages/Wizards/Druids using AE's to drop a bunch of mobs fast. <p><html>

I got one question: If you pull say a green, blue and yellow(red?), which mob is it best to take down first. The greens die fastest, but the reds dish the most damage?? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Usually I sic my pet on tanks target, and if there is a weak secondary mob that still does much damage to the tank, I burn it down. Of course especially casters. HeeHee, nothing more fun that casting at same time as the Wizard, and that Orc Priest just topples over from 70% health.<br>
<br>
Secondly, dont totally dump the AE idea. It is a weapon which we can use, and even if the risk is HIGH, so is the reward. Mana efficiency is the key word. For example, if you fight 2 equal mobs, and one at low health, an AE will kill the low, harm the other, and your mana efficiency will be larger than casting a DD?<br>

<br>
ASSUMING the following:<br>
your group is pulling 1 red mob with a slight allowance for med and heal time afterward<br>
<br>
I would say that you/your entire gorup always should stick to whatever your intended mob/pull is at that time, regardless of what comes with it.<br>
<br>
The only exception I will add is if a magic using mob rides it's coattails.  Kill dem suckers first.<br>
<br>
This is just my honest opinion from situations in successful groups.<br>

Lots of great tactics and I agree with all of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Every tactic has it's place depending on the group.<br>
<br>
In regards to the first post...<br>
<br>
Anytime people in a group ask questions like that, I'll just let the pet sit back for a fight, and not nuke at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That or I switch into overdrive for a kill and and nuke something down so quick the fighter only gets a few hits in. The melee types don't like when that can't whack things alot.<br>
<br>
Or... and this one is the best... Ask the melee types if they can swing more cause you don't think they are doing enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Or see if the clerics can heal a bit faster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
People that ask questions like those fall into two groups.<br>
<br>
1. Impatient players that feel the group could do more (maybe the group could, sometimes it warrants pulling in more even if it's non exp stuff maybe pull more for extra loot) this happens alot with static spawns that you're waiting on spawns. People get bored <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. People that just don't know enough about tactics to understand group balance and rythms. Again, a little talking with these people and I'm sure you'll enlighten them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Okay, that's enough from me for now.<br>
<br>
Take care, and have fun,<br>
