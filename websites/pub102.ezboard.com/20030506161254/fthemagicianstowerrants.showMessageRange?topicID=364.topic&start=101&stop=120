Time and again, he makes *rhetorical* mistakes -- the information and plans he presents are generally good (sans his policy in north korea), but the way in which they're presented alienates the world.  He's just not smooth.  The whole 'axis of evil' diatribe is a prime example of one of his gaffes.<br>
<br>
About the Iraqi assassination attempt on Bush SR.. the motive for going after a country that tries to kill your leaders is not revenge -- on the contrary, it's pragmatic.  If Saddam tried to assassinate the president once, we can assume there's a decent change he'll do it again.  If he uses chemical weapons on his civilians once, we can assume it's likely he'll do it again.  If he invades his neighbours once, we can assume he will again -- and so on down the line.  <br>
<br>
We already had all the information we required to warrant a war.  The world has a short memory.  In hindsight, I wonder if going to the U.N. was a mistake.  We only went to the U.N. to placate the international community, taking the gamble that the inspectors would find the weapons we knew were there.  Now that they haven't found them, we've backed ourselves into a diplomatic corner, because we have to explain why we agreed to the inspections in the first place if we already knew we were going to invade.<br>
<br>
About Saddam keeping down Islamic fundamentalists (Islamists) -- yes, he does.  That's why Al Qaeda has traditionally spoken out against the Iraqi regime, before recently, when they did a quick turnabout to say it should be supported in the coming war against their greater enemy, America.  It also speaks to why the U.S. won't install a democratic government in Iraq when Saddam is history.  Among businessmen, academics and other secularists, there's real fear in the Arab world of Islamist takeover.  Islamists have captured the popular imagination there.  If there were a democracy in Iraq (or syria, or jordan, or saudi arabia) it's probable that Islamists would be elected.  And the first thing a real Islamist would do after getting to office would be to suspend democratic freedoms and install a repressive theocracy.  <br>
<br>
It's one of the reasons any action in the middle east is so morally yucky -- you're always dealing with the lesser of two evils.  On one hand, you want to establish the right to self-determination, but on the other you don't want to create powerful enemies.  So America, up to now, has been content to confine its goals to the support of benign dictatorships.  As a fervent fan of open societies, that irks me, but damned if I can think of a more practical alternative for the present...<br>

<br>
Anyway, just a couple tidbits.  Really has nothing to do with a post-Saddam Iraq, I just couldn't help but take issue with the idea that Saddam Hussein and his followers are &quot;moderates&quot;.  Yeah man...that's what I'd call moderate.<br>
<br>
/boggle<br>
<br>
Silverblade, I have looked and looked for three days for some kind of evidence...ANY kind of evidence to support what you say about out of control extremism.  I mean, I've read articles and reports by agencies and think-tanks ranging from the CIA to the Washington Institute, CNN, Reuters, British JIC, Jane's, the Washington Quarterly...hell even NPR and the BBC.  I can't even remember them all.  It has been extremely educational, and was time well spent.  But guess what...I have found exactly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that backs your claims.  Consensus?  A post-Saddam Iraq will be precarious and tricky, but not unmanageable.<br>
<br>
Well f**king duh.<br>
<br>
The current thinking is that after Saddam Hussein is removed, a US-lead coalition will  occupy and manage Iraq - not totally unlike what General MacArthur did in Japan after WWII.  Unlike in Japan, however, any temporary governance will have to be headed Iraqi civilians and backed by Western forces.  The Iraqi people would most likely not submit to having a Westerner calling the shots.  Which is fine, and completely understandable.  <br>
<br>
This occupation force will remain in place long enough to help rebuild infrastructure and build a functioning Iraqi government.  My guess is that it will be there long after that to babysit, much like we are in Bosnia/Kosovo.<br>
<br>
A few examples of this force's mandate(s) will be:<br>
To train and possibly help equip the Iraqi regular army (the RG and SRG will, by necessity, be decimated during any military action), which will play a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>major</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> role in the stabilization of a post-Saddam Iraq; to help rebuild infrastructure; to help the Iraqi army maintain security and stability; <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>to protect Iraq from any outside threat</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (e.g. Iran)<br>
<br>
I do not doubt that there will be certain ultra-extremist groups that will have a problem with any Western presence in their country.  But, well...so what?  Believe it or not, we can deal with it /GASP.  Yeah, there will be people who do not want us there.  Surprise surprise.<br>
<br>
In any case, the idea that our presence will somehow cause Iraq and the region to go completely off the deep end over night is really without base.  Actually, the reason we will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have problems with the Shi'ites is because <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>they are Saddam Hussein's BIGGIST OPPOSITION</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for Christ's sake.  They want him gone more than we do.  Hell, I would not be surprised to see them fighting alongside us!  In fact, when speaking in terms of open, armed revolution, the Iraqi Shi'a have tried to overthrow Saddam Hussein as recently as 1991.  As did the Kurds in the north...and we know how that ended.<br>
<br>
Another misrepresentation of truth that you've put forth, which is further evidence of your overall lack of understanding, is that the Shi'a of southern Iraq will cause problems post-Saddam because Iraqi Shi'a = Iranian Shi'a.  This is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not the case</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The two groups are not the same.  <br>
<br>
During the Iran-Iraq war, the Iranians thought they could depend on the Iraqi Shi'a to flock to them and do their bidding.  This did not happen.  Why didn't it happen?  Because the two groups - although Shi'ite Muslims - are not of the same ethnicity.  The Iraqi Shi'a do not have any allegience to the Iranians.  The Iraqi Shi'a identify themselves as Arabs...and more commonly, as Iraqis.  What the Iraqi Shi'a want is proportional representation in the central government.  They make up over 60% of the population, and the ruling Ba'ath party is almost exclusively Sunni.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that is why you are wrong.  I spent a few days of casual study in my spare time and gleaned a basic understanding that I didn't have before.  I would suggest that you follow my lead before you put forth asinine arguments about something you clearly do not understand.<br>

Honestly, can't you come up with anything better than this?  Not only is it utterly void of any intellectual substance, I defy you to substantiate it.  My 12 year old cousin could do better.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, where were you people when Bill Clinton went into Haiti, Bosnia and Kosovo without the UN's permission during the 90's?  Nowhere.  Where were you in 1998 when Clinton launched cruise missiles on Iraq.  Were you even aware that he launched more cruise missiles on Iraq in '98 than were launched during the entire gulf war?  Where were you then?  Nowhere.  I find that more than a little ironic.<br>
<br>
And why were you nowhere to be found?  Because you are not really against war.  You are agianst George Bush, for whatever reason (aren't you a Brit?).  If you were really against war, as you claim, you'd have been out there protesting every time Bill Clinton used military force without the UN's permission.  And he did it a lot.<br>
<br>
Bottom line is this...<br>
<br>
When our security is threatened, we will neutralize that threat.  We will not ask YOU or anybody else for permission.  We will not sit around and wait for the debating society that is the UN to reach a decision.  Simple as that. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

I have only one issue with any of it.<br>
<br>
The only reason saddam &quot;may&quot; be holding down extremists is that his government is socialist, not muslim. &quot;That&quot; is why the extremists were against him -- &quot;be cause he was not muslim. ... and yes that is why Osama didnt like him, but you are right, he will support Iraq against America.<br>
<br>
Remember the text of his last message? He called the govenment of Iraq &quot;socialists.&quot;<br>
<br>
Another thing that has begun to anger me a little.... the european attitude. This has caused me to do a little thinking and just a small amount of research (very small).<br>
<br>
It seems that the European Union (EU) was formed with several objectives in mind - two of the most notable were to try to and become more of an economic power and take away some of that power from the US. The second, they were beginning to see that the US was going to become the most powerful nation in the world and wanted to have an organization that was powerful enough to counter it. <br>
<br>
A strong united europe would be able to do that. Its not hard to see this in the recent actions by some of the old guard europeans. This whole big argument is pure politics. The french, germans, and belgians have been stalemating us, not because of what they say in public, but because they are flaunting there power. This seriously alarmed the rest of europe, hence the decsion to let the NATO defense committee decide whether to send aid to Turkey - a committee that france is not part of anymore. ... and did ya notice one more thing? As soon as france was blocked from having a vote, germany and belgium changed there minds. The french must be very good bullies. Its amazing how quickly the other two changed their minds when france was out of the picture.<br>
<br>
A couple of more items to loosely back up these opinions:<br>
<br>
When Jimmy Carter was given the Nobel Peace prize, there was one little bit that wasnt given much air time -- one of the members of the committee that grants the peace prize, a european, stated one of the reasons Carter was given the prize was as an insult to the Bush middle eastern policy. Dont get me wrong. I think Carter was a great choice. I just find it funny what gets air time and what doesnt.<br>
<br>
Next, I was watching MSNBC last nite as they were interviewing people in Paris about this whole US / france thing; and even though a few of those interviewed expressed favorable attitudes towards the US, one person, a french congressman, stated blatantly that the US has to learn that just because it is the most economically and militarily powerful nation on earth, that it cannot just &quot;do what it wants.&quot;<br>
<br>
That even further bolsters my belief that this is politics and not reality. Unfortunately, the reals issues are being ignored.<br>
<br>
Oh yea, there was one more thing I saw in the show i did not like. The reporter went to a bookstore and showed the covers of several books. One book that was written compared present day America to Hitler; another was titled &quot; Why we love to hate Americans,&quot; or something like that.<br>
<br>
Bottom line:<br>
<br>
The europeans used to be the big boys on the block. They controlled much if not most of what we know as the modern world, in one form or another, from one country or many, for a very long time. They dont like playing second fiddle anymore.<br>
<br>
Its really sad that something like this is being trashed by selfish politics, but I think that is what it is in a nut shell.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elladin>Elladin</A> at: 2/20/03 1:29:36 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caenn>Caenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 1:16:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: idiot socialists</span><hr size=1> Ad hominem?

<br>
I know rather well about Saddam's crimes. Saddam was a &quot;friend of the west!&quot; once upon a time and his atrocities were mostly over looked. BBC once ran an interesting piece of footage late one night, never saw it gain, but was during the Iran Iraq war. iranians were attacking over a stretch of 2 canals, Iraq's butchered them (hey it was war and the stupidity was the Iranians), made WW1 stuff look tame, what was interesting was that it seemed there was use of &quot;gas&quot; shells. Now that was a LONG time ago, may have been one of the incidents you noted. But there wasn't much comment then...largely because he was seen as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;fighting the Iranians which was a Good Thing&quot;.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Are you aware of that? The media bias due to government/economic reasons.<br>
Actually bias in the British printed press got pretty bad in the 80s and on as a few media barons took it over and laid down their &quot;vision&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And when did I ever say Saddam as a &quot;moderate&quot;? He's a freakin' maniac.  Do you see me saying <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;He's a nice guy really, we shouldn't invade&quot; ??</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Read my stuff on Graffe's for example I say that yes, Saddam needs dealt with, but his COUNTRY does not need or should not be subjected to a WAR to get rid of a minority when the vast majority dont support him and will suffer (as wel as the costs to us in regards to personnel, relations and economics). Show me where I'm wrong, I like debate as you can learn a lot from it, but DONT say an out right lie. Sheesh like folk saying I'm a commie and support stalin. jeez freakin' read and grow up. Saddam, Stalin, Mao et al = scumbags, I know this rather<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> well</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I love history and like trying to really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>understand</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about events. What I hate is the 2 faced crap of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Hey he's general pinochet he's a good guy cause he's for us!&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Freakin' West backed POL POTT 'cause he was anti-Vietnamese, gah! <br>
Saddam, the pre-curosors of the Taliban and Al-Qeda got Western backing, half the terrorists Europe in the 70's<br>
got CIA funding/backing/handling REGARDLESS of their cause or insanity. Wanna deny that?<br>
Wish to say Iran-Contra, Watergate, Air America, CIA's links with the Mafia or illegal experiments on civilians, bio-weapon tests on American populace, McCarthy, J.Edgar Hoover and Nixon are all a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>load of conspiracy theory crap</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, hm?<br>
I'ts 'cause I know about such stuff I wouldn't trust any politician from ANY country, from ANY side further than I could spit in a hurricane :&gt;<br>
<br>
Fact of life is that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>people will often support their own country/area first over ANY other allegiances, such as religion</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->---in response to your good points on the various makeups of the differing groups in Iraq. This applied for example, in the USA Civil War, many folk took sides purely to defend their &quot;homes&quot;, rather than due to actual political, moral or other issues. Similarly in an invasion of Iraq, you have to be careful not to upset the people there, who want Saddam dead, toot sweet, but who would back him if the USA goes too far.<br>
  Also the whole Middle East *is* a powder keg of conflicts, and thinking that islamic extremism is not a great risk in Iraq is a MAJOR over sight. Even if Iraq itself doesn't go fundamentalist, neighbouring countries may and that may lead to problems in Iraq. Do you doubt extremism isn't a danger in Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, Egypt etc?<br>
  Staying in a region after an invasion, even with good cause etc it's a major hassle, you are right there, the Israelis made that mistake in Lebanon which actually caused a lot of the tensions still around today :/<br>
<br>
Em, &quot;Where was I&quot;? where were &quot;YOU&quot; when these things occured, hm? Were you there? yeesh these are issues involving our COUNTRIES. Yup, UN should have got involved in some of the issues, note though that the British WERE in Bosnia and actually played a large part in KEEPING THE PEACE there and still are (or were last I heard), if you think otherwise, YOU are mis-informed. British troops and helps has benefitted the USA greatly over the years, even if covertly. You do know the British SAS was in Vietnam for example?<br>
<br>
<br>
Are YOU so naive as to think that personal revenage and the potential to make yourself, your family and your supporters large amounts of money are NOT good reasons to start a war? If they are merely added sweetners? Would you like it in ANY other situation of serious national, legal, criminal, economic or scientific import, when the main leader has 2 clear an ddirect personal motives for profit from an action they are directly responsible for starting?<br>
<br>
DA with a lot of gold bullion in the bank who's Arab pushes ofr the arrest of an important member of the gold trading community in Wall Street who's Jewish....<br>
<br>
Protestant politician in Britain who's a porpoerty developer has Cathoclics forcibly evicted from some areas to create a &quot;buffer zone&quot;..and their homes are seized by the government.<br>
<br>
Those kind of things would cause a STINK. It ALSO stinks when your country's leader calls a war for the removal of another head of state, when your leader has clear personal reasons that would benefit him DIRECTLY. You *CANNOT* dismiss the fact that his father was almost killed at Saddam's orders. Yoo CANNOT dismiss that he was involved in the oil industry, or that his family still is and that he has many suporters in the oil industry. It doesn't matter if oil prices go up or down as a result of his actions, they can still make huge profits, I've heard folk naively saying <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;But if prices go up, he won't make that any profit!&quot;...</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->and folsk think *I* am naive?!<br>
<br>
Ah, so there's the crux of the matter...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><br>
When our security is threatened, we will neutralize that threat. We will not ask YOU or anybody else for permission. We will not sit around and wait for the debating society that is the UN to reach a decision. Simple as that.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <br>
So the morality, legality or plain common sense isn't an issue if you feel the USA is threatened? <br>
...You do know why the USA has a Constitution, don't you? <br>
It's damn pitiful that soem of the populace country who rightfully and proudly agreed to that document don't have a CLUE WHAT IT MEANS.<br>
Or have you failed to grasp the history and morality of the past 100 years of disgusting butchery, savagery and down right evil?<br>

Get real, you are runing out of arguments. Every single cause or reason you have espoused has been successfully debunked by someone on this board at one time or another.

<br>
So, disarm him, but why the mad push to invade, the utter crass diplomacy that has angered, outraged or estranged many who would have helped?<br>
The international community *is* for disarming him, it's just not wanting another great stupid FUBAR in a very sensitive area of the world. <br>
  Actually I woudl say that Collin Powell maybe about the only guy in that entire administration with any sense, brains or understanding of foreign policy and it's implementations. Be nice to hear what he thinks *privately* about his Leader and other stuff.<br>
<br>
If you don't realize that conspiracies and outrages perpetrated by *insert name of your own government here* don't happen, then frankly you ain't been checking up on current events and history for the past 50 years. Think the *back* of JFKs head was due to some bizarre backwards flying bullet? That the CIA and Mafia weren't in bed since the OSS and Luciano got involved in Sicily? (go check the CIA vs Castro, if you think I'm talking crap) <br>
  Wanna go back further in time? USA and Britian and the Chinese Opium Wars, those directly lead to the Chinese Revolution and the heroin addicts on our streets.<br>
  The Gestapo put rumours around that Stalin's army was disloyal, so Stalin killed nearly a MILLION of his own troops and  so decimated his officer corps that the highest ranking person left was a Colonel , *one* colonel. That's how the Germans went through Russia's army like corn.<br>
  The Dreyfuss Scandal in France, he was a Jewish officer, there was treason in the army, he got hit with trumped up evidence to bury it and he was Jewish so easy scapegoat in an anti-semitic climate.<br>
  Concealing the KNOWN fact of the Nazi death camps during World War2 and hushing up the concentration camps horror before hostilities in the Western press and military.<br>
  USA military's involvment in making sure that black men infected with syphilis were not treated so they could be studied.<br>
<br>
That's the tip of the iceberg, there must be a ton of crap we also do not know because it was silenced or the folk buried. North Korean submarines landing commandoes in South Korea, USA intelligence officer spying for Saddam, Iran-Contra, those are some of the more recent conspiracies and bizarre crap.<br>
<br>
If you *DO* trust your political leaders and security forces you are *NAIVE*. And since we know conspiracies *do* happen, why would you think Bush Jr is incapable of perpetrating one? Some other USA presidents have been caught out (or almost caught out) commiting them.<br>
<br>
As for The Boogie Man, until someone comes up with 100% incontroverrtable evidence he does not exist, I maintain the right to believe he *may exist* even if the odds are extremely slim :&gt;<br>
That's a humorous reply, but, while some folk may not like this,<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> it's the proper scientific way of looking at it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
Hm, that's another good rant, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;the quasi-religion of Science and its <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>belief</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in its Laws and Dogma&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. No, I'm not anti-Science, quite the reverse in fact.<br>
<br>
&quot;Succesffuly debunked&quot;, like, em how?  This is a *debate*, I may be wrong in some *facts* (Without going over this entire debate, have I?), but a lot of this has been about personal beliefs and values--from all sides. You don 't *debunk* that, you can argue against it however. Oh and facts are incontrovertable things like dates of events, the Who Why and What when it comes to Human Events/Politics/Beliefs is largely guesstimates, agreed upon testimony that is recorded and so forth, that's why you talk--debate such things.<br>
<br>
Oh and I *like* to ramble, a debate is  a talk with another person or persons, it often involves many subjects, wanders around, and encroaches on many different topics. That's largely what makes it fun and lets you learn things. You start arguing over football and end up several hours later wondering what would have happend if the Roman Empire hadn't fallen <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Paraphrasing you: Saddam is holding down the extremists because he's a socialist...er..? <br>
 Folk *KNOW* he's a bastrd, you think everyone outside the USA is uninformed? (*wry grin...sort of riposte dig there*). Folk are concerned with any action taken agaisnt him may result in an even WORSE mess, and despite what some have said  the MAJORITY of folk know that is a very real possibility. Going in like a bull in a china shop = bad. This isn't Haiti you know. About the best hope is that the build up of military forces allows the USA/UK to say secretly to Sadam's generals <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;either he goes or YOU go, and we chose who's in power and destroy the NBC weapons, you can hang on and draw your pay as usual&quot;,</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and so resolve the problem.

Fair warning....LOTS of quotes ahead (sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Saddam was a &quot;friend of the west!&quot; once upon a time and his atrocities were mostly over looked.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>But there wasn't much comment then...largely because he was seen as &quot;fighting the Iranians which was a Good Thing&quot;. Are you aware of that? The media bias due to government/economic reasons.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I'm very aware of that.  The US knew that he was using chemical weapons while he was using them, yet we moved to normalize trade relations with him.  Why?  Because it's what was in the best interest of the country at the time.  That's how politics works.  <br>
<br>
That was a very different time and the world was a very different place.  At that time Iran was seen as the major threat, not Iraq.<br>
<br>
The US and UK were allied with the Soviet Union and Joseph Stalin during WWII, as I'm sure you know.  Again, because it was in our best interests <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>at the time</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Doesn't necessarily make it a good thing, that's just the way it was.<br>
<br>
I don't know that there is really a media bias, I mean the information is readily available from major media outlets on the web.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And when did I ever say Saddam as a &quot;moderate&quot;? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
You never said that he is a moderate in so many words.  But you did infer it...and I thought I made it pretty clear as to how you did so:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
...you know much about Islam? Sunni <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>(moderate)</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, Shiite (extremist), ok that's very simplistic but a rough idea of the two main factions...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know rather well about Saddam's crimes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Look, I'm sure you do...I was just trying to put emphasis on a point.  So let's compromise and try not to stray any further in this direction than we already have.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>...Saddam needs dealt with, but his COUNTRY does not need or should not be subjected to a WAR to get rid of a minority when the vast majority dont support him and will suffer (as wel as the costs to us in regards to personnel, relations and economics).

<br>
Why is it that you want so badly to believe that we are going to go in there and lay waste to the entire country through the judicious use of carpet bombing and napalm drops on entire cities so that we can take out one military target?  You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>KNOW</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that is not how it happens.<br>
<br>
For christ's sake do I really have to explain to you how modern munitions work??  I know you know.  We can put them right in a window or down a chimney or through a door...<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>literally!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
You also like to use the premise that his &quot;country&quot;, which I take to mean his &quot;people&quot;, are our targets and our enemies.  That is simply not the case.  I do not know how to be any more plain about that.  The United States is not in the business of genocide...that is Saddam's territory.  I wish you'd get past the idea that we are as bad or worse than he is.<br>
<br>

<br>
Although this is an example of pure sophistry on your part, I will briefly indulge you...<br>
<br>
At the risk of sounding cliche, politics is a dirty business.  The things that make the world go round are not always nice and soft and fluffy.  Do I defend the things or the people you mentioned?  Some, yes...others no.  I'm not going to get into the who's or why's right now.<br>
<br>
But you really need to grow up in this regard, because you are in for a rude awakening sometime later in life when you finally figure it out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Similarly in an invasion of Iraq, you have to be careful not to upset the people there, who want Saddam dead, toot sweet, but who would back him if the USA goes too far.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again, please substantiate this.  I have done some studying on this, as I've said, and I have not found <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to support this claim.  In fact all information that I could dig up (and I dug) says that the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>exact opposite</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> scenario will play out.  This is pure speculation and uninformed opinion on your part.  If you would just take the time to research what you put forth, you would understand what I mean.<br>
<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Em, &quot;Where was I&quot;? where were &quot;YOU&quot; when these things occured, hm?

You entirely misunderstood the point I was trying to make.  I was attempting to show you that what we are doing is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not without precedent</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Nearly the exact same scenarios have played out in the last ten years, and I had absolutely no problems with them.  NOR DID YOU!!  That is the whole frigging @#%$ point!  The two differences are the size of the operation and (this is really what the issue is) the fact that there are US interests at stake.  There were no such interests at stake in the Balkans or Haiti.<br>
<br>
I am trying to show you the utter hypocracy of your position.  You were not out marching in the streets (I don't know that you do so now, but you get the idea) when President Clinton took matters into his own hands in regards to other soveirgn countries and their &quot;leaders&quot;, yet you are when President Bush is doing so.

I was in Bosnia as a part of the NATO peace keeping force for nearly half a year.  Do not presume lecture me on the situation there.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You do know the British SAS was in Vietnam for example?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yes.  I wish I could remember the name of the author, but the book is called S.O.G.  One of the best books I've read about Vietnam and the things that our people (and yours) did over there.  All things that we not only were not told about, but things that were outright denied by the government until that book was released.<br>

<br>
Come on.  It is so easy for you to chalk the fact that I don't buy into conspiracy theory up to &quot;naivety&quot;.  Give me a break, will you please?  As much as I hate to bounce accusations back at someone when they are hurled at me (it worked in the 3rd grade, kinda silly now), I really have to say that YOU are the one who is being naive here.<br>
<br>
In point of fact, I happen to consider those who DO buy into conspiracy theory as being not only naive, but in most cases not quite what I'd call overly intelligent.  A generalization on my part, yes.  But a belief I hold none the less.  Are there some things that bear closer scrutiny?  Of course.  Does every action a government takes fall into this category?  Come on.<br>
<br>
Are you familiar with the premise of &quot;Occam's Razor&quot;?  Roughly, it states that all if all things being considered are equal, the simplist explanation will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>usually</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be the correct one.  This is not always the case, and Occam's Razor does not always hold true.  But it can be a good guide.<br>
<br>
So do I buy into your conspiracy theory.  No, of course not.  And I'll give you one of a few reasons why I don't.<br>
<br>
Did you happen to watch the video that Kannt posted?  That guy, whoever he is, is absolutely brilliant.  Anyway, the thing about President Bush wanting to make himself and his buddies rich by bleeding the oil wells of Iraq dry was one of the big arguments these &quot;protesters&quot; (and I use that term loosely...those dimwits wouldn't know a real reason to protest if it bit them in the ass) were using.  Basically spouting the same nonsense as you in regards to Bush being hungry for oil dollars.<br>
<br>
The guy that made that video (cant remember his name dangit) asked them a very simple question: If that were the case, why did George Bush Sr. not do it when we were there the last time?  NOT ONE of them had a good answer.  <br>
<br>
Well, maybe some did and he just edited them out.<br>
<br>
But can you answer that question Silverblade?  Why didn't we just march on in and make off with all the oil in Iraq the first time we were there?  If that's all this conflict is about, why didn't we just save ourselves the time, money and effort the last time and take care of it then?  Hmm?  Bush Sr. is just as heavily involved with the oil industry as is Dubya.  Why didn't we do it last time?<br>
<br>
We definately could have.  We could very easily have.  Iraq's army was decimated, the country was virtually undefended...but no, we decided we were going to give him a decade or so to rebuild and dig in before we came back for the oil.<br>
<br>
Yeah.<br>

<br>
Yes, I can dismiss it.  I'm surely not going to deny it, but I can most definately dismiss it as reason for going to war.<br>
<br>
I'm beginning to get the imression that you are young, Silver.  Is that the case?  I am not insulting you here...I say that because this, as with many other arguments you put forth, is something that would spring from the mind of a person that simply does not have the life experience to be able to adequately understand the way the world really works.  You seem to have an almost child-like perspective on not only why things are the way they are, but why they are not the way they should be...if that makes sense.  Kinda like you've lead a very sheltered life.<br>
<br>
I mean, the whole &quot;revenge&quot; thing.  It's something a kid would come up with.  Leaders of responsible nations simply <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> act in such ways.  They just don't.  They don't make plans to go to war...WAR...just to settle a personal vendetta.  THEY JUST DON'T!<br>
<br>
Not just the Iraq thing, but on the original topic of this thread (before we totally hi-jacked it) as well.  Anyway, just a thought.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ah, so there's the crux of the matter...<br>

<br>
See...once again I'm left questioning your age and level of life experience.  National security takes prededence over diplomacy, over international law...perhaps over morality in some circumstances.  It simply has to be that way if a nation is to survive.  ANY country that would not do exactly the same when their security as a nation and as a people is threatened is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>doomed to fail.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  <br>

I really hope you are not referring to the United States when you say this.  If so, you just lost whatever thread of credibility you may have had with me at any point.  This is just so juvenile, and so completely wrong.<br>

I won't even get into what we as a country have done for the world.  I won't.  Because I don't know that you are directing this at the US.

<br>
<br>
I m not going into reash my own words, so just a couple comments:<br>
<br>
-About international right: things have changed guys, since the Nations Society (or however you spell it), UN were designed to be a laboratory for an international demacracy, and noone should be allowed to sit on it.<br>
<br>
It should give you a hint that Germany and France, those ennemies for ages, are together for peace, at least to give UN inspectors all the time they need, because war as a principle can only be used as the last solution.<br>
The world is not a school yard, and clearly we are witnessing two cultures opposing on this matter: culture of dialogue and mutual consentment, versus a culture of power and conquest.<br>
<br>
USA are a great nation, but they must work with the international community, how is this hard to grasp?<br>
How can you defend democracy when you dont agree with those simple rules? <br>
<br>
As a result, if we except the support from T.blair, Aznar and a couple eastern european countries (the leaders, mind you, not the people), USA appear to be isolated on the international stage.<br>
How can you be right against the whole world and not puting yourself on the test?<br>
The roots of this issue can be probably understood on a picture i have seen, G.Bush and his staff praying GoD   before a meeting.<br>
God and the world affairs have nothing to do together, we know that since 18th century here.<br>
How can you invoke the divine right to guide your hand opposed to the Reason is beyond me.<br>
<br>
-About capitalism the way it is today, (sorry i try to link the original thread with the way it turned out).<br>
Anyone find amusing that a single man (Ruppert Murdoch) can, because he supports Bush, spread through his medias (Fox,The New York Times, The Sun to named a few ones) torrents of stupidity, false informations and hate toward the nations who are for peace?<br>
It isnt much different from the good old &quot;Pravda&quot;.<br>
Thats how people are beeing stolen democracy, and its the same in many other sectors, because money&gt; all .<br>
<br>
About Chomsky: ill agree, but he is maybe the little tree who is hiding the whole forest; the american model can still be criticized (and it is), you dont have to be a leftist anti-american to think different, (as there are still independant journalists out there).<br>
And dont make me quote Michael Moore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
About the conclusion of war:<br>
-Thats a major reason people dont want it, because:<br>
<br>
-USA will kill S.H, and replace him with a ghost military governement, as they did so many times (Afghanistan got to be the last exemple to date, where is Democracy, and what will happened when US soldiers will be gone?).<br>
<br>
There wont be any democracy Irak, are you naive enough to think Islamist wouldnt win free elections after you destroyed their country for 13 years?<br>
The War party is working for B.laden; democrats in Irak and Middle East will be reduced to nothing.<br>
<br>
As for the Irakian people, they dont matter, right?<br>
A couple nights in Bagdad will probably re populate the country and make it for the war's losses.<br>

Just remember one thing, the US or Bush is not the bad guy here. We are not the ones that have not complied with UN resolutions for twelve years. We have NOT destroyed his country for 12 years. Every negative consequence the Iraqis have suffered would have been AVOIDED if Saddam and his gang had just complied with he UN resolutions.<br>

....and as far as waiting.... Europe waited and did nothing early in the last century and it bit them in the ass twice; Both times, we terrible, nazi, war hungry Americans came over and helped save your asses. Oh yes, we were stupid too in the late 1930's and 1940's. It bit us in the ass too. This is all about not letting it happen again. There should not be any politics involved. I dot believe france has any motive except being against what the US is for. Well, happily, they got around that in NATO.<br>

I can count on one hand the number of European governments have come out as being outright opposed to what we are doing.  If anything, France and Germany are the ones who are in the minority, if not isolated on the international stage.<br>
<br>
I thought it quite funny that the idoicy of your government's position was put in its proper place by NATO, when France was completely excluded from the decision to go ahead with making plans to defend Turkey in case of war in Iraq.<br>
<br>
And what was even better was that Germany shut its mouth and went along with the program when that happened.<br>
<br>
It's also interesting to note that every single one of the 10 former Eastern-Bloc applicants to the EU are squarely in our corner when it comes to the situation in Iraq.  Why?  Because they've all had to live like the Iraqi people are currently living...under the boot of a dictator.  They just loved Chirac's quip about them &quot;missing an oppotunity to keep their mouths shut&quot; as well.<br>

France had no decision to take in NATO regarding Turkey, because the internal council where the decision was made doesnt have France in it.<br>

France beeing isolated with Germany on the international stage? <br>
May i smile here, Russia and China already stated that they dont mind using their veto if more time isnt given to UN inspectors.<br>
Out of 15 members in the security council, you dont have the 9 required to make a second resolution.<br>
And your president stated that he would attack Irak even without support, talk about democracy.<br>
<br>
You really didnt see M. Powel face after our foreign affairs minister commented M.Blix report, which evidently showed that things were geting really better in Irak.<br>
<br>
Also, you failed to adress my concerns for the after Sadham.<br>
Cause you dont care, of course.<br>

Because you dont know what is a war.<br>

How many Irakian died? do you even know it, before your president, an ex night cluber, a drunkar, who has find in God his personal only way not to be a loser, puts midle east into fire.<br>

You dont care again, because you are far away.<br>
Your medias will show you pictures that seem to come right from Star Wars, clean, with cool FX...pathetic.<br>
<br>
People in the world know that war is the last solution, and why.<br>
Actually, USA may be the last country on earth to know what exactly are War and misery, and why under the wrong idea to enforce an idea (democracy) you are just going to unleash hell, with the help of like 3000 Rockets every day, of course.<br>

1) yah there was a LOT of Iraqi soldiers killed and the western media blissfully overlooked most of that. Most were poor dumb conscripts and the elite units wereleft largely alive by comparison.<br>
<br>
2) Yup it is not 1939 germany, but Sddam does run an incredibly tight regime of incredibly ruthlessness, his aholes make the gestapo look antiquated.<br>
<br>
3) Russia, China and France do have ulterior motives for not wishing or indeed, Saddam to go *at all*, because of lucrative and frankly filthy contracts for oil, weapons etc. As usual when politics and money gets involved, it's murky, filthy and dirty.<br>
<br>
4) Iraq is *not* under control, sanctions are only reducing Saddam's power, but at the the cost of misery to his people, *which he doesnt give a f**k about*.<br>
<br>
5) yah America basically doesnt have much of a taste of what war does to *you're own country* Americans can argue against that but it's a fact. 9/11 was horrible but compared ot an actual all out war, it's nothing. Most of the world has a lingering horror of that due to the last great wars, America was very lucky to escape almost untouched directly by that.<br>
<br>
6) I think Bush is a total ass and probably the worst d*ckhead to be in the WHitehouse since Nixon, but WTF has been a &quot;NIGHTCLUBBER&quot; got to to with being leader of your nation for good or for bad? Much rather have NORMAL folk who, pardon me, screw, booze, fight, party and like do, you know NORMAL things, than &quot;cold fish&quot;.<br>
Still can't believe America was more scandalized by the President having a blowjob in the Oval Office, than an act of utter treason like Iran-Contra *boggles*. heck if I was In Parliament, I'd have a Lewinsky at the top of Big Ben!<br>

Perhaps it's because you don't live here that you don't realize this, but Powell has become just as hawkish on the need for war with Iraq as Bush or any other cabinet member.  Some think his reluctance in the beginning was kind of a &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; strategy by the Bush administration to sucker people like you, Silver, into praising him as the only voice of reason.<br>

(Actually, now that I think about it, the two go hand in hand).  I'm not going even argue with you, except to say that.  <br>
<br>
Hell, you've even got Silverblade contradicting you, and THAT is saying something.<br>
<br>
Edit: ok I lied...<br>
<br>
I suppose you have experienced war first hand in your life time?  Gee, that's funny...I haven't ready anything about France being invaded in the past 28 years.  Hmm...must be our horridly slanted and biased public education system at work again /shrug.  I R dumb American (that's what this is really about, isn't it Bel?  The fact that you are a bigot?)<br>
<br>
Let me tell you something my friend...I have helped carry bodies from mass graves in Bosnia.  I have stood in front of the ovens at Auschwitz.  I have seen the pictures and heard the stories of my friends in the Army of the aftermath of the first Gulf War.  You don't know the first thing about me or my history.<br>
<br>
You insult me.<br>
<br>
Oh, and NOBODY knows exactly how many Iraqis died in the first Gulf War, genius.  Nobody can get a straight number out of Saddam Hussein.  It's rather irrelevant truthfully, as exactly NONE of them would have died if Saddam Hussein had not INVADED KUWAIT.<br>

You act like this is not worth remembering or learning from.  Perhaps that is where your problem is, Belarkan, you are too arrogant and obstinate to learn from the mistakes of the past.<br>
<br>
In fact, just because I know it pisses you off, I'm going to bring up the fact that France took the EXACT same &quot;diplomacy not war&quot; attitude in regards to Germany and the Nazis 1939...right up until the German army rolled down the Champs D'Elysse.<br>
<br>
But you apparently think you know better than History, so I guess the similarities between the two situations are lost on you as well.<br>

<br>
In regards to a post-Saddam Iraq...<br>
If you'd bothered to read the posts since you've been absent from this debate, you'd see that I and others have tried to address the concerns over a post-Saddam Iraq.  Not even going to bother getting into it again.<br>
<br>
Russia and China?  Forgive me, but...<br>
haha....haHAha...HAhhahaHAHAha...AAAHHHHHAhahaHAHAAHA<br>
<br>
/wipes tears from eyes.  Oh lordie.  Show me a direct quote where they've said they'd veto and I'll eat my words.  Russia and China will abstain, at worst.  Why?  Simple.  We have money, they need it, they'll do what we want them to.  Don't think that's enough of a reason?  Wait and see what happens when France pisses us Americans off enough to incite a serious US boycott on French imports.  Just wait.  You are very close to having that happen, FYI, so I wouldn't laugh.  There are already people calling for it.  Americans are coming quite close to having their fill of your idiocy.<br>
<br>
Yes Belarkan, you need us stupid Americans that much.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>France had no decision to take in NATO regarding Turkey, because the internal council where the decision was made doesnt have France in <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Uhh, yeah and why exactly did it have to go to the NATO defense commitee??  Because France blocked it from being discussed in general committe.  So the rest of NATO - yes...all the rest of NATO - put France in its proper place and found a way around it.<br>
<br>
And why not 12 weeks more?  Because I GUARANTEE that in 12 weeks you'll be asking for another 12 weeks...and after that another 12, and so on until another 12 YEARS has gone by.  I mean FFS what don't you people get about that?<br>
<br>
It's gone on long enough.  The time for making deals and hoping has passed.  Actually, it passed long ago...the UN is just too hopelessly impotent to have done anything about it.<br>
<br>
Want to get into another issue?  I believe that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the United Nations.  It has become nothing more than a mockery of itself and a useless, irrelevant debating society.  It lacks the backbone to credibly back up any of its resolutions, as is sorely evident with Iraq, and the firepower to be effective even IF it can summon the gaul to act.  Two words...Srebenica, Yugoslavia.  Read up on how well the UN saved the day there when you get the chance.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and Iraq in charge of a disarmament conference???  LIBYA in charge of a conference on human rights???<br>
<br>
Gonna end this before I break in to another fit of hysterical laughter. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

How is that, because a bunch of countries do not support your country policy that you would boycot its products?<br>
Of course we need you, and we know it since a long time, the only problem is that you need us exactly the same way, which you seem to have trouble understanding.<br>
<br>
Oh, before i  get flammed for this, with &quot;us&quot; i mean the rest of the world, France included.<br>
You are certainly aware of what will happen the day Japan and China take back their investments into USA to put it somewhere else, arent you.<br>
<br>
But, back to the subject.<br>
<br>
Ill stick to my opinion, sorry, the only country isolated atm is USA, and thats your administration's fault.<br>
Ask Redorious if M.Blair isnt feeling a bit alone atm and wondering about his future atm...just like M.Aznar and Berlusconi probably.<br>
<br>
France isnt agaisnt USA, but we are for UN and international right, international democracy is an important concept out here.<br>
<br>
So as your country is sitting on UN day after day a little more, it will be more and more difficult for France to defend both its friendship with USA and its trust in UN, thats as simple as that.<br>
<br>
Of course you are going to claim that USA are working with UN...and thats right, but before France intervention, it was more about the UN to acknowledge everything M.Powel would ask, and nothing more.<br>
<br>
Now, USA have to really work with UN, and not pretend they do, like they intended at the beginning, and thats what makes enrage M.Rumfeld and co, and why they want to make us pay, of course France would be the first, for this unforgivable act of rebelion.<br>
<br>
The problem is, here we dont see that as an act of rebelion, we see UN, international right, and the common desire to disarm Irak in peace, in order to prevent a slaughtering at Europeans doors.<br>
<br>
We dont have any anti-US campaign in our media, no insults and hatred, no racism.<br>
Can you honestly say the same?<br>
<br>
75 per cent people in Europe are against a war in the present situation, it happens that Chirac is speaking for them, along with Schroeder.<br>
<br>
And what about those 10 millions people in the streets last Saturday, to protest against the concept of preventive war?<br>
Were those people also &quot;neo-Marxists&quot;? =)<br>

<br>
The Complete Military History of France<br>
  <br>
- Gallic Wars - Lost. In a war whose ending foreshadows the next 2000 years of French history, France is conquered by of all things, an Italian.<br>
<br>
- Hundred Years War - Mostly lost, saved at last by female schizophrenic who inadvertently creates The First Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France's armies are victorious only when not led by a Frenchman.&quot;<br>
<br>
- Italian Wars - Lost. France becomes the first and only country to ever lose two wars when fighting Italians.<br>
<br>
- Wars of Religion - France goes 0-5-4 against the Huguenots<br>
  <br>
- Thirty Years War - France is technically not a participant, but manages to get invaded anyway. Claims a tie on the basis that eventually the other participants started ignoring her.<br>
<br>
- War of Devolution - Tied. Frenchmen take to wearing red flowerpots as chapeaux. <br>
<br>
- The Dutch War - Tied<br>
<br>
- War of the Augsburg League/King William's War/French and Indian War - Lost, but claimed as a tie. Three ties in a row induces deluded Frogophiles the world over to label the period as the height of French military power.<br>
<br>
- War of the Spanish Succession - Lost. The War also gave the French their first taste of a Marlborough, which they have loved every since.<br>
<br>
- American Revolution - In a move that will become quite familiar to future Americans, France claims a win even though the English colonists saw far more action. This is later known as &quot;de Gaulle Syndrome&quot;, and leads to the Second Rule of French Warfare; &quot;France only wins when America does most of the fighting.&quot;<br>
<br>
- French Revolution - Won, primarily due the fact that the opponent was also French. <br>
 <br>
- The Napoleonic Wars - Lost. Temporary victories (remember the First Rule!) due to leadership of a Corsican, who ended up being no match for a British footwear designer.<br>
<br>
- The Franco-Prussian War - Lost. Germany first plays the role of drunk Frat boy to France's ugly girl home alone on a Saturday night. <br>
<br>
- World War I - Tied and on the way to losing, France is saved by the United States. Thousands of French women find out what it's like to not only sleep with a winner, but one who doesn't call her &quot;Fraulein.&quot; Sadly, widespread use of condoms by American forces forestalls any improvement in the French bloodline.<br>
<br>
- World War II - Lost. Conquered French liberated by the United States and Britain just as they finish learning the Horst Wessel Song.<br>
<br>
- War in Indochina - Lost. French forces plead sickness, taken to bed with the Dien Bien Flu<br>
<br>
- Algerian Rebellion - Lost. Loss marks the first defeat of a western army by a Non-Turkic Muslim force since the Crusades, and produces the First Rule of Muslim Warfare; &quot;We can always beat the French.&quot; This rule is identical to the First Rules of the Italians, Russians, Germans, English, Dutch, Spanish, Vietnamese and Esquimaux.<br>
<br>
- War on Terrorism - France, keeping in mind its recent history, surrenders to Germans and Muslims just to be safe. Attempts to surrender to Vietnamese ambassador fail after he takes refuge in a McDonald's. <br>
<br>
The question for any country silly enough to count on the French should not be &quot;Can we count on the French?&quot;, but rather &quot;How long until France collapses?&quot; <br>

<br>
Ehh, tens of millions is an exaggeration.  It was more like 3 or 4.  Regardless, it meant nothing, really.  Most of them didn't even know why they were there.  Again, I'd ask you to check out Kannt's link (it's just one example) regarding the &quot;knowledge base&quot; of the peace demonstrators.  I mean, anybody could get a few million half-wits around the world to do anything, if the cause was one that they'd be willing to rally to.  The causes of rebellion in here in the US and anti-Americanism abroad just happen to be popular ones.<br>
<br>
Let's look at it in perspective.  And we'll put aside the fact that they were for the most part completely clueless and just work with numbers.  And this is by no means scientific...<br>
<br>
There are approximately six billion people in the world.  Assuming that approximately 3.5 million of them marched on February 17th (think that was the day), that comes out to a whopping .058% of the world's population.  Wow!<br>
<br>
Ok, well let's be fair about this.  Let's say that each one of those 3.5 million represented, oh I dunno, one hundred unheard voices (and I think that's being generous).  That would mean that in reality some 350 million people feel the same way.<br>
<br>
That bumps the number up to roughly 5.8% of the world's population.  Is that your overwhelming dissent?<br>
<br>
You can argue with my numbers, certainly.  Like I said, it's by no means scientific.  My point is that it was a relatively miniscule number of people that showed up to protest, most of whom didn't have a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>*clue*</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> what they were talking about or why they were really even there.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Were those people also &quot;neo-Marxists&quot;? =)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, as a matter of fact.  And worse.<br>
<br>
A very good article about who sponsored the &quot;peace rallies&quot; here in the US and the UK can be found <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.usainreview.com/2_17_Anti_War_Protests.htm" target="top">here.</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  This comes from USA today, so it's not exactly an un-reputable source.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You have more and more trouble to hide your arrogance, and the fact that any other opinion makes you going &quot;epilleptic&quot;.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Don't confuse the fact that I know I'm right with the idea that I am arrogant.  I'd say it's more due to the fact that you're wrong than that you have a differing opinion.  Opinions I can deal with.  Unwillingness to apply logic to your opinions makes me mad, I'll admit.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>How is that, because a bunch of countries do not support your country policy that you would boycot its products?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
First of all, I just don't buy into the notion that &quot;a bunch of countries do not support our policy&quot;.  France is the only real concern when it comes to opposition because they have veto power in the UN (not that it really matters much).  Belgium does not, Germany does not.  Russia and China will balk at any US initiatives because, well, that's just what they do.  They will go along in the end, with the worst case scenario being that they choose to abstain (which I personally do not think likely).  <br>
<br>
I just don't see the huge amount of dissent that you claim exists among other countries.  Sure, the media hypes what little there is...it makes great television, doesn't it?  Kinda like a &quot;David vs. Goliath&quot; story. But when you come right down to it, it's really just three countries, two of which don't count (no veto power).<br>
<br>
In regards to a boycott...<br>
Think of it as the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>other</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> side's form of protest.  We are allowed to do that too, aren't we?  Or is that a right reserved for the far left?<br>
<br>
Just like the people that marched earlier this month, the rest of us have ways of making our voices and our opinions heard.  Just so happens that boycott is a means of making those opinions felt at the same time.  If you ask me, it's a whole lot more effective than running around in the street singing &quot;koom-by-ah&quot;.<br>
<br>
Anyway, who's to say it will ever happen?  I'm just saying that it is a real possibility right now.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You are certainly aware of what will happen the day Japan and China take back their investments into USA to put it somewhere else, arent you.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Sure I am.  But as it happens, Japan is a very close ally, and China is doing all it can to become a major player on the world stage.  In other words, neither of these things are going to happen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>you need us exactly the same way, which you seem to have trouble understanding.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, see, you're only partially correct.  Think of it this way...<br>
<br>
What would happen to France without the United States?  Conversely, what would happen to the United States without France?<br>
<br>
You see my point?  Ok, good.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ask Redorious if M.Blair isnt feeling a bit alone atm and wondering about his future atm<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know perfectly well that Tony Blair is supporting the US to his own political detriment.  I've stated that already.  Don't you find it odd that a politician would do such a thing even if it meant losing the most important office in his country?  I certainly do.  Which is why I have a new-found respect for Tony Blair, despite my total disagreement with his politics in other areas.  He is obviously a man of character.<br>
<br>
Anyway, do you want to know what I think his reasoning is?  Ok.<br>
<br>
Bush and Blair know the horror that we are going to find when we get there.   That simple.  And they know that once we do get there and the entire picture is laid bare for the world, all of the detractors - yes, even you Bel - are going to be swallowing their tongues trying to explain away their former positions. <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>
