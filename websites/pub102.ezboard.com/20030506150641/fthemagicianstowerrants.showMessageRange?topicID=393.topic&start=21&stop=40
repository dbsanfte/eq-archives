They are fairly well balanced against the damage dealing of monks/rogues/rangers.  They are very well balanced against the tanking of warriors/SKs/paladins.<br>
<br>
However, the fact that they can apparently tank better than a monk *while* magician + pet puts out more damage is far from balanced.  Since they are balanced well against all other classes, it's not hard to figure out where the problem is.<br>
<br>
Sony has a 6-sided die with &quot;nerf&quot; on 5 sides.  Roll dem bones.<br>
<br>
And yeah, I conceded his point.  As long as you concede mine that clerics can put out 30-250% of the damage of magicians.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The fact is when a magician pet tanks, there is no flexibility that a pc has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>because magician pets are by design hard to control, to prevent mage pets from ever becomming effective tanks, which prevents what you speak of from ever becomming a balance issue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
1) pets cannot easily pull aggro from adds which are causing problems (say interupting a clerics casts?)<br>
<br>
2) pets cannot easily position mobs (ever have a mob poof up on a wall?)<br>
<br>
3) if pets are tanking, that means your group cant have any other melee as it can no longer tank. this severely limits potential group members to other pet classes and wizards.<br>
<br>
4) if there are no melee that means one of the casters must pull. that means one of the casters (probably the magician) is losing alot of dps, since during what is supposed to be &quot;downtime&quot; they are moving around instead of medding. the magician equivilant of a monk whos dps is rivaled by an air pet needs all the downtime they can get. their nuking dps will be very low.<br>
<br>
5) if while pulling the magician gets an add they have no choice but to bring them both, whereas a monk can feign split.<br>
<br>
Like i asked lordofkaos over on the monk board tell me faned what group do you think is getting better exp, a group with a magician pet tank or a group with a monk tank?  <br>
<br>
please this is ridiculous. &quot;oh no magician pets out tank monks&quot; lol give me a break... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 12/7/02 4:01:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=faned>Faned</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.kentmbrown.com/PDF/cubed.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#333333>(12/8/02 2:17:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=393.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.kentmbrown.com/PDF/Faned_pulling.gif w=90 h=100></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Faned, Just to clear things up</span><hr size=1> Ya know, I went ahead and got level 61 with my magician.  Figured if I want to solo I'll drop all the way down to my level 11 beastlord.  :P<br>
<br>
Anyway, I also got my magician flagged for PoV yesterday and went and joined a group in &quot;inner cave&quot; (at 60 at the time, hit 61 in there).  I have the bolt spell, that's it (still, /rude Sony).<br>
<br>
We had a pull go bad, cleric died, enchanter died, three mobs in camp.  We decide to run.  Everybody runs, my pet obviously stays there mindlessly beating on mobs.<br>
<br>
I don't know whether one mob stayed or two or all three.  I do know that at least one did because the pet's health was going down the whole time and it eventually died.  When I got to the zoneout stone, my pet was still alive, though not by much.  I stood there and waited for it to die before zoning.  In the time elapsed, as Faned I would have been Feigned (or dead) by then.<br>
<br>
I'm looking forward to getting the level 61 pet to run some real tests.<br>
<br>
And to address a few things:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>magician pets are by design hard to control, to prevent mage pets from ever becomming effective tanks<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
A) They're not all that hard to control, particularly these days.<br>
B) If a magician pet is tanking, there are no other melees.  It's not hard to adjust for whatever mob the magician pet picks to tank.<br>
C) If there are no other melees, you will probably be trying to fight single mobs most of the time anyway so it's a non-issue.<br>
<br>
Yeah, magician pets have some downsides.  No other melees is a huge one, but hey, just get more pets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>pets cannot easily pull aggro from adds which are causing problems<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And yet, better than a monk...  Ask a warrior how hard it is to &quot;back up&quot; or position a mob while a pet is beating on it.  I watched it last night.  If the warrior, who has *solid* aggro tries to move back to get the mob to follow him and gets out of melee range, the mob just turns onto the pet.  I've always wondered about people who complain about magician pets having poor aggro, I think they're the same people that insist on standing in melee range and wondering why the mob isn't hitting the pet instead of them.<br>
<br>
I agree that pets are pretty bad at positioning mobs.  Particularly if they're the only tank/melee in the group.  But really, so are most warriors (and they don't have any excuse  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
Last night, with a melee in the group, the enchanter was pulling.  It kept the mobs coming in a steady stream.  If a melee runs off before the mob dies to pull something else...  whaddya know, DPS suffers...<br>
<br>
From *tons* of experience.  In exp grinds I can go <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>hours</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and even whole evenings without ever needing to feign.  Yes, feign is amazingly awesomely cool.  But if you've got any intelligence and experience pulling it's very seldom required.  This is even more the case in PoP outdoor zones.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Very</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> few things need split.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>what group do you think is getting better exp, a group with a magician pet tank or a group with a monk tank?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I don't think either one will be doing all that great.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   As to which would do better...

<br>
It's utterly simple.  Mage pets push.  Mob will always hit a person in melee range instead of pet.  If you can't figure out how to position a mob with a pet tank you are speaking from a lack of even trying.<br>
<br>

<br>
This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>especially</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> true in PoP.  Add in cleric lull, enchanter lull and druid harmony and the chances of you actually needing a split (assuming your group has the intelligence to use a person to pull who has the tools) are very slim.<br>

Rogues already had higher AC, if they tried (many don't).  They also generally had higher HP.  Before the nerf I knew of well-equipped rogues that could out-tank me (though for obvious reasons they didn't often try).<br>

<br>
Are you lacking or purposely choose to evade my point? <br>
I didn't say you think air pet &gt; monk. <br>
I am pointing out air pet is not even close to a monk at 61 that is moderately geared. <br>
<br>
The way people advance in EQ is like this:<br>
1) they advance through getting AA and lvl(skill).<br>
2) they advance through sarcificing some time to get money or doing a quest or join a guild to advance through gear. <br>
<br>
Missing either one is stupid.  If you are saying you get your monk to 61(?) and you didn't spend the same time as some other monks to get gear, of course you monk is going to suck and it's not even a surprise that a air pet can solo you in a duel. <br>
<br>
Your poor understand of how a character advances in EQ show how little knowledge of the game you have. <br>
<br>
So before you shows your stupidity by keep saying about air pet ~= monk, please spend the time to invest in gear advancement to bring yourself to the gear lvl of 61. <br>
<br>
Then you will find a lvl appropiate geared monk is a superior tank to 61 air by at least a margin. <br>

So, which is it?  If you've tried with a magician pet as tank and never failed, you're obviously lying in one statement.  Or you're obviously lying in the other.  If you're just gonna make stuff up why do you even bother having a discussion?<br>

<br>
Why does it have to depend on a mage pet to tank to ensure sucess?<br>
While 1 mage pet cannot tank exe, 4 can.  If you are to say 4 pets &gt; monk, it is indeed. But 4 pets can pretty own any class except may be a wizard.  <br>
And about half the time we have a melee tanking, may it be a monk or a war. <br>

Because you implied you have tried it.  And you said you had never failed.  If you haven't tried it, fine.  I didn't figure you had anyway.  But admit to it and move on because you're bordering on incomprehensible with the waffling.<br>

Well, bards can tank better than magicians.  So &quot;bard &gt; magician&quot;.<br>

If any monk is out-tanked by an air pet. His equipment is no doubt sub-par.  It's is save to assume that his weapons also sucked.

<br>
By the way, I'm going <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>purely</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by what I've seen posted on these boards in regards to the tanking ability of magician pets.  My magician only has the bolt and DS spell so far, though soon as I get the 61 pet I'll definitely do some tests.<br>
<br>
And my skill is unqestionable.  I pull stuff by myself that higher-tier guild monks tell me require taggers.  That's raids, though, which really doesn't pertain to this discussion in the slightest.<br>
<br>
Though I will toss in here that over the past month I've tanked Gozzrem and a 1-group takedown of Talendor.  That's all about hp and not much to do with actual tanking ability though.  An enchanter with 5k+ hp could do the same thing.<br>
