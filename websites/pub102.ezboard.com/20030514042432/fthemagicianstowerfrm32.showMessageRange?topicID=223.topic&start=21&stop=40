<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> oh watch druids stil out nuke us and heal better after they &quot;fix&quot; the &quot;priests&quot; ... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Did you read Ylaine's post?  She's 100% correct, in my opinion.  Is it really that important that a druid can outnuke a mage, as long as the mage can out<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> damage</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the druid?  There is a difference between the two, you know.<br>
<br>
An average level 60 druid(i.e. doesn't have Moonfire), can do 1024 damage in 6.5 seconds, for 320 mana.  That's 3.2 damage per mana.  Or 136.5 damage per second, assuming no resists and a 1-second recast time.<br>
<br>
An average level 60 mage(assuming they do have SofB, as my copy was just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> handed</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to me), can do 1005 damage in 6.8 seconds, for 334 mana(assuming no focus bracelet <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> or</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> ring, which isn't likely).  That's 3.0 damage per mana.  Or 128.8 damage per second, assuming no resists and a 1-second recast time.  The mage's numbers look even better if you consider the ruby bracelet and studded ring.<br>
<br>
So yes, a druid can theoretically do about 7dps more than a mage via nuking(if the mage isn't wearing a focus bracelet or ring)... and how much does a mage's pet do?  Should be quite a bit more than 7dps.  And I say &quot;theoretically&quot; because I have yet to find even an exp group, let alone a raid, where I can spend all my mana nuking.   Most of my time is spent healing, or buffing, or pulling, or SOMETHING other than nuking.  Maybe 1-2 nukes per fight, if I'm lucky.<br>
<br>
Now back to the original topic:<br>
<br>
What I'm hoping for, with regards to pets, is the increased attack values.  Anything that helps them do more damage vs. raid-level mobs is a good thing, in my opinion.  Neutral faction would be kinda cool, too. <p><hr width=335 align=LEFT><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=123149">Mathas Oakheart</a> - 60th Hierophant, Bristlebane<br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=123576">Malkar Zauviir</a> - 55th Conjurer, Bristlebane<br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usoulcraver.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Soulcraver</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 3:49:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up! From graffe's</span><hr size=1> Actually it is capisc(e) = Do YOU understand?<br>
<br>
Anyway, it would not have been incomprehensible given VI's past track record that they simply forgot to improve the GV air pet or the MS3 pet.  However, I think this new team purposely left them out to hear feed back from the community after the initial changes and are tweaking them now.<br>
<br>
Just as MS series used to have the ability to summon a decoy pet maybe MS3 will have a chance to summon a level 45 mob from the zone--at a cost of twice the mana--just a thought, but the mana cost increase only comes into effect if you summon such mob.<br>
<br>
Air pet with some monk abilities would be nice but I'd love to see them drop the proc rate from 12 sec to 8 or 9 sec, and increase the damage as they have with the other pets.<br>
<br>
Would also be nice if they added attack value to BO4, making pets hit more. I'd be a very happy mage with those changes.<br>
<br>
Oh and everyone has been looking for a raid pet to hit high level mobs.  It seems to me that RoZ was designed for that, just increase it's HP, level,  and ATK value and you'd be set.  Increase the cost of the cast to 1000 mana so when you summon it you get a full can of whoop ass for as long as it lasts and it can't be exploited with the recast and the mana cost. <p>Sarridon Soulcraver

noonie, druids have always been better nukers<br>

i really don't see what balancing they can do with priests, imo they should all get rez spells and necros too. it's a fundamental design flaw to make 15 classes and give a skill the game absolutely cannot be played without to only 1 of those 15 classes.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvalherji.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valherji</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 4:22:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up!

<br>
Alter your fighting strategy then if you aren't doing well. I can go to ME solo and get great exp there. Id even go so far as to challenge a wiz to see if he can kill a mob faster than me. And maybe its just the wizs on my server, but half the time you see a wiz quading monkeys in ME, he's gonna be the cause of a big train.<br>
<br>
Or I can group with my bard, and get even better exp, something a wiz couldnt do since he's limited to his mana pool but a pet can fight all night long.<br>
<br>
And whoever said Mages can't solo either a) is smoking something (puff, puff, pass man)...... or b) doesn't know how to play his class. The majority of the exp I got in all my level up to 60 and my aa pts was from soloing. Every other level I would stop grouping (unless it was an all 60 exp grind group) because I would get so much better exp soloing than in a crappy little seb group.<br>
<br>
Just because what you are doing specifically doesn't work, doesn't mean there isn't another more efficient and better way of doing things. I have my problems and bitterness with the Mage class, things that I want and should be changed, but overall I love it and wouldn't give it up for any other class.<br>

How about you all wait till they are done with caster balance before you whine? for all you know, Verant might decide to make mages the weakest/strongest class ever. All i am saying is, regardless of their previous record, NO ONE AT ALL knows what the game will be like when they are done. No one. and if you think you know, you don't. that is simply because a) it hasn't happened yet, b) you don't have a time machine, and c) not even Verant is completely sure what they are going for, that's why they want feedback. <br>

<br>
Is your inability to use your pet on a raid due to your ineptness with your pet, your social/raid surroundings, or on code?<br>
<br>
See, I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> do</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> use my pets on raids. The mages of CT raided up to Island 7 (8, whatever) in PoA with pets. People can dungeon crawl with pets, you can kill dragons with a pet's help, some fights are kill it as fast as is inhumanly possible (more pets, the better, since that 4 pet thing is a joke anyways).<br>
<br>
Unless you're doing some AoE Fear/Dispell dragon where it's hardly worth it, you can use your pets on raids. I think I've gotten to the point I'm even going to stop asking whether or not I can use it, and use my own better judgement (which will, in most cases, result in me using my pet).<br>

<br>
- Second floor of Hate. Pathing here is atrocious and buggy. I wouldn't use anything but Rage of Zomm here, if even that.<br>
<br>
- Royals area in Chardok. Di'zok sorcerors cast gflux, alot. From the king room they can throw your pet through the ceiling and into the library. If the library has respawned, you'll get one nasty train.<br>

<br>
I know they are looking at it, some changes were made, yet the burning question is WHEN will they make the other changes.<br>
<br>
I wait for it, and don't see it.<br>
<br>
I am thankful for the new damage tables on pets, and the hope hung out to us more changes on the way. Yet WHEN.<br>
<br>
I know some will say be patiant it is on the way. I know it is, but this is going on not days, or weeks, or months, but YEARS now. <br>
<br>
I hope Verant realizes the amount of time we have played this game UNBALLANCED, and are still playing (by there own statements) UNBALLANCED compaired to melee.<br>
<br>
That is the crux of my issue to me. To those that say give them time, they have had years of time. I don't mind giving them some more time, but please do something even if it is just a once a week update to any baord saying. <br>
<br>
We tested some new changes, maybe ok, maybe not, BUT your not forgotten. News any news weather good or bad will let us know it hasn't been shelved, and why do I get this feeling, that as weeks more drag out, that the ballance maybe done at about the release time for Planes of Power?<br>
<br>
I hope that isn't the case, but June is a week away, and PoP expansion pack is less than 5-6 months away. <br>
<br>
I like updates from Verant, saying that they are looking at the issues, and changes are coming, that is all I am asking for, but Verant needs to remember that as they look at this issue, (and yes I will repeat myself) we who play a castering class are UNBALLNCED by their own admission, and that should be a driving concern that lights a fire under them, to get in changes sooner rather than later.<br>

The upgrade in pet damage is noticable, in parsed data the pets average damage is up about 4-5 points on mobs such as Idol of Rallos zek.  Which is completely reasonable considering average of 10 is um 5 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Still gotta do more tests tho, Rich said they would make pets hit high level mobs better also..That should help as well<br>

Another thing is clickable gear makes a huge difference-BoBC, quest legs/robe etc, anything that is equivalent free mana will make you a better soloer.  Sure we CAN solo at 60, but its much more risky and we sure aren't about to go afk to bed while leaving our pets on a mob to rake in xp all night. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 627<br> <font color=#333333>(5/24/02 2:51:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up!

if you dont know how to chain cast pets you need to learn, its a fundamental mage skill. <br>

It is nice to hear that they are fixing the pets.<br>
<br>
I just hope that they also plan to fix the AAXP skills, specifically Frenzied Burnout. I would like an amazing AAXp skill to make the folks go &quot;WOW!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Seen enchanter and necro dire charm in action, and that ability really gives them a nice power boost. Wizard Manaburn obviously makes people go &quot;WOW!! HOLY..!!&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope the VI development team gives us magi an AAXp ability to wow the crowds and still be be useful to us.<br>
<br>
Let's face it. I can think of no class that was as shafted as us when it comes to AAXP abilities. <p>Natharius Bladestorm

Doubtful pets will ever get nuetral to monsters. That would make going through dugeons FAR to easy.<br>
I know in a previous post(can't seem to find it now) it was mentioned that possibly pet's atk and resists will be improved in order to make them more of an asset on raids. Now if you use a pet their atk is so crappy that some mobs they can't even hit and their spells/procs won't land.<br>

I never understood why some people are saying that? what does it change if pet is neutral, the caster is still aggroable etc...i see only good in putting pets to beta neutral aka : if pet takes weird paths he wont aggro mobs on the way etc etc, you never have to care about which way he takes,honestly that would be so great. And I see no trivialization in anything at first view <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1328">Mistress Lareale Angevent</a></center>

two why even bother having a pet summon spell if all you have to do is bring up pet and run and not worry about pet anymore.<br>
three makes it so you HAVE to learn pet control. And if nothing else learn to KNOW where your pet is at all time.<br>
four you could just let the pet chase the fleeing monster away and never worry if it'll bring adds. thus no pet control needed again.(in areas where it flees and then as pet comes back there are no respawns or such)<br>
