<br>
Really good info though.  For some reason when i pull the back 2 of the front 6, both always come.  Maybe just bad luck *shrug*<br>

This is a really good camp if you get a parner of any other class though.<br>

You can now cast one regardless of whether you have a pet up or not.  It's actually a somewhat decent pulling tool if you have a group made up of casters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
My personal experiences in The Hole (got 52, 53 and 54 there) have made me a believer in the &quot;can't aggro if you can't see me&quot; theory <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I never pull with Malosi as it's just a waste of mana, Banish Summoned hits for full a good 95% of the time and it's cheap in case it is resisted and you do have to cast again.  Anyway, if anybody's interested here's my technique:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1st Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Front Right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  This guy's the easiest to pull, obviously.  Just stand on the ledge, cast banish and then back up and send your pet in.  Try not to let him flee since obviously the whole hall's gonna be up, so overnuke if necessary to keep him from training you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2nd Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Front Left</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: I use a weird strategy on this one.  What I do is follow the ledge all the way to the wall opposite this guy.  If you're wondering, the ledge I'm talking about is the one that seperates the path from the water and has a couple big torches (that you can move through freely) on it.  Anyway, I run very quickly to the wall and he never aggros on me.  Then I cast on him and jump in the water, sending my pet when I get about halfway to the spot where you can jump back out of the water.  It's an unnecessary maneuver as you can really just stand on the ledge (as close to the edge of it as you can) and stand right in front of that elemental and he won't aggro.  You can also use the aforementioned eyeball trick...  just whatever suits you really, he's not a tough pull as it's pretty much impossible to get adds with him.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3rd Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mid Right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  For this one I pretty much stand where the 2nd Elemental spawns.  I position myself in such a way that the pillar next to me blocks my view of every elemental but the one I'm about to pull, and I also make sure that I've got a direct line between me and the corner that I've got to run <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> around</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to get back to where my pet is parked.  I cast and then very quickly zip around that corner.  This may sound crazy, but I swear if the others can't see you cast, they won't aggro.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4th Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mid Left</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  This one's fairly easy, I just stand on the aforementioned ledge and again position myself that the other two can't see me.  Only thing you have to be careful of is that the one you're pulling isn't obscured by the pillar next to him at all, otherwise &quot;you cannot see your target.&quot;<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 5th Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Back Right</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:  This is essentially a reprise of the 3rd Elemental.  Position yourself in the area that the 2nd Elemental spawns, and make sure that the rear left elemental cannot see you, and also make sure that you'll be able to quickly zip around that little corner and run back to your pet.  It also helps tremendously if you chant &quot;can't see me, can't aggro me&quot; over and over again.  Trust me.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6th Elemental (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Back Left</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->: Do whatever the heck you want on this one, the hall's empty <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Some additional tips:<br>
<br>
When you're engaged with one of these guys, sit up on that ledge while you med.  While on the floor itself, the ledge is a very annoying piece of geometry that will most likely obstruct your view when you're trying to cast and the elemental begins to flee, and this zone <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> loves</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to throw &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; at you.  If a fleeing elemental has enough life he'll be pretty quick, and having a spell interrupted because the ledge blocked your view can mean the difference between killing it and having it run all the way down to the crusaders below and forcing you to zone.  With an Earth pet this almost never happens though, but it's still a possibility.<br>
<br>
Try your best to get the place solo.  A partner is 100% unnecessary unless adding them to your group allows you to pull more.  The two crusaders and extra warrior that are down the stairs at the end of the hall will become potential kills if you have a partner.  If you get a good group you can pull all the way to the tower (well, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> can't <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) which means several more crusaders and two golems.  This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> very</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> nice, if you can handle it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to take a few hits.  They do hit hard, but it's nothing that phantom armor won't fix up for you by the next spawn.  Don't freak out if one smacks you around while you're trying to med.  Just back off and sit back down again.<br>
<br>
Use pathing to your advantage.  Imagine yourself at the end of the hall facing back toward the beginning.  If you've got something on you and your pet is dead or dying, run straight down and jump over the ledge and into the water, hang a left and swim straight through the zone.  Mobs can't just jump in the water after you, they have to run all the way around the path to the edge of the floor.  This is generally enough time for you to survive.  I once had a golem beat the crap out of me and take me down to half a bubble of life.  I was still able to make it.  And no, you can't die from drowning while you zone (I was worried about that myself, but your air bar freezes just fine no matter how long it takes for you to zone, must be handled client-side).<br>
<br>
21 minute spawn time here.  Kill the first one and start a timer.  I find it best to kill one every 2 to 2.5 minutes after that.  That's usually enough time to med up and let pet heal.  DS on pet lasts for about 6 minutes so that's generally enough time to kill two on one DS.<br>
<br>
Now you may be luckier than me but after a few hours of this I usually find myself falling behind.  My 6 minute or so break after the final spawn has dwindled to about 2 and a half and my mana is down to like half a bubble at the beginning of a cycle, with pet not even full.  If this happens, don't be afraid to just med to full and allow pet to regen.  Once you get the hang of it, a fully popped hall isn't anything to be afraid of.  <br>
<br>
Try to make sure you get at least two full Banish hits on each mob (roughly 1k damage), this is enough to ks your pet and you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> really</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> want the full exp in this place.<br>
<br>
One last thing.  If anybody ever figures out what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Holy Dirt of Brell</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Living Heart of a Brell Minion</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are, you be sure to tell me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

pull them with malosi. this lowers their resists (if you dont do this you will get at least partially resisted 95% of the time) and is relatively low aggro. pull them as far back as possible, nuke twice with char, and your done.  with malosi on the elementals, pet (use earth btw) was able to keep them rooted so they didn't run. xp drops off quite a bit at 54, they went from being about 20% light blue to 80% <p><table border="10"

It's not resisted nearly as much.  Plus, Banish x 2 = 450 mana.  Malosi + Char x 2 = 695.  That's a savings of 1470 mana per spawn cycle. <p><BR><CENTER><hr size=1 WIDTH=75%>

<br>
When u pull the two in the end ALWAYS take the left one u will get an ADD very rare.<br>
If u get an add just zone saves u alot of mana.<br>
<br>
To break the cruscader spawn solo.<br>
Think its doable at lvl 51 but i tried it at 53 its sorta tough.<br>
ok heres the going get high earth pet (58 hitter or 56, with staff shall be easier ;-)).<br>
<br>
Clear the 6 spawns in 12 min (1 every 2min as mentioned in less than 14 min).<br>
Then med to full.<br>
Have pet up use a eye of zomm (or bracer) to look around the corner downstairs.<br>
IF u see a cruscader dont move if not wait til one shows up.<br>
<br>
When this wandering one is leaving and u can`t see it anymore move eye into room,<br>
look left target warrior.<br>
If u get warior targetted wait til both come send pet on warrior<br>
debuff him and NUKE the HECK out of him as fast as possible!! When u get him killed<br>
your pet is low 20-40% (in my tests) then just wait til he is at 15-20 start chaining<br>
a new pet (hope u all know how that works ;-)) send on cruscader ds nuke once and BO3<br>
nuke maybe once more b4 pet gets too low.<br>
In case u get warrior NOT targetted wait til u see em coming up then simply go zone.<br>
When u get back in there is sorta pathing BUG in 90% of the time that ONE elemental<br>
didnt move back to his spawn instead he is in the tunnel simply go down there and pull.<br>
Never got the other aggroed that way just beware of the wandering one.<br>
When u got enough mana and time (the spawn time seems to change after every patch<br>
bec i was sure it was 27min last time but now it seems bit less like 24 minutes :-/) u<br>
can do other cruscader bec he is single pulled easily with eye of zomm single now.<br>
<br>
I can suggest this SOLO but its sorta tough and allows NO errors i also pull with the<br>
LOWEST debuff the lvl 24 (?)one malise bec others are too much mana and use ONLY<br>
banish summoned for nukes.<br>
<br>
I would suggest the camp of the 9 spawns as partner camp. As I said i love duoing with<br>
druid i leveled him from 39 to 44 while i got like 4 yellows in 53 !!!!! So he will thank u f4.<br>
And u have the advantage of having a second mana pool plus some nice buffs.<br>
(regen for pet str etc pp makes it all easier a bit plus they get GREAT melee debuff<br>
reduces downtime by FAR!!!! not sure on the name but makes cruscaders hit for double<br>
70 instead of double 115 hehe) shammie should also work well but IM HELL scared<br>
of pathing in shammie pets (dunno why we whine about pathing they really have to ;-)).<br>
<br>
Also if u are 53 xp with druid partner at 40-44 with 9spawns is better than 6 solo.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps<br>
