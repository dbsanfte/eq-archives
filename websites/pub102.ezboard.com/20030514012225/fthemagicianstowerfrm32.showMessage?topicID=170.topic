<br>
Now I just want to say that I am in NO WAY a master of this Class! So my ideas are just pure speculation! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But I can make an educated guess as to what we want.<br>
<br>
First: Nukes.<br>
<br>
I think it makes sense thta our nuke capabilities are limited, I'll even accept that we get no cold based nukes. With trying to land Malosini and pumping out Mod Rods, we may have little time for anything else. Fire and Magic is enough for me. (but then I'm a novice)<br>
<br>
What I woudl suggest is that the Levels we dont' get new Nukes (29, 39) that we get more manna efficient ones of the same max damage. IE: level 29 we get Improved Shock of Spikes, 176 Dmg for 90 manna?<br>
<br>
Or something to that effect...<br>
<br>
Now the real issue: PETS!!!<br>
<br>
Firstly, I'd recocmend a line of buffs for our pets startign at Level 49 (no real problem with them pre here) for ATK, Dex, Str and Agi.<br>
<br>
Say for example...<br>
<br>
Transon's Elemental Prowess<br>
Level 49<br>
Manna: 250<br>
Effect: + ATK and Str by 100<br>
Buff stacks with Burnout<br>
<br>
Transon's Elemental Tone<br>
Level 55<br>
Manna: 250<br>
Effect: + Agi and Dex by 100<br>
Buff stacks with Burnout and the former spell.<br>
<br>
However, the biggest problem is the difference between pet and mob levels. So... I suggest...<br>
<br>
Transon's Elemental exp-grind.<br>
Level 51<br>
Manna: 500<br>
Effect: + Pet Level by 5<br>
Stacks with Elemental Mastery Staves.<br>
<br>
That wouldreally fix most of pur problems with pets asside from... Pet pathing AND pets resistances to AOEs.<br>
<br>
So, to fix them...<br>
<br>
I'd suggest making all pets inidfferent to every NPC. Of course, Verant coudl include some exceptions like maybe in certain Planes.<br>
<br>
Hwoever, due to AOE damage, there's little we can do.<br>
<br>
It's not feesable to allow su to buff our pets Poison and Disease resistances ebcause we have no authority in that area... even if we can Malise Poison.<br>
<br>
However, it is feesable to allow Magicians to add SV Heat, Cold and minor Magic to our pets.<br>
<br>
Example spells:<br>
<br>
Magi'Kot's Barrier of the Furnace<br>
Level 49<br>
Manna: 100<br>
Effect: + 100 S v Cold and + 20 S V Magic, - 20 S v Heat<br>
<br>
Magi'Kot's Barrier of Ice<br>
Level 49<br>
Manna: 100<br>
Effect: + 100 S v Heat and + 20 S V Magic, - 20 S v Cold<br>
<br>
I'd make these spells ordinary drops from zones liek Fungus and any other dungeon type places where non-uber guilds can enter.<br>

The mana cost on some of the spells are way to high and they would have to last extremely long for that cost in mana. That would go against everything that Verant is trying to avoid. Uber pets that people can afk experience with for about a hour. Also think of what the lvl buff and atk buffs would do to the epic pet? The pet is already out damaging knight class on highend raids (when useable). <br>
<br>
That is why I feel multiple buffs are not the way to go and across the board lvl increases are needed. The dex and attack buffs are nice but honestly they can give us summoned items that we can give to our pets that will do the same thing.<br>
<br>
As far as nukes go.....Magicians should have wizard nuke output. We should be nuking as fast as wizards are with there nukes since we are so limited in our nuke line of spells. Also I feel wizard DD should be raise to a point that no class is even close. Wizards are Invoker/Evokers that have spent there entire life studing to use the very forces of elemental magic to do destructive force. Rogues and Monks should be 80 to 90 DPS lower then wizards even over a 5min battle.  Wizards should be the standard in which all spell casting damage classes are measured. Magician nukes are way to weak and Wizard nukes need major upgrades.   Wizards at 60 should be nuking for 3k with normal spells and 4k to 4500 with ancient spells. Magicians should be at 2200dd at lvl 60 with normal spells and near 2800 with ancient spells. <br>
<br>
However I know this is never going to happen and in the new expansion I am sure druids will be out nuking wizards. I see wizards get so up in arms when magicians ask for any improvements in nukes, yet I here them say nothing about druids. The last class they should fear of stepping on there toes is Magicians and should be more conserned about druids that already have spells that are just about equal in power.<br>
<br>
Moonfire out does all but two wizard nukes and of those two it is only one tenth of a percentage point behind in effectiveness. Something is wrong with that!  Wizards and Magicians have the least amount of utility of all spell casting classs and they should be compensated with being the premier damage dealer in the game. If Verant doesnt want to give Wizards and Magicians there due when it comes to damage then they really need to start handing out lots of utility because right now both classes are lacking and the damage output doesnt make up for that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eriol>Eriol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(4/7/02 12:58:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What would fix pets?</span><hr size=1> I agree with you completely Wezloc.  See my comments about DD damage in &quot;TABOO TOPIC: Caster versus Priest Balance&quot;.<br>
<br>
Wizards SHOULD be the best nukers around by a substantial margin for all the reasons you stated here.  Then upgrade mages to way above druids, but still away from Wizards.  A Druid, with all their utility, should NOT be coming close to either class.<br>
<br>
As for the pets, I agree that lvls should go up substantially to lower resists on their spells.  Earth root just doesn't work.  Everything should be better.<br>

<br>
Alright, the manna cost is high, so then lower it! I'm no Verant representative saying this is how it would be! It's all speculation!<br>
<br>
And verant's Image of the Wizard (like their image of magicians not beign masters of the elements, hence no codl based nukes) si that they shoudl have the most manna-efficient and fast nukes, not the highest damage output, which they should easily have with Garrison's Fiery something-or-other. It's just veru inefficient when compared to Sunstrike.<br>
<br>
I'd doubt we'd get +dex and ATK summons. Targettable pet only buffs are more likely since all our weapon/armour summons are player-friendly and Verant has a thign against putting real magical attributes to them (the onyl exception is the summoned focus items which add minor HP and manna)<br>
<br>
So, we've had the suggestion of summoned weapons with + stats, antyhing else??? Perhpase just a  core change? I've noticed not a lot mentioned about the lack of magician defence when not with a pet. (although this woudl be mitigated with the 1-second casting times I've heard about) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usscale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sscale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#333333>(4/7/02 11:40:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=170.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Okay, some repeats, but basically the jist of it...</span><hr size=1> I would go for the summoned items with stats, make them pet only, so they can put stats on them that are actually making a difference.<br>
