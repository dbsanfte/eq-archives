It is my first intelligence-based caster and I am in the position of being able to twink it pretty well.  I am seeking advice on two equipment slots, wrist and shoulders.  I am having trouble reaching equipment decisions due to the summonable focus items for these slots.  After reading many posts on this and other mage boards, it would seem that many of you use the summoned items far into your careers.  The two most often mentioned seem to be bracelets for extra damage and mantles that increase buff duration.  My first question is this:  do you also have non-summoned items for these slots or do you simply summon for these slots before each playing session?  I’m sure that you do have specific raid gear; I’m asking more in relation to every-day play at early, mid, and later levels.<br>
<br>
For one of the wrist slots, I intend to purchase a Bracelet of Comprehension.  Should it be advisable to purchase for the other two slots, I was thinking of either a Golden Bracer (which provides Extended Range II) or a Golden Chitin Bracer for the second wrist slot.  In the shoulder slot, I was focusing on the Fancy Velvet Mantle (which also provides Extended Range II).  If I purchased the mantle, I would go with the GCB over the GB for the wrist slot, not wanted to pay to duplicate Extended Range II.  Other options for the shoulders would be Jade Inlaid Spaulders or an Elder Wolf Hide.  (I have been searching for both the Piranha Scale Mask – for the shoulders in spite of its name – and the Tainted Skin Shroud, but thus far have never found them for sale in the bazaar on my server, Lanys.  Both of these would be superior to all of the other shoulder slot choices that I’ve mentioned if I could simply find them.)<br>
<br>
I would appreciate any advice you have to offer on these focus item slots or any other you might want to mention.  I don’t want to purchase items that are not needed, but do want to outfit my new character as best as I am able.<br>
<br>
I am really excited about trying my hand at a new type of character and want to do it as intelligently as possible from the start.  Thank you for your time.  It is appreciated!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calfhigh>Calfhigh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#333333>(12/30/02 8:20:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Summoned vs. Purchased Equipment</span><hr size=1> at 65 i still use the ring earring and bracer when ever im not in resist gear those 3 slots i change in when i need resists.<br>

If we are just xp group, casting fast isn't as important.<br>
<br>
The bracer and earring are equipped nearly all the time unless I really need resists.  The exception to that is when I'm doing ToV raids because I'm busy with Mod rods, damage shields, CoH on the puller, etc. and I only nuke the gating mobs so I don't bother much with the DD focus items.<br>

If you are a very young mage(44 or lower) you can get some very nice non-summoned items to give you these very same focus effects, but from 44 on, unless you are part of an uber guild, count on using the summoned stuff. The stats on the summoned stuff aint too bad, at 61 they all have very good AC and 20 hps/mana. Not great for bragging contests, but with all 3 items that is +60 hps/mana. If I had to choose one to give up, I'd give up the ring, the extra damage and the mana savings are priceless. The faster casting is nice, but I could live without it if I had to, but I don't since Im a mage  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The Ear ring has a 15% mana savings on all DD spells.  Nothing else has a 15% savings on nukes.  Nothing can replace it.  Use it anytime you will be casting DD spells.  <br>
<br>
The Bracer has a 25% improved damage.  Get an improved damage I item until you get the bracers spells.  Then use them, use your money for other spots.  The increased damage will result in less casts per kill which is less mana per kill.  Probably more effective that the Ear ring since we nuke so much.    <br>
<br>
The Ring has spell haste.  Wear it all times.  In emergencies, you need that extra time savings to cast more spells.  Since it is an emergency, you can not plan for it, so wear it all the time.   <br>
<br>
The shoulder item has a 30% extended enhancement.  This makes you shield line, phatom armor line, and damage shield lines last up to 30% longer.  Since you nearly always have these spells up, a 30% increase in time means your cast it 30% fewer times which results in less mana spent per cast.  Always have an extended enhancement item on when casting these spells.  You can swap the item when casting these spells, but I cast a damage shield so often, I just leave it in the spot.  Once I get a shoulder FT item, I will have to start swapping.  <br>
<br>
The neck items has a 10% reagant conservation.  I really just swap this item when casting a pet, and only if I think bout.  Most of our spells use cheap gems and the savings is very minor.  <br>
<br>
In addition, I would recommend a Mana Preservation Item.  All spells except Pet summons benefit from this 10% savings.  The black alloy mediallion has level II of this effect and +5 int as well and can be bought for ~ 700pp.  You will be good till your 49th level. This will affect the same spell lines listed in the shoulder item, but will also on all heals and non pet summons.  With a horse and this item, you can summon all your food, water, weapons, pet weapons, vision enhancement, dimensional bags, and pet armor and be nearly full mana when finished instead of medding for 5 minutes.  <br>
<br>
I would also recommend an summoning efficiency item.  The enshrouded veil has summoning efficiency III plus some mana.  It also can be bought ~ 700pp.<br>
<br>
A summoning haste item helps get a new pet off after the old one dies.  The robe of elements is a decent robe of get Brell's Girdle and be set until 65.  <br>
<br>
At different times, I used my heal spell alot.  An improved healing item can really help in these situations.  I used a Book of Obulus in the secondary slot.  It runs about 2000pp and has a nice int bonus as well.  <br>
<br>
But the most important purchase, a Horse.  If you can afford the 100k horse, you will have mana regeneration while casting, no sit agro, and nothing will ever catch you.  If you can't afford that horse, get the low end horse.  You still get the mana regen and the no sit aggro. <br>
<br>
Save some money for KEI.  As a mage, even with a horse, you will always be oom and medding.  KEI will reduce that time drastrically.  With a horse, you may never go OOM and make you a killing machine. <br>
<br>
Another recommendation is to use a 1hb.  The epic and several other great stat weapons are 1hb.  Goto the bazaar and find the lowest delay 1hb weapon you can find and use it.  I used 1h pericing to start.  Then tried 2hb for a while for greater damage.  It became obvious that I would not be able to keep either maxed so I switched back to pericing.  Start with 1hb with a low delay to help keep your offense and 1hb skill maxed.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duveen>duveen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 4:59:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Thanks again</span><hr size=1> Thank you, Dabrighter2, for that great post covering so many bases.

That is a great idea.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I also appreciate your comments on piercing vs. 1HB.  Thus far, I have just been using my summoned dagger.  Now, at level 8, I have managed to keep my offense and defense pretty well maxed, but piercing seems to be lagging behind.  When I played a cleric, the class only received a maximum of four skill-ups in 1HB after level 3 or 4 -- can't remember which -- so it would rise at a snail's pace.  Do the mage weapons skills work the same way?  I could easily purchase a 1HB weapon and there are some good ones with low delay pretty cheap.  However, most mage guides that I have read have indicated that I won't be stepping in and tanking much -- if any -- after about level 13 or 14.  If true, are my offensive skills, including a weapon skill, pretty much moot?  Maybe I have been misinformed and there are &quot;mage tanks&quot; running around Norrath at level 65! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Anyone have personal experience on this either way?<br>

They will no doubt help make me a better mage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dabrighter2>Dabrighter2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 7:55:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Thanks again</span><hr size=1> I always tried to keep my combats skills maxed out and always kept my best skilled weapon in my hand.  I would start out letting the pet tank.  I would then get in melee for a few rounds most every kill to get a couple of swings and defense checks, just depending on how tough the mobs were.  However, because I switched to 2HB for about 5 levels, my 1H pericing would rise, but I could never get it back to its max.  At level 33, I was fighting Broon and Droon in East Karana.  I would get Broon really low on HP to get him to run and then back my pet off.  I would chase him across E. Karana swinging away till we got close to Droon's spawn point before I let my pet finish him.  That was good for ~15 skillups or so and helped close my gap from my max.  Then I went to SOL B.  After being there for awhile, I noticed I could not melee the goblins very well at all.  I decided to use my Stein of Moggok in my primary slot just switch to a weapon when I got into combat.  It wasn't very long before I noticed I was taking a lot more damage the few times I got combat that I was before.  <br>
<br>
I looked at my logs to see why this was happening.  I noticed the following:<br>
<br>
  1.  The first hit was nearly always at max.  <br>
  2.  The first five hits averaged larger that the next five hits.<br>
<br>
Since I was now switching from the stein to my weapon, I thought that might explain 1. and 2.  So I switched back to my weapon in my hand.  After this switch, I was doing much better, but still was taking more damage than before.  I looked at the logs again and noticed that while 1. was still true, 2 was no longer true.  I then turned my attack on at the start of every combat and sure enough that first hit dropped to an average hit.  <br>
<br>
From this I decided the following:<br>
<br>
  1. Having you attack on when hit mitigates damage.<br>
  2. Having a much higher attack value mitigates damage.<br>
<br>
Having decided this, I went to the bazaar and bought a picering weapon with a high INT on it.  This weapon, just happend to have a much lower delay than my previous weapon. <br>
<br>
Later, I was using the back pet off  the giant while it was running and stike it from behind to get skillups.  I was amazed at how much the lower delay helped get more strikes which led to more skillups.  <br>
<br>
For mages to maintain their max combat offense skills, the lower delay is really important.  Mages get 5 skillups per level, but are not nearly as effective as the cleric's 4  skillups be level.  Must be on a different combat chart.  <br>
<br>
To this day, when I am in a combat situation, I have my best skilled weapon in my primary hand and attack turned on, even though I very seldom get into combat.  <br>
<br>
(Last week, I trained my 1hb to 10 and then beat on of a fleeing giant for ~ an hour and WOOT I got my 1hb up to 18. {I hope to someday have my epic in my hand})   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=1xtro1>1xtro1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 11:22:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1144.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Thanks again</span><hr size=1> At 64 I use bracer always,  earing 99% of the time and I swap ring out only if I'm just nuking like once or twice a mob and time is not a factor.

I purchased a smoldering brand before the start of play today and then did levels 8-12 this afternoon.  Now at 12, I have offense and 1HB maxed out, with defense just behind.  This weapon, while sporting a good damage/delay ratio of 9/22, really isn't a good use of the primarey hand slot long-term.  It lacks stats that will help a mage do what he does best.  Thus, I have put together a list of 1HB weapons that would be nice, including the Fright Imbued Battlestaff, the Mootogo Focus Staff, the Di'zok Scepter of Authority, and the Akhevan Scepter.  While I should be able to afford them all, the hard part will be finding them in the bazaar.  Some of these also appealed to my cleric and I always kept an eye open on that character when in the bazaar.  To date, I have never seen any of these weapons for sale!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :| --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/indifferent.gif ALT=":|"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Still, I will use the Smoldering Brand until I get lucky enough to find an upgrade.<br>

Thanks again for your time.  Thanks again to everyone for their comments as well.

I would say outside <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a little bit of tanking is useful well beyond 50, even more so if you get a rune item.<br>
