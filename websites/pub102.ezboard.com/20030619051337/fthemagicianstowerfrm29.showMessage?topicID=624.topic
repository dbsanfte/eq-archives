Once I learn to reclaim pets <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>during</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the fight, as opposed to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet get lost</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I will have chain pretty much mastered.<br>
<br>
I have read of another interesting technique called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aggro Kiting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  The idea is to choose an opponent that cannot outrun you or your pet, and get them good and pissed off at you, so they chase you and ignore the pet, and the pet clobbers them from behind.<br>
<br>
I am interested in more detailed advice about this technique.<br>
<br>
First of all, what is the best way to hold aggro?  In fact, this brings up another question whose answer I am unclear on, but does a single strike of a fast nuke generate more hate because it is fast, or is it simply the maximum damage of the nuke that determines the hate?  That is, do faster spells generate more hate only because they can be chain cast faster, or is there some innate hate bonus due to the speed of the spell?<br>
<br>
Seems like one way to build and hold hate might be to start the fight with an earth pet, do some nuking before the earth pet is killed, and then summon water for the backstabbing.  I should have a lot of hate built up, and it should chase me for a while.<br>
<br>
But then what?  With the ponee I can stay well ahead, so what I do I do?  Nuke every once in a while?  Wait for it to turn on the pet and then nuke?<br>
<br>
Seems like running in a circle might be best.<br>
<br>
And lastly, can I really solo anything that I could not by simply chaining pets?  Certainly if a creature chews up pets too fast then aggro kiting might work, but then there seems little margin for error.  Compared to chaining, the pet is doing more melee damage, the mob is taking at least some more nukes, but damage shields don't count.  I am also running instead of medding, as I would be if I were chaining.<br>
<br>
Seems like with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velocity</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> I would like to keep a single pet for the whole kite, with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Burnout 4</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  But do I wind up aggro kiting with multiple pets?<br>
<br>
I am interested in your observations, ideas, and opinions regarding this apparently little used technique.<br>

But the idea still works with just yourself.<br>
<br>
1.  Use water pet, give it velocity or expedience, turn OFF taunt (very important) and normal buff.  Don't bother with DS unless you have clicky robe.<br>
<br>
2.  Don't use rain spells.  DD only, the biggest one you have.  It will cause a ton of aggro, stay close to mob but out of its reach and it will follow you.<br>
<br>
3.  Mob will chase you around, pet will continue to beat on it.  Make sure you are in an area where you won't get adds and just run around back and forth.  <br>
<br>
4.  When mob stops to hit pet, Nuke it again so it runs after you.  Eventually mob will wear down and pet can finish it off.<br>
<br>
When I did this with a druid partner, druid would snare and we would get about 100 yards apart and ping-pong the mob back and forth (/cheer Bolt spell) while pet beat on it and we took turns taking aggro.<br>
<br>
Now the hard part is finding a good spot to do this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Being a master summoner, you know that when a pet dies it transfers no extra aggro to you.  You will be competing with your pet for the attention of the mob.<br>
<br>
    Some of the highest aggro spells in the game are spells that magicians cannot wield.  Mesmerize, Tash, Snare, Stun are all excellent taunt mechanisms.  The highest aggro spells we have, on the other hand, are nukes, and the bigger the better.......  BUT big nukes suck your mana down FAST.  Really, though, unless you plan on blowing half a mana bar or more competing with your pet for aggro (and unless you have a horse, you aren't gaining any benefit from meditating), this method can be problematic at best.<br>
<br>
    A couple things I can add that may help you.  Using a combination of aggro kiting and reclaim chaining will address any mana efficiency issues, and a fresh pet will give you that much of a head start before the mob (inevitably) turns on your pet.  Boots of Bladecalling could be useful for adding more hate just when the mob turns on the pet, and will allow the next pet to do more damage before the mob gets annoyed at Jobaner again.  Snare glands can be helpful, but they are limited in charges (10).<br>
<br>
    Contrary to virtually every other class in the game when solo, magicians solo most efficiently by limiting the aggro to themselves.  Also, we are uniquely equipped to do just that.  There is likely no mob in the game we could effectively solo using kiting methods that we couldn't go and duo with another magician using either regular pet chaining tactics, or IR chaining.<br>
<br>
    I have had extremely limited success with aggro kiting, and I doubt I'm alone in this.  I wish you luck and success, and if you figure out something that I haven't, by all means post it here. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=pissed1vi2soe>Pissed1VI2SOE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 250<br> <font color=#333333>(8/8/02 6:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  comment</span><hr size=1> Was agro kiting last night, my bard and necro w/ pet.  Here's how I kept agro 100% of the time with the pet taunt on and pet doing massive damage, while I was just tossing in low nuks.<br>
<br>
Sing the only bard dd to get mobs attention (alot less dmg than a pet hits for 24dmg atm), sing selo's to drag him to the pet.  Sing snare when you get close, then twist snare and dd.  Pet was owning the mob doubling for 36's (that I saw), while I was only twisting 1 nuke and 1 snare.  Snare is a huge agro, the bad thing about a druid is that their snare lasts sooooo long and they lose agro after about 100 damage is done.  Yeah I could have thrown in 2 dd's per snare but then I would chance losing agro and/or getting hit.<br>
<br>
xp was actually pretty good, since I never had to sing heal or mana, necro is lblue to me his pet was way green and mobs were even cons, took about 3 minutes/kill but it gave better xp than me kiting 12  low blues (not light blues, just low blues) for 3 minutes then having to sing heal and mana for 2 more.  It just hurts toooo much to take hits from xp mobs as a bard at least. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucjell.showPublicProfile?language=EN>cjell</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(8/13/02 8:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: comment</span><hr size=1> I have been doing this a fair amount in GD lately.  I will pull with a bolt spell from long range, manage to get another bolt spell launched before the giant arrives.  Then, while on horse I just run about...and by the time the giant turns his attention to the pet, it is almost dead.  <br>
<br>
Before fight, I will of course cast expedience on the pet, so that he is able to keep up with the giant.  Works better if the pet is sow'ed with a potion, but that makes it a bit more costly.  Also, it is a good idea to run in straight lines forming a box pattern if possible, rather then a circle, at least with giants and their huge aggro range.  I guess it is just the fact that my main is a 56 bard, that I just love to kite stuff...hehe<br>

Start with earth, nuke while the pet tanks, then chain out your best water vocerate.  BO3, Velocity, /taunt off, and beat cheeks.<br>
<br>
Also, I use a Bioluminescent orb (click cast blind.  5 sec cast, lasts 29 sec) right when I'm about to chain a pet.  This makes the mob run off and gives me time to buff the new pet before I start aggro kiting the mob.  The water vocerate will kill ALOT faster if you BO3 and velocity him.<br>
<br>
I have been killing the Allizewsaur in OOT by using this method.  He's lvl 50, 15k HP, double hits for 130 (very fast too), but he's a slow runner and he does not cast.  If I nuke him down, I'm nearly OOM when he dies.  If I make a single earth pet, nuke with BoBC, chain water and aggro-kite I can finish him off in like 4-5 min and end the fight at full health and 95% mana.  Not bad for a lvl 50 15k HP mob.  Also, he drops lewt from the 1st floor of hate.  I got a diamond, a blue diamond, and a star ruby earring within 5 kills the other day.  He is a 6 min respawn with an occasional greenie goblin PH. <p><B><center><font color=green><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36994">Baron Eandori Raintree Arch Mage</a><br>No guild ATM, I'm the lone mage on Sol Ro.</center></font></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umagejordi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mage Jordi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(8/27/02 6:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Aggro Kiting with Pets?</span><hr size=1> if using Bioluminescent Orb, i would nuke one big to make mob aggro me in the beginning..and cast blind on it...then the fight will look like fear kit :P  I use this alot when I was hunting named in TT long time ago (only me and ranger...err...my epic pet too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )<br>

<br>
I choose the MS pet over Water for faster mobs, the cast time it takes for water can sometimes give the mob a lead that is hard to close. Secondly MS pets have a lower aggro due to lack of casting and no backstabs, that makes them perfect for this style of kite. <p><center><img src="http://spin.emich.edu/sig/ag1.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2164<br> <font color=#333333>(9/1/02 2:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=624.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Aggro Kiting with Pets?</span><hr size=1> Some thoughts:<br>
<br>
This tactic rather nullifies the utility of boots of bladecalling or any right click nuke.  Gaining aggro with them is extremely difficult.<br>
<br>
Magicians have no low mana cost spells that are high aggro that I can think of.  I would think your best bet for holding aggro would be to use the &quot;bolt flinging&quot; technique.  You hit something from far away with a bolt then before the mob has time to engage you hit it again as hard as you can (two scars or something works nicely).  The problem here is that you're wasting time that your pet could be engaged and dealing damage.  It seems to me this type of strategy is best used when you are really worried about pet health and can't chain pets.  (IE you are low level or have your epic..  Incidently, this strategy is much more difficult with the epic pet.  You would probably have to leave off burnout if you wanted aggro on you rather than the pet.) <p><center>
