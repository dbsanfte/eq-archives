Just so you know, i avoided asking anything about root or clarity.  We all know this wont happen, they have said it many times before, asking this would make him not think seriously about some of our bigger problems when we are whining about little things like that...Here ya go tell me what you think...im still working on a conclusion =)<br>
<br>
--------------------<br>
<br>
Absor,<br>
<br>
Because of the class tweaking going on I posted a thread on a few good mage forums to get the general consensus on what they think could be done to help our class post 50.  No mages are arguing we are powerful enough in the 1-50 game, but when it comes to 50+ on raids we aren’t always first on the list of necessities.  So here they are…<br>
<br>
Post 50 Pets:<br>
<br>
Since post 50+ pets don't progress along the same growth curve as pre-50 pets and in some areas pets are prohibited by groups, mages need some more abilities to fit into the post 50 world. COTH is good, but it is not enough, especially since it is a rare drop and level 55. Mages need some fixes along the lines of other classes. When the power of other pet classes pets was decreased, they were tweaked with the addition of new spells to compensate such as hp/mana transfer. We are not asking for a clarity here or any mana regen at all (it would be nice) since you have said it wont ever happen.  Not overpowering, but useful to groups when pets and DOT's were not of service. Mages need a similar tweak.  There are some suggestions further in the letter.<br>
<br>
Post 50th Fire Pets:<br>
<br>
The reason that these pets need to be fixed is because the post 50th spells should have, in the very least, kept the Magician's power status quo compared to lvl 1-50. By replacing our standard Fire Pet with the Wizzie Fire Pet Verant has taken away a pet that had a lot of uses in various situations and replaced it with a pet that has limited uses in very certain situations. Effectively, this has lowered the Magician's power post 50th because the variety in pet summons has actually gone down because of this. <br>
Suggestions: Make 52 and 58 fire pet non-aggressive pets, they are wizards after all…no wizard runs up to something to try and cast on it and melee it at the same time, so if this is really a wizard pet, make it stand back and cast.  Also it has been suggested to give this pet the lvl 49 fire pet DS and maybe lower its Hp’s because it will not be fighting and will die fast this wouldn’t be too overpowering if tweaked a little.<br>
<br>
Specialization:<br>
<br>
Up until Kunark it was very hard to decide on what you should specialize in because many of the good high lvl Damage spells were of both.  Since Kunark came out almost every high level DD that we get is Evocation.  We are mages, not wizards, we are Conjurers and Summoners post 50, why are we casting Evocation spells, that’s a wizards job. Please changes some of the post 50+ spells to Conjuration based.<br>
<br>
Group Damage Shields:<br>
<br>
You have taken under consideration making shaman group buffs more mana efficient.  I hope that you take Mage 50+ group damage shields under consideration for this too.  As it is, it takes less mana to cast DS on your group members than just to cast this spell.  <br>
Additional Idea: If it can not have its mana efficiency tweaked, is it possible to include pets in the casting of this spell? That would more than make up for the extra mana cost. <br>
<br>
Pets in Group Spells:<br>
<br>
Although I am not sure if it can’t or won’t be done many mages would love to see our pets and all other pets included in-group buffs and bard songs.  Not sure on exactly the specifics on if this would make our pets too strong, but maybe they would be a welcomed addition in place of a tank for once.<br>
<br>
Rain spells:<br>
<br>
Remove pets as eating a wave in Rain type spells... now that they are PC’s this may be easier than it was before to do.<br>
As is currently Rain spells are resisted a lot more often than any other DD, this grouped with pets eating a wave of it puts it in the back of many mages spell books (if they even bought it).  We are not asking for it to be on par with our other Fire and Magic based DD’s on resistances, but somewhere a little closer?<br>
<br>
New Spell Ideas:<br>
<br>
Pet Heals: 2 new pet heals... 1 at 39 ... 1 at 50 (300 at 39 with slightly better mana to hp ratio than level 20 spell.. 500 at 50 again with slightly better mana to hp ratio than 39.. or Make level 20 spell increase in effectiveness as level increases.<br>
<br>
New Summon Ideas:<br>
<br>
Shard of the Core: Great idea for a spell the +poison resistance’s are a godsend on some raids, until you realize its No Drop which makes it a very small increase in power over previous resistance dagger summons.  Was this a mistake making it no drop?  <br>
<br>
More Resistance’s Summons: They are great for raids and overall period, even if it means adding some resistance’s onto our existing 50+ summons and making them trade-able.<br>
<br>
Weapon Summons: A couple good post 1 Handed weapon summonings.   Place a level restriction on them as with some items with possible proc..(Kunark and Velious weapons should warrant a change like this.. More for CR than anything)<br>
<br>
An upgrade to Mod rod that we get at lvl 49:<br>
Modulators Rod<br>
Mana Cost 250:<br>
Takes 500 HP and gives back 350 mana <br>
Conclusion -500 HP for 100 mana.<br>
Numbers adjusted appropriately.<br>
<br>
FA Quest:<br>
<br>
Pegasus Cloak: It was said that you weren’t sure if this was No Drop or not and have since learned that it is.  This camp is one of the absolute worst in the game, if you can not increase the spawn and or drop rate of this, Please take off the no drop tag so that we can at least buy it.<br>
<br>
Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth  - For many mages that I have talked to this is the only piece that they need to complete the FA.  Because Gods are on a week spawn rate, many mages will be stuck here for a VERY long time if not forever hoping they see a staff, let alone get one.  Please increase the drop rate on this staff as it is not something that really overpowers our pets, but is ungodly (godly?) hard to get.<br>

I do agree that our nukes should have been Conjuration based from the start, but a lot of people have specialized in evocation because of how the spells were made.  I am specialized in evocation but would love it if verant changed all our nukes to conjuration base, I would just reset my specialization and go for conjuration because then it would cover pets/nukes/CoH.  But Im betting that a lot of people wouldnt react that way and would go bitch to verant <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
I think you should also request some cold based DDs.  Maybe on the spell levels where we dont get a DD of any type a cold based DD could be added, or the spell levels where we get 2 fire based dds a cold one should be added.  We most need one at the levels of 29 or 34 or 39.  At those levels we can got to sol a or b, one of the first places where mobs are resistant to ice, and the closest DD that can hit them is at 24.  Also maybe a low 50s ice DD for skyfire.<br>
<br>
Instead of asking for the drop rate to be increased on the earth staff, how bout ask for them to move it to a few of the hate minions drop tables at the same rate as it is now on Inny.  This would increase the amount of times it drops because there will be more then one mob that has a chance to drop it each raid and every raid there will be a chance, instead of just once a week.<br>
<br>
Request voice graft.  I know not every mage out there cares about this spell, but a lot of them do.  It is just a fun spell that would not overpower the class.  We are the masters of pets, so if anything  we should have it and the necros shouldnt.  Also this would be a good spell to go with monster summoning.<br>
<br>
As an example for new weapons with proc suggest a one hander with stun.  We already can get those gnoll whips with stun so this wouldnt overpower us.  It would just make it so we dont have to farm them or buy them off lower levels.  Should be level 44 or 49 summon though.<br>
<br>
Dont ask for an upgrade to mod rod at 49, thats just one circle higher then the regular mod rod so it probably wont happen.  If we do get an upgrade it would probably have to be in the 50s.<br>
<br>
This bit I am not sure about, it is just what I have heard from others.  At 55 mages get Rage of Zomm which is supposed to be a high damage output pet that goes away after the target is dead and has only 100 hp (also heard it cant duel weild and cant be given weapons (also might have heard it cant be buffed)?).  Ive also heard the necros get a pet in the 50s which is called the monk pet which is supposed to be a high damage output pet.  The necros pet has full durration/life and can duel weild/everything else a normal pet can do.  If this is the case, I think the mage pet should be changed to full durration/life, and be treated like a pet (Buffs Weapons Duel weild Etc).  The way it is right now ive heard that rage of zomm is only great for killing sowed casters in duels.  As I said about the begining, I am not sure about anything in this paragraph.      <br>
<br>
Well theres also more stuff I was going to add, but i cant remember them now, o well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

1) The Necro monk pet - this pet is nearly identical to all other necro pets EXCEPT its kick does much more damage (I'm not possitive whether this pet has an attacking speed increase as well). That, at the cost of 1/2 hp of a lvl 49 pet. IMO, there's really no need to be envious of this pet (its kick damage isn't as much as a backstab anyway). About the 55 Rage of Zomm - this pet is good for the long battles (you can cast burnout on this pet...), however the problem I find is that versus high lvl mobs when they ripote or use their &quot;soandso has been enraged&quot; disciplane, pet dies VERY quickly. Perhaps just a slight increase in hp would be good.<br>
2) I believe the group damage shield was made so that you decide whether it's beneficial to use the group one or the individual one(depending on number of tanks/casters in group)...but in most of the case the individual one is better, since in a group you should have one designated taunter and the others shouldn't get hit much usually.<br>
3) I don't think pets are &quot;completely PC&quot; yet...I believe it'll be rather difficult to have group spells affect the pets, coding wise...<br>
4) Pet heal upgrade would be VERY nice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
5) Also...the Cloak and Earth stave needs to be modified...most other classes' FA item drops from the mob everytime, but the Mage has to get lucky on quite a few items from rare mobs...sounds a bit unjustified IMO.<br>

Ultimate Fix for Pets not allowed in certain situations:<br>
<br>
The reason that pets aren't allowed in some situations is almost always because of pathing.  For instance, areas of Hate where the MoB can go up on the wall and a pet might take a strange path to/from the MoB, or that clearing before the castle in the Hole, etc.  <br>
<br>
The Fix: Level 50 spell called &quot;Possess Summoned&quot; (or something of that nature) which allows us to completely control our pet.   This would negate pathing and thus negate the major handicap to Magicians post-50th.  This is not something that fixes a weakness for Magicians that is there by design, its highly doubtful that Verant designed bad pathing areas on purpose just to make haveing a pet more difficult.     The spell would have the drawback of leaving the caster stationary and defenseless during this time.   There would be no set duration for the spell, but an activatable key for &quot;unposessing&quot; the pet which would act as a spell with a 3 second casting time -- Meaning if we are posessing our pet and our body is being attacked it would take 3 seconds to gain control of the body back.   <br>
<br>
This casting time to unposess essentially means we won't be posessing our pets in every day situations because it is too dangers (3 seconds is long enough to take a massive amount of damage from a MoB), but would be useful in many situations like Plane raids where, if the plane raid goes bad, the Magician is likely dead anyway.   <p> <br>

Note on Specialization:<br>
<br>
Quick way to fix this is to change the new spell, Elemental Maelstorm, to Conjuration (which makes more sense anyway).  This is a new enough spell that it was not a deciding point for specialization.<br>
<br>
As for Cold based DD's, this is part of our inherent weakness and is part of what makes Wizards shine (Cold, Magic and Fire based dd's).    Of course, Druids whined and got Ice put into their lineup, so anything could happen. <p> <br>

-Summons should be made more usefull post 50, and im not talking about another summon beer and fireworks spell.<br>
- More groupfriendly spells post 50, CoH is a start, but as its the only good spell its too late at 55.<br>
- Fix rain spells so pets dont eat up a wave, or remove the spell line alltogether.<br>
<br>
Now to the big part, Pets.<br>
I group mostly with a necro friend and must say that i cant really say that his pets are that much weaker than ours.<br>
On top of that he has all the great spells like Snare, Fear,<br>
Feign Death, Screaming terror, Mana Regen .....<br>
Its not likely that we will even get a root or snare,<br>
nor that our pets will be upgraded in strength or inteligence.<br>
So pets are supposed to be our main strenght and the reason why we have some drawbacks to other casters. In comparison to the other main pet class i think we are getting the short straw here, the necros havent been handicapped by the post 50 pet nerfs as much as us. (All we have is DD and pets, none of the utiliarian spells i listed above)<br>
<br>
My solution would be a very simple one.<br>
Give magicians pet commands no other pet caster has.<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
/pet NoAggro<br>
(pet wont hit back even if attacked)<br>
<br>
/pet StayClose<br>
(pet wont leave the command range, by just stopping, or even better, warping back besides you at higher levels)<br>
<br>
/pet attack %t<br>
(Pet attacks targeted mob, no matter if beeing hit on by other. Might be only available, or more reliable at higher  levels )<br>
<br>
/pet assist %t<br>
(With %t beeing the main tank for example. Pet only attacks the mob that is targeted by the tank, and switches targets with him automatically)<br>
<br>
These are just some ideas of the top of my head.<br>
Should be pretty easy to implement, doesnt overpower us,<br>
doesnt nerf any other classes, doesnt need any new line of spells. But it would make us more acceptable to groups because our pets become more &quot;trustworthy&quot;. Wouldnt you like to hear once,<br>
&quot;No pets allowed except magician ones please&quot;<br>
(Maybe even enchanters would like us for never breaking any mezzes again)<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what do you think of my ideas?<br>

The necromancer is a pet class, yet they can root, mezmerize, fear, snare, ect and it doesn't unbalance / over power them. Why then it it over power us?<br>
<br>
Verent wants ideas to balance the classes that also function to make the class more group friendly, root would do that. The abilty for a magician to contribute to &quot;root parking&quot; extra mobs and stop runners does nothing but aid the group.<br>
<br>
Also, just because verent said in the past that magicians wouldn't ever get root doesn't hold water as a reason not to ask for it now....experience penalties removed anyone???<br>
<br>
Every class that can use magic can cast root, with the exception of shadow knights who can snare and none are deemed overpowered. I can bring more to a group with the root line of spells than i could with any new summon spell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udarkonassunblighter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Darkonas Sunblighter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(1/24/01 3:06:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Please Explain......</span><hr size=1> Malgavite,<br>
Root and Snare would be very practical indeed.<br>
Wizards get Invis to Undead, Clerics get a weak pet...<br>
But I dont want a skill that everybodys sister has,and does better. <br>
Do you really think root will get you invited more often post 50, or even make you more usefull on raids?<br>
Velious is even more geared to multi group encounters,<br>
think snare will cut it?<br>

<br>
Keep in mind that we want to balance the mage class from 1-60.  So often I see recommendations for only high level stuff.<br>
<br>
As I posted on flameplay, I think one of the few things that would not infringe on other classes is if we had summoned items that gave magic, fire and cold resistances. These are always welcome, and numerous items could be created.  Some armor, some items...I really think that would help mages a lot throughout their career.<br>
<br>
Why must the 52 pet be patterened after a wizard?  Why not an enchanter?  It could cast stuns, and mezs, tashans all day!  Now that would be helpfull!  It could also cast breeze and other buffs on players....I know it would never happen since the enchanter class is one of the &quot;holy&quot; classes&quot; but can't hurt to suggest it...after all if all classes are equal what does it matter that is an enchanter rather than a wizard.  Or is Verant saying by allowing the wizard class to be a pet that they too are second class citizens?<br>
<br>
I agree that there are not enough conjuration spells in the game and too much evocation.  I would say they need to be changed!  Sure lots of folks specialized in evoc, but this is easily changeable, if it wasn't I would not recommend it.<br>
<br>
I really feel we need some form of escape spell.  Why are we the only class penalized for this?  We have no more raw power than a wizard, necro or enchanter.  I have seen high level enchanters solo more easily and with less risk than many mages.  At the very least they should reduce the casting time for our gate spell to 2 secs or less with a quick recast time.  Are we not the Gatecallers?  We don't travel well so I do not believe this would be too unbalancing.<br>
<br>
I really did wish we could hand out combine stones that with a right click would teleport the holder to one of the wizard spires.  To make it balanced, perhaps it could be a moderately expensive lore gem/lots of mana...different gem for different spires.  Sounds like a good money sink for me.  Maybe it could be racial?  Erudites could have Tox forest and WK, Elves could have GFay and WCommons (wasn't befallen orginaly a HE home?)  and Gnomies could have GFay and S. Ro; Humans:NK, NRo; Neks: Nek Forest and Cazic.  I think this could work...These would have to be high level say 39 and 44. <br>
<br>

Now soloing is reduced to some spots and very boring and/or risky. (not to mention the heavy downtimes) That is why I concentrated on the groupability aspects. <br>

Thats where you are mistaken. This isnt about &quot;class defining issues&quot; it is about &quot;class BALANCE issues&quot;.<br>
<br>
It has already been stated that NEW spell lines or abilities are NOT the direction that Verent wants to go. They are lookin for minor tweaks to classes they already consider balanced. The root spell line is as minor as it gets, and given the choice to group with a mage that can aid in crowd control and stopping runners with a crummy root spell and with a mage that cannot......I'll take the one who can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dumonyu</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(1/24/01 8:03:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=42.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Mage spell</span><hr size=1> It's time to stop thinking small and grab the bull by the horns. Everyone knows the growth curve post 50 sucks for Mages. It's like we get weaker and weaker the higher we get. I'm level 55 now with no real incentive to go any further. Verant knows the pets suck...they'd have to be brain dead not to. They will either fix them or not, regardless of what we say, so I have decided to take my request in a different direction.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of seeing group after group sitting at the sebilis zone in shouting out for an ENC. I mean tired to the point of asking myself why even log in. I mean, wtf? It's ridiculous we should be held hostage by one class that gets mobbed with group offers the second they hit the zone. Now before someone says 'But you also need a warrior and cleric...' thats not true. I've seen many good caster groups that were good to go except for not having the crowd control required to enter even a dungeon filled with nothing but greenies. COTH was a nice addition to our line as it gave groups a reason to actually want us, which before that we frankly didn't have. However, I'd like to see it taken a step further and see a new spell implemented in that same vane:<br>
<br>
Call of the Beast<br>
<br>
Summons any targetable MOB equal to or lower than the mages level to the location of the mage, within a certain range, and does so without agroing the surrounding MOBs. This would not in any way make an ENC useless as we all know a group is bound to get hammered by a large number of MOBs eventually and need the REAL crowd control that only an ENC can provide, but it would at least give us, and the group with us, a chance to adventure into a dungeon without HAVING TO HAVE AN ENC to get past even the first spawn group.<br>
<br>
I don't think a valid argument can be made that this would be 'unbalancing' while it would allow for some exciting possibilities in terms of group game play. Imagine a group being able to carefully explore a dungeon WITHOUT AN ENC! I know, unheard of, but it shouldn't be. We are the 'Masters of Summoning' and I for one would much rather see a summon like this than another lame weapon or stupid spinning bottle.<br>
<br>
It's obvious that the game as a whole post 50 is whacked, hence the constant 'tweaking' of different classes, but PLEASE help us ALL by removing this, the biggest obstacle to group exploration, and giving the red headed stepchild class (Mages) a bone they sorely need.<br>

I'm posting this on the everquest page as well.<br>
