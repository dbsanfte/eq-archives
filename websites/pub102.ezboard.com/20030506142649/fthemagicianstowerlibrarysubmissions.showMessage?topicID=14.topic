Then I read the boards. All I see are complaints and rants. This seems to be a class that even the ones that play it don't like. I don't see what( that must be obvious to others ) is the major drawback to the magician class. Please let me know what it is that gives everyone so much greif.

The Magician is composed of mainly two offensive parts: the caster's Direct Damage and the pet. The pet, as you probably already know, is the strongest pet out of all the pets. The Mage's direct damage is also very strong - the Wizard's is the strongest with the Mage/Druid sort of tied for second and third. Magicians also have strong Area effect spells (although they are not too useful) and the best bolts (which takes sometime getting used to, but they are pretty useful). Magician is also a very good soloing class, and they can add much to the group (they deal a large amount of damage to mobs).<br>
<br>
Drawbacks: <br>
1) a lot of the summoning spells aren't that useful, especially with the fact that they go poof when you log off or go Link Dead.<br>
2) mages actually don't have a very good name (well at least from what I've seen so far), people are always blaming mage pets for breaking mez and yes I've seen a lot of mages when they are in a group, all they do is send in their pet - they don't even blast. And also some mages use Earthpet in a group etc...generally people don't realize the mage's true power because they never grouped with a good mage. Your challenge is to make a good name for yourself, and perferrably for the class <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
3) Mages have next to no escape spells (no root/snare, etc) This makes the mage class much harder to survive. However that is not to say they CAN'T survive, just more difficult <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Many mages complain about their class relative to the Necromancer class - so think thoroughly about which class are you going to make <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
4) Magicians only get 2 line of Direct Damage spells: Magic and Fire. Both Druids and Wizards have all three lines of DD (magic, cold, and fire). This isn't a big deal most of the time, but in some situations you may wish you had a cold based spell.<br>
<br>
Personally for me, I never regreted that I am a Magician. I loved this class from the beginning. Before my Mage I also made a ecro - played him for a little then realized that it's just not my style. Made a mage afterwards and now he's lvl 51 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (still stuck in Hate...God please grant me the Robe!)<br>
<br>
My recommendation is that experience a little bit with each class, and find which one suits your style. But if you just want to stay with one class - the Mage won't dissapoint you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

If you dig deep you will see that every class has its  &quot;complaints&quot;  and &quot;complainers&quot;.   <br>
<br>
Magicians are an excellent choice to play.  They provide a lot of fun and a lot of variety.  They will give you the chance to group up with other players or solo as you wish.   My suggestion is to not worry as much what other players think about a class and, instead, try the class out for a bit to see if you like it.   Each class has its strengths and weaknesses.  There will always be spells/abilities in the game that make you think &quot;damn, I wish I could do *that*&quot;.  The key is to realize that the person that can do *that* can't do everything and there are things that  your class can do better than they can (or they might not be able to do it at all).  <br>
<br>
There are six classes in the game that get a &quot;pet&quot;.  Of these, only two are considered &quot;pet&quot; classes (Magician and Necromancer).   Enchanters get a very limited pet but have the ability to charm creatures as well (making them pets for a short duration).   Shamans get a weak wolf pet once they hit high level.  Shadowknights get a scaled down version of the Necromancer pet.   Druids are able to charm animals to use as pets for a very short duration.    (I don't count Bards since their charm only lasts for 6 seconds).  <br>
<br>
Of all of these classes, the Magician gets the most variety of pets and has the most overall powerful pets.<br>
<br>
There will always be things that other classes can do that you might think would be cool. (I came to a Magician after playing a druid and I always missed SoW and Ports) but you have to realize that they can't do everything either (I would miss my pet if I played a druid).   <p> <br>

Most of what you are hearing is the natural griping that occurs when change happens. Verant recently fixed some bugs about our pets and since they were beneficial bugs, folks hated to see them fixed.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind, no one ever posts when they are happy ... they're too busy playing *grin*. So it is only natural to only see complaints posted.<br>
<br>
I've been playing a mage a long time now and never regretted it.<br>
<br>
You asked about what are the mjor drawback(s) to a mage. Well ... first you need to understand our strengths. Our characters are pure offensive power ... we deal more damage during a typical fight than anyone. Wizards can deal faster damage and Necros can deal more damage over long periods of time ... but for the typical group fight, nothing beats a mage.<br>
<br>
The balance for all this offensive power is no defense. Mages are totally dependent on their pet to keep the monster away from them. If the pet dies, so will you. So the key to playing a mage is knowing what you can handle and how to avoid aggroing the monster onto you. Some mages never do learn that trick so they get frustrated.<br>
<br>
Anyway ... try one and see if it is your style. A mage is not meant for everyone but if you like being able to solo as well as having a lot to offer a group, it may be what you're looking for.<br>

They're poison. Most of what you'll see on there are rants and flames that started way back when, due to (in my opinion) Verant not knowing how to communicate with its customers, and a large portion of the posting customers not knowing how to get their concerns across to Verant. It's been snowballing ever since.<br>
<br>
Now, to address your real issue of whether or not to play the mage, in what capacity I can.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to talk about 'power' since there are so many variations of that in the game. Mages are good at offense. When I was 20th level (enchanter) I saw a 17th level mage soloing a creature that I could not take down alone. That is one type of power. As an enchanter, I cannot tell you how many lives I have saved (my own included) by stopping a fight cold and making the bad guys just stand there and forget who they were mad at. It doesn't kill anything, but is also a type of power. Clerics bring you back from the dead and restore some experience lost at death. *drool*. You get the idea. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The mage class has a lot going for it. In a fight with any mob (short for mobile npc ... er npc is short for non-player character) that the mage has any business fighting, the mage will win. Damage output is what the mage does well, through a combination of pets and spells.<br>
<br>
Pets are wonderful, as they are a resource that only costs you mana once for unilimited damage, for as long as you keep it alive that is. Also, for as long as they keep a mob off of you, you can consider them a hit point buffer as well. Mages, like all INT-based casters, are fragile.<br>
<br>
Direct damage spells are respectable as well. While not as good as a wizard's in terms of damage per minute, they are very good in their own right. Also, while some other casting classes are vulnerable when they run out of mana, the mage still has his pet to provide some protection or buy time to escape if needed.<br>
<br>
Mages are also very self-sufficient, with the ability to summon food, water, bandages, and weapons. The weapons themselves are not great, but at certain levels are very nice for pets, and some have spell effects that are fun and sometimes useful.<br>
<br>
Like everything else, though, there are drawbacks.<br>
<br>
Mages are very dependent on having a pet to survive. So you must use caution when traveling, in dungeons, when you log on, etc.<br>
<br>
Downtime when a mage logs on is high. Much of what a mage does is invest mana through summonings. This includes pets, food/water, weapons, bandages, and utility items. Some things you can get around, like buying food/water/bandages from a vendor, but others are required, such as pets and even heatstones/coldstones for party members who cannot see at night.<br>
<br>
Linkdeath carries a high price for mages. Going linkdead means your connection to the EQ servers has become unstable. When this happens, you are booted from the game. When you return, anything that was in your inventory that was summoned will be gone. Pets also die if you go linkdead. This carries with it the same downtime as the above point, so if your connection is not very stable you may want to consider another class.<br>
<br>
The mage class has a lack of variety. Each spell circle brings more of the same ... new pets, new damage spells, new summoned items, etc. The upgrades are very nice in most cases, but in most spell levels you won't get any 'new' abilities, with a few exceptions such as summoning a ring of flight, etc.<br>
<br>
All that said, remember the one beautiful thing about EverQuest ... you are not locked in to a single character. Definitely play around with other classes. I say this for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1.) Without first-hand experience with other classes, you won't have a true idea of what is fun for YOU.<br>
<br>
2.) Sooner or later, you will group with people. Having an idea of what the capabilities of your teammates are has benefits that I can't even begin to describe here.<br>
<br>
3.) Okay, I said two reasons but there's really a third. You may like several classes. If so, play them all at your discretion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think I've rambled on long enough. Give it a try. If you like it, great, and if not, keep trying classes until you find one you like. There are 14 of them, and at least one should appeal to any given person. Lord knows I've played (and still play) enough of the classes to know. <p><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

Thank you all for posting, you didn't have to spend the time and I appreciate it.<br>
There is one more reason that most of you have overlooked that a Newbie ( I really HATE that term..lol ) might see that you don't. I have to tell you a few things about me for this to make sense. age - over 20, sex - female. Now this may seem trivial but the game seems to be over run with males with an extreme testosterone overload. I have noticed that the mage classes seem to attract a more patient and mature person than the hack and slash trades.<br>
This may easily be because of the time and patience needed to create a good character. most younger guys trying to get their ya ya's out will change to something more instantly gratifying at a low level.<br>
So in closing, Don't sell yourselves short in the personality dept. The mages I've met so far just reinforce my choice to join the class.<br>
<br>
Peace be with you<br>

Successful mages tend to be those that are patient enough to know that just because we have all this offensive power, it is often best to meter it out at a reasonable pace. <br>
<br>
Those that just want to blast things to bits are quickly frustrated when the monster makes a bee-line for them and ignores the pet. I learned very quickly (and often painfully) when and where to cast my spells to make sure the monster stays fighting my pet.<br>
<br>
It always cracks me up to be in a group with a wizard. They're so used to &quot;burning&quot; a monster fast that is rooted that they often get creamed when in a group. They also are constantly out of mana.<br>
<br>
Also, mages tend to help each other out a lot. Part of that is our terrible research requirements at higher levels. I know I help &quot;create&quot; spells for younger mages because I remember what it was like.<br>
<br>
Anyway ... glad to see you're giving mages a try. They really are a blast *pun intended <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> *<br>

<br>
most of everyone has stated what i would say. the Mage class is a fantastic class. Frankly i love it. I ahve played almost every class in game. i have found 2 that suit me.<br>
<br>
the Magician and the Druid.<br>
<br>
I play both. and im addicted to both.<br>
<br>
right now there are a few changes heading our way. that said even with those changes this class will rock.<br>
<br>
If you do decide to play a mage. then i make one and only one suggestion to you. Master pet control. this will make you or break you as a mage because with out our pets we are really weak wizards.<br>

It's a dual edged sword. The other women on this board can probably tell you better from first hand experience, but I have observed the difference in the way my wife is treated versus the way I'm treated when we play.<br>
<br>
As a female player, you will enjoy a lot of freebies from the gentlemen of Everquest. Guys will sooner give you free SoWs, Clarities, SMRs or whatever, than they would ever give me. Sometimes my wife and I would be camping druids, when a player who was passing through would clarity her and continue on his way, leaving me sitting there right next to her, pouting. In this respect, the life of a female EQ player is very pleasant.<br>
<br>
Then there is the downside, the male jerks of Everquest. Rather than celebrating a woman in their midst, they ridicule her or try to take advantage of her. When my wife played a wood elf ranger, she would occasionally get &quot;cyber-propositioned.&quot; Also on this end of the spectrum are what my wife terms the &quot;weirdos of EQ.&quot; These are the guys who you've grouped with maybe a couple times, and they start confiding their RL secrets, or talking about their problems in RL that you don't care about. &quot;Yeah yeah your wife left you because you play too much EQ, go pull something.&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to scare you away, because the more women who play EQ, the better, IMO. Just be prepared to deal with some of the special treatment you'll probably receive, both good and bad. <br>
<br>
Here are a couple suggestions for avoiding these problems altogether. If you're playing a magician and don't want to get hit on, I recommend a gnome. They aren't as attractive, and guys tend to bother them less. If you play a dark elf, on the other hand, you'll probably get hit on quite often.<br>
<br>
Another option is to play a male character. If you do that, and never tell anybody you're a woman, nobody will know. But most women I know who play eschew playing male characters, and you're probably no exception. Conversely (or perversely) a lot of guys play female characters.<br>
<br>
This is just some unsolicited advice to a person just starting out in EQ, I hope I'm not out of line in offering it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 40th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucaveral.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Caveral</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://home.dencity.com/caveral/c_md_wht.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(12/5/00 10:02:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.dencity.com/caveral/caveral.gif height=82 width=101></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New guy - confused</span><hr size=1> Faynne,<br>

I think the question you should be asking is how much time am are you going to devote to the game and how are you going to use the time in game.<br>
<br>
For example there is not a lot of point playing a group oriented class (although mage is a good balance in this case) if youre on a limited schedule.<br>

A level 30 Bard can kill 2 Giants in a couple of minutes. Try that eh?<br>
<br>
Anyway, being a Mage is great fun to me at least. We have had some highlevel problems, as only Cleric, Chanter and Melee are the basis of groups. Leaves little room for the other classes. And our pets have some problems in negating Dungeons.<br>
<br>
But nothing compares to a mage; Your pet is a killing machine, doing whatever your bidding. Learn pull into pet tactics(See library section) to kill tough mobs nonstop alone from levels 4 to 16. <br>
<br>
Mages can also (with this tactic) group with non-healing melee with little or no downtime. Try that with any other class <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Our damage shields (and druids) are the only ones that really can harm a deeeep red mob when its on to your group. At level 20-21, we kill Avocets at around level 28-30, I am sure my damage shield does 30-40% of the damage on that mob alone. (We can hardly scratch it..CACKLE).<br>
<br>
Never run out of food, arrows, bandages, thats is a goodie.<br>
<br>
If you tell yoru group that you hve no or little escape spells, they will allow you to Gate out in seconds, and doing this, you will survive most bad situations. Always gate as soon as possible. You learn that the hard way.<br>

I would first like to clarify a few posts about you being a female and playing in EverQuest.  Yes, there are a lot less of us females than males and while you may get treated kinder than males I have never had someone send me a private message asking to cyber sex or any @#%$ like that.  Sure, I have had a few people make some comments that were somewhat sexual but it was in fun and we both laughed about it.  Also, so many males play female characters that most people think you probably are a male until they get to know you, I know I look at most of the female characters out there like that.  Be a female, be proud of who we are. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now to the good stuff!  Magicians are a class that rely on there pet, and we have a very hard time doing anything without our pet.  We have very few spells that help other people other than summoning food, water, lightsources, minor weapons and such.  We can also cast invisable on ourselves and other people, as well as see invisable which can be very helpful at times.  Our best spell which is benifical to others(called Buffs) is our damage shield line of spells.  Well, you might be wondering what a damage shield is huh?  It is a shield that surrounds you so that whenever a monster hits us we inflict damage upon it by a force field type thing around us that is made of fire.  As we increase in levels we can make damage shields that do more damage and last longer.  Other than those few spells we don't really have alot to offer as &quot;Buffs&quot;.<br>
<br>
Like many people have said in this post we are the master class of summoning pets, and we are damn good at it. When we start out in the game we do not get pets right away however.  We have to wait until level 4, which is easy to get, and then we can summon our first line of pets.  We have 4 different choices of pets.<br>
<br>
Earth - Can take alot of damage and keeps the enemy monster is one spot by casting a spell called root.<br>
<br>
Water - This pet has quite a bit of hitpoints and casts a spell which causes cold based damage.<br>
<br>
Air - This pet has less hitpoints than a water pet but can cast a spell that 'stuns' the monster which renders it helpless for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
Fire - This pet has the least amount of hitpoints but causes the most amount of damage through its personal damage shield and fire based spell that it casts against the enemy monster.<br>
<br>
Magician pets are what makes us defining and very powerful.  At the higher levels these pets are brutes and can destroy just about anything in there path and many people will be envious in your power. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    But of course, not having a pet or having it die is a big drawback since most cases you will die if don't have a pet and a big mean monster wants to eat your for a snack.<br>
<br>
Next is our spells which are commonly called 'Nukes' or DD(Direct damage) spells.  These spells when cast upon a monster do damage to them right away.  All through our levels we get upgrades to our nukes which are fire based and magic based.  Most of the time you will have your pet attack the enemy monster and you will stand a bit of ways back and 'nuke' or 'blow up' the monster.  It's fun having a slave and telling what to do. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
So you might be wondering, wow... the magician class seems so powerful! What do I have to loose if I cloose this class?  Well, usually if your pet dies, you will die as well since the only form of 'escape' that we have is to either Gate(teleports us back to our starting location, and takes a long time to cast) or to run!  Running may seem easy but it's hard to out run something if it runs faster than you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
My suggestions for making a magician when deciding a race.<br>
<br>
Erudite - If you make an erudite put 10 stats into intelligence, 10 into strength and 10 into dexterity.  If you start this character take the boat over to Qeynos and when you finally get to the front gates ask for a 'bind' there.  Your bind point determines where you start if you die.<br>
<br>
Gnome - Put 10 into strength, and 20 into intelligence.  Personally, I think this is the best race to choose.<br>
<br>
Human - Put 25 into intelligence and 5 into dexterity.<br>
<br>
Dark Elf - I would not suggest this race since it is very hard to get around in the starting city, and the starting location has a lot of mean critters running around.  If you must play this race, put 10 into strength, 10 into dexterity and 10 into intelligence.<br>
<br>
High Elf - I will be shamed for saying it but high elves do not make good magicians since there stregth is to low, and have low dexterity.  However there intelligence is good.  If you really want to play this race put 15 into intelligence, 10 into strength and 5 into dexterity.<br>
<br>
While there are more stats than just strength, dexterity, and intelligence I feel that these are the most importaint stats of all for a magician.  Intelligence is the ammount of mana(amount you can cast) which effects how many times you can cast spells before you are OOM(Out of Mana).  Strength is how much weight you can carry and is very importaint because it allows you to carry more treasure or loot around.  Dexterity is what determines if you regain concentration casting a spell say if a  monster starts to whack you rather than your pet, a very importaint stat.<br>
<br>
When you log into the great world of Norrath for the first time, grab the manual you got with your game and use the maps to goto the the casters guild and turn in your guild invitation to get your robes!  While you are there use your right mouse button and click on your master trainer.  A window will pop up that will allow you to train your different skills, you start out with 5 training points and I suggest you put them all into piercing since you start with a dagger*.  After you do this, click on your spells icon and start to scribe in you spell burst of flame and minor shielding.  Always keep a shielding line on spells cast since it gives you extra hitpoints.<br>
<br>
After you have finally memorized your spells goto the newbie starting location and start to attack the critters out there.  When you finally save up enough money buy some backpacks, pouches, etc to carry around more things.  it gets frustrating very fast always having to run back and forth to the merchant every few minutes to sell things.  After you have bough a few backpacks save up all your money for level 4 when you get new spells.  When you finally get level 4 I would suggest you buy the fire or water pet, your next damage spell, summon food, summon water, summon bandages, gate, reclaim energy, true north and summon wisp.<br>
<br>
Well, thats my long hint on how to help you start your career on being a magician. Good luck, and if you ever have questions come back here and ask away. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><i>Liandriana Sedai 54-Elementalist<br>Syui Chan 48-Monk<br>Caba 20-Shaman</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uliandriana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liandriana</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 12/6/00 4:42:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ureaperrp.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ReaperRP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 213<br> <font color=#333333>(12/16/00 9:27:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Being a magician</span><hr size=1> Dexterity does not affect you recovering from and interuption.
