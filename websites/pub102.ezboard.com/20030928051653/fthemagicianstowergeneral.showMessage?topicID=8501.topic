We have also loss a lot of guild leadership and I am looking at taking the helm.  My questions to the mage community are:<br>
<br>
-  What really makes a guild fun?  Diversity of raids?  Number of raids?  Working on Epic?  Or does it just come down to good leadership?<br>
<br>
I've been pulling people together to do the caller quest and we have been having a great time-- forming some guild cohesion.  I'm just unsure of where to go from here.<br>
<br>
/Edit<br>
<br>
Maybe a better question:  If you had to do it all over again, what would you look for in a guild?<br>

<br>
-  One night a week where we run around and do epic encounters for people.<br>
- One or two nights a week where we do other quests or encounters.  This could either be something like getting some the Quenos Badge of Nobility or Killing named mobs in UP.<br>
<br>
Basically, I started playing a mage because I like the flexibility of soloing but with the option of being in a group (and even being effective!).  I don't think I want a guild that is hard core- &quot;must raid every second&quot; type, there are plenty of those out there [HnE, Familjen, etc].  I think I just want to recruit good people to have fun.  I already have a core group of people that simply rock-- if we could double and triple that and just have fun, then I would consider my job well done.<br>

<br>
If the majority of members are below 60, and you are looking to recruit 50s-60s members, I would suggest starting on Hate/Fear raids.  <br>
<br>
I say Hate/Fear because hopefully most of the individuals you have recruited have been there at least once and you guys will need to learn to work together.<br>
<br>
This will also weed out people wanting 'ph4t lewtz' and see who can listen to orders (future officers) and who can't.<br>
<br>
Getting to work together and having each person knowing their role and what is expected of them on a raid is a good way to start.<br>
<br>
Then hit PoG if faction allows.  Very easy zone but if people don't listen it can be a CR very quickly (hi Tunare!).<br>
<br>
If you do good here, HoT in ToV is a good next place to go.  ToV is an awesome place to learn how to survive.  AE is a pain and you see who needs resist gear and who has it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (I've only done wtov so i'm assuming that HoT mobs are similar)<br>
<br>
Then start working on mobilization.  Find rares, yell it over guild chat and get people there FAST.  Mobilization is probably one of the hardest things to get down but once you do, you can pop those Mini's that spawn and get some really nice stuff for guild peeps.<br>
<br>
After that I'd say start hitting key'd zones.  This will really show if you guys are on the same page and at the same time be a lot of fun.  ST, VP, Vex, Ssra - all very hard, all should be very rewarding if you succeed.<br>
<br>
Probably lots of other stuff too that I have missed but I think that this is what I would look for in a guild if I ever chose to leave mine. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kathartic>Kathartic</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/03 5:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8501.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:What makes a guild fun?</span><hr size=1> The question isn't what makes a guild fun but are there people that want what a guild is doing.  I'm GL of a smaller guild that has goals including 1-2 raids a week.  Members are happy when the calendar reflects those goals, and we keep progressing through game content.  However we have had members that needed other guilds because they had different goals.  Some folks like full time raiding guilds, others like less raids.  Some like to quest more, others more interested in exploring, <br>
<br>
So you, as GL, need to decide what the goals are for your guild and recruit people that want similar things.  Time of day playing is also an issue for members.  It usually comes down to a geographical issue though there are exceptions.  <br>
<br>
The other question is do YOU want to be a GL.  It seems to me that a portion of my gaming time is used in being a leader as opposed to playing.  You will be the leader and hence you can't just kick back and follow someone else's lead and just play your character for a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
1. power gamers- their version of fun is being in a guild that goes after every high end encounter in the game, and plays the game to 'win' it.  their version of 'win' is killing the final boss in the expansion (phara dar, vulak, aten ha ra), entering into the final zone of an expansion (vp, ntov, vt, potime), and having the best possible items for your character... among other things.  these guilds want to be in power raiding guilds among other people that play the game 5-12 hours a day, 5-7 days a week.<br>
<br>
2. casual gamers- their version of fun is the people that are in the guild.  they want to see high end stuff, but not at the expense of their real life priorities.  these people enjoy socializing, playing the game for a few hours every few days, and getting together when they can and enjoying the challenge of content and encounters in the game.  they tend to know a bit more bout the people in their guild outside of the avatar, and are more personable towards them.<br>
<br>
the guild i am in has moved from being casual to being power.  however, we have never lost the 'closeness' that we have.  many of our members have been with my guild for well over 2 years, and we have grown to enjoy and like each other's company.  that is why we still play the game... with each other, and to challenge ourselves on as much content as we can to progress in the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stehle>stehle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 50<br> <font color=#333333>(1/17/03 6:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8501.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:What makes a guild fun?</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the great input, this is a big help.  As for the question &quot;Do I want to be a leader?&quot;, it isn't a straight yes or no question.  I have been playing the game less than 6 months but i'm an avid researcher so I know a lot about _some_ aspects of the game.  So from and experience standpoint I would be fairly decent because I do my homework.  On the other hand, I do like my solo time to try to things.<br>
<br>
All in all, though, I really do not have a choice.  The guild will die without a leader.  I like the guild and i like the people.  I don't mind organizing events if people are willing to try and have fun.  Sure we may die, but the end we will net positive.<br>
<br>
Now I just have to start researching the other classes to figure out how to make functional and effective groups out of what we have.<br>
<br>
Cheers and thanks!<br>

That was a very big piece I was missing.  Do fun places, Acrylia caverns, Akheva, Kael/Thurg...do fun quests like the Scout quests in Grimling Forest.  I know I have always been ready to go see new zones the first day and fun quests are always good to get people together for.<br>

My guild on the rathe is small (25-35 people). The highest level is 54. I get great enjoyment from this group of people.  I have never had a bad encounter, have always felt supported, and have made good friends in my guild.<br>
Our guild is not Uber in any sense, but can hold our own with the more experienced players.  They are always ready to help, mentor inexperienced and young players, and are really involved.<br>
I would consider this group casual players even though many are on a heck of alot. We have monthly guild fights, take guild pics, and are geniunely concerned. On a bad pull one of our guild members had his body deep in a dungeon to be abandoned by his pickup group. A call for help had 20 guild members drop what they were doing to destroy the zone to get his body back.. Nice group of guys..<br>
<br>
Anyway.. This is what makes my ingame experience so much more satisfying.<br>
<br>
BTW I appreciate this group as well. I read the board a few times everyday.. Couldn't get this high with out you all..  Thanks<br>

At your level I would get players between 46-60, this way most players can group together.  My guild has about 100 people, but many are just casual players under level 55, and usuallly there are about 30-40 people on.  For big raids like Inny we can get 50 max.  It's just a matter of what you want to do in a guild, and finding like minded people. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><A HREF=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=371031><center><img src="http://www.illumincathari.com/images/profile/maja_sig.jpg"></center> </A>

<br>
Believe me if I could change things I dont think I would be a guild leader again.<br>
<br>
Our guild is young and small compared to the others on our server. We were even voted the #8 guild to &quot;F off cause we where noobs&quot; on our servers rants board. which I thought was funny as hell.<br>
<br>
I recently have had many people leave at once due to they wanted a guild with &quot;more&quot;. Which I thought I was giving them. I tryed so hard to make everyone happy in our guild and inturn made my game a nightmare. To the point I didnt even want to play anymore.<br>
<br>
I sat down and talk to 2 other guild leaders kinda like ours.<br>
<br>
They told me dont try and make everyone happy ... Try and give your members what the marjority wants. Talk to them see what they want and ask them what makes them happy.<br>
<br>
What it came down to was not everyone wants the same out of the game.. You just have to find members who share your mission statement whatever that may be.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are now in the process of doing it. I am once again a happy GL and wouldnt give up my Knights for anything in the world.<br>
<br>
Just remember you cant make everyone happy. Just give them a good stable sense of direction and it should fall in place.<br>
<br>
I'm not the best GL but Our guild is growing and we have a good ole time when we are all on and about! For us its all about fun!<br>
<br>
Good luck with your guild! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.southbronx.net/~fubar/areillasig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Till Swords And Spells Meet....Be Safe....Be Good...have FUN!!!<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.knightsofareilla.com">Visit KoA's New Home</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

This appears to be the number one problem with most guilds. If you try to make everyone happy someone is always going to be mad so don't try to make everyone happy. Leaders by default (even elected ones) are dictators with a vision of what they want, if the vision is written for all to see the guild will be more successful. The leader needs to lead, this is what we are doing let's go. It gets a little old for the leader to come on ok let's all vote what we are going to do tonight. What in the end makes a guild fun is finding one that fits your play style.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=edyilcrossfire>Edyil Crossfire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(1/21/03 4:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8501.topic&index=17>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What makes or breaks a guild</span><hr size=1> I agree with some of this.<br>
<br>
First, you must make clear what your guild goals are.  You cannot possibly have fun unless you have some sort of direction (to find like minded folks).<br>
<br>
Types of Guilds:<br>
Newb guild - friends and adventure<br>
Friends guild - Chat, fun, but nothing matters except friends.<br>
Raider wanna-bes - Try hard but fail and cause frustration in the ranks.<br>
Raiding guild - Heavy hitters.<br>
<br>
You have to decide what *fun* is for you and your guildies.  After you decide, you need to make a charter to express the direction of the guild and stick with it.<br>
<br>
I have been an officer of a several guilds.  I have created two guilds from nothing.  My first guild was a raiding guild.  They are doing fairly well to this day, I'm proud to say.  However, that wasn't for me.  I'm too old to make my game that much work and I was missing the things that made it fun.  So I created my second guild.  A friends guild.  Sure most of us are very skilled and lvl 55+, but really all we care about is spending time together and having fun.  If we take down some_named_mob_001 we usually end up saying something along the lines of &quot;Oh yeah, mobs down.&quot; /shrug.<br>
<br>
Its relative.  Make sure you know what makes it fun for you and stick with it.  It took me several years of EQ to get back to what is fun for me. <p><p><br>
