Having destroyed our primary raid role with the full and announced intention of turning the Mage class into a respected damage dealer, we have received a number of generous upgrades in Planes of Power in line with this.<br>
<br>
Firebolt of Tallon was introduced as the Magician vendor-only spell. This quite simply stunned almost everyone who read up on it or saw it in action. Many mages speculated during the late phase of the beta when it was granted its godly status that it should be tuned by raising its level, perhaps swapping the spell with the less flashy but much more practical Black Steel.<br>
<br>
Data coming out on the level 61-65 Magician pets is while not as startling to Mages, is beginning to become much more mainstream. The simple fact is that the new pets are delivering damage in the 60-70 dps range, depending on circumstances. It has clearly been an across the board power boost for spelled pets, with Beastlords reporting similar if slightly less impressive results.<br>
<br>
These two points are rousing calls for nerf across class boards. Graffe's, while openly stating that the Magician bolt is a required portion of the retuning of the class, question its easy availability when compared with other nukes in their arsenal of simlilar power. Monks are outright screaming nerfs to the new pets, and you can bet that once someone does the numbers and it becomes common knowlege that Mages are rivalling Rogues now for damage there will be a melee-wide surge of resentment to these enhancements of the Magician class.<br>
<br>
I for one am tired of it. Is it the player's perception of the game's proper state that we remain it's much laughed at red-headed step child? Would it be such a travesty for Magicians to be the outright best damage dealing class, given that this damage is so riddled with issues of circumstance?<br>
<br>
After so long, mages are so hurting for numbers that it would be a very good thing for us as a class to skip just a little ahead of mudflation at the launch of this expansion. After all, you can bet your life that this (the spell lines) are pretty much it for enhancements this expansion, drops are traditionally not particularly effective for casters. I find it a point of pride that we are now being slowly reckoned as serious damage dealers rather than rod whores.<br>
<br>
Its been well over two years now since new pets entered the game. I certainly hope the developers will see the coming backlash against the new pets for what it is, a knee jerk reaction to the finalisation of a long overdue process, the restoration of the Magician class to its rightful place as a kicker of arses and a taker of names. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A> at: 11/7/02 9:31:47 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=salashpenumbra>Salash Penumbra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#333333>(11/7/02 9:36:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: It Begins</span><hr size=1> Most of PoP has yet to be revealed.

Our offensive power is near god status. <br>
<br>
Consider that with proper buffs (Focus/Bo5/ranger atk buffs) the new water pet can reach upwards of 85 to 88dps against various level 62 mobs and lower in the planes. Also consider that with FoT + proper focus gear a mage can get near 5.0 ratio on that bolt and over 400dps. That doesn't even take into account SCF/SCM, and various other AA. Also I am hearing good things about Host of Elements as well as suspend menion. Mages recovering mana are great rates further helping with the output of damage.<br>
<br>
Most top end knights can not hit 85dps in a experience group. We have pets that are able to get near that with buffs. As I said in the other thread, these pets are very different then pets of old. They benefit greatly from stat buffs and with the new gear we can summon for them they really shine. The epic pet doesn't seem to be benefitting from all the new buffs/items like the new pets are. Today for the first time I moved Summon: Orb off my front page of my spell book. /em sheds a tear. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As it stands we have no equal in offensive combat. I am critting for 4600 with FoT and wizards in my group that are lucky enough to have GSS are critting for 4800ish. That is all that they have. They don't have a pet doing 70+dps adding to there damage nor do they have a damage shield racking up more damage. Nor can they hand 7mana per tick to all spell casters in the group.<br>
<br>
The balance comes from the fact that we have no defense. With the increased damage that mobs are able to do now, and the static state of pet hps we have even less defense. A pet is about 8secs worth of a head start for running to the zone against PoP mobs. No runes, root, heals, instant succor, snares, slows, FD ect...allows us to wield offense like we do. It is about time and damn it we have earned it. I have heard melee complaining about the new mage water pet in regards to it assing mobs hehe.<br>
<br>
Either way we have earned this power. We were every highend guilds bitch of a year. We were slaves and now we are free. We are getting a chance to show people what we can do with the chains off. It is about damn time.<br>
<br>
All I really have to say to rogues and wizards is..........<br>
<br>
Focus Items + Blessings of Faith + Fire Bolt of Tallon =<br>
<br>
452dps on a max hit no including pet or damage shield. <br>

<br>
First I have readed the post on monkly business you are refering. I am in no way ubber, equipment and mana wise. I play a lvl 55 magi and a lvl 41 (climbing fast) monk/lvl 40 druid as a combo. <br>
<br>
First, comment in this specific post with winning monks. None of the wise monks expressed an agressive argument against us. Believe me I explore their board quite ofen and I always see nice post nice responces to questions. They are people out there that are quite nice and very instructive. The power of the magi I didn't tasted yet since I am a bit bored of the magi way right now. But don't stop your judgment about monk on that post, as a magi I saw the rod nerf and I was quite depressed thinking I wont be very welcome in raids. My guild proved me the opposite. Now I see that lvl 61+ magi have a good power in hands that is placing magis in the good people to have in raids. As a monk I saw the armor nerf coming and I was quite depressed too. But until now nothing was given to the monks to recover from that nerf. I think when VI will give them something, they will be more than happy.<br>
<br>
Now I still love to play my monk because I don't have my ass sited on the ground while somebody else is pulling and exploring the dongeons. God damn it, VI place more confortabe chair in your dongeons, the magi ass has to be respected as our damages now :-)<br>
<br>
<br>
I found quite interesting that since pop, Necro Wizzie Magi and even bst ( with wich I saw lots of problems link to cross posting) are working hand by hand each other. I think we have to adopt the same diplomatic way with melee.<br>
<br>
Also I find quite interesting that the boards don't reflect what happen in game. I see lots of wizzie, necro and druid lfg when I play my monk/druid combo (not the best combo for sure but I like to move). I invite them a lot, and in game, I never saw an agressive talk between class. So take the boards for what they are. Read the post from the wise and calm people (add Wezloc to the list not calm not always wise but he has his very good moments :-))))) and I respect him) and forget the others. I am sure VI does the same.<br>

I had a long chat in game tonight with one of the posters on that thread, a monk whose opinion I respect a great deal. <br>
<br>
The simple fact is that no matter how I presented my case to him it was simply refuted, the reasoning being that magician pets are simply overpowered and the only correction to balance needed is that they be hammered. On several occassions I pointed out that melee classes are experiencing the end of their own Magician-style Kunark / Velious era and that the cycle would surely swing around, that right now it was finally a Magician's time to shine.<br>
<br>
If someone with such a long game history and usually objective opinion can make such a claim, then there is cause for some concern.<br>
<br>
It also appears plain to me that some people simply object to magician pets out damaging <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, as though a pet as an entity must be below average joe Knight damage in order for the world to be right. &quot;It's just a pet after all&quot; is a very common sentiment to many. I was then asked to consider the possibility that mage nukes were the overpowered side of the equation.<br>
<br>
Why is it OK for a Rogue to do tremendous damage, often twice that of a mediocre Monk or a decent Knight, and not for Mages? Why must we constantly tread this line between having comparable nukes to Wizards, and not stepping on melle toes?<br>

And the pet requires a back to do that much dps.<br>
<br>
And also, your pretty 400+ dps calculation, try it some time, just make sure there's a cleric around when you do, because chaning FoT, with a pet, will get you agro in 1-2 nukes.  We may slightly edge out wizzards in exp groups, or very open boss fights where we can get enough range to send the bolt over people's heads, but GSS doesn't suffer from that, they also have EER should fire not be good to use.<br>
<br>
To be honest I think Verant dropped the ball here.  The spell system in POP is retarded, and makes it impossible for FoT to be as scarce as GSS.  Obviously the gimpy wizzards who never killed emp ssra are going to be miffed about the situation, and I don't blame them; FoT should not be as easily available as it is.  Their GSS-anologue should be moved to level 62, or 61, as long as it's obtainable through ethereal parchments(the only kind that currently drop).  Making FoT a turn in spell and the 61 air the buyable spell couldn't hurt either. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78838">Colleen Ebonfyre</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->65 Magician<br>

<br>
Hehe please don't try to down play the mages power to me of all people. I have not complained about mages in awhile. I am pissed about the mage epic but that is for another thread. The mage class is in good shape for the first time in a long time. Lets not try to down play that power in fear it will be nerfed. I think we are in very good shape, and I don't believe we will be nerfed. I think Verant realized that without Mod Rod2 there was no place for the mage in Norrath so they upped our damage to respected levels. The very reason that classes are screaming for mage nerfs show you that our power is starting to get respect. Every time I see a wizard emote a /sigh when I crit for 4600 I smile inside. It makes up for all the months of seeing wizards call mages there &quot;Rod Bitch&quot; daily on the Graffe. Surely you haven't forgotten I know I haven't.<br>
<br>
I remember when alot of the top end monks that I am friends with on my server told me to dump the mage because they are worthless. Now it is the mage that is riding high, and finally people are wishing they could do what we can do. I kinda like it personally. I love the fact that primal equiped monks drool over my new rogue pet that I am slowly falling in love with. I love the fact people are begging me to do trial groups because they want a mage for damage.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong I really have a hard time getting a group. People still don't know that mages are the damage kings, and they should be happy to get us when they can. With whiny bitchfess threads like over at Monkly Business the word that we rock will get out faster then parses of damage ever could.  I say it is good that other classes are jealous of us. When people are jealous it means you have something valuable that they want or don't have. Finally we can do something no one else can. Be happy and enjoy the moment because we all know it won't last. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Sorry had to reply to this. Umm no top end knights are not parsing 100dps in experience groups. The next experience groups for top end knights are in PoP not sebillis. I am very sure in Sebillis and Velk's top end knights in ssra gear could parse 100dps because my epic pet could hit over 90dps in those places. However  knights are not parsing a sustained 100dps in experience groups. Most of the parses I have seen show ssra/vt equiped knights to be around 70 to 75ish dps in PoV. My water pet can do that with no procing weapons. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This is *mostly* because of the recent nerfs to monks.<br>
<br>
Monks would never have called for a nerf if magicians could outdamage them.  Big deal.  We still eat your pets alive in damage output and your mana is limited and spells have limitations.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A pet is about 8secs worth of a head start for running to the zone against PoP mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's more than a monk is worth.  So now magicians outdamage *and* out-tank monks.<br>
<br>
Yeah, expect monks to complain.<br>
<br>
But take it for what it is, monks got nerfed more severely than *any* class ever has before in one shot (and considering some of the nerfs to necros, that's saying quite a lot).  Monks know where they *were* in relation to other classes, and where they *are*, and magicians are a direct competitor for the *only* spot left in the groups required to fight in the higher level zones.  If you do that job better all around, there will be complaints and calls for a nerf.<br>
<br>
Sadly, they won't really be justified.  But then, the nerf to monks wasn't really justified.  If monks have given up on raising their class &quot;rank&quot; (and they have), they will seek to lower their main competitors so that they can actually compete.<br>

Are you saying magician pets are supposed to tank?<br>
<br>
And that's the point.  Instead of being a balanced offensive/defensive class, monks are now *purely* a damage class.  Monks, the same as magicians, have a *single* defensive capability now.<br>
<br>
Which puts monks in the position of directly competing with magicians for that final damage-dealer spot in a group.  If magicians are perceived to fill that position better, monks will lead the charge calling for nerfs, or at least join in force when the wizards do.<br>
<br>
At least before, monks could solo some if they couldn't find a group.  That's not really an option now.  And before, monks could fill in as a tank in a pinch (though clerics would still prefer a warrior).  That's *really* not an option now.<br>
<br>
If monks as a whole figure out that magician pets out *tank* them, there will be a huge amount of complaints and calls for a nerf.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: Sony doesn't really know anyway.  Luclin and PoP AA skills include double riposte, kick-riposte and damage mitigation skills.  Those are skills that are useful for a tank and useless for someone standing behind the mob.<br>
<br>
EDIT2: Keep forgetting that Verant doesn't exist anymore. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=322727"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Sensei Faned</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Pets are afterall a magicians entire form of defense besides death or gate and when AC means *nothing* to your class channeling will never save you when a mob is hitting for 600+.<br>
<br>
While pets do tank, consider that they rarely mitigate.  I literally saw epic pet &quot;poof&quot; to a pull one day of a single mob, it just was.. gone.  A monk will have a chance to block at least and if hit have a chance to mitigate some.  It's even being reported for the pets so far that they're tanking worse than epic pet.  It reminds me of that line from Alladin where the genie is talking to him and says something like, &quot;All the power in the univers, wrapped into a really small carrying case.&quot;  Pets are far from overpowered.<br>
<br>
And if you think Verant doesn't &quot;get&quot; it, consider that the monk class was described very recently as being able to do damage from behind and in front of the mob, unlike rogues they had no situational damage, which is a great boon for a monk when there just isn't enough room for a rogue to manuever.<br>
<br>
Aside from all that, tell me what is wrong with different classes being choices for group slots?  Should monks be above mages when it comes to filling a general slot?  Should mages be destined to be the people who are lfg all the time until a group that is powerful enough already has pity on their poor dps and lack of usefulness?  Mages don't solo very well in PoP either FYI.  While it is doable, it is not efficient or even very interesting by any stretch of the imagination.<br>
<br>
Except, mages have a reason to solo in pop, we have to get spell to make those levels we gain useful -- melee just level and get new damage tables and better fists.  Have you ever been tied to that type of regime?  Here I am 63 and 3 new spells, including FoT, none of which really extend my power for my particular specialization.  Imagine competing with 5 of 6 group members for progression rights and then having it all based on the random number generator.  Anyone who thinks PoP is just easy street for mages needs to wake up and spell the coffee.<br>

<br>
First, thank you for a constructive discussion and not a winning flame.<br>
<br>
About your post, Pet before pop (experienced myself) was already outdamaging monks. I speak of a normal monk and a normal mage. LVL 54 pet was outdamaging a monk friend who was 56. BUT, the reason it was outdamaging was because of the quality of the monk that always placed the mob in such a maner that my pet was on the back of the mob. We outdamage near everybody on a short term fight when we want to. The problem is that after a certain time we need to med a lot. The monk I am refering too, was a continual DPS killing machine. I was a killing machine when I needed to be. In a normal exp group, the pet will outdamage any melee if well positionned and well equiped. The mage/pet combo will be a killing machine on one or 2 fights per hour. The monk will stay a killing machine for all that hour.<br>
<br>
Take a look next time you have a mage in your group and see when he call for a fast kill or when he announce he will probably take  agro because the situation need a fast kill.<br>
<br>
For the fist nerf that monk recieved, I have not really an opinion except that that nerf just after the armor nerf was diplomatically not really well handled. <br>
<br>
About the armor nerf, here I agree with all the monks I think, this is pure sh*t. Even if it correct a mistake, it has a big impact on the play style of too many player.<br>
<br>
About the lfg problem, monk before the nerf had already problems. A monk was choosen as the main tank in groups for several reasons. I was one of the guys that always prefered monks by the &quot;waow they are good&quot; effect. I'll continue to take monks in group, because there is one think I believe monk do better than other. They make your exp life easy. And believe it or no that's why I play a monk right now. And since I am pulling as a monk my dps sucks because I dont really participate the fight my dps as only an interest when I am the second monk in the group. Now you will say &quot;come on Mini&quot; you are not at pop lvl. Yes true, but from what I have readed, I wont change my mind when I'll be at pop lvl.<br>
