   I know this has been done before but lets try and not whine about it and make an honest/helpful thread on this subject.<br>
<br>
<br>
   I would love to see snare or another slow type spell over root because as a mage we do have pets witch helps us out as a &quot;modified root&quot;. When the pet dies it's like root breaking. Now if we had snare we could &quot;root&quot; the mob by sending in pet, then cast snare or another slow type spell for added safety soloing.when your pet dies or an &quot;add&quot; jumps in the mage now has some options open up. We could run far enough to cast a new pet and continue the fight, stay and try to land some nukes with hopfully less interuptions, or we could zone with added saftey that the mob is not right on top of us.<br>
    Now to keep it in line with a mage Verrant could give us a focus item that had one charge of snare tradeable maybe this way other classes would not mind so much that we would get another spell that we didnt have before. lets face it alot of are spells are on other items that differant classes could use.<br>

<br>
How I rationalize it being balanced for mages to have root:<br>
<br>
Consider the cleric. The cleric was THE excellent force of both groups and raids. Raids needed clerics in twice the quantity of pretty much any other class. Most groups without a cleric were a joke compared to groups with a cleric. It's quite true that a clericless group could actually do better than one with a cleric, since clerics did not output damage. But how many pick up groups in OS did you see without a cleric? 2? Whatever the number there were a hell of a lot more groups with clerics than without.<br>
<br>
It was balanced by the fact that clerics were some of the worst solo xp in the game. Even with undead nukes, clerics just were not built to solo. Their best damage spells were worse mana/dmg ratio-wise than any other caster. They just couldn't solo.<br>
<br>
Now they can. The new changes allow them to solo quite well. But not only that. The new cleric changes, introduced to give groups reason to take a cle over druid, and and also to give clerics an alternative when they couldn't group at all. But really, these changes have increased cleric's versatility a LOT. They used to be pushed toward the end game more than any other class. Now they retain most of that shift, but also can keep up with a lot of classes solo.<br>
<br>
The balancing factor of clerixing sucking at solo was taken away. It's this point that I argue mages should have root or some type of defense.<br>
<br>
Mages have always been one of the most offensive classes in the game. The balancing factor was that we had no defense. We have gate. We have pets. We do not have fear, root, snare, slow, mez, charm, FD, DA, or whatever else you can think of. We have low hp and low ac. If we pull 2 mobs, we die or zone. If the mobs are weak we just kill them both, but it takes a crapload more mana, because we have to chain heal our pets as nuking would gain agro. If I get 2 mobs, I usually end up oom. It's always been justified before though, because of our offense.<br>
<br>
But just as cleric's raid healing hasn't gone anywhere, our offense hasn't gone anywhere. And where clerics had their drawback quashed, I don't see why ours can't be as well.<br>
<br>
Root, which out of any defensive spell would be my choice, is wielded by most casters. Wizards have it, necros have it, enchanters, druids, clerics, shaman all have it. Paladins, who are only half a caster, have it. Bards, Sks, Bls don't have it to my knowledge. But they're all hybrids, and SKs and esp. BLs are quite broken classes in several respects, so it's not worth discussing why they don't have root.<br>
<br>
Of all the casting classes, mages lack root. Why? Because we have the best offense of any of them? Clerics have the best pure defense, but it doesn't stop them from having quite a mean offense.<br>
<br>
One could easily say this argument about the clerics is irrelevent. Clerics were given these spells because druids and shaman threatened to move in on some of that defensive territory. <br>
<br>
But is our primary job on the uberest of uber encounters, and thus the pinnacle of mage hood, not making mod rods for clerics? With additional healing power coming from druids and shaman, I could counter the above counter-argument by saying that druid and shaman heals also cut into *our* roles, indirectly.<br>
<br>
The counter-counter-counter argument would be that I'm referring to the pinnacle of magehood, only the uberest of uber encounters, and that it once again makes my comparison to clerics irrelevant, since a good cleric will never use their new melee powers on anything which would pose such a challenge to their guild.<br>
<br>
So my counterx4 argument would then be that yeah, exactly, that's why I'm not asking for upgraded nukes or mod rods as compensation, but rather an ability which would be irrelevant on such encounters :p<br>
<br>
VI says they added the changes to balance clerics, not to throw them a bone because some other class got an upgrade. But let's face it, it was compensation for druid cheals. Either way you look at it, it's a good reason to have another look at mages getting root. Balance us, or compensate us~<br>
<br>
I've explored some reasons for mages getting root, along with toying with some counter-reasons, all of which were not without their counter-counters. So, anyone got any more anti-root arguments? I'm ready to hear them, this is the first time I've ever been on the pro-upgrade side of a class balance argument :Q <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#333333>(9/8/02 7:02:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> ==============<br>

===============<br>
<br>
That would just be trash. I would not buy it, I would not scribe it. Why? Because I would not mem it. If i'm gonna sit down and mem a travel spell, which is no good while fighting, I'm gonna just mem invis. Such a no-pet root would never be in my memmed spells. I might play with it once and then utilize the new spellbook delete feature.<br>
<br>
================<br>
 would prefer a lure-type root with only a 10 second duration, and minimal aggro, for a small amount of mana cost.<br>
================<br>
<br>
Dude, 10 second root is seriously no good. Again, I wouldn't mem it. A spell slot is not worth the mobs being 10 seconds apart.<br>
<br>
=========<br>
personally id rather prefer a slow but thats just cause i like to solo alot. with run3 root wouldnt serve as good a purpose as a slow would<br>
==========<br>
<br>
Yah, slow would certainly serve more of a purpose, but I think slow might be a bit much for the mage class, no? I'm talking about root, a good all around, multi-purpose tool with no true standout purpose. Slow is a 1 purpose spell. Decrease damage receieved. It obviously allows some stuff as a direct side effect of reducing damage.. but... <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujazzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#333333>(9/8/02 10:36:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Well if I was given any ability defensively I would pick root. In fantasy it makes no since why a pure spell caster would develop no defensive skills. In most fantasy roleplay games the lowest level spells available to casters were defensive in nature. Why would a 90lb very small weakling never learn anyway to keep a dangerous foe away? The answer is he wouldn't. We summon the very ground and earth itself to protect us but we can't hold someone in place? Look at most fatasy roleplay games the ability to root is a low lvl ability. It is the primary defensive spell of all spellcasters in movies and roleplay games. It makes no sense at all that a highly gifted spell caster wouldn't learn a way to protect himself. If we are traveling and get snared we are dead. No pet, no root, no snare........<br>
<br>
This is something that really needs to be changed/fixed. I really do not understand what VI is afraid of. Other keeping us a tiny bit safer what is root gonna do that will be so overpowering?<br>

Aside from wezloc's argument that no caster with half a brain would choose not to learn any way to protect himself to make up for his frailty, it makes sense that mages could control root. We are masters of elementals, summoning any of the four elements in pet form. We can also summon inanimate objects... blades summoned directly into an enemy's body and giant balls of fire to hurl at the enemy. So it would make perfect roleplaying sense for us to be able to summon some earthen shackles around the target's feet.<br>

Yeah necros can do that, but their pets are not as strong as ours for tanking and they don't have damage shields<br>

In D&amp;D casters were very smart. They were no very wise but very smart and crafty. The 4 basic pure casting classes in EQ were stolen right out of Advanced D&amp;D's specialized casting section.<br>
<br>
Magician = Conjuration/Summoner from D&amp;D<br>
Necromancer = Necromancer<br>
Enchanter = Illusionist/Diviner (these were two different specialized classes but EQ kinda combined them)<br>
Wizard = Invoker<br>
<br>
In D&amp;D there were serveral schools of magic and being a specialized caster meant you could not take part in certain schools because they conflicted with one another....<br>
<br>
This is where EQ screws up...<br>
<br>
In D&amp;D Conjuration/Summoners were bad ass. You didn't want to even think about facing one. They could summon multiple pets that could deal with serveral opponents. However they had no access to the Invocation/Evocation school of magic i.e....NO NUKES!!!!<br>
<br>
Invokers  were nasty. Magic Missle, Fire Bolt, Lighting Bolt. You name it they had it. DO NO F00K with a Invoker or you would get worked over. However they had no access to Conjuration/Summoning. The key is those two schools of magic are the most powerful offensively. So it wouldn't be ok for you to allow a class to specialize in one while having access to the other. In D&amp;D Invokers/Evokers (EQ's version of the wizard class) had no ability to summon a familiar. Familiars, pets, elementals, monters were all in the realm of the Conjurationist. <br>
<br>
Also in D&amp;D if I can remember correctly (it has been awhile) every class had some form of abjuration ability. Also in D&amp;D enchanters were not gimp offensively....Ummmm Phantasmal Killer anyone? =)<br>
<br>
Basically if EQ wanted to stick with the tradition of the caster. Then every casting class should get...<br>
<br>
Root<br>
Rune<br>
Damage Shield<br>
<br>
These three ability are present for any specialized caster in any roleplaying game. I do not understand why EQ insist on gimping mages so heavily in this area.  The funny part is necros/enchanters/Wizards all have....<br>
<br>
Root<br>
Rune<br>
Damage Shield <br>
<br>
Yet mages only get one of the 3 defensive spells all magic users par take of? Makes no sense at all.<br>

Sure, magicians can get root. But wouldnt that mean necromancers pets should get closer to magician pets in tanking or wizards getting a defensive pet?<br>
Magician pets can be used for crowd control puposes (epic does it very well) so a root would just make it even better. And if offense is realy tied to defense, then that would require some loss of offense for magicians, wouldnt it?<br>
<br>
Runes, magicians get the phantasmal line instead of that. Regen and self healing fill a similar use.<br>
<br>
33 point single/group damageshield is a bit more then 5 point single target or 12 point self only one. Its not very comparable.<br>
<br>
The bottomline is that while adding root to magicians may not be a big deal realy so will removing class disadvantages make classes more and more alike. Magicians getting root and wizards getting tanking pets is a large step towards making the two classes the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujazzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 206<br> <font color=#333333>(9/9/02 8:31:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: discussion/brainstorming root or snare?</span><hr size=1> Your logic is very flawed....<br>
<br>
Does enchanters/wizards/necros <br>
<br>
having root/rune/stun/damage shields make them remotely alike? The answer is no.  There for your entire argument has no merit. Those 3 classes have root/rune and are nothing alike. If mages received root we would still be very much different from those 3 classes. Also Mages are pure casters not wizard offspring. I think people look at mages as hybrid of wizards which isn't the case. We are a pure casting class and only thing we have in common with wizards is the fact that we wear robes. All classes get some form of dd even bards. That is a universal skill that is shared by every class in EQ. Does the fact that a bard can nuke make him the offspring of a wizard? No. So just because mages nuke doesn't make us Wizard hybrids. We are just another class in the game that can nuke. We are one of many. We should have root.<br>
<br>
Also more flawed logic is the damage vs. defense. Well wizards can out damage us on raids with very little effort. We rock them in experience groups and they rock us on raids. If we were given root who would that make us more offensively powerful?  Also a GV pet isn't going to mezz any mob in UP or CT for very long lol. I don't hang out in velk and sebillis very often sorry. Using pets to hold off mobs in sebillis (two year old content) isn't even compariable to trying to mezz/tank a add in UP or CT. You pet will get owned in a few secs. Epic has no part in this discussion.<br>

Only enchanters have normal runes they can cast on others. Only Wizards have runes that only absorb spell damage, and can cast only this on others. Only nercomancers and enchanters have mezz type of stuns and this is necromancers only type of stun. Only Enchanters have non-damage stuns. Only wizards and enchanters can cast damage shields on others and of those two only Enchanters are remotely worth using.<br>

Does this answer how much diffrent those abbilities are for those classes?<br>
Actualy, magicians root from earth pet is more alike those classes root spell.<br>

What is then the reason to give mages a wizard spell (root)? It is its own class and doesnt need spells just because another class have them.<br>
A quick cast pet would make alot more sense if you need some extra self defense.<br>
This can be gotten with a class AA skill right now, but thats a bit late in game perhaps.<br>

If you have moved beyond the 2 year old content, then you should have moved beyond doing 2 year old quests.<br>
A wizard will also have more trouble surviving rooting an add in UP or CT compared to sebillis, even more so without epic.<br>

Incidentaly, if you check on logs by Mages so are the damage done by a Mage on raids very near (sometimes higher then) Wizards.

The reason for magicians not getting root doesnt have anything to do with offence. Its because magicians get good pets as defence instead. Wizards gets root and snare, but no pets. Necromancers get defensivly weaker pets, but defensive spells as well. Wizards and magicians both have their defense tied up in one area.<br>
=====================<br>
<br>
Well, comparing to wizards, our pets are somewhat equal, offensively, to their better nukes. Considering that, now consider that root is 100 times better and more versatile than pets defensively. This leaves us a bit behind.<br>
<br>
And how do I presume mage is balanced to wiz offensively? Well, wizard out damages us in short period of time. In a long period of time, we typically out damage them. Equal, but different.<br>
<br>
And how do I presume pet is not root defensively? Well, first of all, once our pet is dead, there goes our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> offense.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Not to mention, the casting time of pets is long, so the chances of getting new defense out without any defense is slim. Compare to root or snare. Once they're gone, they cast quickly. So getting defense in a pinch is npnpnp. <br>
<br>
Root can be used to defend against multiple mobs. Agro too many, just move one away from the crowd and park it. there, it's not doing anyone harm, save a slight hit to your mana pool re-rooting it. Pets on the other hand, are really only defense against 1 thing at a time. Sure, with a DS it could sorta work on 2 or more, but mana wise it would be inferior to just killing 1.<br>
<br>
Root is a low mana cost. Pets take 200 mana for a level 49 pet, 400 for 57-60 GVocs, and 500 mana + 5min refresh + mana gained or lost from swapping equip slots with huge mana values while near full mana. To upkeep a pet, you have to heal it. I don't know the heal heal/mana, but i know it sucks. To prevent pet from taking a lot of damage, you must nuke, which takes even more mana but kills mobs faster. Allowing a pet to defend against more than 1 mob only makes this more inefficient mana-wise. Root, however, for well under half the mana cost of any of our pets, can potentially defend for a longer period of time, against more mobs.<br>
<br>
So, defensively, root is waaaaaaaaay better than a pet. Comparing just to wizard, do you think we're waaaaaaaaaaay better offensively? I don't. We certainly may be better, but it's more of an apples and oranges deal. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 573<br> <font color=#333333>(9/10/02 7:51:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> - Dude, 10 second root is seriously no good.

This is because the magician already is very good at handeling single mobs and this would effectively turn a crowd into singles. The magician is the king of static spawns.<br>
<br>
The magician does, however, need to be just a little better at crowd control. Someone suggested a summoned item with charges of root. This idea has possibilities. The number of charges should be limited to maby three and the cast time and recast time should be long. Something like 30 sec cast time and 20 mins recast time. The item could be made drop and usable by all. The item should be introduced at a low level, maby lv 20, and the quality of the root should be based on the players level. This way you get the much needed escape option, without adding a new farming tool to the game.<br>

This is why the Magician epic was designed the way it is now.<br>
<br>
The epic spell (Summon Orb) summons an item (Orb of Mastery) with 1 charge (Manifest Elements) which is a 20 second cast.  The epic spell itself has a recast of 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
This in effect (ignoring the inventory shuffling) is an item with a cast time and recast time.<br>
<br>
The epic used to be something like a 20 second summon, with an instant click summon pet.  Verant deemed this too powerfull, and came up with the above solution. <p><FONT SIZE="3" COLOR=#FFFFFF FACE="Comic Sans MS, Sans-Serif, Courier New, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I actualy agree with most of your post apart from this, what you are missing is that pets also have advantages over root. Not very strange as its alot easier to notice strenghts in others compared to weaknesses. So I will give some examples of roots disadvantages.<br>
<br>
Root can be resisted as often as 1 of 4 times cast depending on the mob. A pet wont generaly instantly die when sent against a mob.<br>
<br>
Root get a new chance to break (same chance as initial resist) from every damage spell cast. A mob will stay on the pet as long as you do not nuke too fast.<br>
<br>
Somewhat obviously perhaps if you read the above, so will you get hit while using root most of the fights unless you have some way of outrunning mobs. Wizards are as good at that as magicians are. The only way for a wizard to use root without getting hit is to have som run speed boost. A magician could also use this to be able to cast a new pet without getting hit.<br>
<br>
Another side effect is that you will generaly have to use root several times each fight. At 30 to 100 mana for roots, so will this quickly add up to cost more then magician pets do.<br>
<br>
Pets also do some damage as a bonus, this extra damage is generaly much more then the small advantage wizards have in mana efficiency. This is very noticeable at lower levels making wizards more dependant on equipment then mages. It requires some decent int/mana to be able to kill 1 blue mob on a full mana bar.<br>
<br>
The dependancy on mana to do damage is also noticeable when handling adds. Every root on an add is that much less mana to use for killing the main target.<br>
<br>
Root will also work poorly on magic resistant mobs and not at all on mobs that are imune to root (not that uncommon). A mage can switch to fire based damage, healing pet or chain casting pets to get around that.<br>
<br>
Quote by Krilren:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
So, defensively, root is waaaaaaaaay better than a pet.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
No, pet is far better then root defensivly.<br>
<br>
But wizards doesnt only have root, after level 29 they also have snare. Snare doesnt have the disadvantage of randomly breaking so are much more reliable then root. There is still a chance of resists and being AE its not safe to cast in melee even if you can channel it. At 75 mana for the cheapest one so will it cost about as much as casting a new pet now and then. At least at higher level when pets costs more.<br>
<br>
Root + Snare is somewhat equal to Pet defensivly. Against single targets so are pet much better, while root and snare can handle more targets. It is generaly only mages themselves that consider mages to be defenseless.<br>
<br>
Pet + Root would be much better defense then Root + Snare. So the question is why mages need to be more defensive then wizards?<br>

<br>
Personally I would prefer a regular root, but seeing as VI might deem that unbalancing, I thought that they could deal with that the same way they dealt with mod rods.<br>
<br>
I.e. we could get to summon at low level a lore item with one charge of root, and at high level a lore item with three charges of root. And I mean regular root, no 10 sec root or any other crap like that.<br>
<br>
make the summon time long, i.e 10-12 sec ,and some recast if they wish, but the cast time on root should be the same as regular root.<br>
<br>
Can make that item tradable too.<br>
<br>
Again, I would prefer regular root, but I think that summoned item with root (or snare for that matter) would go along better with what our class is designed to be.<br>
<br>
Most people covered pretty well why we need a root. To me being able to handle adds without blowing the entire mana bar, or having to run for zone, or gate, or camp is very essential to being a good solo class. Seing as how mage is billed as such, they should give us the ability to defend ourseleves while soloing.<br>
<br>
We already solo slower than necros due to no innate mana regen, there is no need to make that solo even slower by making us interrup our gameplay by running for zone or gating.<br>

i think you missunderstood Krilen, root is much better defensive.<br>
<br>
Okay, say mage and wiz both have run3. The wizzard only needs to run so much that he can get in root (i dont know exact cast time .. 3 or 4 isnt it?). <br>
<br>
The mage instead would need to run so far from the Mob that he can cast his 12!!! second pet (unfocused without any particular AA skills as quicksummoning). <br>
<br>
The mob might even be out of Agro range by when the mage is able to cast his pet again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
So IMO root is better quick defense then Pet, and i think that is what Krilen was mentitioning. <br>

3) does not drop from spells cast on critter being rooted but will die very fast depending on what mob its cast on (ie give the root hp)<br>

Somewhere in beta i think some mage pissed off the idiot in charge of mages and has had it in for them ever sence, the same idiot who did mage epic also did rogue wpm (i wont call it a epic, it took me longer to get my foci then it does most rogues to get their epic). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=332.topic&start=21&stop=29>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=332.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=332.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=332.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=332.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=332.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=332.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
