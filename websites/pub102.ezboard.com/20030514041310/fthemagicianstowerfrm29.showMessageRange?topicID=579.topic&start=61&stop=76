<br>
Why not test it by implementing some version of the &quot;full&quot; PvP-included change (for instance, the 75% solution proposed somewhere in this thread) to Blue servers first, as it only affects duels and arena combat, a rather minor portion of Blue server life? This way you'll get a nice sample size for feedback (as people will voluntarily test it and try it out) without having thousands of people negatively affected if its found to be too strong in the balancing process.<br>
<br>
Although I'm not an epic mage, I would tend to throw my support behind option 2 for the epic. An instant-cast pet from the Orb would add the benefit of making the epic into the often-requested &quot;stored&quot; pet. This idea (summoning a pet and storing it for emergency use) has been belted around a lot and would be a very welcome addition to the scope of benefit from gaining the epic. <p><table width = 200 border = 0>

<br>
I think a nice change would be to replace the mage class AA Mass Group Buff (wholly worthless) with something like the resistant disc that melees get.  Make it a skill that you can use to increase the resists of your pet by say +15, 25 and 40 to all resists for each level of the skill.  And while I'm griping about AA skills I love how we cant even use our elemental form in places where illusions are KoS... its funny, Ive never heard of wizards not being able to use manaburn...<br>
<br>
PS - While you are looking at mages could you check out the pet haste cap and how it affects things like : Burnout4 + Muzzle + Epic = Burnout3 + Epic <p><a href='http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=106776' ><img src='http://www.goresto.com/eq/master_of_elements.gif'></a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unalaanidarkfyre.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NalaaniDarkfyre</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/21/02 9:19:51 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzebanar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zebanar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 212<br> <font color=#333333>(7/21/02 3:07:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=579.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  I hope..</span><hr size=1> I hope they don't forget about MS III and GV Air pets.

OR remove the caster nerf on there damage. Right now casters only do 2/3 damage with their spells.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Around the velious era it made a lot of sense to unnerf the PvP spell damage nerf...but now with the changes since Luclin that would be insane.  With critical hits, AA's, Elnerick's Electrical Rending, etc... there is just no way it would make sense to unnerf spell damage.  Most casters other than mages are pretty well balenced now in PvP.  (I'm talking at level 60 with AA's.)   The single thing that makes level 60 epic mages under balenced is the ability of bards and enchanters to poof the epic pet.  Even when I summon 2 elemental blankets, 3 daggers of symbols, and get resist magic cast on my epic pet, its only a matter of time before a bard will successfully poof it.  Of course I know not everyone has their epics, and a mage without an epic is a joke in PvP.  Hybrids and melees most of the time, don't even need to counter a non-epic pet....they just kite them around and ignore them.<br>
<br>
This is why I am so dissappointed that this changes will not effect PC's casting on pets.  In one single swoop Verant could have balenced Mages and Beatlords in PvP.  In fact, in my mind this would have been THE perfect solution which would have finally balenced these classes for PvP.  I can't speak to much for Beastlords as I have never played one, but as a mage I think this would have completely balenced the class.  We'd still be stuck with our gimpy slow casting nukes, but now our pets, which SHOULD be our major offensive ability would be a force to be dealt with.  <br>
<br>
It would have had the effect of giving a very nice boost to necromancers which are allready an incredibly powerful (if not the most powerful) PvP class, and I think most people agree that necros don't need much if any PvP balencing at this point.  (The most powerful necros on SZ readily admit that they are overpowered in PvP.)  However, most level 60 necros I see don't use their pets in PvP very often at all.  Maybe if this change had affected Pets in PvP it would encourage them to use their pets more often.  Even if level 60 necros did start using their pets more often it still wouldn't have been as large a boost to them as it would have been for Mages or Beastlords since Necros cannot SoW or Velocity their own pets,  and a pet without some sort of movement speed enhancement is pretty worthless in most PvP situations.<br>
<br>
Yes, and epic pet with velocity, and close to or over 200MR might be a &quot;bit devastating&quot; in PVP...but shouldn't it be?  Mages have the hardest epic in the game.  Given the effort that goes into obtaining teh mage epic, shouldn't mages have a devestating PvP weapon?  Does Verant apreciate how &quot;devastating&quot; a level 60 SK with 5k hp's and the ability to summon that SoC speed horse is?  Or how devestating, a wizard casting crit lure of ice's is?  Or how devestating manaburn and lifeburn are?  Or how devastating &quot;funeral Pyre&quot; can be?  What about how devastating a primal weilding warrior with 7k hp's riding on a horse is?  Yes it would be a powerful weapon for the mage, but it would not overpower us.  It would only bring us inline with where the other devestating classes are at this point, and it would still cost us a lot more work to get there.<br>
<br>
EDIT: BTW, I know SOE said  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> We didn't want to make a change that would probably be more than a bit devastating in PvP without having more information.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;, which implies that they may implement this change or other changes later on for PvP.   No one on a PvP server believes that SOE will address Mage PvP balence issues at a later time.  Those of you who play on blue servers might not be able to apreciate just how much of a lack of credibility SOE has with the PvP community at this point in time, but that IS the situations as it stands. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uforyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Foryst</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0> at: 7/21/02 7:32:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utarqal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tarqal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(7/21/02 9:11:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=579.topic&index=65>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  pet resistances</span><hr size=1> I haven't posted here much, and y'all are gonna think I am nuts... such as life...<br>
<br>
I think pet resistances are fine as they are. Remember, this is a PET we are talking about, not some kind of avatar. A 60 shaman can slow and root your pet? So? It is enough right now that my pet outdamages 99 percent of the level 60 warriors i play with. He outdamages every ranger, every paladin, and almost all the shadowknights. I can solo the north and west halls of howling stones, and with a 60 cleric, can pull and keep the spawn down on south hall. Is it such a bad thing that end game mobs like level 70 dragons can cause my pet such magic based damage? Also, how cheap will it be when we buff the hell out of the mage controlling a pet, put him out of AE dispell range, and let the pet sit there and tank away, whilst all the real tanks are dispelled and need to use strategy to maintain their buffs for resistances. I know this would be nice for us, but, already people are complaining about mage pets being overly tough. I think this resistance change makes them even more tough, and will draw enough attention to get us nerfed down the road.  Are we truly gimped by having a pet with level 49 resist rates that we can chain cast and not care if it dies? In the case of the epic, are we gimped because he quads for 77 against a fearing dragon for 3 mins while we make him fearless? Is this really something we NEED? Is this just gravy?<br>
<br>
I am sorry to be the single dissenting opinion here, but our class rocks, folks. I love my mage, and I think we are balanced, powerful, great at soloing, great in groups, great for farming.... Sheesh, I have a tough time finding thigs we can't do...<br>

This is designed to help raiding, and there is no way a mage pet outdamages a ranger unless the ranger is using stuff like lupine daggers or something.  Epic can keep up with warriors *sometimes*..Other times it can do around 50% less damage than they do<br>
<br>
And yeah our pets can hide around walls, but you gotta remember players get healed.  A cleric isnt going to spend mana to heal a pet, and rightfully so, pets need ways to not get damaged.  They *need* resists especially the epic pet which has basically none <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60178">

At first : it would be ok if a lvl 60 shm can cast on my epikpet I have np with that  also if a lvl 70 dragon land a spell on my pet but what we're talking about is : is it ok that a green mob land spells on the epic cause it resists NOTHING ? <br>
<br>
Don t want to be rude but you say your pet outdam 99% of the warriors and every ranger paladin and SK ? Are those ppl naked and fighting with hand to hand or something ? <br>
<br>
Try to outdam a good one of these classes :<br>
Maybe a paladin with flamberge or a warrior with bloodfrenzy and BOC etc ? And I would love to see you outdam a ranger with trueshot and the right abilities and primal or AOW bow good luck <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Although I am lazy, I think perhaps I will try and do some research. In my own experiences, I easily outdamage those classes, though I certainly have no hard evidence. Simple fact is that in XP groups, mobs die a lot faster with Ubober than with a ranger/pally/War in his place. I will try and get a parsed log put together in some Velks/Seb/HS groups demonstrative of this belief. I certainly don't feel we are so powerful in raids against end game mobs, and that was never my contention. <br>
<br>
As for resistances, I dueled my pet with a cleric the other, day. Yes, clerics suck in duels, but, they have a quick casting root spell.  <br>
<br>
Level 60 cleric vs Ubober, the cleric had &quot;immobilize&quot; resisted 17 of 19 times in a fight. With 130 Resistance, the cleric was being nuked a LOT for about 120 or so points of damage. Of course the cleric got waxed, but the point of the duel was to contest that pets dont resist for crap. Maybe the epic has just a good resist to magic based root. <br>
<br>
Again, i'm not a programmer, I am simply going off of my experience. My pet seems to resist things quite well, but I need more concrete analysis than this. If anyone else is good with parsers, please post some comparisons of pet damage vs some of these other classes. End game mobs, XP groups.. whatever you feel is most appropriate. I would like some concrete analysis before I crystalize this theory in my own mind. <br>
<br>
I appreciate the comments thus far, I am not one to stick to an opinion if it is wrong, so lets get some hard factual data. I've been playin this game, off and on, since 2 days after it came out. I love my mage, but I surely don't want to get him buffed all to hell so someone can nerf my poor little elemental despite me. :P<br>

Hardly a difficult area, but I had parses of it from both my perspective and my ranger friend's so I know its acurate.<br>
<br>
At the end of two hours the pure melee damage of the epic pet and an level 60 ranger looked like this:<br>
<br>
Ranger: 212,015dmg.<br>
Epic Pet: 109,656dmg.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I don't really have enough time to go into the log with more then that, or put them up atm.  Keep in mind, that is purely melee damage.  If spells were counted the epic's damage would have gone up...but so would the ranger's.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure what makes you say exactly that a pet can outdamage the classes you mentioned on its own.  But if your going by the fact that things die faster when you are there then when the other classes are...then you could be correct.  As a whole, pet and mage, I can outdamage rangers, warriors, and paladins up to a point.  I seriously doubt that your pet is doing it alone, though. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2001<br> <font color=#333333>(7/23/02 4:31:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=579.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PET RESISTANCE UPDATE FROM RICH</span><hr size=1> Tain:<br>

The lack of pet resists is the main reason why mages are considered one of the worst PvP server classes.<br>
<br>
On the subject of PvP, I think that melee damage should be reduced to 66% like spells.  The penalty on nukes should not be removed.  Pet melee damage is reduced in PvP by 66% (when epic hit for 68 max vs mobs, it was only hitting for 44ish max in PvP, now I assume it only hits for 51ish), so I think it is only fair to have PC melee damage reduced also; or have the pet melee penalty removed.<br>
<br>
There is also a bug right now in arena duels, where if your pet crosses in front of one of your bolts, it will suicide.  This makes bolts very hard to use in arena duels (which is where I do 99% of my duels).<br>

<br>
The resistance change only affects spells cast by NPCs, against pets that are summoned by players. <br>
<br>
We didn't want to make a change that would probably be more than a bit devastating in PvP without having more information.<br>
<br>
-thats typically verant, dammit this would finally fix mages pvp problems, but no they prefer to slap mages on pvpservers once more. verant doesnt know @#%$ about pvp or they would have removed Manaburn allready, rz is crowded of those one shot kill then nexus gate wizards.<br>
