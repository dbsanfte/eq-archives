The parse was done in PoD and the mob was a pile of bile.<br>
<br>
Info on this parse...<br>
-Both pets had Burnout IV<br>
-Both pets had phantom armor summond and given to them.<br>
-I used /pet attack to engage on mob, then /pet hold so the pet would just take hits and not cast or hit back.<br>
-I alternated between healing the tanking pet, and re-rooting the mob.  The heals were so I could extend the fight time.<br>
-Misses and damage shield info was turned on.<br>
-The same mob was used for each pet.  I kept him rooted while I canni-pet to get back mana for the next tanking.<br>
-The only spell I cast on the mob besides root and blind was malosini.  He was malosini'd for both pets.<br>
-My result for mob DPS started after the pet was backed off and the mob was hitting the pet, and it ended when something happened to alter the mob DPS.<br>
-I was able to get a strait parse for the 61 air, but root broke and I had to recast, back off pet, and begin to parse tanking on epic.  So epic pet tanking is in 2 parts.<br>
<br>
The parse got messed up from a few things.  Here's a few notes about it.<br>
<br>
-When the Air pet was tanking, I took 2 hits because the pet got pushed back and he was in melee range of me for a second.  But me taking hits would help the 61 Air pets tanking to appear better.<br>
-When the epic pet was tanking, I accidentally let root break and the mob aggroed on me.  I had to kite and engage pet until he got aggro.  Then I rooted the mob, back off pet, and moved back in to get more tanking info.<br>
-The air pet was being hit from behind the whole time, I could not seem to turn him around.<br>
-For the first half of epic pet tanking, he was hit from behind.  For the second half he was hit from the front.<br>
<br>
============================================<br>
=============== THE RESULTS!!! =================<br>
============================================<br>
<br>
Mob DPS on 61 air: 65.77<br>
Fight time: 3 min, 25 sec<br>
<br>
Mob DPS on Epic (1st half): 67.60<br>
Fight time: 1 min, 21 sec<br>
<br>
Mob DPS on Epic (2nd half): 56.98<br>
Fight time: 2 min, 46 sec<br>
<br>
============================================<br>
My conclusion:  Way too many things happened to call this an average result.  This needs to be redone much more cleanly at a later date.  I need to work harder on mob placement being consistant.  Having said that, it seems that Epic and 61 air take the same damage from behind.  When the Epic was facing the mob his damage taken went way down as expected.<br>
<br>
It would appear to me the actual &quot;damage mitigation&quot; abilities of those pets are about equal.  I'm not going to bet the farm on that right now though.  Much more testing is needed, but it looks that way so far.<br>
<br>
I'll post the whole log file in a reply. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

I know this is a sensitive subject to most (primarily non epiced) mages. It's important for some to feel justified in ones Uberness by playing the &quot;my pet is better than your pet&quot; game.  However, it doesn't help anything and usually just causes emotions to charge.<br>
<br>
I have never run a parse, I have no idea how. If someone would tell me how I would happily do so.<br>
<br>
However, I run pets in PoS and PoV almost every night, as well as other locations. Admitedly, in groups, I use the epic almost exclusively because his damage output is higher (there is no reason to debate this. The above test is not the only parse we have seen. There's no shame in accepting that). Anyway, having never run a parse (but have read several and conducted my own TIMED tests (actually just soloing for xp really) on Coldain Bodyguards at level 61 (epic killed Bodyguard Stonie a full 30 seconds on average quicker than the 61 to the point that it was simply inefficient xp wise to use anything but the epic). In PoS I usually chain pet so the epic isn't practical in this way, and against giants there I usually use the 62 water for the backstab (and no matter what you do, eventually someone's pet gets killed so it's more mana/time efficient to use a 62), but mostly because I've been told that these giants can't be stunned by pets, and have yet to see a stun land myself.<br>
<br>
Against Raid level mobs I use either the water or the epic since I still &quot;feel&quot; like the epic is dishing out more damage, in this case there is NO foundation for that (its just true everywhere else so its hard to feel like it changes here or there), but I will say there is NO indication that I have seen that his melees hit any less against Raid mobs, although I'm sure there is a proc issue for all pets, mostly the epic.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I say all this to point out that it's not only true, but it's also OKAY that the epic has more dps then the 61+ pets. It shouldn't anger or threaten anyone. Yes there are strategic times to use the other pets (cleric and I in PoV Inner determined to use the 61 because, although the fights were slightly shorter with the epic, she needed to heal the tank a bit more because the 61s more frequent stuns were keeping the tank from taking as much damage). It's up to each individual mage to determine whats best for him and his group. Arguing this is kinda like one tank screaming at another because he uses a 2h slash instead of a 2h blunt, and (as is happening here), the guy doesn't even have a 2h slash SKILL!<br>
<br>
1 parse test, statistically speaking, invalidates the test. Random elements (each damage roll is random, the mystery of the epic not getting hit...which is unlikely to occur again if you run another test), can effect results. I would suggest doing a minimum of 3 tests per and average all tests. This would give a more accurate result that, should anyone argue it, would be announcing how much of a fool they are. I would also recommend testing on a fixed higher level mob. Too bad no one thought to try this test on the Soulbinders before Verant fixed them (I did however manage to get all my SKs attack skills including HtoH to max on them before they did.  hehe). Perhaps running several parses on Mini's. Or how about a /pet hold ed 62 pet? Or tell me how to do a parse. I'll be happy to run them. On the other hand, the fact that some posters do not HAVE an epic, invalidates their arguement because nothing they have to say is from experience, only speculation, and is therefore invalid in any statistical analysis...but still...thank you for sharing, but please understand I put no value toward influencing my experiences in anything that two particular unepiced naysayers have said since they have yet to offer any evidence. I look forward to hearing some clear evidence from them,however. Both of them seem pretty smart and I'm sure their data (soon as they get some) will be pivotal to the discussion.  Opinions and speculation are fine, but at this point...&quot;Just the facts, mame. Just the facts&quot;.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163088"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arwennevenstar81>Arwenn Evenstar 81</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(2/27/03 1:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8858.topic&index=107>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> I don't know what the argument is all about. I am level 61, and have my 61 pet and I am also epic. By all means, use the epic if the proc and stun are going to land. It will by far outdamage the air pet while in any Tier 1 zones on a mob that won't resist the stun and the proc. I use epic pet on everything except boss mobs, or mobs that are immune to the proc. How could you not? The proc is a massive dps tool. <br>
<br>
If you're fighting a mob in a Tier 2 or 3 and up PoP zone, you'd better be using that air pet if the epic's procs won't land. The pet is ~10 levels higher. How could you not think it would outdamage the epic?<br>
<br>
I primarily use epic in my travels, because it does way more damage than the other pets. But on a high high level mob, use that higher level pet. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=568885">Arwenn Evenstar</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
in all these parses, when you consider both tanking and dps you gave the air pet a set of phantom plate and a pair of proc weapons, right?  if not then the numbers will be off.  i just thought of that since you only mention muzzle when you were describing the setup.  of course air still won't proc like epic does, but it would add some damage there that needs to be accounted for.  not really sure what the armor would do for tanking purposes, there should be some difference, but honestly i got no idea how epic's armor compares to phantom plate.  if you gonna compare the two accurately you really need to have air fully equipped when you test.  if i'm using air to tank he's got 2 swords, girdle, muzzle, plate set and full time DS for sure.  with epic all that is basically innate except the muzzle.<br>
<br>

<br>
Personally, I don't agree.  I see two situations here...  #1, when going through pets fast and buffs and such are wasted because the pet dies too fast.   And #2, when we ARE going to keep a pet for awhile so we arm it up and buff it.<br>
<br>
NEITHER one of those is going to be the &quot;True Test&quot; for epic Vs. Air, because they are very different situations and neither one is what we do all the time.  The fact is mages do both.  Sometimes we keep a pet, sometimes they die fast.<br>
<br>
If a parse is done with both pets unbuffed, then take it for what it is.   A parse with both pets unbuffed!<br>
<br>
If a parse is done with both pets fully buffed and armed, then it's a parse with two fully armed and buffed pets and it does NOT represent the results of unbuffed unarmed pets.<br>
<br>
You can't say &quot;but the Air pet is better for chain casting&quot; then in the same breath say &quot;Well you should fully buff and arm both pets for testing.&quot;  No, wrong. Those are two different scenarios.  Most of the time when we chain cast pets we only burnout the pet and DS it.<br>
<br>
So take the parses I did for what they were.  If you want to see a parse with something different done with both pets, don't complain about this parse, just ask for somebody to parse pets with the situation you requested.<br>
<br>
Also notice, when I was looking at DPS both pets had muzzle and belt of Magi'kot, and 2x Blade of Walnan.  When I was looking at pet tanking, both pets had burnout IV (highest I can cast) and a full set of phantom armor. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

1) PoD, while PoP, is baby PoP.  Please go to PoV, PoS, or BoT.  Everything greens/light-blues out in PoD by 63.<br>

2) 3 minute tests mean nothing.  You need to run 30-60 minute tests to have any value.<br>

3) You can't seriously still think that a lvl 49 pet is anything close to a lvl 60 pet when hitting lvl 60+ mobs?<br>

All of your tests are seriously flawed.  And many post to you why they are flawed.  And you keep coming back with similarly flawed tests.<br>
<br>
If you want to be taken seriously, listen to why your tests are flawed, then execute them properly.  You're the only one who seems to think this has any value though, so don't expect anyone else to.<br>

Seems to me that you're the one that does not get it.  Do you even have epic?  If no then what are you basing all these assumptions on?  At this point I'm going to assume you DO have epic or I'm going to ask you to stop posting your opinion until you find somebody that DOES and run some tests.<br>
<br>
I said, from the beginning, and you still DON'T understand that I AGREE Epic is NOT the best pet all the time.  But he does beat out PoP pets in some situations, yes in PoP zones too.  All you have done in this entire thread is make statements that contradict the tests I'm running, the opinions of many mages and you offer ZERO proof of your claims.  I think it's about time YOU try to prove your standpoint. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

<br>
I dont understand this entire thread, is it just to say epic isnt outdated? fine, why, WHY, did you put this in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>GENERAL</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'<br>
Why not<br>
<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26" target="top">The Epic Pet</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Forum?<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with general mages, unless you see it worth the few hundred hours or so it takes to do an epic quest.  Unless your trying to spread &quot;awareness&quot;.  Good for epic mages, their epic isnt completly useless! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nimmamen>Nimmamen</A> at: 2/27/03 11:55:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eandori>Eandori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 668<br> <font color=#333333>(2/27/03 11:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8858.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: wtf</span><hr size=1> Yes, I am trying to spread awareness.
