I am Aanelar Clarityjunkie, level 62 Magician on Fennin Ro and long time troller of the mage boards. These are my frustrations with the current parchment system of spell aquisition as a &quot;casual&quot; player and a member of a smaller guild.<br>
     Initially, when PoP came out, I did not see any overt problems with the parchment system. Other than the annoyance of random spell returns on hand-ins, the system seemed ok. To avoid the frustration of getting lots of multiple spells I ended up buying several of the 61-62 spells, which I don't mind. I don't see any problem with a system where I have to spend my plat on a few spells. However, the problem begins with spectral parchments. Not only do I not have time to spend hours camping BoT mini's, I can't even buy the 63-64, even if I did have the plat to spend. Since the advent of PoP I have seen a grand total of 3 63-64 spells in the bazaar. One was a copy of Maelstrom of Thunder in the first weeks of PoP, a copy of Shield of Maelin and the other was a copy of Black Steel, which I kicked myself for having spent my plat on other things a few days before.<br>
     Why do I not see any spectrals...the simple anwser seems to be because mage spells simply aren't worth it for the farmers of spectrals. I see plenty of wizard and enchanter spectrals on the market. I have friends who play both of those classes and they have at least been able to buy a few of their spectrals. There are almost always copies of CoD and Agnarr's Thunder in the bazaar. They are not cheap but at least the are available.<br>
     Now I am stuck at the crossroads of level 62. Do I turn on the AA bar or stick it out to 65. My current leaning is toward AA's, which honestly I think should be flawed. Before PoP there was the incentive to get to 60 before worring about AA because of the advantages of being higher level and the primary advantage of being high level was better spells. The situation has now changed and it seems to me the 12-14 or so AA's I could get in the time it would take me to get to 65 would be more useful to me than 65 itself.<br>
     My assessment is that the parchement system has created a disincentive to level. I don't propose any radical changes, I just ask for a return to the old system where at least some the core spells are vendor bought and others a dropped. More importantly though, is that spells come into the game not as a nebulous &quot;x_parchment,&quot; but as a regular spells, which prevents the farmers from turning all of them in for spells of classes that simply provide the best selling prices. Note, that I am not trying to bash farmers in any way, they can still make their plat getting spells, but at least the spells be for different classes. I also think that there should be rare spells like Transon's Elemental Renewal, Garrison's, Anchients, etc. that set some members of a class apart from the average. I just don't want that to be the case for all of the spells.<br>

I'm missing blade of walnan, destroy summoned, and malosinia. I've gotten about 15 dupes in spectrals, and I don't bother looting ethereals anymore. Anytime I get a dupe it goes to the other mages in the guild. My guild just got into the elemental planes and in doing so, every boss drops like 4 spectrals up to that point. Soon enough everyone in the guild will have all their spells and eventually they will trickle out into the bazaar when we're all filled up on them. Have patience and you'll begin to see them out there. You don't have to farm bot minis for spectrals anyway. lotsa stuff drops them now. Yard trash in hoh can drop em. hobgoblins WERE, haven't been to pon in a while so not sure if that has changed or not. Good luck on it and just hang in there<br>

We were offered a glimmer of hope by the sage quests only to be informed by VI that oh, those useless little trinkets you got are the end of the quest even tho we hinted at new magics with our npc's.<br>
<br>
This system is not only a waste of time but a serious focus for anger by ALOT of people. You'd think for once they would listen to their player base and make an alternate way to get them LIKE THEY INTIMATED WITH THE SAGE QUESTS.<br>
<br>
In all my planar travels and killings i have only SEEN 2 spectrals drop and dont count on getting any new spells anytime soon. so for the time being it's 100% aa and 65 will wait until there's actually some benefit to getting it since a level 65 mage with 62 spells is only as good as a 62 magician with a little extra mana.<br>

<br>
Actually, I think it's working pretty much as designed, and it's working fairly well.  If you CAN access the high level zones, you'll get your spells first.  When you and your group have acquired the spells, then they'll go to the market.  Like any new item on the market in EQ, the prices are intially high, but eventually come down when supply begins to exceed demand.<br>
<br>
So, you can get into the plains early and get your spells and get to sell the excess for big money, or you can wait and get them later, either by going yourself or gathering the Platinum to pay for those that got there before you, or you can wait even more until the spell prices come down.<br>

<br>
2 new pets<br>
2 pet weapons<br>
new pet utility<br>
new self buffs (base, regen, resist)<br>
new pet buff<br>
new fire nuke<br>
new rain<br>
new focus items<br>
new damage shield<br>
<br>
The only thing of note is that 61/62 lacks an upgraded magic dd.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 63/64/65 you start hitting spells that actually DEFINE higher capablilty mages. You get upgrades to nearly all these lines, and new utility, all which help define the higher capability mage.<br>
<br>
So (with the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>possible</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> exception of magic dd), the parchment system is working very well. If your'e a casual mage, you have a very good chance at getting all of those &quot;base&quot; spells. More advanced mages get thiers upgrades to these base spells. This adds more definition across mages, instead of everyone always having all spells and being the same. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38898">Salash Penumbra</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Summoner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.midnightfury.org">Armies</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=immlazen>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#333333>(1/28/03 4:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1800.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  The Parchment System  </span><hr size=1> Ummhh Belhaven....thats a big fat NO!!!<br>

If you remember Verant said that POP would not be dedicated only to high end guilds.  So that is where the flaw is.  They stated something that is not true.<br>
<br>
For some reason we have those that got that &quot;Well im better then you complex&quot;.  The feel that no one else should be able to do anything in the game just because they dont belong to a high end guild.  <br>
<br>
It is also flawed because a 65 Mage with no Spectrals or Runes is the same as a lower level Mage in power output.  There should be some way besides waiting until the &quot;Snobs&quot; feel like selling there spells for others to get them.<br>
<br>
I am in a Medium sized guild.  Roughly 45-50 people with average level of 62.  I have majority of my spectrals, but mine came from being invited to hunt with family in high level guilds.  To me, thats bull...everyone regardless of who you a affiliated with should have a way to get Runes and Spectrals.<br>

Welcome to the world of melee.<br>

I think spells were always too easy to come by. Be thankful they decided for a half way approach. Our base spells (see above!) are easy to get, while the upper tier of spells are for the upper tier of mages, why is that such a bad thing? <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38898">Salash Penumbra</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Summoner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.midnightfury.org">Armies</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nemuneir>Nemuneir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(1/28/03 5:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1800.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Parchment System  </span><hr size=1> Remarkably missing from your list, Salash, is any upgrade to single-target non-bolt nukes.  I'm still using SoFB, which now feels a bit outdated, at 64.  The last time I was 4 levels away from my nuke was 56, and the difference between levels of nuke was an order of magnitude less.<br>
<br>
Black Steel is going to be one very contested spell.<br>
<br>
Another trouble for mages in particular is the sheer number of spells we have, and the relative rarity of mages with respect to many other casters.  There are fewer of us getting spectrals, and for each turnin there is less chance to get any particular spell, so it will take significantly longer for our spells to reach a 'reasonable' market value than most other classes.<br>
<br>
I do think that eventually the spells will be had by all -- but 'eventually' may be a long long time.  I would rather not wait a year for the tools that my class is balanced against.<br>

All it takes to get into tier two is a single group.  It needs to be a group that works well together to get thru the trials for POS and POV, but just about <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>any</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> group can get into COD.  All three of these zones can be hunted by the single group that got there.  <br>

TT is limited to 3 groups, so you need 18 folks.  Dunno about parchment drops once you get there. <p>Belhaven<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

Yes, I am flagged for HOH, Tactic, Bot, Pov, Terris, etc... but it takes more then one group to get to these zones.  Hell it takes a raid for a couple of them.<br>
<br>
But still it goes beyond what Verant said POP would be like.  It was suppose to be like the Trials (execution).  If you had people that knew their class and knew how to play it you could get flagged.  I got flagged the first day with no AE group.<br>
<br>
I dont have to hide behind a raid force.  I take pleasure in knowing I know how to get the most out of my Mage.  It should be like Verant said.  If a group is good enough they will make it to the other Tiers.  That is not the case.  I could understand if Tier 5 was raid force though.  But not Tier 2/3/4.  But just my opinion.<br>

<br>
First of all Salash a warrior improves with levels.  He does not need spells.  So your comment is not well thought out.  2nd you can say well Warriors need armor.  Ok,,,well guess what?  So do casters.  See casters gets it double.  We need armor and we need spells.  Also, a level 65 Warrior is alot better then a 61 Warrior with the same armor on.  A level 65 Mage is not much better then a 61 Mage with the same armor on if the 65 Mage does not have his new spells,,,,that is the point.<br>

If I could do the quest by myself then it would probably be worth it.  Also, its not about who is well liked.  See all my friends have this thing called JOBS,,,real life events, so that doesnt make the quest to suitable.  Also, depends on how often your guild raids...which is atleast 4x a week for my guild.<br>
<br>
Now to get into HOH you kill Aerin Dar....(RAID)<br>
Normally for COD you kill Grummus....(RAID)<br>
For Terris Thule you do the maze....(RAID)<br>
Tactics....(RAID)<br>
<br>
Do you get the point.  It is a raid and not a single group that you need to get into these Tiers.  I am a person that plays the game, so I do know a little that goes on within it.  Maybe not all the quests....but the raids I do.<br>
<br>
Now the problem is the spectrals and runes should be acceptable to others that cannot get into these zones because they are not in suitable guilds.  Like I said VERANT did say it would not only be for large guilds<br>

<br>
I never said warriors needed spells. What I meant was that warriors need upgrades (armour/weapons) to REALLY advance, just like casters need upgrades (spells) to REALLY advance.<br>
<br>
I never said a warrior does not improve with levels. He does, but so do we. Now while I will admit a melee would have a larger increase in power that a caster <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>based off level alone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. You must, however, look at the whole picture. If you consider the spells (even 61/62 ones) a caster would aquire getting to level 65, and the upgrades a melee would get getting to level 65, then I think the balance is in favour of the caster!<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2nd you can say well Warriors need armor. Ok,,,well guess what? So do casters.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Melee depend on armour and weapons FAR more than casters do.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>See casters gets it double. We need armor and we need spells</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Yes we need both, but we need armour less, and spells are FAR easier to get than gear. So actually when you look at it, we get our most important things (spells) easier than melee get thier most important things (armour/weapons!)<br>
<br>
<br>
PS, there are 6-man quests for Torment, Tactics, and Decay in game, with more yet to be discovered <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=38898">Salash Penumbra</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Summoner</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> of <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.midnightfury.org">Armies</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->!</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wildet>Wildet </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 226<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/03 12:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1800.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Parchment System</span><hr size=1> I think the point being made here though is while yes , the trail to get into PoV/PoS is fairly easy.. and the CoD one isn't really that BAD..<br>
<br>
<br>
Torment? NOt easy.. I doubt a single group could do that one in a week.<br>
Tactics? Also not easy in terms of getting the Dikau.. at elast on Rodcet its not.. NOt going to be a one week thing by far.<br>
HoH? Unless you have pppl playing 24/7, its not going to be easy at all to get the bricks of Prellium the other componets and hope they making of all the boxes are successful<br>
<br>
Besides.. Spec drops are RARE in PoV, only slightly better in PoS, CoD I've heard they are better, but Haven't bothered to get there yet.<br>
<br>
Now there ARE ways to get specs without going to any of those places.. the Factory in PoI trails.. sit in hte west alcove kill hte names bugs, always see 2-3 specs drops in 4 waves. Its BORING as hell, and the xp sucks, but its specs.<br>
<br>
I know for a fact I'll never see a lvl 65 spell. Heck, on Rodcet Spec parchment spells still sell for an minimum fof 30k. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :x --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/sick.gif ALT=":x"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What I think the original poster meant by the &quot;higher lvl planes&quot; comment was that in HoH and up, specs ARE more common.<br>
<br>
<br>
But getting their if your in a guild.. like mine.. that has no real chance of getting past PoV/PoS (Cept MAYBE BoT) Welp.. thats why people leave. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"> Wildet Manaweaver<br>
