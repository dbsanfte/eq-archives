<br>
I come here occasional and read all the post in most of the sections. For the most part mages have had a lot of good things happen to them. Is all this class balance imo NO. If you want class balance on magicians unless VI's sole purpose for us is to be a &quot;Support&quot; class is to give us more dmg on our spells, also we need Ice based spells. The 1024 dmg on our highest DD spell is the pits.  Thats where I see we need improvement is on the dmg on our spells Magic, fire and we need ice or cold based spells.<br>

There are descriptions that call us masters of summoning and pets, however.  I never read any mention of magicians being entitled to cold based spells, either.  If any class could be considered master of the &quot;elements&quot;, it would have to be druids, who use elemental and nature magicks to accomplish their ends.<br>
<br>
    Our stock in trade is summoning, though.  Nobody does it better.  We also have some other perks, like above average dd's. We have access to bolts and rains, Damage Shields that confer fire resistance, and a resist debuff that affects all but Disease Resist.  At the highest levels (55-60) our summoning abilities completely overshadow all our other talents, however.<br>
<br>
    On the issue of class balance, I agree that magicians should be &quot;up there&quot; in the damage dealing category.  On the other hand, our stock in trade should not be neglected, and it hasn't.  Pets have received upgrades, our efficiency in summoning them has received boosts as well.  We summon focus items for other nice boosts in effectiveness.  Our Class AA's noticeably favor the &quot;summoner&quot; role, and enhance gameplay accordingly.  Whether it's summoning them faster, resummoning them cheaper, or simply doing massive damage to summoned beings, we have a lock on this.<br>
<br>
    As much as I wish for greater damage capacity than we currently have access to, I can't say I am complaining in the least about the gifts given to our class since Luclin. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 590<br> <font color=#333333>(9/17/02 11:34:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Really want class balance ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The 1024 dmg on our highest DD spell is the pits.

Well, if you are all about dd's, then use pet canni to get mana back fast and nuke to your heart's content.  Until you get in a situation where Lure nukes are needed, nobody will be able to tell the difference between you and a Wizard, except you won't be begging for clarity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=archangelranari>Archangel Ranari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(9/18/02 4:11:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Bah...</span><hr size=1> Mage &lt;&gt; Wizard<br>

The description is in Sony's book describing every class.  It does say that Nukes is only bested by Wizards.  It even says we can call up powerful elementals to fight for us. It says we are self reliant because we can summon.  It did not say that was our main focus.  That is where the disagreements with Magicians come into play.  If you take 10 different people that read the same thing you will probably get 10 different answers.  <br>
<br>
A Magician power lies in his Nukes and Pet.  Verant once said that is the reason we have no defensive ability.  We summon no barrier to protect us, we cannot root, snare, feign death, etc.  A Magician is purely offensive.  Our Pets with our Nukes = Wizard offensive power.  At one time we were higher damage dealers then them.  To a degree we still are, because we can sustain our damage.  I ask Magicians to not lose sight of how they got to level 50, it was not just summoning because that was not all you were about.  We were &quot;Best Soloing&quot; class.  How do you get to be that if it werent for damage dealing?  Or if you were only summoning?<br>
<br>
Also, we are suppose to be &quot;Master of Elements&quot;.  Not druids.  We should be able to control all elements.  For example:  How able a Air based Nuke (Air)?  Or a Earthquake to AE (earth)?  Water based Nuke that restricts breathing (water)?  We have our Fire nukes.  Those might be far fetched, but why cant we have something like those as damage dealing.  They represent the pets we call forth and would give us something that no other class have.  Oh well, Im back to EQ.<br>

<br>
A magician's power comes from a complete understanding on how his or her class works.  Our &quot;hot spot&quot; changes as we level.  Every class in the game that casts spells has some kind of dd's and/or DoTs, so that really isn't our most distinguishing feature.  Our damage comes from a combination of pets, nukes, damage shields, focus items, and pet buffs.  The whole package is the important thing, from the summons to the nukes, and everything in between.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> We were &quot;Best Soloing&quot; class.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I never heard any reference to magicians being the &quot;best&quot; soloers.  Druids and necromancers generally best a magician's efforts, particularly in the formative levels.  We have a unique flavor, however.  We were forced to improvise strategies to make up for our shortcomings, allowing us to shine in our own unique ways.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also, we are suppose to be &quot;Master of Elements&quot;. Not druids.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That is our title.  The truth, however, is obviously different.  Verant never envisioned water based, air based, or earth based spells for our use.  They gave those abilities to our summons.  Our more proper title would probably be conjurer, despite the other labels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for some biased opinions:  I have never felt a need for cold based spells in my repertoire.  Stuns would be nice, but they do carry quite a bit of aggro.  Root would be nice, too.  None of that makes or breaks the class, though.  I will work toward mastery of my class using the tools I have at my disposal.  At high levels, that includes taking full advantage of the AA skills available, the equipment I can get a hold of, and the spells I can cast.  The combination is a sight to behold. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 595<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 7:17:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Really want class balance ?  </span><hr size=1> Some quotes from Prima's strategy book:<br>

&quot;These masters of summoning are never truly alone...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;With the wiggle of a finger, the Magician can also conjure an array of powerful weapons...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;When it comes to pure damage, the Magician is, throughout most of her career, second only to the Wizard for Direct Damage output.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;While it is true Magicians are one of the best classes to solo (thanks to the combat support of their pets), they also excel in groups.&quot;<br>
<br>
No mention was made of magicians being the master of the elements.  It was, however, mentioned several times that we are the masters of summoning. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A> at: 9/19/02 7:17:31 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujazzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 10:15:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Really want class balance ?  </span><hr size=1> Do the mage epic quest.

<br>
Anyway the mage is a damage class. We are the only class that gets a great pet AND good nukes. Every other pet class lacks instant damage. That is really the major benefit of the mage class. Also back when the class was release/designed the mage PET was designed to be that added damage when we could not nuke mobs. The pet is able to hit what his master can not for the most part.<br>
<br>
My only problem with the mage class is it has not evolved. It isn't growing with expansions. It is for the most part staying the same and VI doesn't know what to do with us. The way to improve the class is to make us powerful at what we currently are powerful at. SUMMONING!!!!<br>
<br>
Give us some wanted summons. Focus items with good stats and procing weapons that someone other then my pet would want. Upgrade to Haste mask and a summoned weapon that procs 25% slow. Something to mitigate damage at least. Every class in the game has grown and expanded I don't see why we can't do the same. I would rather have a weapon that proced 30% slow and summoned focus items that gave +5 to all stats and saves +25hp/mana OVER lures, cold based nukes or root anyday. <br>

Jahson Aksot:  &quot;The Words of Magi'kot can only be shared with those elementalists whose minds are of balance.&quot;<br>
<br>
Walnan:  &quot;I am Walnan, elementalist, summoner, wanderer...&quot;<br>
  &quot;Magi'kot was the most powerful elementalist of his age...  He wished to obtain infinite knowledge and wisdom in order to further expand the arcane art of summoning.&quot;  &quot;The arcane art of Summoning is derived from the power of the elements which surround us.&quot;<br>
<br>
Akkstaff:  &quot;Magi'kot was a powerful elementalist, able to control the power of the elements which surround him.  He was not able to fully master the elements...&quot;<br>
<br>
Rykas:  &quot;An Elementalist's power come sfrom the Orb of Mastery.  The elements of Earth, Fire, Wind, and Water are contained within the orb.  The Master of Elements holds the Orb...  He can be found in the Plane of Air.&quot;<br>
<br>
   Akkstaff's quote is subject to interpretation.  Being able to control the &quot;power&quot; of the elements could simply be an expression for being able to control the minions of the elemental planes.  He didn't literally say elementalists can control the elements.  The only &quot;Master of the Elements&quot; mentioned was the npc in PoA.  Walnan's mention that the art of summoning is derived from the &quot;power&quot; of the elements hints further that our focus is definitely summoning.<br>

<br>
    Our class in not growing and evolving?  I beg to differ.  Pet power has increased since Luclin, with increased damage and max summons being automatic.  Magicians can summon large amounts of mana.  Focus items, dropped and summoned, have increased our power and efficiency.  I remember a lot of posts that were around post-Velious and pre-Luclin complaining about our relative inability to solo in comparison to necromancers, druids, and even wizards.  That's changed, especially with AA skills like Improved Reclaim allowing us to resummon pets virtually mana free.  What used to take me a full mana bar to solo now doesn't even dent it.<br>
<br>
  We are evolving, for certain, especially in the area of summoning.  It would be nice to be able to summon more powerful weapons and armor, items with more cool effects, but we simply don't have them yet.  Hopefully that will change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udmuerte.showPublicProfile?language=EN>dmuerte</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 3:09:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Bah...</span><hr size=1> pls keep the epic out of class balancing, it is not part of the mage class as a spell its a royal pain in the ass quest. when they make it a lvl 46 spell that all mages can get then ill think of it as part of the balance. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimmlazen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#333333>(9/19/02 11:11:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Really want class balance ?</span><hr size=1> Jochan, I have to disagree with you on a few things.  First of all the Magicians have not received alot of offensive upgrades since Kunark.  Our pets have received small upgrade as every Pet Class.  But, it wasnt Magician specific.  The summoned focus item increase all Casters power, its not just for Magicians.  The reason Im saying &quot;not just for Magicians&quot; is that every class has some form of offensive upgrade to there class alone.  Magicians have not seen that, so in a way those that rant about no power upgrade is right.  Also, you might like to perform Trod duty and think thats all a Magician is about, but a Magician should be more then that.  NO DEFENSE means pure OFFENSE.<br>

I would agree with that excepting Luclin, where we got upgraded nukes, more rt click nukes, a rt click 35 point ds, focus items, and a lot of sources of Flowing Thought.  The changes to pets affected US the most, as it significantly increased our dps and the tanking ability of our pets.  Luclin uber mobs were designed with significantly reduced resists so our nukes will land more often.<br>

I am not a die hard advocate of trod duty.  In fact, I tend to raid very little while I focus on levelling and AA's.  I am an advocate of using all our talents and abilities, whether in straightforward or unique ways, to take down bigger mobs more frequently and faster.  Post-Luclin has provided that for me.  It didn't give me a massive upgrade in nuking power, but I got an upgrade nonetheless, both in nuking power and summoning efficiency.  As an aside, trod duty at raids allows me to pick and choose my faction hits in zones where faction plays a significant role.<br>

<br>
Pets are our defense AND our offense.  They have served me well enough to keep single mobs from beating me to a pulp, and do significant damage to them.  When the pet has done its job, I resummon and let the next pet do its job.  Learning to use what skills, spells, and abilities you have been given makes you an asset.  Not learning and using them makes you a liability.<br>
<br>
Like I have already stated, I would like to have some more upgrades to pets, fire shields, nukes, pet buffs, and summoned items, but I will make do with what I have access to at this time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umadcazter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Madcazter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/02 5:59:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Really want class balance ?</span><hr size=1> It never stops amazing me how ppl can suggest something and then you have someone come along that as all the answers to everyones problems and make your suggestion look like crap. This was my suggestion not a freaking debate on what we currently have, bottom line is we are not, and have not been balanced as individual magicians. Focus items benifits all and for the most part there are only 2 that are most used 1) Braclet 2) Ring .<br>
<br>
Sometimes its just not feesable to have our pets by our side on raids. <br>
<br>
We are not wizards I appercaite that if I wanted to be the sole damager thats what I would have made. I am sticking by what I have said we need and that is More dmg on our DD's, Magic spells and we need ice based spells.<br>

I'm all ears on that one.<br>
<br>
Luclin gave us SoFB, Mael of Electricity, and the Ancient Shock of the Sun.  Sounds like better nukes to me.  PoP is offering more, although it's kind of incremental rather than gamebreaking.<br>
<br>
Also, give me your definition of class balance for magicians.  In my eyes, it's using the balance of our abilities to noticeably impact solo, groups, and raids.  With Luclin we do all three rather well.  We certainly need a little tweaking and bug fixing, maybe some more damage in the form of pets, ds, and dd's.<br>
<br>
I'm not the man with all the answers, but I do study the class intently enough to make observations, form opinions, and develop strategies that help benefit the class as a whole.  I thought you might appreciate some of my input. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujochangaladar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jochan Galadar</A> at: 9/20/02 8:25:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucyricusbloodbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 933<br> <font color=#333333>(9/20/02 8:38:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=349.topic&index=15>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Really want class balance ?</span><hr size=1> Heh, there is even a cold based right click nuke avaible for all mages - Iceshatter drops from The Itraer Vius in Akheva:<br>

<br>
I don't care about cold nukes too much reallly. Would be nice, but I've gotten this far without them. Main reason I'd want them is our magic nukes deal rather anemic damage (even clerics can do betetr magic damage than we can). I don't see anything game breaking about it either. The only excuse we've ever been fed about not having cold nukes is that it'd tread on the toes of wizards. Uhh HELLO ?! Look at the druids spell list, they don't just tread on the toes of multiple classes, they stomp on them with steel toed boots. Even if we got cold nukes comparable to our fire based ones, I don't see us threatening wizards at all. Their nukes will always have better damage, and better mana efficiency (as they should), in the end that usually matters more than the resist check.<br>

Druids/Clerics get the tremor line fo earth based AEs, perhapse we should to.<br>
<br>
The Wind Druid line would be a great addition for Magicians since they actually HAVE a stun component, not just a pushback (ala Shock of...) which doesn't interrupt NPC casting since it's movement only.<br>
<br>
That just leaves Water... More Magic absed DoTs? In the same line as the Enchanter Choke line. Minor DoT with some stat debuffs. Few Encs use this ability at high levels since they're too busy doing the crowd control thing. (HEY! Why not give us the Enc Choke line abotu 10 levels later than the Encs get the spells!)<br>
