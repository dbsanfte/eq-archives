It can't be charmed anymore. They should nerf the exploit that allowed someone to solo a named in BoT. But that's where I'm confused I guess. Some say they used an exploit, others say there was no exploit, just a charmed pet. I don't know the facts about that so I can't really comment.<br>
<br>
Slow *is* powerful. You can't even do PoP zones effectively without it. But if you think it is OVERPOWERING, do we nerf it too? KEI helps with the downtime, something players begged for. As for Bristlebane, remember, I died 3 times during that fight and so did the mages (at least once each). For me, half the fight I didn't even have KEI as slow was my priority and I couldn't muster up 900 extra mana to burn before the next slow needed to be be cast. I do have a weapon I got in Hate that has unlimited charges of the 29th level Clarity. I used that on me and the mages who died till I felt comfortable enough to cast KEI. So you can only blame my overpowerd KEI on *half* the fight. <br>
<br>
So now slow and KEI is overpowering, what's next... haste? I guess I don't understand why people want the nerf bat swung so many times. You take all the things away that sets the classes apart is it even fun to play EQ anymore?<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I don't see every enchanter doing the AA every 20 minutes thing or solo'ing Woushi or taking out named in BoT. I see a very small handful of them doing a few amazing things. Just as I see a few elite mages doing some neat things too. As Izelin pointed out, your average enchanter won't be able to do these things.<br>

I however do not blame COD, I blame the zone layouts tied in with spells.  Lets look at BOT, a chanter can invis, run all the way to the named(yard trash dont see invis), Pacify the room, charm a pet, attack the named, if pet dies or loses charm zone through a safe portal(dont get summoned when u do this) and come back, get new pet, continue to pound on the named until its dead because it has almost no regen.  Its not COD that wins the fight, its not COD that makes this doable, its a combination of zone layout(portals next to a named, etc) and spells available that make the right combination allowing a chanter to make this happen, or in my eyes, abuse it.<br>
<br>
Every class that feels it deserves or should be master in damage dealing are the ones complaining, but FACT is chanters have been capable of outdamaging mage pets through charm or DC for at least over a year, definitely since Luclin.   If you try and take away chanters charming ability, it would be like taking away nukes from wizards or pets from mages, its what chanters do.  Chanters who maintain and keep a charmed pet do so at a great mana cost and great risk to themselves and their groups when charm breaks.  Its a tool that comes with risk.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind since POP released chanters have been given powerful spells and tools all geared towards their ability to charm.  We have Arcane rune(1500HP shield), Eldritch Rune(1500 instant shield), new Runes and Uproar(450HP shield), total domination 3(reduces chance for charm to break), plus all the defense abilities.  Do you think Verant provided us with these because we get aggro from Tash? No, its because their plan was for chanters to use charm abilities MORE in pop then in the past.  Part of the problem is with POP chanters now have larger mana pools, can take over 3000HP in damage without losing any actual HP, allowing them to not only charm a pet, but to hold onto it almost indefinitely.  <br>
<br>
Charm isnt going away, and I hope VI recognizes that COD is a good tool for chanters and its not what needs fixing.  Just like they did with Wuoshi and making the other mobs in the zone uncharmeable, they need to look at the zones where charm is being used and eliminate the ability of a few chanters to exploit those zones.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=andurravenblade>Andur Ravenblade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 5:04:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> I feel 1 aa point in 20 minutes is exploiting a broken ability and most people who play EQ will more then likely agree.<br>

<br>
This is where I agree with both of you. I don't have a problem with the fact that mobs can be charmed to create monster mobs, alot of us don't and we don't blame CoD for that. We blame the scaling of the power of mobs in PoP. I don't have a major problem that you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> get an aa every 20 minutes. As you pointed out, there are other classes that can do that. Wizards quadding, for example. The people that have a problem with this are jealous that we can't do that, of which I am one fo them. I don't think CoD should be nerfed for the XP gain however.<br>
<br>
However, as long as mobs are available, I'm sure some enchanter somewhere will find somewhere to kill named with one charmed mob. IE) Sleepwalker with a charmed razorfiend (Not sure if it's been done before, but a suggestion).<br>
<br>
Manaburn wasn't bad in itself, but when they used it to kill named dragons that whole guilds couldn't kill, people yelled for a nerf, and it happened for almost a year. <br>
<br>
This is the same for CoD. No one really cared about it before enchanters posted that they could kill BoT named with it, that they could run ahead of groups killing in a wing in BoT and kill the named from their camp. No one cared untill enchanters went overboard on CoD and started killing this crap.<br>
<br>
We come down to two soloutions. Nerf something when somewhere is found where an enchanter can kill something he/she shouldn't be able to, or nerf CoD in itself. If you could find a reasonable soloution to these problems, then I'm all for them, but keeping CoD as it is right now, and/or keeping the zones as they are right now, is just not right, ecspecially BoT. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.power3d.com/Arch/member_inv.asp?member_id=263"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://hobie.homestead.com/files/Nukeb.JPG" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

What risk? The layout that Kiri posted lists the only risk as death and perhaps time wasted, but considering the gain (killing a named mob groups are needed for normal) I don't see that as a problem.<br>
<br>
Death once again is still not a risk, the fact that enchanters have to work to gain the ability to do this making it balanced is just retarded. No other class through amount of time put in can do what an enchanter can do. It doesnt matter if I play my mage 24/7 365 days a year I can never do what enchanters can do. Gaining spells and AA's are a part of the game, not some special thing that just enchanters have to do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=edyilcrossfire>Edyil Crossfire</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 5:34:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=87>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> I'm not an advocate for nerfing. <br>

However, I would like to say this.  In an RP context, one would think that charmed mobs, especially of higher level, would fight furiously to break that charm.  That would greatly affect their fighting ability.  They would hit for less, hit less often and attack slower as they have mental battles with their charmer.<br>

Soloing = Fine.<br>
<br>
How would you solo in PoP as an Enchanter without charm?<br>
<br>
If you take away an Enchanters ability to Solo here, then please be prepared to give up the same thing yourself.<br>
<br>
This mindless begging for a nerf will bring you no friends, nor will it win your cause.<br>
<br>
The reason Verant hasn't taken away CoD or just outright nerfed it is because it would take away 50% of the power that Enchanters have been given in PoP. Would you like to give up 50% of your spells? Maybe we can make it so mobs regen at 5x their normal rate unless a real tank is hitting it, that way Mages aren't putting real tanks out of a job.<br>
<br>
After all, someone mentioned that the reason CoD should be nerfed is because it will make it so nobody else can get a group. Well &quot;Pet Centered Groups&quot; are putting tanks out of a job and that's just as wrong in my opinion. Maybe Mages should only be able to summon a pet every 10-20 minutes so they aren't able to be used to replace tanks.<br>
<br>
If you say &quot;But we can't solo without them&quot; or &quot;Tanks have no trouble getting groups and the pet centered group isn't putting them out of a job.&quot;... well the same holds true for Charm groups. I don't see anyone having that much trouble getting groups so it's a moot point.<br>
<br>
Yeah I know.. I sound like an angry extremist. Which is also what many of you sound like.<br>
<br>
Again, I'd like to commend the people that have put honest forethought into their posts and offer viable alternatives.<br>
<br>
I'd like to say to those people that say &quot;Unless you can prove the risk, I just want it nerfed.&quot; Please offer something in the way of an alternative yourself instead of asking everyone else to do the work.<br>
<br>
Perhaps they will &quot;Tune&quot; some zones and mobs to balance it in tomorrow's patch. That would fix the &quot;End game encounter&quot; issues. But 20 minutes for an AA point isn't broken by any means. Especially if it involves another 30 minutes of rebuffing and meditating to get back to getting exp.<br>
<br>
Stuff like this sure brings out the ugliest in people. I hope we can get past this soon.<br>
<br>
*Edit*<br>
P.S.<br>
I killed in Plane of Growth with my Cleric/Necro combo and a level 60 Mage friend before PoP. With Alternating Rains he was parsing 250dps and could hold that for an entire fight. (Without being summoned and killed btw.) (His mana pool allowed him to do that for the duration of a 32k mob kill.)<br>
<br>
His rains were something like 3 waves of 600+ at the time. With PoP his rains are 3 waves of 900+... that would be around 350dps correct? None of that includes pet damage. Should this be nerfed too? According to some of you, the answer would be a definite yes.<br>

However, it is really tough think your arguements have any valitidy when you keep with the assumptions that PoP mages can solo with effeciency.  We can't.  I'm not saying that killing a mob here and there isn't possible.  I'm saying that mages, in general, don't go to any PoP zone to solo.  Doing so would be of no benefit.<br>
<br>
The arguement on the mage side of the fence is two fold.  First, chanters can easily out solo us.  Mainly because our solo ability for exp gain at those levels is all but non-existant.  So lots of mages think that using a pet to solo is an ability the mage should have.  If we don't, then why should an enchanter who can readily get groups way before the mage is considered be able to solo multi mobs for exp?  If we were considered first for groups, most mages wouldn't give enchanter charm the time of day.<br>
<br>
Second, the ability to kill boss mobs in the maner described here stinks of something being wrong.  That's obvious to everyone.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I don't advocate a nerf.  But please stop the assumption that the mage solos in PoP.  It simply isn't true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=soriak>Soriak</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/03 6:33:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> I think SOE is trieing to reward dangerous hunting more than chainpulling of low level mobs. Recent changes such as exp bonus for high level mobs seem to strenghten that point.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at exp gains:<br>
<br>
You could get 1AA every 4hrs soloing in FG (pre PoP). zero risk.<br>
<br>
1 AA every 2hrs in a full PoValor group, very low risk.<br>
1 AA every 1.5hrs in a full Halls of Honor group, low risk and chance to get spectrals.<br>
<br>
1 AA every 1hr soloing (with cleric bot, so more like duoing) in BoT, high risk - rare dropping eth/spec - very rare (rare named drop) rune.<br>
<br>
I haven't tried to exp in elemental planes yet, but based on the raid exp I think 1 AA every 45min or so in a full group at mid risk is doable. Not to mention tradeskill components for some really nice items. also spec/runes of course. (not sure if random mobs also have a chance to drop any ornate/elemental armor?)<br>
--<br>
<br>
The higher you move up in tiers, the higher the risk and the better the exp. <br>
<br>
To get this 1AA/hr soloing in BoT you need more than average gear and a lvl 65 spell. (which is our only real useful one btw, Vortex isnt a huge upgrade to ancient/black steel and earth pet is weaker than air in most situations)<br>
<br>
Chanters have it easier to charm kill than mages - no question, but it has been one of there class abilities since release. <br>
<br>
If you want to see how it is to charm hunt go to valor and try to channel a malosinia through 2 mobs meleeing you. (the charmed pet + the mob you were fighting) <br>
Considering its a lvl 65 spell it will be harder to channel and it has a few seconds recast time so you dont want it to get resisted. (the mob you're fighting will most likely summon you so staying far enough away isnt going to help much =/)<br>
<br>
Now (for max exp gain) imagine this with one of them having 85% haste. (and add flurry/rampage to it if you use FB)<br>
<br>
Then come back and tell us how you did. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39884" target="top">Soriak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Death IS in fact a factor since it adds a LOT of time to the process.<br>
<br>
Unless the Enchanter has a support crew of high level Druids, Beastlords, Clerics and Shamans standing by to buff/Rez them for free every time they die, there is a huge time sink in getting the buffs back that you lose when dying. (Normally 15-25 minutes.)<br>
<br>
Then there's load times, zoning times and self buffing/mana regen from self buffing times. (Add in 10-15 minutes to complete this process.)<br>
<br>
For those that think Enchanters can just gate out to recoup their resources.. they can't heal themselves. There is a lot of downtime when your runes don't hold stuff back and you take damage...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Second:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you scale down the damage output and overall power of the Charmed mobs, then scale UP the reliability of the Charm spells themselves and reduce the mana cost to make it more effective. Even with ALL the AA's that make Charming easier it's still VERY unreliable and with Total Domination 3 you can have charm break the INSTANT you cast it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Finally:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
If you think it’s a particular encounter that’s the problem. (I’ve heard the word exploit used here so it must be involving a few limited locations in some part.)<br>
<br>
Here’s the solution: (This is where the “Productivity Wagon” really takes off.)<br>
<br>
In Bastion of Thunder it was mentioned that an Enchanter used Invis to get to the Boss mob, Pacify to Single pull them and an easy access portal to escape death.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Place a few see invis mobs along the path.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Tune Pacify versus Boss Mob Guards.<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Make the portal require “No Aggro” to be able to use it. (This would respond much like the Tribunal when there’s a Trial in progress.. it would say “You cannot use this portal now, you have guests.”) Forcing you to CLEAR the room before using the portal.<br>
<br>
Your words would be FAR more credible if you offered this kind of thought rather than just say “It’s over powered, nerf it”<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
I have MANY Mage friends that solo in Planes of Power. (I have more Mage friends than Chanter friends that solo in PoP anyway. In fact, I have more Druid and Wizard friends that solo in PoP than I do Enchanter friends that do it.)<br>
<br>
If YOU can’t solo in PoP as a Mage, that doesn’t mean Mages can’t do it. This argument goes both ways. You are acting as if Enchanters are running rampant soloing Gods left and right, but Mages can’t do it at all. Neither of those statements are true.<br>

Inc real long post.<br>
<br>
Few of us seem to recognize the real underlying issue with charm. Charm is not merely &quot;unbalanced&quot;, like how class01's nuke might be a little too good compared to class02, or class03's heal is too weak compared to class02; its a little bigger than that. The whole core design of the spell is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>broken</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and the foundation of the spell must be redesigned.<br>
Despite what many of us think, its not the pop environment (mob strength, or potential risk) which makes charm broken. As i will explain later in my post, these things merely agrivate an existing issue. Saying pop made charm overpowered, is like blaming the salt for causing the wound. In practically every other instance, pop is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fine</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and most would agree is a step up from previous environments. Much like the salt, there is only an issue when it is introduced to the real problem -- design flaws inherent in the charm ability.<br>
<br>
First let me explain something which is essential to discussion. The game is nothing more than 3 elements, it is paying customers (the players) overcoming computer generated challenges (environments), for rewards (character advancement). This is pve, this is the game. Even on pvp servers this is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>still</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the game, you are only as good at pvp as you are at pve, since advancement is awarded through environmental progress only. The act of advancing is truly what defines a game, without it everquest is a chat room with computer generated scenery. Pvp in eq is a side event that one engages in just for fun, to settle disputes, whatever, between pve'ing. <br>
The problem as i see it is charm in its current incarnation takes two things which are at the foundation of the game <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>created</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for competition, and makes them no longer competitors. This has a whole spectrum of game breaking repercussion. Keep in mind im not saying physically turning a mob into an ally is broken, the act itself is neutral. Its allowing classes to actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>harness</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the full potential of mobs -- environmental <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>challenges</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> -- completely <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>unchecked</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> save for level restrictions <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> whats broken. At the heart of the matter, unpoliced meshing of environmental challenges and player ability is whats causing the problem. The problem is somewhat complex in nature, and is defined most prominantly by the following aspects:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1) Charm makes the creation of dynamic content virtually impossible.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Current charm was created with one type of environment in mind. An environment where mobs are only a little stronger than players, in which leveling is an endless treadmill of non challenging mobs, and death, although rare carries a heavy penalty. This type of environment was pretty much the mold for previous expansions. Although arguably too powerful for a non-tanking, non-offensive class, charm really wasnt <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>broken</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> then. In some zones it was (kael being the biggest offender), but throughout most of norrath charm wasnt crazy like it is now. <br>
However, pop was designed a little differently than previous everquest expansions. Mobs are now rather difficult, but you kill a bit less of them. Also death penalties are lessened significantly. This has the side-effect of making charmed pets relatively much stronger than they ever have been before, while simultaneously mitigating the risk to the point where the rewards completely overwhelm it. <br>
As i said earlier, since charm fuses together 2 elements (players and environment) which by definition <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>never</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should be merged in such a way, the design of pop accentuates inherent flaws in the charm spell. This new high difficulty - low penalty environment didnt make charm broken; charm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always was broken</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, it just merely made the problem more obvious to everyone. <br>
<br>
The bottom line is, it was foolish of verant to allow an ability to scale with environmental difficulty like that, and it must be changed. Just as complete heal needed to be changed since it indirectly allowed class strength to scale with environmental difficulty, so is it now time to deal with charm and do the same. A hard coded limitation on charm must be created, and soon. The only other options are to: <br>
a) eliminate dynamic content and make all mobs of a certain level the same strength, and revert to the low blue leveling treadmill of previous expansions (which would negatively effect ALL players, even charm classes), or <br>
b) continue to allow charm classes to trample over everything in their path (this is not really an option, more like wishful thinking on behalf of a few selfish players).<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2) Charm is balanced in a world which assumes level is an appropriate indicator of difficulty of an encounter. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
This is in the same vein as point #1, but is so important it should be elaborated on. I think a common mistake players make is to assume charm was supposed to be balanced <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exclusively</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by potential risk, more specifically, the bigger of a mob you charm the more risk you expose yourself to. Most believe charm was intended to be balanced by the reward itself. Closer observation of the charm line proves this was probably <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the intention of the designer, since charm spells are capped by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>level</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. If charm was intended to be balanced by risk, and verant intended on enchanters being able to charm mobs which potentially could be overwhelmingly powerful, why then the level cap? I mean, shouldnt a level 50 enchanter be able to try his hand at charming a level 60 mob, since after all the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>risk</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should keep it balanced?<br>
<br>
But wait, a level 50 enchanter really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> attempt to charm a 60 mob, because his charm spell has a level cap (i think its L52 isnt it?). The level caps function in the charm line as basically saying &quot;a level 50 enchanter should not have access to the kind of power that charming a level 60 mob would bring, regardless of risk&quot;. The level caps on charm spells <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>prove</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> verant never intended on charm being balanced by risk primarily, and they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>did</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> intend on their being hard coded limitations on the strength of what enchanters could charm.<br>
<br>
Now, heres where verant went wrong. Verant assumed that level alone was an appropriate indicator of mob strength, and this was a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>major</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> failing on their part.<br>
Charm currently is balanced only in a world where all L10, L20, L55, L56, L70, and ect mobs are x amount as strong. Unfortunately this world is not norrath, and never will be norrath, which is why charm has become more balanced by risk and less by level. Charm in its current state can only exist and be called balanced, or at least balanceable, in a non-dynamic world where the level of all content tells you the whole story about its difficulty. What the con system doesnt consider is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">reward</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, and this is a very important facet of environmental difficulty. <br>
A level 55 mob that drops very good loot (extra reward, extra incentive) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should and will</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be stronger than a level 55 mob that drops standard coin loot. The better the loot, the more undercon the mob. Naggy, for example, is much stronger than mobs of his level. Kael giants are a little stronger than mobs of their level, since they have the potential to drop good quest pieces. There are endless examples of &quot;under-con&quot; mobs who are more challenging for appropriate level players than they should be, because of extra reward. <br>
<br>
So you see, charm either must be rebalanced so that there is a more hard-capped potential from charming, or dynamic content must be done away with. Which would you prefer happen?<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>3) Charm has grown to be balanced primarily around assumed limitations like risk, which just isnt enough compared to the potential the spell offers.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Even though evidence shows this probably wasnt the intention of the original designer of the charm line, as everquest has matured and content has become more dynamic and varied as the game expands, this has become the case. Now charm is balanced less by hard coded restriction like level, and more by assumed restrictions like potential risk from mob difficulty. This just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is not appropriate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for an ability as powerful as charm. It is more not appropriate for a class with by far the best ability to mitigate the dps of their enemies, to have an ability which is self policed like that. Enchanters are capable of mitigating nearly all the &quot;risk&quot; their pets pose. <br>
<br>
The conclusion is obvious. <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Charm must be redesigned so that there is a hard coded restriction on the power of their pets</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.<br>
<br>
This solution must keep in mind the following:<br>
-Charm still does have a risk attached to it, but risk should not be the primary balancing factor of the charm line. If an enchanter charms a more undercon L55 mob, his power should increase more than it would from charming an overcon L55 mob. Putting a flat damage/tanking limit on all 55 pets, 56 pets, ect should not be a solution.<br>
-Enchanters are not a dps class. They are not a tank. They are enchanters, theyre primary job is to reduce the dps of enemies through spells amongst other functions. Charm spells should not trivialize true dps classes and tank classes. Charm is supposed to be situational, and enchanters should not be able to maintain a charmed pet indefinitely.<br>
<br>
<br>
That said, i think the following changes to charm would make it more balanced.<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Attatch a resource-drain component to the spell which scales with level.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> The resource drain component should be potent enough to mitigate the bonus of both level-appropriate clarity lines, and druid hp lines, as well as bring the caster into a deficit over time. Class specific abilities should be brought into consideration, for example the mage spell would drain a little more hp than others, the necro version would drain alot more mana, ect. The desired result is that the caster cannot maintain a charmed pet for more than a few minutes.<br>
<br>
-<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Attatch a recast delay to all charm spells.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This way, should you desire to keep a mob perma charmed it would take the collective efforts of more than one caster. You <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> still utilize the full strength of the mob, but it does not belong to one character. If it took 4 enchanters and a cleric to do what 1 good enchanter does currently, that would be fair. The goal is so the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>individual dps</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of all 5 characters would be less than the individual dps of a mage or rogue.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Risk isn't the only factor.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
It takes a great deal of risk as has been pointed out.<br>
<br>

<br>
The exact and simple answer is to tune encounters and zones. They've had the ability to do this for quite some time now. There are a HUGE number of things in the game that the developers had never considered when making this game. Feign Death was just supposed to be a way for Monks to escape death, it was never intended to be a tool for pulling mobs.<br>
<br>
Just because the players find a way to use the spells and skills in new and creative ways doesn't mean they shouldn't have it, and it doesn't mean it's &quot;Broken&quot;. It just means they need to take the next step and make sure the content can adapt to things like this.<br>
<br>
In only the most extreme situations (Like Mod Rods and Complete Heal, which, unlike Charming had NO risk and were guaranteed positive results infinitely.) should a spell or ability be reduced or removed. Charm isn't one of them. Tune the content, not the spell, and most of the content is fine the way it is.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are NOT defined as crowd controllers. Your definition is incorrect there. They are masters of Mind and Body control. They buff your minds and bodies, while boggling the minds and bodies of those that would harm them. This includes charming, as well as mezmerizing and slowing them.<br>

Well yes there are other balancing factors for the charm line of course, such as invested time and mana reserves, but they are so nominal relative to the reward that they are barely worth aknowledging. Let me better illustrate what i mean.<br>
<br>
Lets assume that the average CoD pet lasts 5 minutes. Sure some pets will break in 5 seconds and some will last the whole duration, but on average a pet is maintained for 5 minutes. Just to be clear this is a mythical, although realistic figure.<br>
<br>
CoD costs 700 mana per cast, and it is in an enchanters main spec. Its probably not unreasonable to assume this enchanter has scm 3 which is a total mana reduction of i think 23%. The spell costs about 540 mana then. <br>
Also, lets assume the enchanter refreshes their arcane rune (400m) every charm break. This is a spell in a secondary spec, which would put mana savings at about 13%, i think. Total mana cost is now  888 per charm. <br>
And finally lets assume the enchanter throws out a word of morrell, in addition to rune, to further mitigate ex pet damage. This is also a secondary spec spell, which now brings the total mana cost to 1149 per charm break.<br>
<br>
1149 mana over the course of 5 minutes is 23 mana/tic. You might be thinking thats alot, but lets look at this a little further, shall we? Closer inspection reveals thats not alot at all, and for the rewards it is in fact outrageously mana efficient.<br>
<br>
Most charmed pets in pop do 250 dps and up. Lets say you are in a group which lasts 2 hours, with 70% uptime, and your pet does 250 dps (a modest figure btw). So, that means the enchanter did 250 dps every second, for 5,040 seconds for a total of 1,260,000 damage. The enchanter spends about 27,600 points of mana over the course of 2 hours to do this damage. This is a damage:mana ratio of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>46</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. That is close to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ten times</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> better than the best wizard mana:damage ratios -- wizards, a pure offensive class are 10 times less efficient in dealing magical damage than an enchanter, a class whos purpose is to mitigate damage. How can you say the mana cost isnt nominal relative to the reward?<br>
<br>
The 23 mana/tic figure doesnt even realistically <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>interfere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with an enchanters ability to do other tasks like cc and slow. With things like horses, c5, sd, ft, and what not 23 mana/tic is just a drop in the bucket. Another thing to keep in mind is this 23 mana/tic figure is hardly static. For one thing if pets on average last longer than 5 minutes, and im sure they do, mana spent is alot <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>lower</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than 23 per tic. Also enchanters dont need to spend all that mana on stuns and runes either, if they are grouped with a snare class, or if they have the aa rune skill, that alievates alot of the mana cost.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in short, my point is that charm in no way is realistically balanced by resources, relative to the damage of true offensive mana based classes, it is criminally efficient. It is almost entirely balanced around <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>risk</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and you can see my first post as for my arguement of why it is not a good idea to balance charm around risk (difficulty with the creation of dynamic content, also a tendancy to over estimate associated risk since enchanters are so great at mitigating damage).<br>
<br>
And as for your arguement of charm taking alot of time... well seeing as the damage is done through an entity seperate from the enchanter, i fail to see the concern. A few seconds every few minutes to manage charm breaks is hardly &quot;alot of time&quot; and it really should not interefere with an enchanters ability to do other things like cc and support.<br>

You have a point, but the point you bring up just isnt good enough of a solution (flag more difficult mobs uncharmable). Mobs which yeild an extremely high reward (such as low con older expansion boss mobs) and therefore are huge undercons can always be flagged uncharmable, sure.<br>
<br>
...But what about more subtle, less obvious, variations in mob strength? Say you are in a ficticious dungeon with a 30% experiance bonus. Due to the increased reward relative to other mobs, it is expected the mobs be tougher. Should every type of mob in the zone be flagged uncharmable?<br>
<br>
My point is that undercon mobs *are everywhere*. Do you expect verant to keep in mind every little detail of this vast world, and flag all these mobs uncharmable, simply to avoid directly changing the way charm works? I just dont see that as a realistic option. <br>
Since charm directly utilizes the strength of the casters environment, there needs to be more hard coded limitations for the usage of such a powerful tool. The results of not doing this are evident everywhere -- enchanters soloing mobs which wipe out 2 full groups, enchanters soloing woushi (using undercon mobs), ect.<br>

You have a point, but this really falls into the &quot;risk&quot; vein of charm restrictions, which is subject to all the failings of other &quot;assumed risk&quot; type limiting factors. Charming a mob with higher than average mr is simply more risky, but there is not really a hard coded limitation which prevents you from doing it. All it means is you expose yourself to more risk, and your damage is a little less efficient.<br>
<br>
Like other types of risk, this is not an appropriate enough balancing factor for charm potential, because it can too easily be mitigated. Resists can be circumvented through tash and malise (the first is an innate enchanter ability which is virtually mana free, the later is usually readily accessable). Also it is worth mentioning CoD has a -50 resist mod.<br>
<br>

So basically what your saying is, dont nerf the ability. Adapt (aka nerf) the environment. I couldnt disagree with you more. Not only is it completely impractical for verant to go about and change aspects of all mobs, zone design, or whatever just to avoid simply nerfing some classes ability (which btw, would end up with the exact same result in the end -- the death of the overpowered action), but most of the time it hurts players <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to nerf an environment than it does to nerf <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>one</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> class(es) ability.<br>
<br>
For example, in order to &quot;adapt the environment&quot; to current charm the following actions would need to take place.<br>
1) Broader blue con range reintroduced. <br>
2) All appropriate leveling zones have mob frequency increased, but level and difficulty decreased.<br>
3) Mobs now yeild signifigantly less exp per kill.<br>
4) Harsher death penalties reintroduced.<br>
<br>
Both would result in the desired effect - charm pets no longer being ridiculously as strong as they are now. However, adapting (nerfing) the environment rather than directly nerfing the ability has a whole host of additional negative side affects which hurt <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players, including the charmers. Just a few examples...<br>
<br>
1) Back to the exp treadmill, WOOT!<br>
2) Death sucks, again.<br>
3) Play being more tedious, leveling feeling more like work and less like fun.<br>
<br>
Which do you think players would prefer? Which do you think even charm classes would prefer?<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

I disagree, and i consider charm to very much be an extreme situation the calibur of mod rod and complete heal.<br>
<br>
First, &quot;assumed risk&quot; is very much over rated, esspecially when the class in question specilizes in dealing with emergancy situations and minimalizing dps. <br>
Second, both mod rod and ch had their own attatched risks. Mod rods lowered your health per use signifigantly, and ive not yet met a mage who hasnt killed themselves on them either due to a careless click or accidentally dropping below frenzy range. The more hp you heal from a ch, the more hate the cleric drew. <br>
Both came with their own risk. It isnt a question of whether or not risk is present. Risk is present in everything you do in eq really. Its whether or not the risk is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>sufficient</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for the reward. In the case of mod rods and ch, the risk wasnt even close to being sufficient. The same is true of charm, id say to an even greater degree than mod rod or ch.  <br>
<br>
Theres no way around it. The design of charm needs to be changed.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Well yea thats the rp spiel. <br>
<br>
Lets use mages as an example. Sure mages are summoners, we conjure things like rains of steel, bolts of lava, shields of flame, elemental companions, as well as jewelry imbued with magical power, loaves of bread, weightless bags, amongst other things. We summon (bring existing things to us) and conjure (create something from nothing) lots of stuff. <br>
The practical application of a mage though, is a potent damage dealer with minor utility and virtually no ability to mitigate damage.<br>
<br>
Enchanters deal with mental manipulation, sure. They stun, blind, fear, and drive there enemies to madness through their spells. However, the practical application of an enchanters abilities in eq has traditionally been in crowd control, or more basically as a class who mimimizes the dps of enemies through spells. Secondarily they support other classes through buffs and do a little damage directly with animations, charmed pets, nukes and dots. They also tend to have spells useful for trade skills.  <br>
<br>
Rp really doesnt mean much regarding actual game balance. Technically i could rp explain that im a mage who summons things, therefore i should be able to summon a 10 charge instant cast ch vial for 20 mana called &quot;vial of elemental rejuvination&quot;. Kinda silly way to justify abilities isnt it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=menarion>Menarion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 74<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 4:06:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=100>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> Very well said Noonie.
