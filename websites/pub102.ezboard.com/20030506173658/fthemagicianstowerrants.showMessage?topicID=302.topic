Asking question is fine, especialy when you're new to the mage class and to EQ. But what you do is come here and whine about stuff you don't even have the shadow of a clue about. Just look at the kind of things you say, you're making us look bad, whiny and unknowlegeable.<br>
<br>
**<br>
We got some good upgrades in soloing and grouping with pets not stealing experience and causing agro, but that's really the only big things.<br>
**<br>
NO<br>
<br>
**<br>
Yes I am a new mage, but it doesn't change what is happening.<br>
**<br>
Nope, but it means you don't really have the knowledge to understand these changes fully yet.<br>
<br>
**<br>
The improvements that clerics, druids, and shamen are getting for end game are FAR superior to any endgame improvements mages have received.<br>
**<br>
No, you are not in the end game, so how could you know about it? Druids badly need better healing for raids, the current spell on test might be a tad too powerful, but they need something. Shamans are actualy fine, they'll keep using torpor anyway most the time since it's more efficient than the one they get on test actualy. The only case they'll use is if fast healing is needed or if they need to heal outside their group.<br>
<br>
**<br>
And you cannot over look how terroribly hard it is to get the epic. <br>
** <br>
And you cannot over look how terribly powerful mage epic is, it's hard for a reason.<br>
<br>
**<br>
Yes, mages have it much easier getting to lvl 50 now, but lvl 50 and beyond, on the big uber raids, we are still only big pez dispensors for all the other caster classes. <br>
** <br>
Once again, stop talking about high end uber raids when you haven't taken part in them yet. There's very few fights that require mages to only drop rods.<br>
<br>
**<br>
Druids and wizards are getting money for porting. Enchanters are making obscene amounts of money with KEI. Shamen can make potions and sell them.<br>
Tried to make any money from focus items? Probably not, because you can't. <br>
**<br>
False, I often have people trying to donate to me when they ask for focus items wich I refuse cuz well, I don't need money. But mostly you're a mage... you're probably the best farmer in game. You want money, go do HGs in rathe or IGs in perma. Raisin a shaman's alchemy skill is an investment of many thousands of PPs btw, we pay few pp to a merchant to gain summon focus item spells. KEI scroll sells for insane amount of money. It was 90k earlier on and is now still worth a good 20+k. Those chanters selling kei have a lot of selling to do before they break even (unless of course they got the spell themselves while raiding).<br>
<br>
**<br>
Don't be blinded about all the changes that have been made. If you are making $5 an hour and get a raise to $10 an hour, and the guy next to you was making $12 an hour and got a raise to $14 an hour, sure, you got a bigger raise, but you still ain't equal to the druid next to you. <br>
**<br>
WTF... only place where druid shine is outdoor soloing. In groups they are pathetic, in raids too, soloing indoor too. Well maybe not pathetic but certainly less usefull/efficient than a mage. Once again, druids need a heal upgrade BADLY.<br>
<br>
**<br>
Come on, doesn't it bother you to get marginally better pets, which the shaman got also, by the way, and the beastlords started out with, while other classes are getting added abilities?<br>
**<br>
Marginally??? The recent improvments to pets are HUGE increase, not marginal. Shaman almost never use their pet, they are pathetic. Beastlords have very weak damage output. Once again stop talking about stuff you have no clue about.<br>
<br>
**<br>
Sometimes, it's ok, and even right to be mad. I believe this is the time. Yeah, I will keep playing my mage, but everytime some enchanter demands 100pp for KEI, or a druid KS quillamare, or a shaman soloes a dragon, I will be POed, if that's ok with you. <br>
**<br>
Let's see... 100pp takes me about hmm 15 minutes to get? for a spell that give me insane mana regen for at least 2 1/2 hour? I'd say that's pretty cheap. The dragon that shaman solo has been soloed by mages too. Druid KSin quillmane, welp just buy the MQ, it's actualy simpler than camping quillmane. Or better yet, make tracker friends and have them help you.<br>
<br>
**<br>
Well time to go back and find a wizard or druid to give more money to for porting me around. Maybe they will take a summoned bracer in exchange. Right. <br>
** <br>
Most wizzy or druid will port you to hell and back for a set of focus items...<br>
<br>
**<br>
My point, often stated, never clearly, is that they gave the better rifles, but still just rifles. They are giving the other classes whole new types of weapons. It's the scale of the changes that is depressing. They ratchet up the mages and give wholesale new abilities to other classes. <br>
**<br>
You admit many times to being a young and new mage... you have no idea about the real impact of the changes to mage class, they are not minor, they are HUGE. It's perfectly scaled with the rest. I'd even say that mages got the best out of pure caster balancing (and we needed it). And if you stopped complaining about everything, you'd notice that 90% of the high end mages are asking for very few more thing. Namely pet haste cap being removed, being able to summon pet only bane weapon, and fixing our broken AAs (namely FB).<br>
<br>
**<br>
Kaemon, Winston Churchill once said something to the effect that even paranoids are right sometimes.<br>
<br>
To paraphrase the both of you, sometimes the grass IS greener.<br>
<br>
Even the boy who cried wolf was right sometimes.<br>
<br>
Don't put you head in the sand. This is a travesty and Verant should know it. If everyone says oh well, then why should Verant care? <br>
**<br>
Thing is, in most case, like yours, paranoids are just deranged peoples imagining things, the grass just LOOK greener(stop smoking it!) and the boy who cried wolf was just a lying little bastard craving for attention that deserved to be eaten. We are not putting our head in the sand, we actualy play the damn end game. We know, trust us, the chages we got are HUGE and much much much better than you think. Just wait till you get there to actualy whine about it.<br>
<br>
**<br>
What is a rune item and how do mages generate mana from it? <br>
** <br>
This is the biggest clue for you to realise you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. Asking question is fine, I like to go out of my way to help new mages. But ranting and bitching and moaning when you don't have a clue make you look like an @ss. Please change your attitude or post in the rant section of the boards.<br>

And this I hate much : *And you cannot over look how terroribly hard it is to get the epic.*<br>
<br>
Sure I can I have it and all the mages who starts now have something we DON'T had : a detailed description of the quest with spawns and locs we have to find out ourselves.<br>
<br>
Not to forget the increased spawntimes of some mobs : I had  to swim 17 times to the fish in KK for the wand with a full group to kill the PH an 8 hour spawn...<br>
<br>
Those days the mageepic is dramaticaly easier then 20 month ago.<br>

But I think only if the components will drop from an orc pawn or emperor crush ppl will stop whining.<br>

<br>
 Sorry bud I agree with alot of your post but what druids have you been grouping with?...A 60 druid with a decent amount of AA is uuber...You could say they are MORE usefull to a group then a mage...Of course our jobs in groups are diffrent so I wont compare that (frankly comparing dps to utility is Inane).<br>
<br>
Let me see druids with the proper AA already have an 1050+ heal for 400 mana...Not to mention snare/evac both needed for hunting anywhere worth while :P . They nuke better then a mage as well as the 3rd best dots in the game.<br>
<br>
With the right focus gear druids are truly a thing to behold..In many exp groups druids are making a feirce come back..The ONLY thing I would say they need help on is with end game raiding (wich in turn helps us :P more ch'ers means less mod roders).<br>
<br>
Less effecient then a mage...No  but you could argue that simply because a mage dps rocks a druid dps....Less usefull then  a mage? No....We have diffrent jobs and by far in comparing utility a druid is more usefull in comparing dps the mage is more usefull. <br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I'd even say that mages got the best out of pure caster balancing (and we needed it) <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Not gonna argue there we got seriously hooked up with the caster balancing (altho If the druid ch goes through there may be a valid argument as to who got the best part :P) However besides the broken AA and the pet haste cap I think many mages would like thier spell line to be reveiwed...IE work on the mage themselves not just general pet issues. However since a mage is mostly his pet the pet fixes have been great.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And you cannot over look how terribly powerful mage epic is, it's hard for a reason <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Getting the epic sucks :P and by many standards its more difficult to atain today then it ever was...Many High end guilds will not go to PoA/Hate simply because besides the out dated epic drops there is nothing there...Save for the caster epics all other epics are pretty much obselete...<br>
<br>
Many guilds will not take the 2 days it takes in sky or the multiple no staff magi in hate for ONE mages epic...Its just not worth it..Not when equipent in luclin/NToV is vastly superior to any epic (save for the casters)...<br>
<br>
Perhaps PoP and epic 2's will change this. For right now tho I am praying they change the magi to a trigered encounter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Yes its the last piece I need :P.<br>
<br>
Most of the changes were great..I have to agree with you the mage now is 10 times better then a few months ago.<br>

<br>
But as far as mod rods go, in my personal experience at least, any boss we go after (ssra stuff, burrower, etc) requires lots of rods.  Which despite being boring, is an incredibly incredibly powerful end game tool.  So yeah sure were pez dispensers, but we are dispensing basically 8-15 clerics per mage in a long fight.  As in we are making enough rods for 5-8 clerics to heal what would take 15.<br>
<br>

All the pet changes are great, but remember one thing, they helped all pet classes. These were not magician specific changes, they were pet changes.<br>
<br>
Necro and magician pets both hit harder now.<br>
<br>
All pets in game are non aggro.<br>
<br>
All pets can now hear commands zone wide.<br>
<br>
All pet classes (except BL) summon a pet at the highest level each time.<br>
<br>
No pet takes experience if the caster does 1 point of damage.<br>
<br>
These changes are as I said great. Magician's relie upon their pets more than the other classes, but necros can and do relie upon pets when fear kitting etc.. and will now readily use a pet where they may not have in the past as it no longer sucks up even 1% of the experience.<br>
<br>
Once the pet haste cap is removed, all pets will benifit from the change, not just magician's except in the instance when frenzied burnout is cast.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, as I sdaid I applaud the changes, but our spells need to be looked at and re-evaluated. <br>

Anyone that knows me know that I LOVE to help youger mages. I like our class and I'll support anyone of my fellow mages as much as I can, but I really think hine needs to stop complaining so much about things that he/she has no grasp about. If he/she would have complained about mid level mage's abilities, fine, that would have been acceptable for me. But to see him/her spam the boards with &quot;I'm a mid 40s mage and think high end raiding mage are broken&quot; and posting tons of misconceptions gives a real bad image of the mage class to people visiting this board. We already have a whiny class reputation with VI, and that's one of the reason why they don't listen to us as much as other classes.<br>
<br>
A few days ago after a raid I gated to nexus where a young mage asked me to combine his 29 fire pet. Since I have maxed research for level 49 back in the days I've always done any combines i've been ask to for free. So this young mage hand me the book with the components and I hit combine. /boggle, does not combine message. I check in book and he has lvl 24 pet scroll, the right word, but breath of ro as the item... It's been so long that I'm not really sure wich is the right component so I ask him and he says web site said breath of solusek and the closest thing he found was breath of ro. Then it hit me, I remembered about EC merchant. So I logged in mule druid, ported to EC, bought component, gated back to nexus, relogged to mage and combined for him. That's the kind of stuff I'll do for any baby mage on my server or this board. <br>
<br>
I just think hine was going way way over his/her knowledge and made us look bad. VI and other classes read these boards for feedback on mage class. I think we should all work together to give the most truthfull view of the mage class that we can. And I don't think a new player in his 40s is a good voice to whine about the high end game.<br>
<br>
I don't mind young mages talking about mid level game and sharing their experience. But I do mind young mages spreading false info on high end game when they haven't actualy experienced it. The problem Cyrius is hine was not asking question, he/she was spamming in every thread that high end mages sucked. I tryed to point out to him/her that he/she was basing his/her comments on misconceptions and strongly suggested he/she spend some time reading these forums and ask question about stuff he/she didn't know about (see hine's thread about rune items, wich was actualy a repost from a question hine asked in his/her &quot;imho mage are getting shafted&quot; thread, if he/she started with that, it would have been fine, thing is he/she bitch about high end for 6-7 post, THEN ask about a basic part of the high end mage, just hoping it would happen the other way, ask first, then complain if you have something to complain about once you know the actual facts). I also strongly suggested that hine stop posting about things he/she don't know about.<br>
<br>
Likewise, I rarely comment anymore on low-mid level game because I don't have a clue about most of it now. I was already pretty high when mage pets were given dual weild. I wore FBR till my 40s, I never had a pet heal growing up, I haven't been in a sub 40 zone since pre kunark mostly cept maybe to farm silk in crystal caves or fight up to tserrina once in ToFS. My luclin experience is all in 4-5 zones, I won't comment about the other ones. I expect the same from other mages. Share your experience, and ask about stuff you don't know. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</A>&nbsp<A href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&ltTDE&gt</A><BR>

The only specific thing given to the mages were the hp and AC and slight dmg inceease in our pets at 57+/epic. Most  mages myself included would like them to seriously look at our spell lines and see if any tweaks can be made to us there.<br>

<br>
A better analogy in my opinion is this - go find a woman and tell her that high heels are comfortable, and women should wear them all the time, and that if a woman is raped, it's probably her own fault, and if you're still alive, you'll get my point.  It's not the capability to understand or not understand the high end shite that makes me angry, it's telling the high end people what it's like, when the person telling has no experience and NO ABILITY to experience the subject matter.  That's why I typically don't post on those matters, because, while I am &quot;high level&quot;, my guild has never done any single fight harder than Nathyn in Katta without outside help.  I know that I don't know what it's really like, and I keep the trap shut out of respect for those who do.<br>

<br>
But I think it might be, that most of us as our mages grew up in the pre-50 game, found our leveling abilities to be adequate... if not superior than most of our compatriots in other classes.<br>
<br>
Sure, I was 50 shortly after Kunark was launched, and there wasn't the variety of droppable/tradable weapons or armor that there is now, but even now, versus warriors, rangers or even monks, our soloability is fantatstic and our damage output via pets in groups is awesome pre-50 (especially 39 - 49).<br>
<br>
All of these were acceptable even before the recent changes (no exp penalty, max pet level summoning, etc.). Those changes would certainly keep us current mostly with the increases other classes have gotten via gear in recent expansions.<br>
<br>
For this reason, I think that the complaints from our younger mages are discounted. They have had it easier than we ever did... and we didn't have it that bad then.<br>
<br>
I think that's where some of the credibility issues come in. Either that, or I'm an old fart complaining about these young &quot;whippersnappers&quot; and how easy they have it today. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table width=100%><tr><td width=33%><font color=blue><i><b>Master Svenuce Summonstuff</b></i></font><br>
