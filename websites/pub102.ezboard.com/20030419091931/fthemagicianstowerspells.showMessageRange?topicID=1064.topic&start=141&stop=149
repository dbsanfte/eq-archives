<br>
at first i was concerned about druid DS being 1 point higher, less mana, longer duration, but now i couldn't give 2 shades of shite if they got a 50 point DS. least ours ups my FR on raids <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
how often is YOUR ds requested? mine is basically sweet FA or the time. instead of booning my group for 1 tank, i ask the tank to tell me when it runs out, they never do, because they don't care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
im just waaaayy over complaining about small little things like this. im happy as a mage now, and i doubt very much that a DS 1 point higher than mine, that only level 60 druids can cast is really going to make me less attractive to a group.<br>
<br>
man, we could go to any other class forum and see the same whiny @#%$, from different classes, probably about us. <br>
i bet there are plenty of lev 34 wizards cracking the shits about our nukes &quot;they can nuke for XXX, it's only XXX below mine, plus they get a pet, DS for group, and can still put out damage when OOM, VI is a bunch of XXX, and XXX, and XXX.&quot;<br>
<br>
people are gunna complain about piddly little @#%$ because it's all they can complain about, and they have their idea of where THEY want to be, and if they aren't there, then it's wrong and we're getting ignored etc...<br>
<br>
this is why the forums at the everquest site were removed. i was NEVER unhappy with my mage till i visited them, then i felt like quiting, because when people concentrate on the negatives so much, our positives become insignificant, and in need of apparent upgrade.<br>
<br>
anyways, im a whiny bitch sometimes too, but ATM im over complaining about our class.<br>
<br>
and hey... if you think YOUR class brings nothing really to a raid or XP group, what about rangers? ranger in a dungeon? mm push that dragon into a wall and watch them break down and cry cause trueshot doesn't work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i feel for them far more than i feel for our class. <p><p>

The two classes I picked (and the only two I play) are Ranger and Magician.  It's seems I just like not being wanted.  In truth I agree with Kryten in that I didn't realize I had so much to complain about till I started reading the messages boards.  <br>
<br>
I've not reached &quot;End Game&quot; so i'll just continue having fun with both as I have been, and hope that the things that are broken are fixed before I get there.. <p><br>

Hmmm *alot* more then I've heard we can't run it because we have no mage.  Circles are VERY important on alot of AE mobs, someone stated that elemental chorus replaces that, hi have you ever raided with elemental chorus on 60 people?  Bard AE songs are NOT server filtered, the lag caused by them is almost unbearable, i'd much rather bring a druid along and have them heal as well, then have all 60 freakin people lagging because of a song, might not call it off all the time, but hey who doesn't enjoy a good corpse summoning cause noone can move.<br>
<br>
Now as a druid how many times do you hear no you can't come because we have a druid already?  Extra healing is almost *never* turned away.  On mobs with huge DPS that chain DLs need to be cast on a MT, natures touch is used alot when clerics are lacking.  I have been turned away from my own guild before because one of the other mages was already there.  Needless to say I didn't stay in that guild long but that should NOT happen.  I meen its gotten to the point where mages don't even make up for the extra lag they cause on raids and that is just rediculous and now a druid can DS everyone just as effectively for almost twice as long, and that is VERY important as alot of fights nowadays last over 7 mins and you might not have the mana to rebuf it midfight.  Truth is very rarely will a raid be canceled if a necro (outside of corpse summoning, which most guilds can log on a necro for) or a mage or a druid is not there, they are not NEEDED.  But at least druids and necros are nice to have, mages have gotten to the point where you might want one to CoH (if it hasn't been beaten with the nerf bat in that zone) any extra is just a waste of frame rate.  Little candy spells are not gonna fix it, until its determined what we are supposed to be best at we'll never be fixed, making us slightly better at things half the other classes in the game are better then us at is just stupid.<br>
Simple as that.<br>
<br>
As for why druids have become better then us in...hmm everything now.  They are VI's &quot;lapdogs&quot; and always have been.  Ever heard the saying jack of all trades master of none?  They are jack of all trades, master of some...which should not be.  When EQ came out i looked at druids and was shocked at everything they got...Someone tell me what they, in &quot;optimal situations&quot; as one druid stated here, don't do better then us?  An &quot;optimal situation&quot; would have that druid with a nice dire charmed pet hitting for 120+ so optimaly their pets are better.  They heal quite a bit better too, imagine that considering they are priests, not robe wearing casters. They get better armor then us.  Their best DS is now higher then ours, and lasts longer/more mana efficient.  Their DDs are still a bit better then ours.  They have better defense spells then us (considering we have none, thats not hard to do), and they can port.  Oh guess what they can buff too...I'm not &quot;envious&quot; of druids really because in all honesty they have problems too in the raiding end.  But I don't like druids coming to our boards and whining that we have nothing to whine about when they outclass us in *everything* in the optimal situations they referred to.  So cry on a warrior or cleric board if you think your underpowered compaired to someone...or maybe you just figured since noone plays a mage you can whine without getting flamed?<br>
<br>
Now as for how accessable these spells will be...who cares?  The point is they *CAN* get a spell that makes them better then us, why shouldn't we get a spell thats just as hard to get that keeps us above them?  Yes it might be hard to get these new spells and it might be easy, noone really knows, but the point is, we'll have to do the same thing they'll have to, to get spells that are pointless and not worth going out of your way for, when they get spells that take over a whole area in damage from another class, a class that is struggling as it is to begin with.  Its just mind boggling how little thought they put into mages.  <br>
<br>
I remember VI stating they wish they had never put CoH into the game, in referance to all the nerfed it was recieving.  Maybe their way of taking it out of game without taking it out is to make it so noone plays a mage anymore.  <br>
<br>
These spells are not in game yet no, but if noone complains about them now they most likely *will* go in game as they are and that is why people complain about things on test, if enough people point out a huge and obvious problem VI will fix it.  Everyone isn't just bitching for the sake of talking...<br>
