********<br>
things like better abilities and spells, are also given, but class unique.<br>
a level 55 mage, should not have a better pet than a level 61 mage. theres no other way to say it. <br>
********<br>
<br>
I have to disagree here.  Your logic here says that by the same token, (s)he shouldn't have better than a 56th level mage either.  <br>
<br>
This is incorrect.  The 55th put in the work, and got the epic.  The 61st without the epic did not.  There is no &quot;given benefit.&quot;  There is only &quot;Earned&quot; benefit.  Your hypothetical 61st did not feel it worthwhile to pursue the epic pet - knowing full well what that pet could do.  <br>
<br>
The quests for these new pets are gimp quests.  Kill enough stuff, score some pages, turn them in and POOF!  New pet.  <br>
<br>
If that 61st level Magician wants a big-ass wonkin elemental, (s)he better get his/her butt down to SK and start looking for flappy horses.<br>
<br>
Very likely, if things continue to L200 as you suggest, there will be &quot;staged epics&quot;, so that an individual can either pursue standard pets - the Ford models - and have a passable elemental, or (s)he can time out from levelling/raiding to go acquire a Porsche.<br>
<br>
I busted my ass early on for this (might very well be the lowest-level magician on my server to have done so), and I can tell you straight up it's tougher for a lower-level mage to get this thing done.  I would think the 46th level magician SHOULD have a better pet than a 60th for doing this quest.  (S)He won't nuke hardly as well, but certainly will have a kick-ass pet.  <br>
<br>
Those folks who didn't pursue the epic early, instead got levels or aa's.  That means they differentiated themselves down a different path.  You're arguing here for a homogeneous bunch of interchangeable people.  Blah.  I was psyched to be a 54th magician that everyone wanted in their group because my pet could massacre whatever critter we were dealing with.<br>
<br>
Eventually, &quot;standard&quot; pets will eclipse the epic.  Not this time.  Probably when the effort to acquire the standard pet is greater than the effort to acquire the epic.  i.e., a while from now.<br>
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
There should be other ways to work for rewards, like questing, tradeskills, raiding.. that reward the player in a comparable magnitude as xping.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
<br>
as an avid quester and tradeskiller, i completely agree with this statement. the rewards from questing/tradeskilling/raiding should be of proportionally comparable magnitude as that you would receive from leveling. key phrase being proportionally comparable magnitude.<br>
********<br>
<br>
Those tradeskillers and questers DO get rewards appropriate to their actions.  They get cash and trophy items for tradeskilling, and they get quest rewards for questing.  <br>
<br>
You're again asking for a free ride here.  <br>
<br>
If folks want the dang pet, do the dang quest.  All this whining sounds like &quot;but I don't WANT to have to do all that work.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Tough beans.  Get off your duffs, recruit some friends, and go do the dang quest.  You want the best pet?  Earn the freaking thing.  At 61st, we're not talking about a monumental effort.  Otherwise, learn to cope with the normal pet for your level.  <br>
<br>
I wouldn't expect to see a pet equalling the epic until at least L70 - and in fact, it probably won't be as good in the conglomerate sense.  Maybe the earth will have the hps and will hit as hard...maybe air will have the proc and the stun...maybe the fire will have the bigass fireshield...<br>
<br>
I understand you probably get tired of using the same pet over and over again, or maybe you don't want to be tied to summoning the orb, etc.  I can see why you'd feel that way.  I just don't agree that some L61 should be able to go farm a page or three and convert it into Uber_Pet_01.  <br>
<br>
If they want to bump off Gonad, they're going to have to do some severe work for it.<br>

&quot;Please don't belittle my acomplishment because I'm not a &quot;high Enough&quot; level mage&quot;<br>
<br>
We do not mean to belittle you or your accomplisments. But, do you feel it is fair for a 52 mage to have a pet that is as good as a 65 mage? Do any 52 wizards have the same (best) nuke as a 65? Or any other class in that regard? <br>
**********<br>
<br>
Tain, you are totally disregarding that the 65th level mage has nukage and other spells that will flatten the 52nd.  The 52nd has NO chance to compete in the same arena.  Yes, the 52 SHOULD have a better pet, because that 52nd worked his ass to the bone to get it - and the 65th DID NOT.  That 65th has every opportunity to pursue the epic, and chooses not to.  Don't pretend that he's some poor, oppressed, can't-afford-a-cup-of-coffee bum.  At 65th, he could probably sell a chunk of gear and make the 300k he'd need to buy all the pieces for MQ.  <br>
<br>
This is not rocket science, folks.  We are not our pets alone.  A 65th without epic is not a lesser being than a 52nd with it.  Quite the contrary.  <br>

I keep hearing that cleric's, enchanter's, druid's, shamans', and  wizards' epics are useful and they don't discard them. The main word is &quot;USEFUL&quot;. They are useful but they are not essential to their power. <br>
<br>
I equal their usefulness to a mage with boots of blade calling, a lv 60 mage with boots is more powerful than a lv 60 mage one without them but a lv 50 with boots is not more powerful than a lv 60 with full spellbook.<br>
<br>
Tell me, who is more powerful a lv 60 wizard with full spellbook and no epic or a lv 59 wizard with epic? a lv 60 cleric with no epic or a lv 59 cleric with epic? enchanter? shaman? druid?<br>
<br>
LEVELS and SPELLS should be the main power for a casting class not some item no matter how difficult it is to obtain.<br>
<br>
Pets are a big part of our power, tying us down to the epic will only serve to cripple us. I do agree that a lv 65 mage with epic should be more powerful than a lv 65 mage without it but a lv 65 mage without epic should be more powerful than a lv 60 mage with epic, hands down, no discussion. Making the epic a FOCUS for the lv 61+ pets fits perfectly into this pattern.<br>
<br>
P.S. If the new pets are not significantlly more powerful than epic then what is the point in getting them? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xoniker>Xoniker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(10/24/02 12:01:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=784.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> Ok, so if epic pet is not eclipsed by 61 to 65 pets, then what?<br>
<br>
Beastlord pets parsed at 28 DPS vs mage epic 32 DPS with level 60 spells.  That was when beast pets weren't quadding.  Beastlord 60 proc is 142 vs epic 143.  Beastlord 61 + NON-EPIC quest pets will be higher level and have new procs.<br>
<br>
Do you think 61+ beastlord pets will be &lt; mage epic?  Not a chance in hell, sorry.  What about Necro pets, will they get a meaningful upgrade to EoT?  Wouldn't that make their pets &gt; epic too?  More than likely.<br>
<br>
The epic will probably remain the best solo pet by a slim margin, but be eclipsed in groups and raiding by the higher level pets.. as it should be to remain balanced vs other classes.  Why would you want to tie the epic quest around the mage classes neck to let us drown on it?<br>

And don't even think for a moment you can compare the power of our epic with that of a rogue or a warrior, compared to gear out there.  That's either just plain stupid, or it's intentionally overlooking it so you can pretend to be disadvantaged.  Sit down.<br>

<br>
Wizard isn't a relevant point here, this is an easier epic to achieve, and will be in use forever.  There's no tie there.  If you were asking me, though, I'd take the W59e over the W60.  The W59 is guaranteed to me to last longer, dishing out almost equivalent damage and requiring less time from the cleric.<br>
<br>
C59e wins out over C60 hands down.  Try to tell me what at 60 makes me feel I wouldn't want a clicky around? <br>

<br>
Don't be a moron.  You are intentionally ignoring that the M65 with a ton of AA can EASILY outdamage a M60e.  <br>
<br>
It's not like he doesn't have a pet, dude.  And it's not as if the damage quotient isn't going to be within a point or two.  CLUE.  Get one.  If this Mag65 with a ton of AAs doesn't have the epic, there's one of two reasons here:  (1) he doesn't feel the need for it is worth the effort of the quest any more, or (2) crap, I can't think of a (2).  <br>
<br>
Why don't you check with a M65 who has no epic and tell me?  <br>
<br>
Oh yeah, because no one's gone that far yet.  <br>
<br>
Which reminds me!  Just how much speculation are you getting your knickers in a twist over?  We've BARELY had a semi-conscious report about the 61st air pet, and you're already beefing on this stump?  <br>
<br>
Jeez, get on with your life, go out there and level a bit, then come back and ask Cyricus for a parse.<br>
<br>
You guys are pretending like we have nothing other than our pets.  That's dishonest and misleading.  You can't ignore our nukes and pretend that's not part of the whole picture, if you're going to pretend that levels v pets make a difference.<br>
<br>
Fact of the matter:  you're not getting a free ride.  If you haven't put the work into scoring the best pet available, guess what?  You don't get one.  End of story.  All the whining in the world isn't going to change that.<br>
<br>
Use what you have, and if you want better, go work for it and stop cluttering up the view with your pointless droning.<br>

<br>
1) It is false to say we have the same epic pet as in Kunark. That is a LIE. It has been upgraded so much that all it shares in common with the original is the name mainly. We have epic2 if ya want to look at it that way. NOBODY else has had their epic changed to do more damage. Think about it.<br>
<br>
2) MANY mages here have whined about the damage the pet can take in the &quot;modern world&quot;. I havent been to SSRA or VT, but i HAVE been to most other zones including today in the plane of disease. Mobs there hit for 230ish. I dont solo too much since I live with a cleric and 99% of the time we are together. But often we are alone or in a group with no chanter. I tank a lot of adds alone with no help from her in many zones with no problems while she takes care of the melee person. In PoD we had no problem killing regular exp mobs other then the dang spider that CHed itself no less then 4 times. Long battle but not a real problem. My epic pet on a 1 on 1 battle doesnt get owned. Could i solo a PoD mob? Not yet I dont think, would be very close. But add in one other person of any class and I will take anything.<br>
<br>
3) Should Epic pet be outclassed by the new pets? I dont really care. Should there be an epic2? I think so, just to differentiate between those of us who went thru the pain and make everyone that didnt have to go do epic1 to get epic2. LOL. Ok so i am sadistic. I never understood any mage who didnt dedicate his existence to getting our epic. BUT i am not in uberguild_01 and have no FT, no clickies, and junk gear, lol. So my pet is my full time partner. I still kick butt and dont apologize to anyone cuz I can put out damage, CC in a non CC group, and am fun to play with (bit of conceit). I do fine at it all and always get asked if I have openings in my groups.<br>
<br>
5) This is a game and if you play it like one people will want you around, at least the ones who make friends and like PEOPLE and not bragging rights over uberitem_01. Relax and have fun.<br>
<br>
6) On the other side big holes in our fun from VI crippling should be addressed also, just not with all the usual hate and name calling. MOST of the time we here seem to do it fairly well. Though the pre-PoP furor was ungodly.<br>
<br>
7) On a side note, thanx for all the info, laughs, and community.<br>

<br>
You still didn't address my argument:  The fact that other classes almost certainly will get better pets than our epic, without having done a quest that compares to our epic.<br>
<br>
Yes, I was being fecitious, but that is basically the attitude you guys are having here.  You want the epic pet to remain the top pet for one reason.. So you can enjoy feeling more powerful or important than someone who did not complete the quest - regardless of level.<br>
<br>
This does not help our class, no matter how you want to justify it to yourself.  The epic pet was upgraded, but so was almost every other pet, including those belonging to other pet classes.  As it stands now, nearly any improvement to beastlord or necro pets will result in a better pet than epic pet.<br>
<br>
If you get what you're asking for (out of pure pride and spite for those that did not do the quest it seems) then magicians lose ground to other classes.  This is the point that I was trying to make.<br>
<br>
Other classes will get pet upgrades in the same manner we do in PoP.  Just because their new pets are better than our epic, do you think VI will make them do a quest harder than the epic to obtain them?  NO.  <br>
<br>
Mages, however, should have to do both the epic and an even harder quest to get better pets than epic.. hmm, how balanced is that?<br>
<br>
I am level 61 with 70AA now.. and yes I could buy the epic if I wanted to but that's not the point.  The point is that the argument you guys are making: <br>
<br>
1) Hurts the mage class overall by limiting our power in relation to other classes.  <br>
<br>
2)  Is entirely selfish and for the most part childish.  Previous work for uber item does not always = you will have the most uber item for all time.<br>
<br>
How can you complain about getting more power?  If epic became a focus item for regular pets, great.  If epic 2.0 came out, great.  However some folks saying epic should remain the top pet, solely because they have it and don't want to lose their relative position within their class, regardless of how it will hurt the mage class overall is just plain sickening. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xoniker>Xoniker</A> at: 10/24/02 3:24:29 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=magetlow>magetlow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(10/24/02 3:53:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=784.topic&index=69>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Nice Argument, how about facing the real problem</span><hr size=1> xon - ok im not sure if you dont understand what most people are saying or not but here it is for you.<br>
<br>
1. &quot;we want the epic to stay the best pet -yes.&quot;<br>
 <br>
this does not mean we want it to stay the same power it is now. that would be stupid. we want it to be upgraded in some way, either being scaled with lvl or just upgraded.<br>
<br>
2. &quot;we want an epic2 which takes epic1 to complete.&quot;<br>
<br>
this would be if they didn't upgrade epic1 in some way. even through another quest where we would be able to have a better pet then the ones of none epic mages which did not put time into there own epic because we put the work in and they did not so it would only be fair.<br>
<br>
noone wants the mage to be left behind and everyone wants the best pets in game(cause were mages thats what we have.). if you think were trying to slow our own class down im sorry you feel this way but you are wrong. <br>

Do not denigrate the opinions of others, or insinuate that they either stupid or dishonest.<br>
<br>
I also agree with the poster you are insulting.  To my knowledge, no other class's epic has been as greatly upgraded as ours, and the mage epic has been upgraded to be a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;tier&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> above its original implementation.  As global improvements to pets are made, it will also grow in power.<br>
<br>
Even things that might appear otherwise are effectively upgrades to epic, such as healing, suspend companion, improvements to mend companion.  Can you name any other class who can so dramaticly increase the effectiveness of their own epic through their own spells?<br>
<br>
I think that as long as the epic pet is the best pet under some common circumstances, the post-61 pets have both flaws and advantages when compared to the epic, that seems like that would be fair to everyone.  I am not epicked, but hope to be someday.<br>
<br>
I also think it is entirely clear that the magician epic is like no other, in that no other epic effects the core strength of its class to the same degree the mage epic does.  It is arguably the best epic for the holder.<br>
<br>
The saddest part of the epic has always been the loss of other pets, and the dependence on sustaining pets as a sole strategy.  One pet, one tactic.<br>
<br>
I hope that epicked mages are both able to continue to use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ubaner</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to good effect, but will also regain a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">choice</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> about which pet to use under which circumstance, which is missing pre-61.  I can hardly imagine a stunning pet with nice proc and built-in nicer damage shield becoming completely obsolete.  If nothing else, it remains what a post-50 fire pet can only dream of, especially if the post-61 fire pet is a wizard.<br>

<br>
It is also my Opinion that the epic should be CONTINUED with PoP.<br>
<br>
Once you have epic complete, you continue on a quest in PoP to get an ever greater epic pet.<br>
<br>
As an alternate Idea, the new epic can no longer summon a pet, but be a pet BUFF that will also sclae up with the mage casting it (similiar to how a melee epic is more powerfull in the hands of a high lvl melee)  This would allow us to mix and match pets per situation with the epic buff on it.  ALSO it would have to be undispellable like like the BL pet buff used to be, or the buff would be worthless on dispelling mobs. <p>Zyler Majicka &lt;br&gt;<br>

<br>
I was not disagreeing that the epic has been upgraded.  But, I still find it amazing , without trying to be disrespectful, that mages continually think that straight up, patch upgrades to the epic are not only a good thing-but one worthy of praise.  Its sad.<br>
<br>
Our epic has been upgraded..and upgraded...and frankly, its getting pathetic.  If we need another patch upgrade to it in a few months so that things are balanced..Im sorry, its wrong and incredibly sad that mages are coming to depend on that. <br>
<br>
Frankly, I'm tired of being the class least worthy of respect because we insist on getting free upgrades-and get upset when we have a chance to work for ones.  I see no justification for this special treatment.  And, it just makes us look bad to expect it.  <br>
<br>
And finally- Mages are nukes AND pets.  Both, equally important.  No level 52 mage should be as good in *either* as a 65 mage.  The epic is not hard to do anymore, time consuming yes, hard no.  It hasn't been for awhile now.  AND, it will be even less difficult for a level 65 mage to do.  So, balance the reward against who will be working on it...like other quests.  If levels 50-60 will mostly be focusing on it-make it good for them.  I mean, the robe of the elements was &quot;difficult&quot; if you did it at the appropriate levels...does that mean it should be boosted every expansion to compete with high end gear?  ANd yes-epic to robe of the elements is a bit of a stretch....but you get the general idea.  The crutch needs to go. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=knuklesninefingers>Knukles Ninefingers</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(10/24/02 3:05:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=784.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: missing the point about pets</span><hr size=1> I don't get it, why are epic'ed mages so upset that the 60+ pets might be better than epic??  its an upgrade for ALL, I repeat, ALL mages, why are they upset that a stronger(and more easily obtainable) pet has been put in the game???.

Rather than an uberpet, the epic should have been some sort of pet focus item that we could use on pets of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> levels.  Or, if not a focus item, it should have had a Malo kind of effect.<br>

I don't know a lot about the endgame, just what I've read on this board.  I can totally understand both points of view on this subject...The epic'ed mages don't want to see their time and effort eclipsed by something that doesn't take anywhere near the investment of time, blood, sweat, and (I dare say in many cases) tears.  I can also understand why people wouldn't want the mage class to be limited to the power of the epic, which was introduced during the Kunark era, and wil soon be vastly underpowered in the 61-65 game, as it exists now.<br>
<br>
How do we handle this problem?  Obviously no-one has come up with an equitable solution, judging by the vociferous, and often vemonous, responses to this thread.  It's sad to see the mage population at such odds over what should occur to keep both sides happy.  I would like to offer a suggestion to help ease the dispute that doesn't look like it will ever end.  This solution incorporates several suggestions already in this thread, so I don't want the credit for this, I just want to offer an opinion that might help settle the masses.<br>
<br>
Anyway, here it is...<br>
<br>
There are two distinct groups of mages that exist nowadays: the epic'ed mage, and the non-epic'ed mage.  I suggest that the epic staff (as suggested in several other posts) become a focus item for the new pets from 61-65.  I also suggest that the pets from 61-65 be ***in their specific areas (melee, casting, tanking, etc.)*** stronger than the epic pet.  That would make the epic pet still the best overall pet, but in certain situations the new pets might be better.  HOWEVER, with the epic staff, the new pets would be focused, and therefore stronger than the pets that could be cast by a non-epic'ed mage.  And, to cap out this solution, at level 65, not below, you would have access to a quest to get epic v2.0.  Sections of this quest may be able to be completed at a lower level, BUT they would have to be done at level 65 in order for them to &quot;count&quot; in the completion of the quest.  This could be accomplished by using the new &quot;flags&quot; concept unveiled for PoP.  This epic v2.0, as an integral part of the quest, would include turning in an epic staff.  The new epic would also be a pet, but stronger than any of those that precede it, in a way that obviously makes it superior, but not completely unbalancing to the game itself (just as epic v1.0 was, in its time).<br>
<br>
What are the upsides to this solution?<br>
1.  Those mages that hold epic v1.0 still have an advantage over those that don't, because they will receive better pets from 61-65, and have an easier time completing epic v2.0.<br>
2.  Those mages that don't hold epic v1.0 have access to great pets as well, but they will never be able to equal the power of those pets of mages with epic v1.0.<br>
3.  It creates a scenario that allows epic'ed mages to still hold a distinct advantage over those mages without the original epic, both during levels 61-65, and when it comes to completion of epic quest v2.0.  In essence, to become one of the truly elite mages, one has to go through both quests.<br>
<br>
I fully realize that this plan is not perfect, so please, poke holes in it, rip it apart, do as you will.  I just wanted to voice my opinion on this hot topic, and hope to get some constructive discussion going.  It has been proven (especially with this expansion) that if we have reasonable requests to better the class, and keep it balanced with others, and within our own ranks, there is a chance that SOE, VI, whoever is in charge will listen.<br>

Ok, I'm finished...Flame away.<br>

Xoniker's quote of...<br>
<br>
****<br>
You still didn't address my argument: The fact that other classes almost certainly will get better pets than our epic, without having done a quest that compares to our epic.<br>
****<br>
<br>
That's correct - I didn't.  I haven't seen any other class' pet in comparison to ours yet, so I'm not in a position to claim that we're disadvantaged or not.  <br>
<br>
****<br>
If you get what you're asking for (out of pure pride and spite for those that did not do the quest it seems) then magicians lose ground to other classes. This is the point that I was trying to make.<br>
****<br>
<br>
First of all, never read motive into what I say, unless I specifically denote why I'm saying something.<br>
<br>
****<br>
Other classes will get pet upgrades in the same manner we do in PoP. Just because their new pets are better than our epic, do you think VI will make them do a quest harder than the epic to obtain them? NO. <br>
<br>
Mages, however, should have to do both the epic and an even harder quest to get better pets than epic.. hmm, how balanced is that?<br>
****<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned before, levelling is easy.  It is a byproduct of spending time playing.  <br>
<br>
Other classes may indeed get better pets - and I do expect we'll exceed them in some form or fashion.  Probably most if not all forms or fashions.  How that is done is up to VI.  <br>
<br>
I simply find it &quot;sickening&quot; to hear people whine about how so-and-so pet &quot;should be better&quot; than the epic simply because it's 61st level.  61st.  So what?  Why does this make any difference over 60th?  Or 59th?  58th?  49th?  That is what I find &quot;childish and selfish&quot; - that's a &quot;gimme&quot; attitude that I hear in those voices.  Whether I'm correct or not in hearing that, it's still the impression I get.  <br>
<br>
BFD.  So we have new pets.  Maybe they're better, maybe they're worse than the epic.  I actually prefer Balanz' idea of having them exceed the epic in one form or another, but not in all respects, leaving it to be the best general-purpose pet in the bag.<br>
<br>
Sounds, actually, like that's exactly what is happening - and it sounds like our utility spells are designed so that we can actually *build* pets that are better in many ways than the epic.  This works just dandy for me - since these utility spells can also be used on the epic itself.  <br>
