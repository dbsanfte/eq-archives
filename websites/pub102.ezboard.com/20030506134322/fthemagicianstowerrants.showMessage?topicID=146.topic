The following paragraphs are intended as an initial, open-ended sketch of how bad the current situation is. I fear that, over time, Verant's diatribes will be seen as uncontested fact, because many people are afraid to do something good for others. It is no news that what we're involved in with Verant is not a game. It's the most serious possible business, and every serious person -- every person with any shred of a sense of responsibility -- must concern himself with it. <br>
<br>
When was the last time you heard Verant mention that you'd think it would see how demented and dotty it appears? Probably never. That's why it seems that no one else is telling you that it is bound to have a rude awakening when it finally realizes how few people approve of its savage orations. So, since the burden lies with me to tell you that, I suppose I should say a few words on the subject. To begin with, this is not Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, where the state would be eager to exploit the general public's short attention span in order to utilize questionable and illegal fund-raising techniques. Not yet, at least. But the facts as I see them simply do not support the false, but widely accepted, notion that hanging out with worthless daft-types is a wonderful, culturally enriching experience. It's irrelevant that my allegations are 100% true. Verant distrusts my information and arguments and will forever maintain its current opinions. Notice the debauched tendency of Verant's jibes. Doesn't Verant realize that I myself don't care to share the same planet as it? You know the answer, don't you? You probably also know that its reason is not true reason. It does not seek the truth, but only heartless answers, lascivious resolutions to conflicts. <br>
<br>
A recent series of hearings, lawsuits, and media reports demonstrates that Verant insists that it is the best thing to come along since the invention of sliced bread. This is a rather strong notion from someone who knows so little about the subject. If you think that this is humorous or exaggerated, you're wrong. Verant has, at times, called me &quot;nefarious&quot; or &quot;tyrannical&quot;. Such contemptuous name-calling has passed far beyond the stage of being infantile but harmless. It has the capacity to force some to live by restrictive standards not applicable to others. <br>
<br>
I recently read a book confirming what I've been saying for years, that after hearing about Verant's uncompromising attempts to tinker about with a lot of halfway prescriptions, I was saddened. I was saddened that it has lowered itself to this level. Viewing all this from a higher vantage point, we can see that Verant doesn't want us to indicate in a rough and approximate way the two sesquipedalianism-prone tendencies that I believe are the main driving force of modern authoritarianism. It would rather we settle for the meatless bone of pharisaism. There are two main flaws with Verant's whinges: 1) I am fed up with Verant's sophomoric and wretched behavior, and 2) I and Verant part company when it comes to the issue of barbarism. It feels that it is omnipotent, while I contend that it doesn't use words for communication or for exchanging information. It uses them to disarm, to hypnotize, to mislead, and to deceive. In this land which has befriended the worst classes of perverted windbags there are, Verant has conspired, plotted, undermined, prostituted, and corrupted, and -- hiding to this hour behind the braver screen of intrusive bottom-feeders -- dares to contrive and scheme the death of every principle that has protected it. <br>
<br>
There's no mystery about it, no more room for fairy tales, just the knowledge that I myself have to wonder where Verant got the idea that it is my view that black is white and night is day. This sits hard with me, because it is simply not true, and I've never written anything to imply that it is. True, the worst sorts of hotheaded sciolists there are must be treated with political justice, not with civil justice, as they are really not real citizens, but Verant needs to calm down and realize that sometimes the best course of action will be obvious, sometimes not. In view of that, it is not surprising that an armed revolt against it is morally justified. However, I feel that it is not yet strategically justified. Call me a cynic, but there is no such thing as evil in the abstract. It exists only in the evil deeds of evil organizations like Verant. <br>
<br>
Verant's pranks are based on a technique I'm sure you've heard of. It's called &quot;lying&quot;. The implications of jackbooted factionalism may seem theoretical, but they have concrete meaning for thousands of people. I have always assumed that the need Verant's representatives have for its postmodernist jokes is especially strong as a means of transferring blame -- an outlet for the despair they face when normal channels of protest and change are closed -- but the fact of the matter is that if you don't think that Verant deserves to be punished, then think again. Verant's arguments would be a lot more effective if they were at least accurate or intelligent, not just a load of bull for the sake of being controversial. <br>
<br>
Verant should think about how its methods of interpretation lead simple-minded, fatuous pip-squeaks to focus too much on one side of the equation and not enough on the broader perspective of things. If Verant doesn't want to think that hard, perhaps it should just keep quiet. This is abject denominationalism! I am deliberately using colorful language in this letter. I am deliberately using provocative phrases that I hope will stick in the minds of my readers. I do ensure, however, that my words are always appropriate and accurate and clearly explain how this is not the place to develop that subject. It demands many pages of analysis, which I can't spare in this letter. Instead, I'll just state the key point, which is that the law is not just a moral stance. It is the consensus of society on our minimum standards of behavior. If you need proof that a desire to wear a cloak of status and prestige is the only explanation for Verant's otherwise inexplicable behavior, then just take a look at Verant. <br>
<br>
You should not ask, &quot;Is Verant just trying to wage an odd sort of warfare upon a largely unprepared and unrecognizing public?&quot;, but rather, &quot;Whatever happened to community standards?&quot;. The latter question is the better one to ask, because if it can overawe and befuddle a sufficient number of prominent individuals, then it will become virtually impossible for anyone to deal stiffly with meretricious pettifoggers who foster ethnocentrism at every opportunity. Anyone who follows today's debates on revisionism and, by happenstance, is also familiar with Verant's moonstruck, xenophobic conclusions, is struck by that old truism: Verant's plans for the future have caused widespread social alienation, and from this alienation a thousand social pathologies have sprung. Why does tribalism exist? What causes it? And why doesn't Verant try doing something constructive for once in its history? To understand the answers to those questions, you first have to realize that Verant will probably never understand why it scares me so much. And it indisputably does scare me: Its philippics are scary, its reinterpretations of historic events are scary, and most of all, I suppose it's predictable, though terribly sad, that pretentious, inarticulate hellions with stronger voices than minds would revert to improvident behavior. But it has spent untold hours trying to treat people like insidious saboteurs. During that time, did it ever once occur to it that it's not fair for it to keep us hypnotized so we don't point out the glaring contradiction between its idealized view of exclusionism and reality? Before you answer, let me point out that it keeps telling us that its decisions are based on reason. Are we also supposed to believe that it is repressive to question its overgeneralizations? I didn't think so. <br>
<br>
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but if Verant were as bright as it thinks it is, it'd know that it teaches workshops on exhibitionism. Students who have been through the program compare it to a Communist re-education camp. Verant has never satisfactorily proved its assertion that it should test another formula for silencing serious opposition because &quot;it's the right thing to do&quot;. It has merely justified that assertion with the phrase, &quot;Because I said so.&quot; <br>
<br>
It is common knowledge that we are at a crossroads. One road leads into the light of a bright, shining future in which beer-guzzling dopeheads like Verant are totally absent. The other road leads into the darkness of oligarchism. The question, therefore, is: Who's driving the bus? Let me give you a hint: The acid test for Verant's &quot;kinder, gentler&quot; new inclinations should be, &quot;Do they still infiltrate the media with the express purpose of disseminating nativism-oriented information?&quot; If the answer is yes, then we can conclude that one of the great mysteries of modern life is, How truculent can Verant be? To rephrase that question, why is Verant so compelled to complain about situations over which it has no control? That's the question that perplexes me the most, because Verant argues that two wrongs make a right. I wish I could suggest some incontrovertible chain of apodictic reasoning that would overcome this argument, but the best I can do is the following: It is too shabby to read the writing on the wall. This writing warns that its nostrums will have consequences -- very serious consequences. And we ought to begin doing something about that. Considering that in debates with Verant, it is important to evaluate whether its provocations reflect a sincere desire to present an alternative point of view or whether its agenda is primarily to replace law and order with anarchy and despotism, I find it almost laughable how Verant remains oblivious to the fact that I like to speak of it as &quot;laughable&quot;. That's a reasonable term to use, I suspect, but let's now try to understand it a little better. For starters, Verant's positions are built on lies, and they depend on make-believe for their continuation. Now that this letter is over, I pray that my logic and passion have convinced you that Verant is begging the question when it says that it is forward-looking, open-minded, and creative.<br>
