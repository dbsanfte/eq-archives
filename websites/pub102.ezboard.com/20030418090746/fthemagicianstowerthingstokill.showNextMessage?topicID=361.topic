WE can cast damage shield.  Our damage spell is better.  Cast it on a pet that can take a beating, such as earth pet, and guess what. you get much better damage output from it.  <br>
<br>
Come on everyone, I know people are going to bash this, but seriously, fire pet is the biggest joke in the game as far as pets are concerned.  Lets not tease the younger mages by telling them to use a fire pet<br>

<br>
But you seem to be overlooking some points. 49 fire pet or Dyzil's both cast a damage shield superior to anything we can cast ourselves. Dyzil's has about the hitpoints of an earth elemental too, it's pretty good at taking a beating. Having it cast it's own damage shield means not only do you save mana not having to cast a damage shield (not all have a Velious robe, and it's not our best damage shield either), it also means freeing up a spell gem for something else. 49 fire and 49 water's proc are exactly identical except one checks cold resist and the other checks fire. Post 50 they are entirely differant of course.<br>
<br>
The post 50 fire pet isn't totally useless either. Against high AC mobs, it can do pretty good damage if the mobs resists can be debuffed. Where the melee pets will miss alot or not hit for much, the fire pet can still do some damage. Don't bother me with the level differance, pets are mobs, and as we all know, mobs do not follow the same rules pc's do.<br>

The shield from the fire pet was not all that much better than our DS, our damage shield takes very little mana to cast on one creature, and the amount of beating our pet could take as a fire pet, was no where near the damage our other pets could with our own damage shield on them.  As for decoy, well I used it 2 to 3 times, it was aweful.  Maybe they made it better since then as this was a long time ago.<br>
<br>
As for the 50 plus pets.  Pure garbage.  Thier low level wizzy spells will not outdamage the melee power of our other pets even against high mitagation mobs.  This area is suppose to be for hunting, not about pets, I know this, but if we are going to be talking about hunting then we should be talking about hunting with the best pets we can.  Honestly, earth pet, or water pet depending on your fighting style.  If you like to nuke more, water is a good choice, if you want to let your pet get beat up a bit more, then earth.  Air pet has its uses but its agility in my opinion does not make up for its lack of hp though I have used it in some cases.  The only time I have ever used the fire pets were for CoM fire guy and ixiblat fire elemental in BW.  Other than that, stay away from them.<br>
<br>
Now that im finished with that, the epic pet is a godsend, and will help mages with soloing or groups immensly so I suggest working on it as soon as you can, and if you are not in a guild able to get to the 7th island, start saving up your plat now and buy the crown.  Epic pet is completly worth using for hunting and I only wish I had it before I was level 60.<br>
<br>
By the way, chardok is very very good solo exp with the epic pet, though not quite as good with earth pet.  With epic pet and a c3 before I get to chardok I can get 1 full yellow of AA exp every hour to hour and a half.  Though I think you have to be level 60 to pull singles reliably there. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubaxstarrsmom.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BaxstarrsMom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(5/1/02 3:45:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTh is up with fire pets</span><hr size=1> Pre-50, I've found fire pets are by far the best for soloing, mostly due to the damage shield. The fastest exp comes with soloing low blues -- stuff that is blue to yellow to the pet. At 39-43 using firepet I save 70 mana per kill on not DS-ing, and the extra damage from the DS (34 per hit instead of 20) means one less nuke to get full exp, so that's another 155 mana if I'm using Blaze. So that's 225 mana per fight that I'm saving total over using an earth pet. <br>
As long as I'm not an idiot I don't get aggro from nuking. <br>
The lower hitpoints don't matter, because I kill the mobs so fast. And the mana savings are huge now that the pet regens so fact, because my mana bar is the bottleneck in downtime.<br>

The innate DS is the best DS in the game, pet level +1 or so.   So, if your 34th spell summons a level 28 fire pet, it's DS will be 29 -- this is better than the 49 Lava Shield.  <br>
<br>
A level 34 Mage with a Fire pet that has a 29 point DS is able to tear down blue mobs quick.<br>
<br>
The 39 pet gets enhanced regen, so even if your fire pet take 90% damage in a fight, it will regen to full in like less than a min.  The 39 fire pet is going to have a DS that is about 30+ points.<br>
<br>
If you focus your fire pets with the torch of Alna, and you chain fight low to medium blues, you can absolutely rake in the exp.<br>
<br>
Also, some people forget that DS damage is not counted to the pet's total damage output for exp allocation purposes.   So the fire pet allows the mage a much grater chance of outdamaging the pet in solo situations.<br>
<br>
Now, the original poster has Epic.   Epic is better than any Mage pet, except against mobs that have super nasty AoEs like Rak'ashir that require fire pets.  So, I don't know of any other reason why you, as an Epic-ed Mage, would want to look at using any other pet, especially level 49 fire or DDD.<br>

This is the whole benefit to having a firepet.  Mana efficency.  I'm not fighting against my pet to get all the exp, so i dont have to nuke 2 times unless i need to.  And i dont have to recast a DS on the pet, which saves a TON of downtime considering the right camps.<br>
<br>
Sure, sometimes you can find comparable alternative pets for situations...but why would you ever skimp on the side of being efficent?<br>

<br>
Yes, earth pets have a ton of hps. They need them, because the earth pet takes a beating, and takes another beating due to root when when they should be beating on a mobs backside while it flees. Earth has it's uses but it is the least used pet in my book (excluding rage). Yes, that includes the 52+ fire pets. I can find more uses for those than earth pets.<br>
<br>
As an example: 49 fire pet vs 49 earth pet, hunting hillgiants. Try them both out versus a set number of giants, I'd suggest at least 5 each to get a feeling of an average fight. Of course, let fire pet ds itself.  Earth pet will lose a greater percentage of it's life, because it roots the giant when the giant tries to run, causing the earth pet to take more damage. Now since that percentage is out of a larger amount of hps, each percentage point equals more hps lost than the fire pet. This translates into a much longer amount of time waiting for the pet to heal. The fire pet had killed the giant faster due to it's amazing damage shield, got many free hits on the giants back when the giant turned to run, and will take a shorter amount of time to heal each percentage point of health, because each point is worth fewer hps... and it lost fewer % of health too.  Oh you say you'd just reclaim the earth instead of waiting for it to heal? That means you are spending mana recasting pets and mana on DS and BO (unless you have velious pants and robe), when you could be pulling another giant in the time it takes the fire pet to regen it's lost hps. Fire is so superior to earth for soloing (at those levels) that I can't help but laugh when i hear people say they only use earth for soloing.<br>
<br>
Earth is nearly as bad 50+ as well, except fire is no longer the better pet. Air makes a better solo pet at 53, as it takes less damage, doesn't root, and it's stun creates huge aggro even if resisted (meaning you don't need root to save your ass). At 54 on low mobs Water makes a great pet, as it gets a nice nuke, an extra attack from the front or a backstab from the back. Try a little mage kiting if you like, or have it be a blender on low hp mobs.<br>

Save your earth pets for chain casting. At that point all you want is a load of hps to take damage while the ds works, and frankly I'd probably use MS2 instead. Same amount of hps and it doesn't stop to root every other round. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uteamnoir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>teamnoir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 7:27:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTh is up with fire pets</span><hr size=1> I've been working my way through all the pets.

Fire pet ds is better than what I can cast.  And fire pet getting hit holds aggro, (and thus holds the mob in place), better than earth pet rooting.<br>
<br>
I still try all the pets on each camp.  I've often been surprised by which works well where.<br>

I decided to give fire a &quot; shot &quot; against a light blue mob in dreadlands. Plaguebone died with me having one bub of health ( never nuked once !! WTF ) and the pet having 2% health and thats a 52 fire. None the less that spell just went to page 49 of my book. Personally I don't like that the 52 and 58 fire proc Enstill. With a pet with no hps and not much melee damage this is bad. Unless they want to make our pet &quot; smart &quot; so he kites them :P And on that line if our pets are bordline npc why is they hit like wusses ? but a NPC caster of the same level will beat the holy crap out of you in seconds. !! WTF !! Anyway blah 50+ fire pets just suck all around. I pull that pet and anyone I am with says &quot; get the f@$K rid of that fire pet and pull water ! &quot; <br>

As somebody mentioned earlier, spells never miss (Well... bolts can!), they can be resisted, but they never miss.  Good on high AC mobs.<br>
<br>
Maybe somebody should parse the damage from a fire pet compared with another pet on the Soulbinder, and count each fire pet nuke as full damage (Soulbinder would be green to it I'm sure), and see how that performs. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulardain.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lardain</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(6/15/02 7:30:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=375.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://downloads.members.tripod.com/solro/Lardain.bmp WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: WTh is up with fire pets</span><hr size=1> The fire lv 52 and 58 fire pets were made wizards because of high AC mobs.  <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=58777" target=_blank">
