<br>
45 Mage here just want to share my expirences with Bloodgills. Hopefully this will help you when you decied to go over for the 44-49 stretch.<br>
<br>
There are two 'buildings' that stick out of the water. One that you cannot get onto without lvl and one that looks like you cant sit on but is just slightly underwater so your free to med there. Swim to the spot and set up shop.<br>
<br>
Ok.. First summon a fire pet. I say do this becuase since a recent patch it take about 5mins for the pet to proc its DS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (<br>
Then summon yourself a coldstone some food and water and about 3 waterstones. Cast Arch shelilding (cast phantom plate if u like but using my method you 'should' never get hit) you will be at 3/4 mana sit and med to full. Cast BO2 on pet and /guardme and its time to..<br>
<br>
DIVE DIVE DIVE <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Let me expialn a bit about the setup. There are two distinct levels underwater for sake of easyness i will call upstairs and downstairs <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Upstairs there are a total of 8 bloodgill spawns clustered into 4 sets of 2. These are located on each corner of the buliding directly below you so really easy basicly. Two sets are each located nxt to the two big pillars. One set is directly under were you med and the other is direcly under the 'other' building.<br>
<br>
At lvl 44 i was taking 4 BG's per bar of mana and heres how.<br>
<br>
Locate your first double spawn. Stand back and send pet. Wait approx 2 seconds and cast Renew elements on pet. /assist your pet and you will see a BG HP bar slightly deplited. Cast Shock of swords if this does not kill the first BG the pet will about 3-4 seconds later. At this point the pet can be anywhere from 80-50% in heath depnding on luck. If 50 Renew pet then shock the 2nd BG and it will die. If about 80 dont bother with the heal and just SOS the BG. This would leave me just over half mana. I would find the next double spawn wait till pet at full heath and repeat exactly. This will leave me with just under 1 bub of mana left. Return to med point med to full then rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
Thats it basicaly. If you have camp to yourself there is no need to go downstair for the extra spawns 8 is all i used at 44-45. I was getting slightly over a blue for 4 kills so about a yellow and hour witch is damm good. And this camp will take me all the way to 49 and new spells which is nice. Other peole have stated that breaking the spawns is better but ive never had cause to do that becuase i find taking two on is pretty easy after you have done it a few times. So i never bothered. Plus the excitmet is always good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One thing i would say thou 'Everything is hard at first' dont know who told me that but its true. When i first tried it i died a few times and nearly gave up the camp. But i kept at it. I advise you to do the say try it get your skill down and each one will become easier and easier.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps people out and reduces the amount of times you die. <br>
<br>
Oh another couple of off topic tips. If you are over the age of 7 i advise your to turn /ooc off or become utlitamly annoyed. Becuse of the amount of lvl 15-20 people (bout 80-100 at peak) every other minute some totaly stupid argumet will break out about KSing or some other abbritray and your OOC will become cloged with immature commets. Dont get me wrong really funny and enteraing at first but does get annoying <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Its also a shame to kill the BGs sometimes because I think graphics wise they are very nice to look at. Not nice as in 'nice' but well drawn and anitmated but i digress<br>

<br>
Ok, I'm so in love with bloodgills I /em kiss'ed one last night. Anyways, here's a simplified version of the above post and what works awesome for me.<br>
<br>
PREP:<br>
Summon Fire pet<br>
Summon 3 or 4 Waterstones<br>
Summon whatever else<br>
Med, med, med until he DS's himself (took 20 minutes the<br>
      other night)<br>
<br>
FIGHT:<br>
/pet attack on one bloodgill<br>
Wait 2 seconds (approx 3 bloodgill attacks)<br>
Renew Summoning on pet<br>
/assist pet<br>
SoS<br>
Renew Summoning on pet<br>
/assist pet<br>
SoS<br>
<br>
NEVER SoS before the first heal unless you're taking one of the single spawns. Renew Summoning takes too long to recycle and doesn't heal enough HP. I was tired last night and did SoS first and it cost me 2 hours of waiting plus 125pp and a full mana bar of Mod Rods for a Ress because of that mistake.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, and if you can con a Cleric or Druid to buff your pet with some AC/HP, it's all that much safer. Hell, even a mid-20's Druid and Cleric can give enough extra AC/HP to save your life. <p><center>Behold the Magic, the Music, the Harmony of the Elements!<BR>Drizzinn Shadowedspawn - Erudite/Shadowed Man Magician of the 46th Summoning<BR>Drizzin Barrdslayyer - Gnome Wizzie of the 20th Portal<BR>Darsen Darkstrings - Ninja Bard of the 11th Orchestra</center><BR>

Plus, I now have over 1k in the bank even buying sow potions.  You may die when you first try this... keep trying! You will get the hang of it.  <br>
1) Very important to use the /ass (pet name) button, if you target the wrong gill the pet will stay on the one he is fighting and you will be killed by the one you nuked.<br>
2) Don't heal too early... I wait 4 sec as I have had the 2nd gill attack me at times when I let loose with the first nuke and the first bloodgill don't always go down right after you nuke so your pet is busy and you getting hit<br>
3) Buy some sow potions.. after you heal, nuke the first time look at your pets health if it is reallly low and you don't know if he is going to survive click on a sow potion before you heal him that way you can run away if it goes down bad<br>
4) The area has like a whitish color dome and a ledge that goes around it... once you get down there and kill first spawn.. hug the wall and just swim in a circle to kill the next set of spawns you can meddy down their safely. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uganlet.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ganlet</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/3/01 12:04:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels4950.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   not to sound dumb......</span><hr size=1> but i don't know where these guys are, can someone clue me in? thanks<br>

<br>
I doubt they have been buffed - they have been the same ever since kunark came out, and people have been camping them forever, so I don't think VI would change them now.<br>
<br>
You can do these for great xp all the way till you ding 51 if no one else there is camping them.  A 49 fire pet tears these apart, and ya only need to nuke once to out damage your pet (they have ~1200-1300 HP IIRC, a 600 dmg nuke will do half damage because the fire pets fire sheild will do over 100 damage from a neutral source).  49 and 50 only took a few hours here.  <br>
<br>
To the person who waited 2 hours for a rez - in the time you spent waiting for the rez, ya coulda got ~4X the xp that the rez would give back (~.5 a bubble loss for death, in 2 hours you can get 2 bubs preaty easily). I would ever really worry about getting a rez until 51+ unless there is a cleric in your group or close by who will rez ya cheap or for free.<br>
<br>
Overall it is best to split the gobbies insteada doing 2 at once each time (either way works great though).  To split them kill the first one as fast as you can (nuke as much as possible w/o pet dieing), then kill the second one slowly (heal pet, dont nuke).  Do this a few times and they will be spaced out enough so you can kill one before the second spawns.  Once they are split make sure to kill the first one fast all the time to keep them split.  Ya can kill the second one fast too, but just dont kill it too fast so they get unsplit. <p><table border="0">

<br>
If you have not battled underwater a few fast tips;<br>
<br>
1. After moving count one two before you cast to help fizzles. (seems after moving it takes a few secs to stop underwater)<br>
<br>
2. You cannot swim backwards, unless you have SOW/T-boots. I forget if LEV helps to move backwards, do not think so,<br>
<br>
So just move and cast a little slower and you will have less CR.<br>
<br>
I learned BG the hard way, and in one day died 5 times learning the whole racetrack process.<br>
<br>
I always parked pet back from mobs and used bolt at maz range to pull mob. <br>
<br>
Have fun great exp till 50 or 51, but at 49 you can do DE wiz which is best exp 49 - 53/54.<br>

Pet can almost solo two spawn of Blood gills.<br>
Tactic. Send pet in. Sit and wait till 1st blood gill at 50% HP, Blaze. Let pet finish off if still alive. Second blood gill wait for a bit say 75 - 50 % HP, then Blaze. Let pet finish off. If your worried you can drop a heal on pet after first blood gill is dead or a shock of flame etc., but i never really bothered. Use 1 bub of Mana per Double spawn for Human mage at 142 INT.<br>
After first corner sit and med and wait for pet HP to get back to 100%. Do all four corners, drop down to entrance and do to single spawns by pillars, then do the two by the doorway. Easy.<br>
<br>
I had no downtime except for pet HP regen, as mana useage very low, and after finishing off downstair upstairs was repopping.<br>
<br>
had triple pull once with only 2 bubs mana left easy no problem pet finished up on 30% HP and i had half bub mana left over.<br>
<br>
XP awesome about 1/2 blue every double spawn, PP about 75 an hour.<br>

I used an earth pet with Phantom Plate, keep it damage shielded when fighting.<br>
To split them, send in your pet, heal it when at 80%, assist pet, Blaze, heal pet, Blaze. First goblin should be dead now, make sure the pet is on the one you nuke, /pet back off &amp; /pet kill while you cast blaze should make him stick on your target. Nuke the second BG once with blaze and keep healing the pet until the BG dies.<br>
You now have about 10 - 20 seconds to pull the first BG away from the spawn spot when they repop (i used malise to pull, dont nuke unless you need to raise defence skill ;P ) and voila... Spawn is split now, abuse at your pleasure <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  After this, it is a piece of cake.<br>
When they pop send in your pet, DS it and malise the BG (you dont have to, but i hate resists), Blaze once and your pet can solo it. I am evoc specialised, so i nuked them twice to raise skill.<br>
I could hold 2 spawn points with 2 BGs each, and i was almost allways at FM. Once you are familiar with the bloodgills, you can tell which ones are weak enough to melee them a little, i got 6 defence, 2 offence and 5 points in 1hb. Keep up Phantom Chain if you do this, they hit fast and hard, so dont take chances :/ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucatarack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Catarack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(10/16/02 4:49:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels4950.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.guardiansofvalour.com/pictures/ruf.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Soloable from 39+</span><hr size=1> These are very good and fast exp.<br>
<br>
at 46 I get 1 percent exp per kill = eq 100 gobos = 1 level<br>
<br>
During 45 this was a little slower but not much<br>
<br>
There are 12 spawns + 1 all up - 2 per tower + 4 at the enterance of the marauder cave<br>
<br>
The hardest split is the maurader and guards spot.<br>
<br>
once the maurader is dead he has a long respawn<br>
<br>
12 gobos at 1 percent a gobo = 9 clearings per level<br>
<br>
Respawn is about 13 - 14 minutes. Total time if you have enough mana for all of them (including Kei) is about 2 - 3 hours <br>
<br>
If you over nuke be prepared for some pain - I suggest keep gate up at all times and start casting if your pet is going down well b4 time as once they smack on you you WONT be able to cast<br>
<br>
Only difficulty is in the 2+ hour spawning Maurader - he ALWAYS makes it interesting<br>
<br>
**EDIT At level 47 12 Bloodgils return 10 percent EXP<br>
<br>
**EDIT At level 48 12 Bloodgils return 8 percent EXP <br>
<br>
**EDIT At level 49 12 Bloodgils returns 6 - 8 percent EXP - after this the light blue ratio kills you and your better off going elsewhere - new pets eat them for breakfast <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=catarack>Catarack</A> at: 10/31/02 8:40:22 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xyplok@themagicianstower>Xyplok</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/14/02 2:19:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels4950.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=77.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Great Exp</span><hr size=1> Tried the bloodgill rotation last night and I must say I was surprised at how over-con'd these things are.

Went to 43 quickly.  Here is my method.  <br>
<br>
First a description of the underwater area.  From the lake you can see two 4 pillar constructions.  One of them has a floor with a man standing on it.  Under the water is a large Dome sitting on a square pad.  At the corner of the square pads are these 4 pillars.  There are two Bloodgill Goblins (BG) at each pillar.  The BG's are on a 15 minute spawn cycle.  <br>
<br>
This is my method.  <br>
Step one summon an Air Pet Armor all focus items Shield weapons.  Then summon 6 water stones and a coldstone for Ultravision.  Cast Tiny companion on pet.  Then med up.  Cast burnout and Expedience on you pet and buff yourself. {Include see invisible to see your pet} Med up again.  Swim down near one of the pillars until you see the BG.  Fireshield your pet and then you.  Then send you pet at one.  When pet engages,cast malise, assist Mob, heal Pet, Assist Pet, Cinder bolt Mob, Assist Mob, Heal Pet, Assist Pet, Cinder Bolt Mob, rinse and repeat.   If the pet stays on the same BG, you won't get aggro.  If pet changes targets,  let BG come to you.  Use one of you shorter BG spells (I use shock of blades) on it.  A BG with 50% health will run from the damage shield on you even if you don't get a single spell off.  Have the pet switch targets helps as well.  Once the first BG dies.  Just heal you air pet and let it kill the second one.  You want to longer kill this one to split the spawns.  Note, you do need to nuke once to get XP, use you lower mana nuke. <br>
<br>
Now med up.  You have about 10 minutes to take out a second pillar.  Do the same to the second pillar.  Then swim back to first pillar and wait for first BG to PoP.  With a fireshield, the Airpet can kill a single BG with out any problem with maybe one heal or DD help.  On the first BG in a spawn I usually Cinder bolt it to make sure it dies before the second one spawns.   Then I just heal the Air Pet on the second one to split the spawns even more.  Taking two pillars, I can regen mana.  Once full, I take a third pillar as well.  Doing three pillars, I loose about half a bulb of mana per cycle and will have to drop out a pillar and med back up.  <br>
<br>
The key to making this work is to split the spawns and let the pet do most of the damage and healing.  <br>
<br>
When I make 44, I will probably be able to take all 8 in the 15 minute spawn cycle.  <br>

You can get a glimpse of the layout at least and see where the mobs are by doing this.  Using levi move around barely submerging and you can see clear to bottom, move up and down to get the height just right and you can view the whole layout.<br>
<br>
I have to say again how great the exp is here, did 44 in 3.5 hours on the 8 upper spawns, wasted about 9 hours grouping in DL for all of 45 ( would have been better at BG), and did all of 46 in 3 hours killing the 8 upper and 2 singles lower (have to keep busy without KEI). <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=429815">Talena Waterflower</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - 55 Myrmidon<br>
