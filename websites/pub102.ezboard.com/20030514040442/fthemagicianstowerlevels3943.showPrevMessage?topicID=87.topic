<br>
The place is a wide open plane brimming with blue con bad guys. Everything seems to have a fairly small aggro radius, except for the sarnaks, so you can pick and choose what you want to pull. Hunt near the Skyfire zone if you want a convenient place to run to. If you're evil or agnostic, I've had a lot of good luck hunting just outside the outpost. There are guards here that you can run to if you get into trouble. It's like hunting in a newbie zone all over again. Also, there's a bank and merchants here so you can take care of business, sell loot, buy malachites, etc. Watch out though, as an agnostic gnome I find the prices are outrageous. Over a gold each for malachites.<br>
<br>
The loot here is so-so. Some mobs will drop upwards of 5pp in change, and you'll occasionally get nice gems like emeralds, opals, topaz, pearls, or amber. Mostly this place is just an experience mill. It can get boring but you level quickly and safely. I've grouped and gone solo, both with good results.<br>
<br>
You will want to invest in some SoW potions here. Rhinos and sabertooth cats both run at SoW speeds.<br>
<br>
If you are a good race or grouped with good races, then you'll want to watch out for the dragoons. A large group of them all leave the outpost at 7pm game time and fan out through the zone killing everthing they come across. A lot of times I would pull a mob only to find a goon tagging along behind trying to kill it. The goons all make their way back to the outpost around 7am.<br>
<br>
I've read plenty of recommendations for yetis in the Dreadlands, but I haven't tried them yet. In OT I have the convenience of a nearby city and I hesitate to abandon that. Give OT a try, it's good stuff. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 42nd Trial<i><br>Member of Silmindo, Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Kalamos</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(12/22/00 6:25:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Overthere</span><hr size=1> As it seems Nefarius and I are on similar leveling schedules (*grin*) I will add some comments on his post.  I play a High Elf Mage and am on constant alert when hunting in The Overthere.  Those Goons hit for 120 and will beat you down fast.  I found that if you are soloing ... pull to a spot up the hill and right next to the entrance to the Skyfire Mountains zone.  I had no trouble with Goons wandering to that spot and if you accidentally run into one when pulling ... the Skyfire zone is right there for you to run to.<br>
<br>
If you dont have a SoW, I found that pulling with a low level bolt works nicely.  Gives you plenty of time to run back to your pet when pulling those fast MOBs.<br>
<br>
I also grouped in OT and the exp is quite good .. but if you want to group I highly recommend the north wall of Karnor's Castle in the Dreadlands over grouping in the Overthere.  The exp there is insane at lvl 40+ ... and there is endless MOBs to kill.<br>
<br>
I also killed Yetis and they are very easy and decent exp at lvl 40 ... but I never sat there long enough as there was always a group looking for more outside Karnor's that I would join soon after getting settled in at the Yeti cave.  With a good puller your exp will really move .. I did all of lvl 41 in a four person group (2 Warriors, a Cleric and me) in about 6 hours of play time.  Also, the melee players in your group will love you for your Nullify Magic spell.  Those Drachnids have a nasty damage shield that basically does more damage than the spiders do themselves ... take that down and your tanks and Rogues can smack away damage free.<br>
<br>
At lvl 44 you can likely solo at the north wall ... just have some SoW potions handy in case things go bad so you can haul ass over to the West side of the castle and zone in.<br>

Better then Dreadlands from my personal experiences.  I could manage to pull with out dieing with out sow by vectoring (run/strafe at the sametime).  The fast mobs like tigers and rhinos will eventually catch up, but most of the time I wasnt pull that far.  Without sow I wouldnt recommend pulling over long distances if everything in your area is green.  When pull w/o sow always have sheilding and phantom line up.  The place I pulled to most was the corner of the zone between the FM entrance and Skyfire entrance.  Not many people pull from around there so there is usually stuff to fight when you are ready.  For levels 39 and 40 grouping is fine and can sometimes be better xp but 41-44 soloing/partnering/trioing with other mages/necros seemed to be best. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/undiavar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ndiavar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(3/15/01 7:56:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Overthere</span><hr size=1> You can also hunt sarnak berzerkers for their whips, if you are welcome in the outpost.

That said, you can solo here very well at 39 and up. Your 39 pets have insane regen....over 4percent per tick.

Just remember the regen. My 39 fire pet would be sitting there at 100% most of the time, waiting for me to med up. <br>
So just heal the pet enough to make sure it doesnt' die.<br>
<br>
Oh, and don't pull any sabertooth tigers or sarnak knights....they are not impossible, but they hit HARD, and you don't get enough exp to make it worth it..... <p>Balthemal says: "Save me, Jboots, save me!"</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=fantik>Fantik </A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(3/24/02 12:05:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=32.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   OverThere</span><hr size=1> I just leveled to 41 in OT today. I couldn' believe it. I was oom and my pet had 80 percent health. Somehow I got aggro'd by a cactus, i was on the verge of running because I thought i was gonna die. My pet soloed the cactus by itslef. I was totaly amazed. After that i decided to test out it's solo abaility against the other beasties in the zone. My pet could solo everything in the zone, excluding dragoons of course. I had to literally killsteal my pet to get all exp. I was cruising through 40 and I didn't have a worry in the world knowing my FIRE pet could tank anything in the zone. Also my Gnome was agnostic so i ddin't even fear the goons. The only beasty in the zone that i had to watch my pets health closely was the Sabretooth tiger. I'm definitely staying here until 44. Other people in the zone who were grouped up fighting near me couldn't believe how easily I was soloing here. They would run towards me screaming for help when they were getting beat down by a Rhino because they knew my pet and I could take it out. This place is just awsome for the 39 to 44 range. Of course u come up against the unusually strong beasty sometimes, so I had toss my pet a heal here and there but i was never in jeopardy of dying ever again. Absolutely amazing, my pet actually kicks ass now.<br>

Pre 39, you will get pet deaths if your not careful, but after 39 your pet won't die as long as you nuke the mob with a cinder bolt, get hit for a couple hits (hey might as well raise defense, mine is almost maxxed out) and sit back and watch the show.<br>

At 39, you can plow through berserkers with ease. Fast enough that you might forget to nuke once to get full exp. Save up those braids and turn them in. It takes a lot to get to amiable.
