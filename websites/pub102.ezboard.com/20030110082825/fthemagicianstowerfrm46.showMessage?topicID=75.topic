Something I haven't heard before....</span><hr size=1> I was thinking...what if we had the ability to transform our pets into their base element? Some pets would possibly die in this process, while others would retreat into a defensive form...examples...<br>
<br>
Fire: Transforms into a DoT that takes effect on the target, lowers targets AC. Dies in the process.<br>
<br>
Air: Dematerializes i.e. untargetable. Regenerates HP at a fast rate, but cannot reform and cannot be dismissed until a set time has passed.<br>
<br>
Earth: Becomes like stone! It takes 1/10th normal damage, yet deals no damage itself. Has a reset timer like air, moves at 20 percent base rate.<br>
<br>
Water: Encases your opponent, causing him to choke, DoT effect, possibly snare or slow. Dies in the process.<br>
<br>
This would give alot of diversity to our class as far our  <br>
soloing tactics go.. for instance, you might start off with water to slow your opponent, and follow it up with Fire, then with an earth pet.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uomegasyphon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>omegasyphon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 469<br> <font color=#333333>(10/10/02 1:17:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> comment</span><hr size=1> sounds good but um what is the point of the air one again? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzebanar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zebanar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#333333>(10/10/02 4:56:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ah,</span><hr size=1> Air one would keep the pet from dying, although, I'd wager most of you probably wouldn't care about that..I tend to arm my pets to the teeth, and keep each pet as long as possible.

<br>
These are just examples of what COULD be, not necessarily should be. i just kinda came up with them on the spot, the real idea i'm trying to get out there is the ability to change pets into its base element, giving us greater utility.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#333333>(10/11/02 4:13:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ah,</span><hr size=1> This doesn't make any sense to me.

<br>
What's the difference between being their element and being composed of their element?<br>
<br>
I think they already literally are their element, but that doesn't matter, because roleplay justifications should be internationally illegal.<br>
<br>
This game doesn't make sense roleplay in the first place. How come characters disappear when they camp? What's with the load times? Why are there no laws of physics, and if there are how come people can completely ignore them and cast spells and such? Why can I only mem 8 spells? How do bankers keep 8 bags full of stuff for 10000 people and instantly transport them?<br>
<br>
So, without roleplaying smoke and mirrors, which have no place in class balance discussions since anything can be given roleplaying explanation due to the nature of fiction, answer these questions:<br>
<br>
1) What the heck is this idea? I still don't understand what it does, why it does it, and what good it does for us.<br>
<br>
2) What the heck is this idea(again)? Is it just strange new game mechanics with no known use, other class's skills under the guise of mage abilities, what?<br>
<br>
3) What the heck is this idea?(the final chapter) AA, spells? <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A> at: 10/12/02 10:36:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzebanar01.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zebanar01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 270<br> <font color=#333333>(10/13/02 2:56:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Hmm..</span><hr size=1> Ok, Krilen, we can go into that if you wish =)<br>
<br>
Alot of the spells in Everquest were based on....<br>
<br>
Dungeons and Dragons. Alot of the game, is and always will be based on some roleplaying, or at least THEMES. <br>
<br>
Look: <br>
<br>
Clerics have spells like:<br>
Healing<br>
Anti-Undead<br>
Resurrection<br>
<br>
Necromancers:<br>
Masters of Undead<br>
Lifetap lines<br>
<br>
As much as you might not like it to be composed of roleplaying / theme elements, the game is very much made up of those very things..<br>
<br>
 &quot;This game doesn't make sense roleplay in the first place. How come characters disappear when they camp? What's with the load times?&quot;<br>
<br>
Somethings have to be done for necessity, they cannot be avoided, things like load times and camping......Although, parts of the game DO make sense from a RP perspective.. Rogues sneaking, warriors taking the brunt of a monsters attack, clerics healing. All this comprises roleplaying as well. <br>
<br>
&quot;Why are there no laws of physics, and if there are how come people can completely ignore them and cast spells and such?&quot;<br>
<br>
Last time I checked, I could die falling off a cliff, and incorporating ALL physical laws into this game would bog down computational time. <br>
<br>
Also, take a villager from some tribe in Africa. Allow him to witness a man using a machine to fly. By that villagers perceptions on things, its most likely being done by &quot;magic&quot;. Its being done, somehow, in some way we don't understand..I can't say its much different from our personal understanding of magic in EQ. <br>
<br>
Can you tell me EXACTLY how my magician summons an elemental? Perhaps he works those very physical laws you mentioned earlier, coaxing them to do his bidding, and providing him with what he needs.<br>
<br>
&quot;1) What the heck is this idea? I still don't understand what it does, why it does it, and what good it does for us.&quot;<br>
<br>
You still don't understand what I'm getting at as far as the actual difference between a fire &quot;elemental&quot; and fire? <br>
<br>
Take the Elementals in D&amp;D for instance, a rather good source on the mythical/fantasy realm.<br>
<br>
First, you have the Water Elemental, one of his Abilities is to transform into a Whirlpool, while the air elemental can change into a tornado. Earth can merge with the earth, travelling within it. <br>
<br>
In this case, I'm stating that fire elemental would become a fiery blaze with no physical composition, become a fire DoT, possibly as a last ditch effort to destroy a target. Earth becomes as stone, and takes less damage for doing so. <br>
<br>
Essentially, what I'm asking for here is each of our pets to show more of their elemental nature. This is one method of doing exactly that. <br>
<br>
what good does it do us? Well for me, I would find this entertaining, and another possibly method of attacking monsters rather than the currently bland: /pet attack + nuke strategy. <br>
<br>
What thoughts have I given to class balance? Quite honestly I haven't. Its one of the reasons the idea is so general, keep in mind the examples I gave were just that, EXAMPLES of what could be. <br>
<br>
2) What the heck is this idea(again)? Is it just strange new game mechanics with no known use, other class's skills under the guise of mage abilities, what?<br>
<br>
Obviously they would have some use, as a pet is near death, using it in this way would allow for some diversity. Is it an attempt to steal other classes abilities? Well, if taken in that way, I suppose one could implement it as such, although thats not its intent. As far as how it would work, it would work similiar to how Frenzy burnout was SUPPOSED to work. I.e. at a particular time, the pet would dissappear, and X would happen. In earth's case it could be in the form of a huge AC buff. Its important to note, the ability wouldn't be the magicians per se, but instead the magician &quot;calling&quot; upon the pet to use his own inherent abilities. <br>
<br>
3) What the heck is this idea?(the final chapter) AA, spells?<br>
<br>
Something like this could be implemented in several ways.. I left it open ended hoping for input. <br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
<br>
1) pets at certain levels could get it. Through this method, some skill bar would have to appear as you inscribe the spell. reuseable X minutes. <br>
<br>
2) could be done via spell or inherent ability at a particular level<br>
<br>
3) upon pet reaching a certain amount of HP.<br>
<br>
Finally I would like to answer this statement...<br>
<br>
 &quot;So, without roleplaying smoke and mirrors, which have no place in class balance discussions since anything can be given roleplaying explanation due to the nature of fiction, answer these questions..&quot;<br>
<br>
I entirely agree: Roleplaying justifications cannot be used to &quot;balance&quot; classes. I was never suggested that it can, nor was I suggesting it had anything to do with balance. Roleplaying/Themes can however, change one's perception on a class, giving that class a focus, a defined meaning. <br>
<br>
Lets examine the magician. We are neither, the stage magician, nor the &quot;Summoner&quot; we are something in between. We are both. It doesn't fit into any previous class stereotype I've seen out of EQ. I have a hard time wrapping my brain around exactly what a EQ magician IS, and I'm not the only one. <br>
<br>
What are we doing with: <br>
Shock of swords. I lace an opponent with Various knives and such? kinda like a stage magician pulls a knife out of no where to preform a trick? Ever seen a stage magician attempt to &quot;summon&quot; an elemental? not I. <br>
<br>
Malosini. What the heck is this. I've got a sickness spell now? where'd that come from? what does that have to do with either of the above two? <br>
<br>
Phantasmal protection: Now I deal in ghosts and spirits too? <br>
<br>
Elementals: While this would form a good basis for a class, combined with the other abilities we have, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. if things were to be done to draw in a good customer base, who often times like to base their characters off of others read about in books (drizzts, raistlin, etc) the magician would have to be hybridized with the wizard class.<br>
<br>
The magician class has no identity outside of the EQ setting as it is currently. I honestly think that is a major problem with the class perception, which influences its perception OF being out of balance as well. <br>
<br>
Add this to my list of ideas... <br>
<br>
CHANGE: <br>
Malosini line: to a line that debuffs only fire/magic/cold but more so than current malosini. Rename it somethign elementalish. <br>
<br>
Phantasmal armor line: rename to protection of the elements(if thats not already used). Water which represents healing makes up the regen component, while earth could compose its AC element. <br>
<br>
Change shock of swords line to Boulders/rocks etc.. otherwise essentially keep it the same. Perhaps make a DD line based on a AC save, rather than a resist save. <br>
<br>
I'm only looking for consistency and focus for our class. Balance wasn't a consideration in this thread, although feel free to give input. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umelik001.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Melik001</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://goldrush.com/~herd/as-one.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#333333>(10/13/02 5:23:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=75.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://wreckerofplans.bravepages.com/images/Mage1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New idea for pets!

<br>
Having that much offensive power i.e. the magicians pets, and the wizards nukes would offset the drawbacks of a defenseless, non-control class. Of course, taking each class as they are currently probably would be overpowering. Take away the Snares/Roots of wizard, and force them to use the pet. <br>
