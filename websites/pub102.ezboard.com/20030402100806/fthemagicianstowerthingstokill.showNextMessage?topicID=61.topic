I started playing back in march of 99 like alot of people here (back at the very start) and played a paladin on Xegony until a new server called Erollisi Marr started up.  Some of my IRL friends were just starting up and we all wanted to start fresh along with everyone else so we moved there and I created the first of many many characters on Emarr.. my Magician Dyce Steelslinger.  Back then Mages sucked.. flat out.. they didn't work so I stopped playing him and switched to my warrior Gurglespit Fruggybasher. To make a long story shot I ended up getting bored with the game and recently came back on the 6th of December and I am almost level 49 today (1/3/03.. I am about 20% from level 49.. should get 50th tonight <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) with about 8 days /played (and a good 3-4 of that afk in the bazaar while I was sleeping/working)  Here's Gurg's guide to levelling a mage solo 1-50 in a month <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
This guide requires all the expansions to follow completely.. but you could probably do it without velious all I needed there was Monster summoning <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Levels 1-7<br>
These levels are usually self-explanitory, just kill in your newbie zone and you can usually get to 8th level in a couple or days.. a single day if you play a long session, loot EVERYTHING you will need the cash.  Spells to buy at level 1.. you don't need them all don't waste your money yet on stuff you won't need/use.. buy burst of flame, minor shielding, and summon dagger. At level 4 purchase burn, elementalkin earth, gate, and summon bandages.<br>
<br>
Levels 8-11 <br>
This is one of the tough spots.. I couldn't find great xp anywhere at these levels so I just stayed in nektulios and killed the skeletons there.. it was a bit slow but I chugged through it.. At level 8 I bought elementaling fire, renew elements, invisibility, lesser shielding and shock of blades.<br>
<br>
Levels 12-15<br>
once you hit level 12 this is another annoying spot I pounded through it in Lavastorm with my fire pet (great against drakes.. thier fire breath doesn't hurt them and they eat themselves on the fire damage shield.  I am a HUGE fan of the fire pet.. alot of people hate out pet heals saying they aren't mana efficient.. but on a fire pet you can think of each heal as a DoT + heal since the mob hurts itself with hevery hit to your pet. I hear Plaudal Caverns is good at this level but I can't say for sure myself since I didn't hit paludal until level 16. Level 12 spells to get include, bind affinity, burnout, cancel magic, and elemental: fire.<br>
<br>
Levles 16-23<br>
First you need to either go out to the ocean of tears and buy the level 16 and 20 pets that youwant (I always suggest the fire pet)<br>
Go to the Paludal Caverns.. the EXP here is just nuts!  I just followed the pathway around the big lake (just past the bandit camps if you enter from the Shadowhaven side) and killed every Patog Flarg Fiend that I came across as I moved.  Once again I used my fire pet and it usually took 1 heal and 1 nuke per fiend.. if you stop in the nexux and pick up a KEI (there is always at least one chanter there casting for donations on Emarr) you will have nonstop killing for over a blue a kill.. got 8 levels in a day here it's insane.  Spells to buy - buy all the focus items you want when you come up here, they are 6PP each so you probably won't have the cash to buy them at the levels you can start getting them.. also buy the summon elemental defender and give your pet 2 of them when you summon him (one for secondary and one for back) also be sure to buy Phantom Leather and keep it cast on yourself.. just incase the fiends hit you and disease you.. the HP regen from Phantom Leather will negate the disease dot. at this point you can really start to afford your spells so just buy what you feel you will use.<br>
<br>
24-35<br>
Here is where you move over to the echo caverns, go to the secret entrance near the bank in Shadowhaven and enter the Echo caverns.  go in and turn left as if you were going to Fungus Grove before the water (where you zone to FG) turn around and you will see a big room with mosquitoes called needlites in it.  These are awesome.. once again.. summon your fire pet (I used my level 20 one since I refuse to do research again.. and he worked fine until 29) they hit for 20 max but hit FAST and they eat themselves on your pets DS.. I would throw a DS on myself and tank them for a bit too.. to raise defence and offense. at 29 I started running over to the bogling room and killing the spawns in there too the only way to break the spawn of 4 shrooms and a bogling in the back is to train them to the guards.. or ask for an upper level char running through to split them for you.. I could clear both rooms and med to full in between with the standard KEI.. never leave the nexus without it. They start to go light blue too much once you hit 36 so I moved on at that point.<br>
<br>
Levels 36-45<br>
Here I went to the overthere.  At lower levels stay away from sabertooth tigers, stonegazer cockatrices, and sarnak nights.. you can kill them but they take way too much effort.. if you are evil try and get all the berserkers you can find, as thier whips are pretty good xp too when you turn them in.  When you get your 39 pet you will be able to take most anything.. but I still advise avoiding tigers as they are just meeeean.. and when you get the 44 pet.. kill the tigers and everything else that is still dark blue (will mostly be tigers, sarnak knights, and stonegazer cockatrices)  My favorite hunting spot of the zone is the southwest corner (the corner between the skyfire zone and the frontier mountain zone) there are a ton of mobs here but they don't path all the way to most of the edges of the zone here so you have a place to med in safety.<br>
<br>
Levels 45-50<br>
Go to Lake of Ill Omen and kill Bloodgill Goblins.  They are pushovers.  I summon a fire pet and give it armor, daggers, shield, lev rings, BO2 and the pet can take a pair of them without much problem at all (I, of course, use the fire pet exclusively) I send it pet at each pair... nuke the one the pet is on when it is at 70%, sit, nuke the second when at 70%, sit move on to the next pair.  At 45 I could take all 8 up top and the 4 down below and be medded to FM by the time the first up top popped again.  <br>
<br>
There it is.. the complete guide of what to kill to get to level 50 in under a month without PLing or Twinking <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Level 1-7(good race):<br>
 Newbie areas (Greater Faydark).<br>
<br>
Level 8-15(good race):<br>
 Crushbone. XP rush if u get a group in the Throne <br>
Room.<br>
<br>
Level 16-24:<br>
 Paludal. Definately the best XP at those lvls.<br>
(I was KEIed from about lvl 8 to 24, and Duoed mostly with a same lvl mage. The first 24 lvls was done in 24 hours playtime)<br>
<br>
Level 25-28:<br>
 Netherbian Lair killing ONLY Netherbian drones(little HPs) and warriors(somewhat more HPs). Those other mobs hits for to hard and has to much HPs. I found that the first square room just into the tunnel from the center pillar in the zone was a very nice place to pull to. The Swarm Leader (netherbian Boss) spawns once in a while and can be tough but doable.<br>
<br>
Level 29-43:<br>
 Dawnshroud peaks got lovely XP. From 30 to 33 in the Shroom Castle in the SouthWest corner. From 34 to 38the cavemen outside the Griegsend entrance(and or those at the Maidens Eye entrance). From 39 to 43 run around with the pet and kill Large Zelniaks and or Wolves. There are a lot of them.<br>
<br>
Level 44-48:<br>
 Tenebrous Mountains! Wolves and Bats. They got little HPs and u kill these fast. When stuff starts to get lightblue at 47-48(50) take some of those little gray/brown &quot;aliens&quot; :-). At the higher end of the levels you can try out one of the Coterie camps. <br>
Bloodgills XP was to my experience much lower.<br>
<br>
Level 49-(gotten to 52 so far)<br>
 Ocean Of Tears. The Seafury Cyclops are very good XP. Also you can get a shot at the Ancient Cyclops ring that you can use for the nice +5 Int it has or to get the Jboots. <br>
I have heard Scarlet Desert is also good. Have not been there yet. <br>
<br>
Anyone that can help me fill out the next 10-15 lvls of good xp soloable(or duo with another mage) places to hunt?<br>
<br>
Side note:<br>
I've read ppl saying that ie dreadlands is good xp at around lvl 44 getting 1 level per 8 hours. That is bad xp. From lvl 40 up to 50 each level is done easily in from 3 to 5 hours (at least to my experience in the zones i mentioned). At lvl 49 i got 1 yellow per 50minutes (in Tenebrous mnts).<br>

Took 4 months, but for a casual gamer (6 hours a week average) its pretty good.  Most of the information I used was from this board.  This was for an Erudite, in case the glare from my forehead blinded you.<br>
<br>
First, be sure you have all expansions.  Luclin for the bazaar and nexus, and PoP to go anywhere quick. Keep in mind that 90% of this was solo due to my funky schedule.  <br>
<br>
(1-5) - Bats, gnoll pups, decaying skeletons, and rats in Qeynos newbie area.<br>
<br>
(6-10) - Giant Bats, Gnoll Scouts, Giant Rats, and the Putrid Skeletons in Qeynos hills.  Don't kill bears or wolves because of Holly Bitchstalker.  At lvl 10, start killing wisps for cash and XP.  West Karana animals are also good at this level.<br>
<br>
(11 - 14) - 2 options.  First is Wisp Hunting in Erud's Crossing. Don't kill anything else, and you will be fine.  Great cash and XP.  Second are the Sirens in the Ocean of Tears.  Overcons that yield very high XP.  Short spawn time makes them an excellent camp starting at lvl 12.  Take the boat from Freeport to Butcher, and jump off at the two spires before the butcher zone.<br>
<br>
(15 - 18.) - Yard trash in Unrest.  Death Beetles, Tormented Dead, Greater Skeles, and Jack O' Lanterns.  Great XP that only stops to med/heal.  <br>
<br>
(18 - 24) - Paludal.  There are just no words for the massive group XP you can get in this zone.  I personally never fought the fiends, but stayed in Recondite groups.  6 levels in 2 days with no deaths and no need for KEI.<br>
<br>
(25 - 30) - Alternated between Echo Caverns (Needlites and Boglings), and Marus Seru.  The needlite camp can get boring, but you will raise skills really fast if you step in.  Silly suckers will self destruct against damage shields, so use fire.  In Marus, you will have a never ending stream of xp due to the vast number of similar level mobs.  Watch out for Lightcrawlers and Zelniaks.  Both are KoS to heartbeats, and run faster than SoW.  Zelniaks have an insane aggro radius also.<br>
<br>
(30 - 35) - Golras in Timorous Deep.  Run around their island and kill kill kill.  No wanderers, no adds unless you want them.  Fast XP.  <br>
<br>
(36 - 39) - Overthere.  You will be tempted to join a group.  Don't unless you enjoy slowing down XP and getting aggrivated by dumb pullers.  Find a spot on the ledge, and pull Tigresses, Berzerkers, Chickens, and Cactii.  Once you get 39 pets, pull Knights, Rhinos, Spiked Cactii, and the harder chickens.  Good XP, but it does get a bit boring at times.  Tundra Yetis in Dreadlands are also good XP, but a slow camp.<br>
<br>
(40-43) - Dreadlands.  Group at KC, or kill Glacier Yetis solo.  XP seemed slow in a group, but any chance to group is good to keep grouping skills fresh.<br>
<br>
(44-50) - Bloodgill Goblins.  I started at 42, but would have had fewer deaths had I started at 44.  4 pillars of 2 goblins, and 4 more at the western wall.  12 total, plus the marauder if he is up (which is rare).  At 42, the XP was about 2% per kill, or 24% per &quot;pack&quot;.  At 49, the XP about 3/4-1% per kill, or 10% per pack.  Take 2 at a time with fire pet.  Use low nuke or ceramic band to tag both with damage, then just heal the pet.  39 pets were a challenge, and the 44 pet yeilded some pretty exciting fights. The 49 pet just rips them to shreds without breaking a sweat.  If you want to add to the XP, there is a barracuda spawn on the east wall.  It is on a 1 minute timer, so logically you could just chain pull them.  To break the boring camp, I also did some grouping in City of Mist, and a bit of soloing the Seafury Cyclops in Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
Best advice is don't just grind XP.  I took time out to do quests, and do a bit of tailoring.  I also did a lot of exploring in later levels just because I am a newb and in awe of the vastness of the world.<br>
<br>
Here are some other spots worth mentioning:<br>
<br>
Qeynos Aquaducts - 5-8.  Went down there for the dress quest, and stayed because the XP rocked!  Jello Cubes and rats by Cubert spawn are great xp with a 20% dungeon bonus.<br>
<br>
West Karana - 8-14.  Animals and spiders will yield some nice stuff to sell at bazaar.  Bandits will yield bronze weapons and cash.<br>
<br>
North Karana - 15 - 20.  Beetles are good XP, but with all the wandering Griffs, the place can be nerve racking.<br>
<br>
Warsliks Woods - 24-29.  You can solo the mountain giant fort.  They look menacing, but they are cake.  With KEI you can keep the whole fort down.  The skulking brutes in the caves are also good xp at this level.<br>
<br>
South Karana - 24 - 32.  Paw, KFC, and wandering stuff all are good.  Later in life you will hate this zone with a passion, though.  <br>
<br>
I hope this helps someone.  May you have fewer corpse runs than me. <p><div align="center"> <a href="#"><img src="http://www.nemeandesign.net/eq/sig2.jpg" width="382" height="66" border="0" onClick="window.open('http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528641', 'morillion', 'WIDTH=800,HEIGHT=600')"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mantria>Mantria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#333333>(2/24/03 10:30:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=432.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.DaveShirley.org/neil/rock_beast_03_t%5B1%5D.gif height=150 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Similar Path</span><hr size=1> Hands down THE best place to levelo from 12 - 20 is Pauldron Caverns. <br>

I was literally gaining a level every 20mins or so.  Once I hit 16 and got my new spells I just went back and from 16-20 took 94mins.<br>
<br>
I made a Gnome mage because I wanted to mess around with tinkering and well since I know mage class well I figured would be fastest way but never in my wildest dreams did I think it'd go THAT fast. 16hours played time and level 20.<br>
