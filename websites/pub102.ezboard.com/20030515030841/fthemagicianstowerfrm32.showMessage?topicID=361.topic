I've been playing Everquest for just over a year, the first character I ever created was my human magician. She is now level 60 and remains my only character above 40, and my favorite class by far. I love being a magician. What follows is not to indicate my displeasure with the class, but rather to lay out a wish list of things I'd like to have. Some may be unrealistic, some may be class unbalancing, that is why I brought my ideas here, so others might discuss my ideas with me.<br>
<br>
First, I think magicians should be the ultimate pet class. Most of our damage and abilities should revolve around our pet, after all we create him specifically to do our bidding. With that said, here are a few things I'd like to see.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet only weapons that are actually good.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
An upgrade to the &quot;runes&quot; line of weapons that would give +10 to all resists but be pet only. <br>
<br>
Bane weapons that are pet only, where the bane would actually stack above their damage. For instance a pet with a +5 bane vampire weapon would have 5 damage added to each hit against vampires, something like that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet only armor with stats that actually add to the pet's stats</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Armor with good resists but -hps<br>
<br>
Armor with +hps but -resists<br>
<br>
Armor with +dex +agi but -resists<br>
<br>
This would give us the ability to customize our pet for an encounter.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet &quot;lures&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
One or two pets that cast &quot;lure&quot; type spells that will actually land on higher level mobs. This pet would be very weak in hps to keep magicians from using it to solo things they aren't intended to, but strong on damage against higher level mobs to help mages in both groups and raids where our own nukes are heavily resisted and our normal pet's nukes do not work.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> More beneficial pet buffs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The &quot;resist blah&quot; line of spells, pet only. Yes I know pets now go on our resists, but I'd rather be able to buff my pets resists independently of my own than have his resists match mine *shrug*<br>
<br>
Cure component added to pet heal. Doesn't make any sense that the master of pets can not cure his/her own pet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Utility Pets</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These pets would work like any other pet, which means we could not have another pet up and have any of the utility pets up.<br>
<br>
A pet at lvls 20, 39, and 54 that roots. Same cast time as the wizard basic root, same resist rate/length of hold. This pet would have approximately 10 hps at lvl 20, 45 hps at lvl 39, and 85 hps at lvl 54. This pet would disappear within 15 seconds after summoning if not directed to attack. This would give us the ability to walk through an area and maybe not have to gate if attacked. This pet would cast root immediately upon being sent at a mob.<br>
<br>
A pet that increases our mana regen. This pet would not attack a mob as normal if we were attacked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> General things non pet related</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I think Phantasmal protection should be moved to lvl 49, and a second one given at 60 that gives us the same mana regen as clarity. Sorry, just bugs me that druids have better mana regen than us, and yes it is a jealousy thing lol<br>
<br>
Pets should be considered a part of the group when group spells are cast or group songs are sung. This has long been an annoyance of mine.<br>
<br>
/drop command. Come on, it can't be that hard to implement and it's silly that we spend so much of a raid with an inventory full of bandaids or else staring at the ceiling/floor.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying we should have all of these things, but perhaps some of them.<br>
<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pet only weapons that are actually good. <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Tons of farmable weapons out there that are good. Yaks and gnoll whips being just two of them.  I'd rather see them allow us to get the weapons back somehow. Like reclaim weapons and pet poofs or some such.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pet only armor with stats that actually add to the pet's stats<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This one only be good if they allow us to summon a bagfull like the bags of armor we can summon now.  I don't want to have to summon 9 pieces of equipment on top of everything else I have to cast already.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pet &quot;lures&quot;<br>

The water pet casts a spell that LOOKS like ice why doesn't it HIT like a cold spell?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  More beneficial pet buffs<br>

<br>
Again this goes back to the fact I don't want to have to keep casting more and more spells on my pet or for my pet.  Soon we'll have nothing to do but cast buffs for pet for an hour.  My resists are all over 100 and it seems to work fine.  Pet used to get slowed religously in fungus grove but now it is very VERY rare he does.<br>
<br>

If you wanted to be a wizard then you should have made one. Verant has already stated Mage will never get root. Learn to deal with it.  I personally don't want Flappy flying around my head just to get mana regen.  rods and transons and a form of clarity work just fine for me.<br>
Not saying is a bad idea, god knows I'd use if given to us but of all the ideas here this one has the lowest chance of ever seeing the light.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> General things non pet related<br>

<br>
Personally I like that the pet takes no exp from the group instead of getting the buffs from the group.  After all as long as a group member is within MELEE range the pet doesn't even get hit, so why bother buffing it?  They took the exp penalty off for us. If we got pets buffed with group then I'd forsee the penalty coming back.<br>
<br>
Love the phantasmal idea.<br>
<br>
The drop command would be nice but tis one I can take or leave.  I use the slimline inventory for the new UIs and since I'm never looting during raids, cept the odd item I am awarded a full inventory is just easier for me atm.<br>

I would just like the option to run through an area and not have to decide on defense or invisibility.<br>
<br>
If I'm running through an area invis and something sees through, or it drops (rare since I have the fixed duration invis), it is silly that I have zero options aside from running or gating. I've tried the &quot;channel through&quot; method, and that didn't work so well *grin* I have kited mobs around and killed them without a pet but it's rare that actually works since most of our nukes have a rather long cast time and the mob is on me before I've finished casting. Generally if something sees through my invisibility I either gate or train the nearest zone. I HATE having to train an area because I have no other option aside from gating back to my bind (which is almost always nexus)<br>
<br>
I don't want to be a wizard, I thought that was pretty clear from most of my suggestions, since 90 percent of them revolve around our pet. I like being a pet class, but by the same token I do not feel that should mean I have no means of defense. The idea of the utility pet was thrown up when I was talking with my husband one night. I agree that traditional root is not within Verant's vision of a mage, and I understand how it would throw a significant advantage to the chain pet people, but I do not feel the &quot;utility pet&quot; root would give us any significant advantage other than the ability to maybe not train a zone line.<br>
<br>
Explain to me why Necromancers, the other int caster pet class, have Root, Snare, Feign, Harmshield, Shadow Step, and Gate and we have Gate. I've heard the reasoning of &quot;well our pets are stronger&quot; and quite frankly that doesn't cut it with me. I'm not talking about a measure of defense I could use when my pet is up, I'm talking about a measure of defense for situations where my pet is not up. I do not feel that would give us a significant advantage, and I'm not even asking for a method that is guaranteed, just a shot at defending myself is all I ask for.<br>
<br>
Pure caster wise let's look at defense (not counting gate)<br>
<br>
Shaman<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
<br>
Druid<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
Snare: 2.25 second cast<br>
<br>
Cleric<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
Stun: several, various cast times, shortest is 1 second<br>
Divine Aura: 1 second cast<br>
<br>
Enchanter<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
Stuns: lots, various cast times, shortest is 1 second<br>
Rune: Longer cast but can be put up ahead of time<br>
Mez: lots, various cast times, but short<br>
<br>
Necromancer<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
Feign Death: 1.5 second cast<br>
Harmshield: 1 second cast<br>
Shadowstep: 1 second cast<br>
Darkness line: Various cast times, but relatively short<br>
<br>
Wizard:<br>
Root: 2 second cast<br>
Shadowstep: 1 second cast<br>
Snare: 2.5 second cast<br>
<br>
Magician:<br>
Pet: 10 second cast<br>
