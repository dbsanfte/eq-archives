<br>
I honestly didn't have time to read all the posts in this thread, but this is a recurring statement in a lot of the posts.<br>
<br>
Do you think that if Verant took CH out of the game and adjusted mobs accordingly that the mobs would no longer be insanely hard?<br>
<br>
The insanely hard mobs are that way because Verant wants them to be insanely hard.  Verant would adjust the mobs to be just as difficult based on whatever tactics they see players use in the absense of CH. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uiralikespotato.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IraLikesPotato</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(5/16/02 2:53:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hmm.</span><hr size=1> Problem I see is due to the way a lot of high end mobs are designed you see a huge portion of the dmg done to the mob coming from melee. While at the mean time you see the more offensive priest classes and mages and necros not doing significant damage because of lots of mobs being designed to be all but immunte to their form of attack: spells.  Add to that certain DoTs which do insignificant dmg in comparison to what wizards and the melees are doing cause aggro from a mob with 30k hp who is at 50%.  <br>
<br>
How many mobs do you see that are immune to physical dmg? (this makes a lot of sense if you think of a fantasy setting, extremely powerful Arch Mages and wizzies in most fantasy stories would laugh at any type of physical attack.)<br>
<br>
Ah, so where is this all leading?<br>
<br>
If you take CH out and gave clerics 2-3k hp heal and gave power back to offensive spells on big mobs you'd have it better for all.  I mean if VI gave casters the ability to do real dmg with spells on big mobs and left CH in, then mobs would drop insanely fast once tank had secured aggro (kept alive by the handy CH.)  That's why I think VI so nerfed caster dmg is because they realized it came down to nerfing caster dmg, retooling CH, or just letting people kill their pretty mobs fast. Of course options 2 and 3 were unacceptable so they just castraded pure casters and druids/shammies in the dmg department.<br>
<br>
With CH out you can have casters being able to do dmg with their spells (but this isn't unrestricted we still have to wait long enough for tanks to get aggro) and with a 2k heal you have power to keep an MA alive but it's going to take more clerics than before, which appropriately depowers the clerics. And we won't see as much &quot;1 cleric is worth 1,000 mages&quot; type things from raid leaders. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uroyalbloodofrodcetnife.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Royal Blood of Rodcet Nife</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(5/16/02 5:41:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hmm.</span><hr size=1> Complete Heal was overkill in the Kunark era.

If Verant could go back in time and make a change, one of them would be to remove the spell completely.

Cheal is only &quot;neccessary&quot; in encounters where it takes more than a group to take down one mob.  In normal XP grind situations, even if I am main tank (and I'm a ranger) I find that a druid or shaman does just fine with their healing and about as much downtime as would be with a cleric.  No class is absolutely essential in the daily XP grind.  I've done daily XP with me and a bard trading off healing.  Yes for high-level encounters like AoW and CT, you need to adopt such tactics as chain-CH, rune rotation, and warriors going defensive.  Most high-end encounters are tailored to those sorts of tactics.  Perhaps a way to make everyone feel a bit more &quot;balanced&quot; would be instead of nerfing CH completely just make it a 50+ spell rather than 39.  50+ is when clerics &quot;need&quot; it since that's when the &quot;high-end game&quot; approximately starts, so why not wait until then?  Until then, it's just a convenience rather than a neccessity.  As for warriors being the better tank, actually I've seen paladins and shadowknights tank just as well.  They don't deal out as much damage as a warrior, but they can keep agro thanks to their spell lines and can take damage since their armor is roughly equivalent to that of a warrior.  And that is the job of a tank...to take the damage from the mob while more fragile melees (like me) dish out extra damage without getting hit.  (thank Verant for jolt though...)  Unfortunately, it seems that even in every day grind groups, the &quot;we must have a cleric, warrior, and enchanter team and damn all the other classes&quot; mentality still reigns supreme.  *sigh*  Heh...forgive me if my interpretations are away from the norm, but it's just my opinion and observations.  *shrug*<br>

Wrong, its from intellegent players who realise that yellow mobs are poor exp for the time it takes to kill them, the damage they do during that time and finally the risk involved.<br>
<br>
As to the word nerf, its an analogy.  A real weapon converted into a soft spongy weapon (Nerf toys).  An uprade to someone else isn't a nerf to you.<br>
<br>
HP buffs are only useful if you're being chealed, otherwise it just increases downtime.<br>

EQ would be horribly broken for a long time.<br>
<br>
Thats the short answer.  Heres the explaination.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Lessen all mobs HP, easy to say, hard to do.  Is it better to use tanks that trade off?  How about pets that just absorb the damage?   Theres a number of different strats that players will try and verant has to figure each one out and how it will be the new &quot;effective tactic&quot;  Cause yes, most players will pick one tactic.<br>
<br>
- Lessen melee damage.  You have no idea how welcome this would be..  Perhaps spells cast by ubermobs would actually be feared..  Same dilema though.<br>
<br>
- Amazing how long it took for people to figure out how good slow was.  Now that it was beefed up all that time (I guess verant wanted us to use it.)  the same problem fits for slow.   And again things have to be re examined based on this as well.   If most damage is being done by spells now and the mob was meant to be slowable then you have a slow spell spell?<br>
<br>
- If verant wants to make super duper mobs then zerg tactics become more promising.<br>
<br>
All in all it's way too much effort to even try.   It won't be done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uyanbun.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Yanbun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 133<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 12:55:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Can't be done</span><hr size=1> EQ will last longer if they take, say, the summer, and make plans for revamping CH, and all encounters that is is ment to be used for.

You are so right on. I have been spending time reading alot of the message boards for new online games that are coming out. OMG some of these games look really amazing and two or three of them I am going to try because I am looking for a change. Coming from a AD&amp;D background I feel EQ has really let down casters and it is to late for them to go back now. All i can do is squeeze as much enjoyment that is left in this game out before I move on. City of Heroes looks like a very cool game. The graffics are breath-taking to say the least. The world looks awesome and having the ability to fly will be very interesting. I love fantasy role play and I love comics and superhero stuff. City of Heroes appeals to me and I for one can't wait till it is released this summer.<br>
