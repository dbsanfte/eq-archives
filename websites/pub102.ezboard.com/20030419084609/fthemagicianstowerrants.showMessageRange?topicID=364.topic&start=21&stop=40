There are soemthinsg that you SHOULD be prevented form owning/buying: that which harms others. Idots shoudl not own firearms, fast cars, explosives orother such stuff. The exact specifics of that have to be carefully weighed between personal freedom and harm to the society.<br>

Socialism has failed evrytime it's been tried. Thats fact. You can't name 1 place where it worked.<br>

Oh and if I lived anywhere that I hated as much as some of you seem to hate the US I'd pack up and be on the next plane out. You should think about it. But don't just say it like that piece of crap Alec Baldwin. I bet these people that don't think the government should tell them what to do with their money would make an exception if it were to buy you people a one way ticket out.

<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Moron rich kid brat gets to high expense school gets soemwhere in life PURELY because of the reputation of that school but he is a total idiot. Is that right?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There are some problems with that statement.  Most people in the US learn what Randul was incorrect about in free public schools.  There are private schools, but most people attend public schools.  I do agree that we need &quot;more new schools with much smaller pupil numbers and class room sizes, and higher paid and more respected teachers&quot;, but simply stating that the problem exists doesn't actually fix anything.  Besides, even with its problems, the &quot;American school system&quot; (which by the way doesn't even truely exist in such a form) isn't that bad.  There are also other problems.  If a child is raised in an environment where education isn't stressed, then no amount of education system is going to help.  <br>
<br>
As for the second quote, no its not right, but at the same time, how much does it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>truely</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> happen?  First of all, people don't get into paid schools on payment alone.  There are other factors involved such as having shown a willingness to work hard previously (previous grades, school/out of school activities, etc).  Someone who is a complete, lazy moron is going to have difficulty gaining acceptance into a paid school.  However, I'm not niave enough to believe that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>enough</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> money still wouldn't get you in.  Once in, you have a new set of problems.  If the school is truely good, then it means the students truely have to work for the grades (parent's can't just buy them).  Simply going to the school isn't good enough to get a good job, if I attend the best school in the world and get C's and D's and F's, its not going to get me a job.  If the &quot;best&quot; (considering that best <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a subjective term) school just sells grades, they will quickly lose the title of &quot;best&quot; school, and the system fixes itself.<br>
<br>
The best form of economy, in my opinion is a Capitolism that has socialism threaded through it.  Any system that is held to its extreme, literal theory will fail.  You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>must</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> protect people from the flaws of capitolism.  For example (as Silver has brought up before) the tobacco industries have not had a very good track record.  They're starting to pay for it now, and hopefully will continue to do so.  Another example would be Enron.  A lot of good, intelligent, and completely innocent people lost their jobs because of the corruption of the heads of the company.  The government's job should then be to take care of the good workers until they can get a new job.  In pure capitolism these people would be wasted, they would go hungry, lose their homes, credit, etc, before finding a new job.  However, that doesn't mean that its the government's job to make sure everyone has money at all times.<br>
<br>

<br>
Sweden is generally considered the model socialist society.  Of course, they also have good oil revenues, and an extremely low population, 8.9 million.  The UK is around 59 million, for comparison.<br>
<br>
Anyways, there's more I have an opinion on thats been brought up, trickle-down theory, corruption, lobbies, helping 3rd world countries, etc.  But this post is already getting so long people won't read it, so I'm going to finish up with this...<br>
<br>
Its an individual's responsibility to put clothes on their backs and a roof over their head.  Its the government's job to make sure the people have the chance to do that, while protecting them from each other.<br>

<br>
Very much so.  I moved from a high school in San Antonio, Texas known for academic excellence(Clark, if you're from there).  Then I ended up moving to Denver the middle of  my junior year.  Both schools are your average, run of the mill high school.  The quality of the teachers is the same, but the people just aren't interested in education, or going to college nearly as much as the people I knew at Clark.  The difference is family, and motivation-and the school can not do anything about that.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, Clark had a much higher percentage of athletes.  Wonder if that had anything to do with it, even with the extremely false 'dumb jock' stereotype.<br>

Yup, democratic socialism, with capitolism as means of promoting wealth and innovation seems about the best we can have at the moment.<br>
<br>
My gripe is with the constant harping that CAPITOLISM is &quot;good&quot; and the only method that works, and removing many safeguards and controls on corporations and financial institutions.<br>
ie Capitolism is being portrayed as &quot;&gt; democracy and socialism.&quot;, and being more important than governments and justice.<br>
Capitolism as merely a method of enriching folk's lives is good, as the moral structure and guiding light of your society it f**** sucks :/<br>

Realistically, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. <br>
<br>
Monopolies, Bad. Oligopolies, Bad. True Competition Good.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, all too often things are done in the name of capitalism/free markets that are really bad for competition, which is really what makes capitalism thrive. Waaaay too many mergers going on in the world these days. As soon as companies have to start competing on price, they start looking to eliminate their competitors so they can inflate their prices again. Some controls are needed to prevent the greed of capitalism from doing more harm than good. Some greed can be a good thing, and greed is generally rewarded under such a system.<br>
<br>
By the same token, Socialism would work pretty well if we were ants, but since we're humans, it tends to fail due to the fact that it does in fact reward laziness. Raz is correct that some good has come of socialism. If it didn't have some good ideas, no one would believe in it at all. Universal health care is a wonderful concept, I just can't trust a government to run things efficiently enough for it to actually be a help to everyone. Labor unions and civil service provide too many loopholes for inneffective and unmotivated workers to retain their employment. <br>

<br>
Well...anyway...<br>
<br>
This is mainly to you, Silverblade, in response to the following comments you've made in this socio-economic debate, but this is also to all those other people that jumped on the Capitalist/anti-Socialist bandwagon without fully developing their thoughts out.... At least Silverblade made a concise (though angry) arguement for his position<br>
<br>
Before I say my piece, I want to make a few things clear. First of all, I am a Chinese American. Second, my family fled China after the Communists took over. Third, I have excellent reason to believe that the rest of my family was slaughtered as my Grandfather held an official diplomatic position within a Chinese embassy under the Republic and came to America instead of answering the Communist-ordered recall.... that, and the fact that my Uncle, who later escaped to America, confirmed this...<br>
<br>
So, it is understanble to assume that my following comments are made because of personal bias.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> <br>
<br>
*SOCIALISM* is the idea of &quot;people come first, peopel are important&quot;, it's NOT freakin' communism, are you dense? Problem is that folk take it as a &quot;political absolute&quot; rather than a basis for starting things from. or get so wrapped up in the beaurcracy of it they over look the fact that its about HUMAN BEINGS, be they one, or a million, ALL have rights<br>
<br>
Socialism is an IDEAL, so of course it don't work in this world because too many folk are pragmatic selfish bastrds.<br>
<br>
Ok, the basic problem with Capitlism is, that rather than seeing Capitolism as a methods of creating, and spreading wealth, therebye bettering everyone, it is in practice all about GREED and POWER.<br>
<br>
My gripe is with the constant harping that CAPITOLISM is &quot;good&quot; and the only method that works, and removing many safeguards and controls on corporations and financial institutions.<br>
ie Capitolism is being portrayed as &quot;&gt; democracy and socialism.&quot;, and being more important than governments and justice.<br>
<br>
Capitolism as merely a method of enriching folk's lives is good, as the moral structure and guiding light of your society it f**** sucks <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that the above quotes basically sum up your posisition on this thread... I'm gonna divide this into answering your thoughts on Socialism and then your thoughts on Capitalism<br>
<br>
The textbook definition of Socialism has traditionally been that of a system of social government in which the means of production and distribution of goods are owned and controlled collectively or by the government. Now, the ideal behind this is economic and/or social equality, or in the very least, a lessening of of inequality, which is why production and control is centered in the government. <br>
<br>
In fulfilling this ideal, Socialism actually succeeds.<br>
<br>
The Soviet Union actually acomplished much during its 80 year rule. In a country with a history of backwardness, reactionism, and extreme social and economic inequity (thats the Russian Empire of the late 17th century to 1917 for you non history buffs), the Soviet government made huge strides. Almost overnight, Russia saw universal enfranchisement (that means everyone could vote for anything that was allowed to be voted for), equality between the sexes, universal health and medical care, and zero percent unemployment. <br>
<br>
Prior to 1917, Russia was primarily an agrarian economy with a laughable industrial economy. The saying goes that in World War I there were four men to a single rifle. <br>
<br>
By 1943, the Soviet Union actually outstripped the Nazi Germany in industrial productivity in the production of arms, armor, munitinos, cars, and steel by a large margin. <br>
<br>
An arguement could be made that the above statement is the work of Soviet propeganda and thus, not credible. However, this particualar statistic was NOT released by the Soviet Union, rather, it is the work of an American committe finding during the 50s that attempted to assess the military capability of the Soviets should America go to war with them.<br>
<br>
Thus, we can't simply say that the Soviet Union failed because none of it worked. Obviously, in regard to some areas, Socialism did a marvelous job of quickly bringing Russia into the modern world. <br>
<br>
So why did the Soviet Union in the long run fail? You yourself stated the reason Silverblade, albeit in a much more pessimistic way then I would have put it. Indeed, people on average are self-motivated and greedy. A correlation to this is that for a person, the desire to work hard and his/her personal advancement are in direct proportion. <br>
<br>
The ideal Socialistic society creates an enviroment where EVERYONE is equal, regardless of birth, sex, ACOMPLISHMENT, or EDUCATION.<br>
<br>
I stress these last two factors because they are why Socialism cannot work and why it does not work in the real world. Because everyone is equal regardless of who they are and what they do, there is no motivation (satistfaction of greed) for a person to achieve and personally advance within society because there is none. Personal advancement equates to social ineqality (if one person moves up a ladder to the next tier, where does that leave everyone else who didn't move up that ladder?). Once again, I go back to the Soviet Union for my example. <br>
<br>
During the second Five Year Plan under the Stalinist regime, a system of quotas was developed for factories. To make this discussion empirically manageble, lets assume that the factories were ordered to make 50 million nails per month. <br>
<br>
The result of this was that the Soviet Goverment recieved 50 million tiny half cenimeter nails that were brittle (because of their small size) and generally useless. That month, 50 million nails were melted down resulting in a loss in productivity.<br>
<br>
The second month, the Soviet government changed the quotas from amount of nails to tonnage, they instead asked for 200 tons of nails (i have no idea how much nails weigh). What resulted was the production of about a hundred huge nails, each weighing 2 tons. Once again, due to the inherent lazyness of people, production fell off. <br>
<br>
While the above example may seem idiotic, it actually did happen. (The foremen and several of the workers were subsequently shot as &quot;slackers&quot; and &quot;enemies of the people&quot; after that, the factory met the next month's quotas adequetely and according to standards).<br>
<br>
Another, more recent example is the fact that in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, there was one brand of toothpaste availble to the public in the country..(and it tasted horrible, believe me).<br>
<br>
Socialism, is inherently flawed due to the fact that unless Civil Rights are violated, there is no motivation for people to work hard and achieve. Thus, on average, while productivity as a whole increases, quality of products suffers because there is no motivation to maintain quality, only quotas to keep. It is all Civil Rights violations can do to ensure that the quality of the production is even marginally acceptable. Also, because production is controlled by the government, there is an emphasis placed on &quot;guns&quot; (non-comsumer goods) rather than &quot;butter&quot; (consumer goods) which leads to a generally less standard of living for the populace.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: While everyone is indeed equal in Socialism, while everyone is equally treated, and while everyone equally matters, they are equally poor, equally hungry, and generally equally less well off. Silverblade, in light of this, when the core theory is so very much flawed (as opposed to slightly flawed which is Capitalism..and the next post), I can't see how one can make it the &quot;basis for starting things from&quot; without changing the fundemental concept of Socialism which is universal equality. <br>

<br>
Thats right, I knew I was missing something...  Your absolutely right Balanz, but this is because Socialism is a system/ideal that is a its absolute core a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>moral</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and good hearted ideal.  I honestly believe that most Socialists, who truely believe in the ideal of Socialism are extremely good hearted people.  Thus, they are ironically the leaders of Civil Rights movements, Labor movements (championing the downtrodden), and other such good hearted and noble objectives.  When you get down to the cold functionality of the viability of the system they advocate, it simply does not work.  <br>

<br>
I'm tired, its 4:50 AM, and I have a paper on Shakespear due in aprox....7 hours...WTF am I doing writing this S*** anyway....  The quality of this post is gonna be really bad in comparasion to the last post..  when i'm more functional//awake i'll go back and fix the problems with this post because I'm postive this post will have massive errors and alot of logic problems...<br>
<br>
Anyway...I hate to do this to you Silverblade but the way I see it, Capitalism is the ONLY viable socio-economic system.  Capitalism is an ancient system that has survived centuries.  From its conception at the hands of Adam Smith in his book <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em> The Wealth of Nations </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, Capitalism has flourished throughout Europe and the rest of Europe.  It has survived the Cold War, the great battle between Socialism and Capitalism, and it survives and thrives to this day.  <br>
<br>
So, because its lasted so long and its the system that everyone uses, that means its the BEST system, right?<br>
<br>
@#%$ no, well actually, it is the best system, but not for narrow-minded reasons like that.<br>
<br>
As I said in my last post, Human beings are greedy and self-motivated.  Capitalism works because it actually addresses these fallacys and accomodates them, something that Socialism unfortunatly does not.   <br>
<br>
Capitalism at inital glance is a cold hearted, sunovabitch, cruel-ass system.  I mean, @#%$, theoretically under Capitalism you can (and do) have starving kids and who cares?  Not my problem, your problem.  Thats the core theory of Capitalism, everyone looks out for numero uno (thats number one in spanish) and for some reason, an &quot;invisible hand&quot; magically appears out of nowhere and the economy and society as a whole advances all wrapped up in a nice little package.  <br>
<br>
Yep, thats pretty much Capitalism in a nutshell...  <br>
<br>
However, under Capitalism, people have a tangible motivator to work hard and advance.  People with skill, talent, and drive are motivated to work hard and create wealth for themselves.  Also, because under Capitalism, the market, instead of being controlled by the Government, is instead controlled by the Consumer, quality of goods, and thus standard of living as a whole goes up. <br>
<br>
Thus, while there is a greater econmoic diversity between rich and poor under Capitalism, the economy and the standard of living, as a whole is much better then what would be experienced under Socialism.  To grossly simplify my arguement, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being starving and 10 being filthy (@#%$ you Bill Gates and your Demon Inspired, God Cursed, Soul Stealing,........DRUIDISH!!!!!!!!!, X-Box..thats right you X-Box Junkies, God is on MY side as he is on the side of all PS2 fans.....(i'm tired, don't take that seriously) ) .. rich<br>
<br>
Everyone in Socialism would be at like 2<br>
<br>
While in Capitalism would vary widely with an average of about 5-6.<br>
<br>
Thus, the average person would be much better off than the average person in Socialism.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying Capitalism is perfect, hell, there is no perfect system in my opinion, however, Capitalism is the best system because it, compared to the other system, Socialism, is less flawed and accomodates the fallacys of People rather than correct them.<br>

We're not really socialists either actually. What happened was that for the most part of the 1900s we were led by the Social democrats (which started out as a labour movement blah blah and is in it present state.. pretty much like any other party, ie. populists). That's why we're called Socialists..<br>
<br>
Anyway.<br>
<br>
Socialism in its pure form hasn't ever been implemented nation wide. It doesn't matter if you think about Marx's (The dictatorship of the proletariat?) or if you talk about altered ideas such as Lenin, Mao or whomever. What has been implemented has been dictatorship through govnermental ownership. That's not the same thing as the base value of Socialism.<br>
<br>
Socialism could work as in that the society offers services that citizens can partake in, but Socialism will also alienate said citizens because it can not at the same time offer choice.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Capitalism on the other hand will not work very good either since there will be no one controlling what happens on the market. One example is the innovation from a few years back: A special tyre that was made out of (forgot exact number) lots less Rubber and with which it would be impossible to get caught in an aquaplane while driving. This tyre would also let the car use up a lot less ( same here I'm afraid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) gas. This tyre would have been a revolution for the general safety and the pollution levels worldwide, it would also have meant that oil reserves would have lasted a little longer. Yet, it never came into production since the big rubber and oil companies would have lost too much money on it.<br>
<br>
In that way Capitalism will just be an expression for greed, global well-fare surely falls far behind.<br>
<br>
Now, which is right and which is wrong isn't up to me to say. Let me just close with saying that selfishness isn't the same thing as ignoring others. You can be a hell of an egoist and still give money to charity. In fact, Capitalism would have to be a society built on charity. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=blumfield>blumfield</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(11/27/02 4:05:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: idiot socialists</span><hr size=1> Damn, I got to the thread too late -- darkerplanes summed up 90% of my views on this subject.  So I won't go to the trouble of restating them in detail.<br>
<br>
But what it comes down to essentially, for me, is that I wish to be entitled to just rewards for my labour.  I wish to own what I've earned, and I want what I've earned to come into my possession.  It is not 'greedy' to want to be justly compensated for your achievements (or if it is, then greed is good).<br>
<br>
It has been stated in this thread that socialism is inherently more moral than capitalism.  I would say the reverse is true.  Socialism, which consists in public ownership of property, is unjust, because everyone is entitled to the rewards of *my* labour.  This is, in effect, theft.  The justification offered for such public ownership is &quot;need.&quot;  Poor people need my money.  So the socialist state steals my money on their behalf.  It is legitimized burglary.<br>
<br>
Socialism oppresses the rich just as capitalism oppresses the poor.  The argument could be put forth, &quot;but the rich have so much!  And poor people are dying right and left because they have no money!  They don't deserve it!&quot;  But this argument rests on a contradiction.  Socialism, which proposes that everyone should be equal, also proposes that the rich are not entitled to their money, whilst the poor are.  Hence they lack rights which the poor are granted.  This is an inequality.  It is a punishment for merit.<br>
<br>
I was born in poverty.  American public education provided me with virtually nothing.  But (pardon the cliche) I believed in the American dream: that people, by their own efforts and intelligence, should be able to achieve just about anything, regardless of their origins.  Holding to that dream has served me well.<br>
<br>
I will include a caveat:  pure capitalism does not work.  The economy must be regulated, because when companies become large enough, capitalism ceases to function.  A state of competition between businesses must be maintained, sometimes by government intervention.  Competition is what guarantees low prices and quality goods/services for the consumer.  <br>
<br>
Also, the complete abolition of welfare is inhumane.  Some people, because of physical or mental defects, are unable to work.  They must be assisted.  But being poor alone is not an adequate justification for receiving welfare, unless the economy has collapsed and absolutely no jobs are available.  <br>
<br>
Therefore, only in very poor countries, where it is impossible to earn a living without state assistance, is socialism viable.<br>
