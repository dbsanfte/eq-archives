WORKING WITH MAGICIANS<br>
<br>
Sorry if this item seems a little simplistic, it's written as a general guide, and assumes you've never played a mage or worked with one a lot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Most people don't realise the usefulness of working with a magician in Everquest, which is a real pity, considering what this useful, versatile class can do for YOUR character and group! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This article explains how to get the best from your mage friend, and what you can do for him, so your party can kick major buttsky <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Magicians can summon powerful pets and useful items, nuke enemies and cast resistance debuffs and damage shields. <br>
<br>
TANKS (WARRIORS, MONKS, PALADINS, RANGERS, SHADOW KNIGHTS, ROGUES)<br>
The pet Aggro &amp; Attack distance attribute (see below) is a major point that can be used to YOUR advantage! Pets can't taunt as well as a proffesional tank can. Despite calims, pets aren't as good as a properly equipped tank, and their also dumb, so never feel they are a replacement for you, isntead they are your tanking buddy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   They will take hits for you, stun, root mobs off the healers and generally help you. Don't be afraid to pull back and let the pet take some hits if you need to get healed or deal with another mob. because pets regenerate, if you don't let the pet get hit now and then you are actually making the healers work harder than you should, and do you really want the cleric to say &quot;OOM!&quot; when you're trained? Pride stops many tanks letting pets do their jobs, but do you tell a wizard &quot;Stop nuking! I can take it!&quot; ? Of course not, the wizzy is there to help you, so is the mage and his pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
There are some mobs whose special attacks, fire, poison, or cold, you are best letting the mage pets deal with, since they are darn near immune to it, and also to let mobs waste their mana on nuking! This is done with Maestro in the Plane of Hate for example.<br>
Magicians are a very, very fragile people, they are the only class with almost NO defensive abilities, no stuns, root, mez etc, only your taunting and the pet keeps the magician from being aggroed on. If the mage dies, the pet dies, please try and guard the magician, they will love you for it  Mages use the Phantom Armour spells to regenerate so they can take some punishment, but most blue mobs will tear a mage apart<br>
Levitation Rings summoned by magicians let non-casters levitate, and don't need batwings, they also give AC 4. Great items when fighting mobs that can Grav Flux!<br>
Shadow Knights should watch out for their pets, due to the PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE issue (see below) SK pets generally get smashed if they try to tank alongside mage pets if the mob isn't feared! SK pets get too close to the mob compared to the elemental ones<br>
<br>
CLERICS<br>
Pets are mini-tanks basically. Since they regenerate you don't need to waste valuable mana on them, and mages at high lvl can summon Modulation Rods (Mod Rods), right click converts 200 hp to 150 mana. Vital for rezzing lots of folk or when your OOM. <br>
Magicians' Phantom Armour spell is overwritten and wiped out by your Shield of Words spell, so please do not cast this on a mage without asking first! Mages regenerate thanks to  the Phantom Armour spells, again saving you mana.<br>
If the pet is acting as a main tank, treat it as a tpical tank, healing and buffing. Pets have enormous amounts of hit points at high level though (2000+ from the 51 level and higher spells). but they also regen fast.<br>
<br>
SHAMANS<br>
Again pets are tanks, so you can buff them and heal them. However mages cast the Burnout spells on their pets, which are haste spells, so do not cast any speed spells like Alacrity without asking they will generally overwrite or not take hold, Burnout spells are better for pets as they add armour and other stats too.<br>
Again, Mod Rods help you to convert hp to mana, and saves time Cannibalizing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Shamans should watch out for their pets, due to the PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE issue (see below) shaman pets may get smashed if they try to tank alongside mage pets! Shaman pets though have a much bigger aggro distance than necro/SK pets and thus may be ok.<br>
<br>
ENCHANTERS<br>
Enchanters hate mage pets for breaking mezzes, well this can be avoided by making sure the magician knows his job, it took you time to learn your craft,  and similarly magicians have to learn how to work with you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   When several mobs are pulled when working with an enchanter, the mage should WAIT to attack, keep at the back of the party with his pet so they wont' get aggroed on. Once mobs are mezzed, he can /assist safely on the chosen target. If the pet goes for the wrong mob, use your stun spells, then mez and make sure the mage gets his pet off the mob. Alternatively just let the pet deal with the mob ,you don't have to mez every mob <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The pet can tank quite well saving you mana and aggro. Discuss what tactic to use with your mage friend.<br>
Don't cast the Shade/Cloud type AC buff spells on a mage without asking first, they overwrite the Phantom Armour spells that let mages regenerate.<br>
Enchanters should watch out for their pets, due to the PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE issue (see below) enchanter pets generally get smashed if they try to tank alongside mage pets if the mob isn't feared! Enchanter pets get too close to the mob compared to the elemental ones. This also applies to Charmed mobs, except large creatures like giants by the way or some high lvl mobs that have a big aggro radius. Enchanter pets actually do pretty good damage it's just they lack hp and AC. <br>
Tashan spells let magicians Shock nukes and Malise spells work beter as they are magic based, as well as air and earth pets stuns/roots get resisted less.<br>
<br>
NECROMANCERS<br>
Work very well with magicians, but the Earth pets' Root  breaks Fear spells, but not snares. Fear kiting with an air, fire or water pet works extremely well (the lvl 54 and 60 water pets backstabe hehe!). Donating mana to the mage means he can nuke mobs down fast, so kited mobs don't get too far and cause aggro. Also since Fear isn't good to use in dungeons, the mage pet can do tanking for you, beware however that due to the PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE issue (see below) necro pets generally get smashed if they try to tank alongside mage pets if the mob isn't feared! necro pets get too close to the mob compred to the elemental ones.<br>
<br>
WIZARDS<br>
With the pet to taunt off, or better still Root, a wizzy can have fun nuking! The Earth pet casts root frequently and doesn't break your Snares. The magicians Malise series of spells makes your nukes rarely resisted as well. TPing around with a mage pal you can accomplish a lot of tasks quickly.<br>
<br>
DRUIDS<br>
Again the ability to TP to good spots, have a tank and nuker is a great combo! Fear and snare kiting works well and you can heal/buff the pet if needed. Mage and druid damage shields don't work together unfortunately <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
Druids  should watch out for their pets, due to the PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE issue (see below) druid pets may get smashed if they try to tank alongside mage pets! Druid pets though have a much bigger aggro distance than necro/SK pets and thus may be ok.<br>
<br>
BARDS<br>
Bard songs dont' affect pets, major bummer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also bards are HUGE taunts, so if partenring with a bard be very careful of taunting, only earth pets and probably air can stop mobs going after an incautious bard! Still, a bard's speed (for pulling), melee, and song skills make him a good partner for duoing with a mage.<br>
<br>
<br>
MAGICIAN SUMMONED ITEMS<br>
Note all mage summoned items disappear when you log! They are great for CR, so you don't have a &quot;naked corpse&quot; that cannot be resurrected, and can provide quick equipment.<br>
WATERSTONES:  put them on fingers or in an inventory slot, and right click an dyou get Enduring Breath effect and don't need fish scales either! However you cannot target other people, so watch out if you are rezzing folk underwater!<br>
LEVITATION RINGS: activated like waterstones have up to 3 charges of evitation and give AC 4. however a bug sometimes stops the correct number of charges working <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
DAGGER OF SYMBOLS: Damage 5, Delay 19 which makes this a damn good piercing weapon! Can be placed in the ranged slot as well as in hand and provide +5 Magic , Disease and Posion Resistance<br>
SPEAR OF WARDING: Dmg 6 dly 27,piercing,  Again in hand or in ranged slot, provides +5 Fire and Cold resistance.<br>
SWORD OF RUNES: 1hs dmg 7 dly 27, procs Ward Summoned on summoned mobs (45 hp DD)<br>
STAFF OF SYMBOLS: 2hb dmg 10 dly 34 has 4 charges of See Invisible, can be used as lev rings or Waterstones<br>
STAFF OF RUNES: 2hb dmg 9 dly 36 casts Cancel Magic, can be used as lev rings or Waterstones<br>
HEATSTONE / COLDSTONE: give infravision / ultravision, put in ammo slot. Laos give AC if put in neck slot.<br>
DIMENSIONAL POCKET / DIMENSIONAL HOLE / GIFT OF XEV make weight reducing bags Edit: All are 100% weight reducing. great for carrying all that heavy but not important booty like Fien Steel weapons. Never ever put important things into them incase you go link dead! <br>
MODULATION ROD: 1hb dmg 8 dly 32 (?), right clicking this converts 200 hp to 150 mana, great for casters who go OOM a lot, espcially clerics.<br>
<br>
MAGICIAN PETS<br>
TANKING: Magician pets are pretty good tanks, not as good as a warrior, ranger or paladin, since they lack skills, armour and brains :&gt; However they do REGENERATE their health quickly, especially the water pet, and the pets summoned from the level 39 spells and higher regenerate incredibly quickly, they can be fully fit from almost death within a few minutes. Some pets are very RESISTANT to certain attacks, so they can safely deal with some foes, and using them to attack the mobs first can prevent the enemies special attack being used on a tank if the pet is taunting. Water pets are almsot toally immune to poison, air to cold and fire to flame and heat.<br>
PET AGGRO &amp; ATTACK DISTANCE this is little understood or utilized by most players. Elemental pets, as they get high level have a truly huge aggro and attack radius, meaning they can fight a mob from considerable distance, almost as if they had the reach of giants. In EQ distance = aggro, the closer a palyer or pet is to a mob the worse the mob will aggro on them. Since high lvl pets attack from a huge distance they rarely get aggroed on, wasting the pets ability to take damage for players and using its regeneration to heal quickly after the fight. This can be overcome using the &quot;pull into pet method&quot;, basically the puller lures the mob then stands behind the pet so that when the mobs hits the puller and mage gives the pet the attack order, the enemy will be almost inside the pet, the pet will be so close the mob will go into a frenzy on the mob and almost totally ignore any one else! As long as no one over nukes or melees too close, the mob will stay on the pet, allowing the players free reign to reign havoc on the mob. As long as the pet is healed when necessary, this tactic can mean almost no down time, since no one is hurt bar the pet, which regenerates quickly. Casting a damage shield, or using a fire pet (which has a built in damage shield) makes this an awesome tactic!<br>
Also rooting the mob right beside the pet works great (nice tip from a ranger pal, Andric)<br>
STUPIDITY &amp; PATHING: Yup, mage pets are pretty dumb, they have to be controlled correctly, and that's down to their master! Thsi is a particualr problem when working with enchanters (see below). Due to bad pathing pets are often best dismissed and recast in the new spot and set to /pet guard here mode so they don't wander. If you don't hear the message &quot;Guarding with my life, oh master&quot; message then the pet isn't on guard duty.<br>
WEAPONS: Don't give pets weapons without asking their owner, you can cause problems, lvl 24+ mage pets dual wield so giving them a 2 handed sword will stop them dual wielding and won't make them do any more damage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The lower lvl pets do get an advantage from 2 handed wepons however <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
MAGICIAN SPELLS<br>
MALISE SERIES (Malise, Malisement, Malosi, Malosini and Mala) These debuff every resist on the target! Making weapon procs, nukes etc all far more likely to work *evil laugh*.  Mala is irrestible.<br>
NUKES: Magician nukes are either magic based (Shock spells) or Fire. They cost more mana and are nearly always slower/less damaging than wizy ones, but are still very good. The Bolt series (Lava Bolt etc) are Line Of Sight (LOS) spells hat will be blocked if they hit a player or object, so they are often best cast from ABOVE and thus onto the mobs' heads <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Bolt spells have an enormous range however.<br>
DAMAGE SHIELDS: These damage anyone who hits the target, even mobs immune to magic!! The last point makes them very useful when dealing with Spite Golems (Hate) or Reavers (City of Mist). Great if you are about to be trained or take on a lot of mobs since their duration makes enemies  take a huge amout of damage. Normally cast on the primary tank just before a fight. There are group versiosn, Boon of Immolation at lvl 53.<br>
CAL OF THE HERO: lvl 55 spell that can let the magician summon a person from anywhere in the zone to his side...Great for infiltrating deep areas <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
