If you don't care about a few new newbie quests that were added for Dark Elf Magicians (as well as Wizards and Enchanters) then just ignore this post.  Obviously the items given by these quests are not meant for high level characters, but young Dark Elf casters might find a few of them to be quite useful.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Apparently Nektulos forest was given a bit of a revamp with yesterday's patch.  New mobs were added, some old mobs were given a facelift and a number of brand new &quot;newbie&quot; quests were implemented.  These quests result in several pieces of low-level armor useable by Dark Elf Wizards, Enchanters and Magicians.  Each piece has at least +1 int on it and some pieces actually fill slots that a young caster probably wouldn't be able to get int items for (notably hands and legs).<br>
<br>
Anyway, being the curious, quest-obsessed Conjurer that I am, I decided to go through these quests and find out what the end result was.  It turned out to be something of a mixed bag...<br>
<br>
The quest NPC, Morgalanth, can be found standing in the middle of the main room of the Tower of the Spurned (Caster guild located in the Commons area of Neriak).<br>
<br>
You say, 'Hail, Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Who dares to address me while I am clearly busy reviewing my daily research. I sure hope this is important Initiate, I do not have time to waste on just any initate of House Spurned. Not a single day goes by that I do not come face to face with cannon fodder that is not even worthy of a headstone in our burial grounds. If you wish to [prove yourself] then I might be in a generous mood. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I wish to prove myself'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'I must admit this is not the first time I have heard someone say that nor will it be the last, however I am wiling to give you a chance. First thing we will need to do is get some clothes in your back if you wish to survive for any amount of time. If you are a young Wizard, Enchanter or Magician of House Spurned then I will present you with a [mystical sewing kit]. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'what mystical sewing kit'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'The Mystical Sewing kit that I have created is one that is able to fashion a material used for crafting clothes worn by all Initates of House Spurned. All that is required are Cloaks worn by Lightwalkers that plague our Forest to this very day. If you are to take my task and seek vegenence on this inferior group of Arcane lightwalkers you will pride your house along with gathering one of the [key ingredients] for your armor. I have heard rumor that they have tried to generate some kind of magic from a source shrouded by our forest. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'what key ingredients'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'You will be given different combination recipes for whichever armor piece you wish to craft. You will combine the specific items in the Mystical Sewing Kit that I will give to you when you are ready. After you have combined the correct items in your sewing kit you will fashion together a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned. At that time you will put the pattern that I will give you for each armor piece you request in the loom along with this cloth to craft your Armor piece. I will also suggest that you craft your Breastplate last due to the difficulty of obtaining the items. Do you [understand] the instructions I have given you? '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I understand'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Very well Initiate, here is your Mystical sewing kit. I have the patterns and recipes necessary to craft Spurned Initiate [Skullcaps], [Bracers], [Sandals], [Sleeves], [Trousers], [Gloves} and [Robes]. When you feel you are ready to gather the items necessary to craft your armor simply tell me which piece you want to craft. The items that you will need to collect will mostly be found in the Forest but some will be here in town. As I said before seek out the Arcane Lightwalkers to collect the cloaks that you will need to make the armor materials. I look forward to seeing what you will make of this opportunity. '<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> At this point you receive a Mystical Sewing Kit, a 10-slot, large-item holding, lore, no drop container with a combine button.  This in itself is a nice gift for a new character</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft a skullcap'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'You will need to collect 1 Blood Drenched Cloak 1 Ash Drakeling Scale 2 Bone Chips and 1 Red Wine. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Skullcap. Take this Cap pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft a Skullcap of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Here Morgalanth gives you an enchanted cap pattern (lore, no drop).  To save a lot of repetition, each of the following phrases also results in an enchanted pattern for the item in question.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft a bracer'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Initiate, you will need to collect 1 Blood Drenched Cloak, 1 Black Mamba Skin, 1 Fire beetle Eye, 1 Short Beer. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Bracer. Take this Bracer pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft a Bracer of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft sandals'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Vendui Initiate, you will need to collect 2 Blood Drenched Cloaks, 2 Snake Scales, 1Ruined Bear Pelt and 2 bandages. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Sandals. Take this Sandal pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft Sandals of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft sleeves'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Welcome back Initiate, you will need to collect 3 Blood Drenched Cloaks, 1 Fire Beetle Leg, 1 Black Wolf Pelt and 1 Water Flask. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Sandals. Take this Sleeve pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft Sleeves of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft trousers'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Hello again Initiate, you will need to collect 4 Blood Drenched Cloaks, 1 Deathfist Legionairre Scalp, 2 Bone Chips and 1 Ruined Wolf Pelt. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Sandals. Take this Trouser pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft Trousers of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft gloves'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Excellent Initiate, you will need to collect 3 Blood Drenched Cloaks, 2 Garter Snake Tongues and 2 Spiderling Silks. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Sandals. Take this Glove pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft Gloves of the Spurned Initiate. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'I want to craft a robe'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'It brings me great pleasure to see that your training has come this far Initiate, for your House Spurned Ceremonial Gown you will need to collect 5 Blood Drenched Cloaks, 2 Basilisk Eye Stalks, 1 Embalming Dust, 2 Large Snake Skins. Combine these all in your Mystical Sewing Kit to create a Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned that is used for creating your Robe. Take this Glove pattern that I have given you and place it in the closest loom along with your Bloodstained Cloth of the Spurned to craft a Robe of the Spurned Initiate. Please return to me should you succeed in this task, I have one [final test] for you in mind. '<br>
<br>
You say, 'what final test'<br>
<br>
Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen says 'Well I must say that I did not expect you to progress in your training at the rate you have Initiate. I also knew there was something that seperated you from our other initiates. For your final test I will need you execute 3 specific Orc Chieftans in the forest and the  Commonlands. Bring me the Prayer beads of all 3 Orc Chieftans. These Orc Chieftans are the heads of each Orc camps and will be heavily guarded so I would suggest bringing any friends you have made that are somewhat proficient on the battlefield to assist you. They have caused my house many problems and it is time that they are put to rest. You have come to far to fail me now Initiate. I hope to see you soon, alive that is. '<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I haven't done the final test part yet, I assume two of the Chieftans will be found in the two new Orc Camps that have been added to Nektulos Forest.  The third is probably found in either East or West Commons.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Anyway, to save you from having to search through Morgalanth's responses (and explain a few things) here are the recipes for each of the pieces:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Skullcap</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1 Blood Drenched Cloak<br>
1 Ash Drakeling Scale<br>
2 Bone Chips<br>
1 Red Wine<br>
<br>
Blood Drenched Cloaks are a semi-rare drop from the new &quot;Arcane&quot; casters that have taken up residence around the Nektulos Wizard Spires.  There seem to be three kinds of them, Wizards, Magicians and Enchanters.  I think the names got a bit jumbled though...  the Magicians are called Arcane Shapeshifters and the Enchanters are called Arcane Elementalists.  Seems like these should have been reversed.  Killing these folks gives a bunch of negative Faydwer-based faction hits and a positive faction hit for The Dead (Neriak Necro/Shadow Knight guild).  The cloaks themselves are stackable no drop items that seem to drop an average of one out of 10 kills.  This item is required for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> every</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> piece of armor (and most of them require more than one).  Since I'm level 55 I don't really know how tough these guys will be for a young caster to kill.  They apparently have a very large assist radius though, as I saw a level 6 Magician quickly get overwhelmed by three when he tried to pull one (they're spaced pretty far apart).  Basically the level at which a person can do these quests is the level at which he can successfully tackle these mobs.  Their level seems to range anywhere from 2 to 9.<br>
<br>
Ash Drakeling Scales drop from the new Ash Drakeling mobs in Nektulos.  They seem to be around level 4 or 5 and drop scales pretty often.<br>
<br>
Bone Chips, most people should know where these come from.<br>
<br>
Red Wine can be purchased in Neriak, The Bind Fish is where I go for all my intoxicating needs.<br>
<br>
Combining these 5 items in the Mystical Sewing Kit results in a swatch of some sort (I forget the actual name) that is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> specifically</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for the Skullcap.  Combining this and the Enchanted pattern from Morgalanth in any tailoring facility (he says to use a loom but my Deluxe Tailors Kit worked just fine, I would imagine a Small Tailors Kit would too since only two items need to be combined) will result in the Skullcap of the Spurned Initiate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurncap.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Note:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the final step may or may not require some tailoring skill.  I'm a Master so it was trivial for me, but how trivial I cannot say.  It may be as easy as making a silk swatch, or it might take a bit more than that.  I'll probably redo these quests with my newbie wizard to see if I can figure out the trivials for the tailoring portion of each recipe.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Bracer</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1 Blood Drenched Cloak<br>
1 Black Mamba Skin<br>
1 Fire Beetle Eye<br>
1 Short Beer<br>
<br>
Black Mamba skin drops off the new Black Mambas (snakes) in Nektulos Forest.  They're a bit tougher than Tree Snakes, around level 8 or 9.  Not sure how potent their poison is but supposedly it's not that bad at all.<br>
<br>
Fire Beetle eyes, pretty self-explanatory.<br>
<br>
Short Beer can also be purchased in the Blind Fish.<br>
<br>
Same procedure here.  Combine these four items in the Mystical Sewing Kit, take the resulting swatch and combine it in a Tailoring container with the enchanted pattern Morgaleth gave you to create the Bracer of the Spurned Initiate.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurnbracer.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sandals</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
2 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
2 Snake Scales<br>
1 Ruined Bear Pelt<br>
2 Bandages<br>
<br>
This recipe is so straightforward I'm not even going to go into detail other than to say that summoned bandages aren't gonna work.  The result:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurnslippers.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Sleeves</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
3 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
1 Fire Beetle Leg<br>
1 Black Wolf Skin<br>
1 Water Flask<br>
<br>
Another easy one.  The only confusing point is that Morgaleth says to use a Black Wolf Pelt...  I killed many Black Wolves and didn't see a single one of those but I did get many Black Wolf Skins, which apparently are what the recipe actually requires.  Again, don't use a summoned Water Flask, go buy one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurnsleeves.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Trousers</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
4 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
1 Deathfist Legionairre Scalp<br>
2 Bone Chips<br>
1 Ruined Wolf Pelt<br>
<br>
Easy stuff here as well, except for the scalp.  These are a rare drop off of the Legionnaires that populate the new Nektulos Orc Camps.  They seem to range from levels 7 to 9 and may or may not require a group to reliably kill (not sure whether any of them can be single pulled or not).  This one is definitely worth doing though, as it results in a pair of pants much better than the Silversilk Leggings that most young casters walk around in.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurntrousers.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Gloves</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
3 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
2 Garter Snake Tongues<br>
2 Spiderling Silks<br>
<br>
Aside from the fact that the Garter Snake Tongues (dropped from another new Nektulos mob, the Garter Snake) seem to be extremely rare, this is an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> easy</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> one that results in a pretty decent pair of gloves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurngloves.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Robe</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
5 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
2 Basilisk Eye Stalks<br>
1 Enbalming Dust<br>
2 Large Snake Skins<br>
<br>
While there are Basilisk Hatchlings in Nektulos, they either don't drop eye stalks or do so very rarely.  I ended up going to Lavastorm and even there I had to kill about 20 Basilisks before I got two Eye Stalks.<br>
<br>
The Enbalming Dust drops off of mummies.  Might have been able to get this from the undead camp that's near the East Commonlands zone line (mummies occasionally spawn there, and in fact they may also occasionally spawn with the undead at the Wizard Spires too) but I ended up just running to South Ro where the first Crypt Mummy I saw gave me the dust I needed.<br>
<br>
Snake skins, easy.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the resulting robe may not be worth the effort, in my opinion.  It doesn't even have a very unique look.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurnrobe.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/spurnrobelook.jpg"><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>
<br>
The quests aren't that tough and they result in some pretty decent newbie items, and most should be obtainable by the character's early teens.  If you're creating a new Dark Elf caster sometime (that you don't plan on twinking), you might want to work on these.<br>
<br>
Here's a list of what to keep an eye out for while you're levelling that little guy up in Nektulos Forest.  Note that with the exception of the Blood Drenched Cloaks, all of these items are tradeable.  Might want to check out vendors for the rare stuff like eye stalks or enbalming dust:<br>
<br>
19 Blood Drenched Cloaks<br>
4 Bone Chips<br>
2 Spiderling Silks<br>
2 Snake Scales<br>
2 Large Snake Skins<br>
2 Garter Snake Tongues<br>
2 Basilisk Eye Stalks<br>
2 Bandages*<br>
1 Water Flask*<br>
1 Short Beer*<br>
1 Ruined Wolf Pelt<br>
1 Ruined Bear Pelt<br>
1 Red Wine*<br>
1 Fire Beetle Leg<br>
1 Fire Beetle Eye<br>
1 Enbalming Dust<br>
1 Deathfist Legionairre Scalp<br>
1 Black Wolf Skin<br>
1 Black Mamba Skin<br>
1 Ash Drakeling Scale<br>
<br>
*You can buy these in Neriak<br>
<br>
Incidentally, the fact that these are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Initiate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> items may mean that future upgrades to these are planned (Like the Initiate -&gt; Disciple -&gt; Regent Symbol of Innoruuk quests for Clerics).  If so, it might be a good idea to have these in the bank.  Heh, it's a longshot I know...<br>
<br>
BTW, some of the items seem to have incorrect graphics.  Check out the pants, gloves and sleeves...<br>

I remember how hard it was to level there in the low levels, especially compared to other newbie areas I've since been able to experience. It's great that Verant is revamping some of the low levels too. There definately weren't enough low level quests worth doing, and the new newbie armor quests are actually kind of fun.<br>
<br>
It's actually very smart of Verant. Hook the new players at an earlier level, give veteran players something new to do when they make fresh characters. It was always a sign of a problem that so many would rather power level a new character than play it, because the low levels were either boring or the fun material had all been played through. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrezark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trezark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#333333>(4/10/02 6:50:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=930.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/ezhmage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: New Quests for YOUNG Dark Elf Casters</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Anyone know what you get from the [final test]? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Ceremonial Dagger of the Spurned</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Same problem that some drops are terribly rare... I love the idea though.  When the parts are most useful you are still getting exp during the hunt.  Much better then the old days of selling bat wings for a full set of cloth armor... or worse yet fishing for coppers! <p><hr>
