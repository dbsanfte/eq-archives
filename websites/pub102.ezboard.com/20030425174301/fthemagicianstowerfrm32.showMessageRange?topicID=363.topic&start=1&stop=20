 The elemental tanks, the mage nukes for the majority of the damage.<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
This is often not true. In fact, the most mana efficient fighting style for mages generally involves letting the elemental deal most of the damage, while dealing a smaller portion through nukes, although this leads to longer fights.<br>
<br>
What is clear is that the majority of damage dealt by a beastlord is done via the warder.<br>
<br>
I think a variety of circumstances conspire to make the lords themselves weaker than they ought to be, and since warder changes, long overdue, are in their chaotic tuning stage, it is natural that beastlords press as hard as they can now for warder upgrades.<br>
<br>
I think the current pain threshold for many mages is the 54 and 60 water elementals. These are our specialty damage pets, and do not tank well (although probably better than many mages care to admit). If, in the current round of improvements, warders on average do no better than those elementals, then the mage community will not object strongly. This includes factors like positioning, as both warders and water elementals do far and away their best damage from behind.<br>
<br>
Using similar reasoning, since earth elementals are the tanks, you should press for at minimum earth elemental damage independent of positioning. The earth elemental is our tanking pet, but is a better damage dealer than many mages care to admit.<br>
<br>
Between these two limits you would have a significant better warder, something close to what the majority of beastlords aspire too, and because of those two bounds, the argument could be carried to mages <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  (I know I would work actively to calm mages down in that case).</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This would be a good solid step forward.<br>
<br>
Then, after hell freezes...I mean beastlord melee is fixed, and a more complete picture of beastlord capabilities becomes clear, then if further adjustments need to be made for warders, it can proceed in a more rationale fashion.<br>
<br>
One last comment. Many of you are unsatisfied with the procs, some to the point of wishing to minimize or even abandon them. Do not. While they will make your warders harder to evaluate, procs are important source of magical damage, which is independent of AC. With significant procs, damage can be dealt to high AC targets. The cost is lower damage against magic resistant mobs, but if nearly all your damage output is melee, then you are less flexible.<br>

This is a post that I found reading the beastlord message board today. I have to say I do not agree with this nor do I think it is in anyway fair that beastlord pets equal our elementals in damage. If beastlords want a pet as good as GV Water then they should make a mage.   Raz you do not speak for all mages and when you say things like.......<br>

You are not the authority on mages even though I feel you aspire to be. I for one would be very upset if Beastlords came close to mage pet power factoring in all the utility that they have.  Are we remotely on par with Wizards in terms of nuking? No. So why should a hybrid class be on par with the dominate pet class (Stated many many times by Verant) in the game?<br>
<br>
You are a moderator on one mage board that VI reads and I sure they know who you are. You really should speak for yourself and not for what mages think. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am making this thread because I really would like to know what mages would be happy if a beastlord pet was equal to ours?<br>

Since BST pet hit like our GV Water pet... PoP spell dissapoint me even though it's not live, it still dissapoint me because it means VI see us as useless class(?!?!?!) for making almost no difference between our DD and Enc's DD.<br>
<br>
I will be very dissapointed if BST pet hit like our pet in future, because they are hybrid, and we are not. Hbyrid are not suppose to be greater than original pet owner. But as we can see, they are close to us.<br>
<br>
It's just that they nerfed our pet because of Trods or whaetever. Kinda makes me sad, because I never started mage to be Trod summoner, but to control pet and do stuff<br>

Beastlord warders can NEVER reach the damage output of our GV: Water pet.<br>
<br>
First, and most obvious, they dont backstab. Yes this is a power dependant on positioning...but BST warder just dont do it, so in an optimal situation our pet will be far superior meleewise.<br>
<br>
Second, it has been reported that the warders have a much worse hit chance than our pets (supposedly because they use their H2H skill which caps low). So even in an non optimal situation our water pet will have a better chance of landing hits.<br>
<br>
Not to mention that our water pet has casting built in. No need to cast an imbue pet spell every few mins...our pets come ready to kick, our buffs just improve them, where the BST warders are virtually useless without their buffs.<br>
<br>
What about the tanking ability? Yes the water pets arent the best tanks but then we have the power to choose a pet that does better in that regard. So, I cant see problem that the BST warders can tank as good as one or two of our pets. They must generalize, we can specialize for each case.<br>
<br>
Overall we still have the best (non epic) pet for damage output, and several choices for a tanking pet.<br>
So WHAT THE HECK DO YOU STILL HAVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT?!<br>

Summary of those three paragraphs : Beastlords should aim for something better than GV:Earth, but <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   worse</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> than GV:Water for the powerlevel of thier level 60 Warder.<br>
<br>
Not that they should be aiming for better than all of our pets - which is what your rather inflamatory title indicates.<br>
<br>
What he is saying is almost exactly what many (if not most) of the Mages who have expressed an opinion on the subject have said in the various threads on the subject - as long as our best non-epic pet remains better than their best pet, we are fine with it.<br>
<br>
As such, it is entirely reasonable for him to say that the Mage communuity would probably support such a solution. <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=FFFF00)"><h4>Zyphyr Runnersbane</h4></div>

IE-earth pet being a far superior *tank* then any other pet, BUT doing far less damage then *any* of the highest level pets.  Going in the reverse....  water doing the most damage by far of any of the pets..but tanking the worst of *all* of the highest level pets.  And then Air being the middle.  Fire of course, being a wizard, is in its own little area.  <br>
<br>
In this setup , Id see no real problem with warders/necro pets being on par with our air pet. IE- very good middle of the road pets, decent at both tanking and doing damage.  Honestly, I cant see any reason for beastlords/necros to have completely worse pets then mages in all areas.  <br>
<br>
Really though, the pop pets have to fall further into specialization, for mages that is.  They should really start falling further into those categories rather then just in theory.  ATM there is not really a huge difference between pet functionally in different roles, and because of that a middle of the road pet comes fairly close to being the best in general.

If you read the referenced thread, what I said can be summarized as follows.<br>
<br>
60 Warder DPS &gt;= Epic DPS.  Not acceptable.<br>
60 Warder DPS &gt;= GV:Water DPS.  Not acceptable.<br>
60 Warder DPS &gt;= GV:Earth DPS.  Plausible.<br>
<br>
My understanding is that Epic DPS ranges mostly from 40 to 80 depending on the mob, that GV:Water can come close to that under ideal conditions, and that GV:E is generally closer to 25 to 45 DPS.<br>
<br>
Cyricus has also suggested Air Elementals as an appropriate model for warders.  Are you really going to get upset if warders are roughly equivalent to air elementals of a similar level?<br>
<br>
If you are suggesting that for all levels, all elementals must be better than all warders, then I think that is unnecessary and even petty.  Beastlords deal damage primarily through their warders, with lord melee and spell dps a fairly minor portion.  Even if lord melee DPS is increased, warders will remain their primary source of damage.<br>
<br>
I stand by what <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>I</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> said.  If you are interested, read <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>my</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> words carefully, and not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wezloc's</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> emotional and biased exaggerations of my positions.<br>

<br>
BL's are seeking pet upgrades primarily b/c its the only thing that VI will react to at the present time as it is considered part of caster balancing. <br>
<br>
BL's are technically hybrids, and will be subject to all sorts of casting/melee enhancements whenever the hybrid balancing occurs (don't hold your breath though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    )<br>
<br>
The only thing that would concern me about the BL pet = the mage pet in damage is that BL's will receive subsequent upgrades in the next round of balancing, whereas we will be ignored.<br>
<br>
That being said, I personally have no problem with BL pets receiving a 'temporary upgrade' to tide them over until the hybrid balancing occurs. At which point the BL pet can be reduced, or better yet, the mage pets can be improved.<br>
<br>
This would really be the best overall solution to cover the BL class for both the long and short term.<br>

<br>
I'd be seriously pissed if there were any situation in the game where a BL pet would be better than a mage pet.<br>
<br>
I think the author of this thread was correct in pointing out that there were some incorrect generalizations about the mage community in the BL thread... I disagree with those generalizations VERY strongly.<br>
<br>
I'm all for class balancing, and I'm all for beastlord balancing, but pets are my territory. You just don't mess with my pets, based on principle if nothing else.<br>
<br>
Btw, as far as I can tell, beastlords are as balanced as any other hybrid. They will work in a group or solo, and have something to do on a raid (1 buff) Hell, shadowknights don't even have 1 buff. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zyrexxshadowfyre>Zyrexx Shadowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 316<br> <font color=#333333>(9/30/02 11:23:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh god, not again...</span><hr size=1> Shadow Knights have a use on Raids.<br>

You seem to not want any improvements to the beastlord class from the posts I have seen because you are constantly saying we should not have good pets. BEASTLORD is the name of the class and that indicates a good pet class. I really would rather see an improvement via our own dps and not the pet but vi does not seem to be doing that. That puts us on the same lvl as mages for pet reliance. If our pets can never aproach the dmg of ANY mage pets then that leaves us as the worst dmg dealing melee class in the game. Are you really so insecure that you would rather see another class screwed than their pet approach the max hit of a mages pet when NOT approaching the actual dps of the mage pet. Unless vi fixes the h2h skill problem, the warders will always have a high miss %. I can see the point of mages in not wanting us to have the best pets but too many seem to not realise we rely on that pet for the majority of our dmg. Since you said you did not want any beastlord pets approaching the dmg of any mage pets I think you should go after the necro pets as well which deal good dps but necroes do not have to have their pet out to deal serious dmg unlike beastlords who would get their butt kicked without the warder out. <br>
<br>
So are the beastlords your sworn enemy despite another pet class having a higher dps pet than beastlords? If you continue that thinking krilen you will be disappointed with the game because we will not be held down in that manner. I do not bitch about mage pets so stop bitching about ours. I know that I will get flamed for this but just remember I did not make the comment about warders never doing the dmg of ANY mage pet. Beastlords are here to stay and the rest of the classes in eq will just have to accept that. We are going to step on someones toes no matter what improvements we get and a lot of the beast community realises this. So we will be defensive about any gains made since we can not please everyone if we hope to be balanced. Are we way out in left field in terms of balance,no but we still have some ways to go.<br>

<br>
This does not have to decay into flames.<br>
<br>
Krilen, are you saying that for every elemental of roughly the same level as a warder, that the elemental should be better than the warder in some important way, but that the warder pet can be better in some other way?  Yes?<br>
<br>
In other words, the warder pet, which is necessarily a generalist pet and must be fairly well rounded, should not be better than any comparable specialist elemental in its specialty.<br>
<br>
Further, post-50, a warder should be inferior in some way to our air elemental, which is our well rounded pet.<br>
<br>
Have I stated it correctly?<br>

I personally do not like playing 'pet cleric' and as such I would preffer *not* to have a balanced warder. How about this instead.<br>
<br>
Tanking: Warder &lt; Water Pet (lvl 60)<br>
Damage: Warder &lt; Water Pet (lvl 60)<br>
<br>
but close in both those categories? Especially the damage category (*we* tank, not our pets...). This would allow us to improve our raid DPS while still having your water pet spank our warder =). Right now as our pets go, I would *gladly* give up a good deal of tanking ability for the chance to do more damage and to realize our OFFENSIVE role in a raid.<br>
<br>
So to finalize.<br>
<br>
Damage: Earth &lt; Air &lt; Warder &lt; Water &lt; Epic<br>
Tanking: Warder &lt; Water &lt; Air &lt; Earth &lt; Epic<br>
<br>
As long as the damage part is close to the water pet, I would be fully happy with this result. Give us less hps, give us less ac, whatever is needed to reduce our pet's tanking ability to compensate.<br>
<br>
-Drexion<br>
<br>
p.s. As other beastlords have stated, I also would be happier with an upgrade to *our* DPS... That, unfortunately, won't happen for quite a while (if ever) and my class has been broken AND incomplete SINCE it was released. Heck, we just got some of our AA's *now* (And we still have less class specific AA's than ANY hybrid...Passive AND active). Frankly, i'm not sure doing what I suggested to our pets would be *enough* to make us be wanted in raids...But hopefully it would be sufficient to tide us over until the upgrade to OUR dps (whatever is appropriate at that moment).

<br>
First, put the post in context.  I believe that Yiktiki posted that, but don't quote me.  I do rememember, however that it was not meant as a 'we SHOULD, no NEED X,' it was an exploratory post, meant to stimulate discussion.  It was NOT a 'we NEED this, mages can go @)#* themselves like some other posts.<br>
<br>
Read the thread before condemning the BST community, if you please-quotes are a bad example, because they take the post out of context.(Just got home from tutoring some freshmen in rhetorical stance-sorry if this comes across as inflammatory.)<br>
<br>
As a BST, what would I want?  I believe, pre-50, the water pet is the jack of all trades pet, decent damage and tanking, correct?  That's what I'd like to see.  It would allow me to back out of combat when I felt like medding, or bandaging, it would be adequate for pet clericing if I feel like that.  I feel that this would accomodate BST's the best, since we can be played with a variety of styles-straight melee, pet cleric, and a blend of the two(the most popular).<br>
<br>
I've read here that most mages have a favortite pet pre-50.  BST's tend to have a favorite style of play, instead.  I would rather have one multi-purpose pet on par with pre-50(appropiate to BST level of course.  No 49 pet at 60 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) water in regards to tanking/damage, which would best allow BST's to preserve their current style.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:These are just my opinions, they do not neccesarily represent the view of any other beastlord, or the beastlord community as a whole.  Reccomended with 1 grain of salt, with breakfast and before bedtime.<br>
<br>
I'm not even going to get into the 'are BST's a hybrid or pet class' arguement.  I think BST's should come to a consensus first =)<br>
