I'm not too interested in our summons, and comparing pets is rather hard to do but I'll try to briefly discuss them.  We as mages have endured much since Kunark, and I believe no other class can truely understand the setbacks and reduction in power that the Magician class has suffered during these past few years in Everquest.<br>
<br>
KUNARK<br>
<br>
While I started after Kunark was released I do know that before Kunark our pets were very powerful, especially the fire pet which was on par if not greater than most melees of that time.  Considering the best weapons were very poor quality and pet damage has remained relatively the same up until recent patches.  With Kunark came ten new levels and dozens of new spells for all classes to enjoy.  This might sound a bit strange to non-mages but we are a damage dealing class and have always been one if you take the time to look back beyond Rod of Mystical Transvergence you'll see that every single one of our abilities is aimed at one thing: damage.  With the exception of Call of the Hero and various summoning spells the bulk of our spells from 1 to 60 have one thing in common, they either cause direct damage, melee damage or indirect damage in the form of damage shields.  These are the core mage spells, not trinkets we summon nor people we call to our sides.  <br>
<br>
Kunark spells brough Magicians a wide variety of new additions and enchancements of old ideas, we recieved mass summons to bring forth large quantities of food, arrows, etc, etc as well new pet spells, some rains, 1 PBae, 2 bolts, and a few other choice nuke spells.  As well as those forms of direct damage we recieved 3 new damage shield spells to help with the indirect form of damage, and to boost our damage shield capabilities above that of Druids.  To put this in scope, out of 37 new kunark spells we recieved 22 forms of direct or indirect forms of damage output.  66% of our new spells were damage oriented, not support oriented as some might claim mages are, but damage.  Out of the remaining 14 spells we have 5 mass summons, 1 Utility spell (coth), 3 debuff spells, 2 pet enhancers, 2 self buffs, 1 dispel and eye of tallon.  I don't know about you but I think that seems like a pretty convincing lineup for a damage dealing class.  During the kunark era we had a total of *1* utility spell and this spell was usually used just to bring late people ot the raid.  Now the problem with all these damage spells was that during the Kunark era we couldn't hit any boss mob more or less, it was all resisted therefore we were a class with over 2/3 of our spells that were supposed to be used against bosses but we couldn't.  So where does that leave the Kunark mage? Lonely and depressed, without much to do on raids other than to coth people and use horribly underpowered and buggy pets.  <br>
<br>
The kunark pets are a different story all together.  If you take a look at the pre kunark pets you'll notice they all hit for the same amount, 56 damage x4 at max.  However you look at the Kunark pets and you would notice that the pets hit relatively for the same amount, 58 for earth, 24? for fire, 56 for air, 56 for water.  Yes the air and water pets recieved some minor upgrades but our pets were virtually the exact same as our level 49 predecessors.  Now you're probably asking yourself, so what? Mage pets were too powerful because they outdamaged level 50 warriors who were wielding 9/25 swords they got from nagafen and therefore their new pets should do the same damage.  That's a very convincing argument I must agree, but you gotta take into the account that melees recieved a huge boost to weapons in kunark with the addition of such weapons as Jade mace and Lamentation, not to mention unique kunark armor which boasts impression AC for the time.  So as you can see pet power, which is supposed to be relative to melee power, not only was greatly surpassed in Kunark but the pets themselves remained almost completely unchanged.  For a better comparison you can take the level 44 pets and the level 49 pets, every spell level mage pets have recieved roughly +6 to their max damage therefore the 44 pets hit for around 50.  However the 57-60 pets only hit for +4 damage over the 49 pets and that's through *2* spell levels.   Anyone knows nowadays the dramatic power change one gets from raising through 51-60, as opposed to pre-50 and the power increase for mages (a damage dealing class) was pathetic at best.  <br>
<br>
Just for fun, wizards recieved 38 new spells in Kunark.  Out of those 38 there were 27 offensive combat spells, not a lot more than mages and yet Wizards are a &quot;damage dealing&quot; class and Mages are a &quot;fun utility/mod rod class&quot;.  Druids recieved out of 38 spells 11 that were offensive, and yet they are recieve more offensive power than us now.  Enchanters recieved 4 damage spells in Kunark (counting pets).  It seems quite obvious to me that Magicians were meant to deal damage on an impressive scale by using our nuking abilities + our pets and supplementing them with our damage shields<br>
<br>
Before the end of Kunark there were a new brand of quests introduced.  Player named the &quot;Epic&quot; quests.  These quests provided extremely high quality weapons of the time, with exception to a few (warriors?).  The Epic pet as it's called by us is our only true upgrade since Kunark, and remains thus even through Luclin.  <br>
<br>
VELIOUS<br>
<br>
Anyway enough ancient history <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Time to go to Velious and see where it takes us.  During the age of velious we saw very large improvements to boss resists which made it quite easy for Magicians to once again nuke bosses, however the problem with pets remained and they were almost unusable in places like Temple of Veeshan where if they didn't run amok and kill your raid they simply died to AEs.  Velious is a very depressing time for us Mages and it's hard to relive our spell lists, but I'm going to post them anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    In comparison to Wizards, Druids and Enchanters once again but only the 50+ spells as the rest don't really matter for this purpose.  We recieved 5 new 50+ spells in Luclin, 2 of which were pet spells which had no apparant use as they were weaker than our current pets, the only redeeming feature was the *fun* factor and you could gain mana from one of them however it didn't add to our damage.  Second, we recieved 2 dots but again had no apparant purpose as they did less damage than either of our Conjuration or Evocation nukes (keep in mind evoc was still a valid choice then).  The only purpose of these dots was it allowed you to produce less aggro, however they weren't any better than our nukes therefore useless on boss mobs.  The final spell was a new pet buff, Burnout 4 which even on paper only gave a meager 5% haste bonus and 10 extra strength.  For being 6 levels above Burnout 3 these enhancements were miniscule at best, and down right insulting at worst.  It took us nearly a year to figure out that pet haste was capped at 60%, thus making Burnout 4 and our previous kunark pet enchancements worthless.  <br>
<br>
Remember, in Kunark mages recieved roughly 66% damage oriented spells but in Velious we recieved ZERO usable damage spells or pet enhancers.   For a damage dealing class it is quite frustrating to recieve absolutely 0 upgrades to our existing pets and/or nukes.  In contrast Wizards recieved 3 direct damage spell upgrades, thus further widening the gap between mage and wizard nuking.  Some wizards might say mages have no right nuking, that wizards are the masters and that everyone must fall in line very far behind them.  I disagree with this to a point, Wizards should outnuke mages but the balance *must* be maintained.  Sunstrike in Kunark was a 3.6 ratio nuke and our best Seeking flame of seukor was 3.2 (However its a bolt therefore not usable on raids), on raids our best is shock of steel a 3.0 ratio spell.  Now in Velious wizards recieved Ice Spear of Solist which is a 4.0 nuke, but mages are still stuck with a 3.0 ratio nuke even if the overage damage of ice spear is much less than sunstrike.  At that time ratios mattered a lot more than they do now, since there was no reliable form of Flowing thought, it did not stack well and there were no T-Rods.   Now this isn't a rant against Wizards in any means, since again I agree that Wizards should be masters of nuking but that is not a valid arguement for keeping Magicians in the stone age.  The bane spells in Velious also played a minor role, since they can't be used on many mobs I thought I'd just keep them out of this discussion.<br>
<br>
LUCLIN<br>
<br>
Since I really dispised the Velious era Im skipping to modern history, Luclin.  As you might remember in Kunark mages recieved 66% damage spells, and I am still using those very same spells today with a few exceptions.  Now I don't have many complaints about our Luclin spell lineup as they have made soloing a lot easier with the pet heals and T-rods.  However the fact that we recieved a very very minimal nuke upgrade is not only astonishing to this Magician but also very confusing.  It seems like Verant has dismissed Mages (and it seems everyone else has to) as damage dealers and put us into the Misc. Utility category along with Shamans, Chanters and Druids.  Our Luclin nuke is called Shock of Fiery Blades, which is 1005 damage compared to Shock of Steel 825.  That might seem like a moderate upgrade, but it is still the same ratio 3.0 as Shock of Steel.  Where other nukers recieved drastically improved ratios (Moonfire, Ice Spear, Elenericks) Magicians recieved nothing.  Another large point is that once again we recieved no pet upgrades, not even &quot;fun&quot; pets with no apparant purpose.  Yes Epic pet is very impressive, but it doesn't make up for the complete change of direction in our class from the premiere caster sustained damage dealing class, to a class that summons rods for other classes to nuke with.  Luclin did mark a few revolutionary changes however that can't be ignored.  Increased pet control, pet resistance changes, pet attack ratings, pet tank abilities and HP were all drastically improved to a point where I think most are relatively satisfied.  Pets are only half of what a Magician is, the other half comes in the form of nukes.  While not as powerful as Wizards they should be atleast a better option than summoning Mod Rods for *clerics* to nuke with.  I mean come on, unless you are VERY anti-mage that point seems pretty clear to me.  All in all Luclin was a good expansion for casters and honestly we shouldn't have much to complain about, except the role reversal Magicians are recieving at the hands of Verant.  <br>
<br>
There is another part of Luclin that not many will experience, these are the Ancient Spells from various high end bosses.  While most of these spells are very good for the primary nuking classes (Druid/Mage and Wizard) they also give a precursor to what Planes of Power nukes are to be like, where Necromancers (who have NEVER been considered a nuking class) recieve a 1080 nuke while Magician ancient nuke is 1150, even Wizard ancient nuke is only 1200.  Enchanters also recieved a huge 950 magic based nuke which is much stronger than our 825 MR nuke.  Now I don't mind as much that we dont get any kind of offense upgrade compared to wizards, but I do mind that every other *non* nuking class does.  Clerics, Enchanters and Necromancers all recieve relatively *huge* upgrades to their nuking abilities, as well as to their other functions without changing their class drastically as Luclin has done for Magicians.  In fact our job as Rod makers has made necro's raid roles into damage dealers and quite frankly a lot more entertaining.  Clerics have gotten upgrades to make their class more fun, with the addition of nukes and *cough* melee abilities.  The underlying fact is that Luclin, while improving Mages, has left us a very unfun class to play since our primary role as a damage dealer has been completely reversed and twisted to make us something we never were and never wanted to be.  Not to mention we have recieved no pet AA skills that work, and no further pet buffs to further augment our primary ability which is to have the best pets.<br>
<br>
PLANES OF POWER<br>
<br>
Now, Planes of Power is pure speculation at this point but we do have a few pieces of information from just released spells.  As stated in numerous other threads the upgrades to Mages in this expansion seem shakey at best, or unknown at this point.  One thing I am grateful to see are the large number of direct or indirect forms of damage once again being given to us.  The thing I'm concerned about is that our upgraded nukes are very low in damage still, Sun Vortex for instance while being 1300 damage is still only 3.25 ratio/mana and Black Steel our new MR is 3.6 but still only 1000 damage.  This leaves me to wonder why Enchanters and Clerics are recieving 1100 point nukes and mages only 1300? Have we degraded that much that Clerics and Enchanters have been given almost equal nukes compared to us? AND the ability to Complete Heal, root, stun, etc, not to mention the chanter abilities which are extremely vast.  With the addition of awesome nukes these classes will dwarf Mages who have always sacrificed our defensive abilities and any other utility spells for pure offensive power, this is very discouraging to say the least that not only are our offensive nukes almost the same as Enchanters but we have recieved no defensive spells as well. One might ask &quot;But you have Rain spells, they do over 2000 damage&quot;, yes and no.  Unless Verant changes rains so they aren't resisted 50% of the time or more they'll never be used. Another issue with rain spells is that they do not recieve focus bonuses, while this might seem overbalanced at first you have to take into consideration that most mages are Conjuration and Rains are evocation.  You take Sun Vortex, add 20% damage and you get 1560 for a max hit then you can take Sun Storm 720x3 to get 2160.  Factor in your normal 1 out of 3 resist and you're down to 1460 for more mana.  Rains are virtually the exact same spell as our normal nukes except we don't get any damage bonus OR specialization bonus which leaves them at a substainal disadvantage and overall worthlessness.  Bolts are another big topic of interest, while they do have higher ratios than our nukes normally they cannot be used on bosses since on a good day they'll get 50% blocks.  Even if the mob is right infront of you with no one near you they can get blocked and the mana is wasted.  We recieve a decent bolt in PoP but due to the reasons I just stated it will most likely not be cast, or cast very infrequently.  <br>
<br>
This leaves mages with only 1 real option for nuking, and those are the non-bolt, and non-rain spells.  I understand that Verant likes to give Mages Rains and Bolts to susbstitute for other spells, but the fact of that matter is that they just don't *work* and it's very annoying to be given spells that constantly and frequently end up being useless when in &quot;theory&quot; they are great.  If it would be possible to redo rains and make bolts hit most of the time then I would be grateful for these spells.  In my opinion however they don't do anything to enhance the magicians nuking powers, and the fact that Enchanters, Clerics, Necromancers and Rangers are getting closer and closer to Magician nuking power in every expansion is appaling and degrading to any kind of magician self-esteem.  It is our right to be high damage dealers, that's what we've always been and that's how we should stay regardless of what Warriors, Rogues or other classes think of Magicians.  If we are continually overpowered by new Enchanter nukes and further distanced from Wizards, without recieving large pet changes to counteract these imbalances I don't think there will be many mages left to complain after PoP.  We just went through MONTHS of balancing till we, the Magicians, are finally satisfied (except for the fact that pets cant get 63+ mobs with spells which still has to be removed) and to go through Kunark/Velious again is such a freightening thought I would rather not level at all than become a level 65 Magician with the power of a level 60 and be equal in nuking power to an Enchanter.<br>
<br>
I'm just trying to educate others on the history of Magicians, and hopefully help them see that we're not some mod rod class and we don't deserve to be forgotten as damage dealers and forever resigned to summoning rods for enchanters/Wizards/necros/clerics to nuke with.  I don't wanna play in that kind of future<br>

<br>
As for the pre Kunark era Mages were the top of the damage line nothing much to say there other than our utility spells were mainly just for us (I got asked for Arrows by maybey 2 people before Kunark and nothing else). Our pets did match some warriors/rangers/monks in damage but the control and liability of the pet was ignored for the most part.<br>
<br>
I played my SK more than my Mage before Kunark so I am by no means an expert on pets back then though.<br>

I've been reading this forum for a long long time but never posted because I didn't want to get in the middle of things.  Well I don't like the way things are going.  I made my mage back before kunark when we were very powerful.  I made him because I liked doing damage with my pet and nuking with powerful DD's secondly only to wizards.  I am now a 60 mage in a guild that pretty much kills everything so I know the life of a magician, and right now it stinks.  I do make rods and CoH for the guild because it does help the guild as a supporter, but that is not why I choose the class I did.  If I wanted a support class I would have choosen a enchanter or cleric or druid, yet those classes are surpassing us in nuking ability, one of two main abilities that we prided being second in.  Our other main ability, pets, is having our dominance in the area being threatened also with the introduction of dire charm.  Well I just can't take playing my class the way it is anymore.<br>
<br>
All I want to know is WHY DID VERANT COMPLETELY CHANGE OUR ROLE in the end game?  You have changed our class for the worse can't you see that with how many people are upset?  I only hope that you either send your message in Ylaine or either Absor or Rich read it. <p><HTML>

Good question, I've never understood that. What other class does an about-face in roles at the end game?  It's great we got rodding and all since we were useless before, but it's a band-aid to cover the wound, and the wound is still there.  <br>

Think about the wound.<br>

but at where u can use it, you can get xp much faster even than an epic'd mage .... <br>

This wouldn't be too bad if we GET a few places where we can <br>
1) SLOW the mobs better than chanters<br>
or<br>
2) CC better than chanters<br>
or <br>
3) mana regen better than chanters.... <br>
<br>
but the thing is there isn't any places like that at all... and we don't have ANY of the above ability... <br>
<br>
chanter can't heal the DC pet? <br>
bedlam/chaste and slow is usually letting pet take very minimal dmg. and DC pet has mob regen i think. <br>
<br>
just why i think DC overpowered the chanter.... <br>
but that was before the pet fix for mages.... <br>

afterward i don't notice chanters got ath big an advantage over a soloing mage. <br>

This thread isn't about Dire Charm. <br>
<br>
 It is about mages not wanting to return to the &quot;bad old days&quot; when our class almost went extinct due to uselessness.<br>
<br>
 It is about a class that was founded on offensive damage, is designed for offensive damage, and has a spellbook filled mostly with offensive damage spells, being unable to fulfill that role and instead being relegated to &quot;CoH Whore&quot; again like we were in Kunark/Velious, or more recently &quot;Rod Whore&quot; that much of Luclin has devolved into because our raid damage is not good enough to override the neccesity of T-Rodding others.<br>
<br>
When a nuking class is better off handing their mana to a non-nuking class so that *they can nuke instead*, there is a serious problem.<br>
<br>
Getting the sad &quot;upgrades&quot; that PoP test shows us will only magnify this since we aren't gaining power relative to the other classes.<br>
<br>
Let me put it very simply:<br>
<br>
**If PoP has Kunark/Velious Era resists that require Lures to land effective damage, mages will be pushed so deep into the &quot;rod whore&quot; role that the class will go back to the near extinction it suffered in those expansions.**<br>

They were no better than us and at times worse.<br>
<br>
Now with the changes to dot stacking and the number of buff slots increased they are back to where they want to be.  On my guild's boards they are giddy with the kind of damage they can output on boss mobs (since the fights last longer).  Raid leaders, seeing this power, now don't require them to twitch during fights unless it is absolutely positively necessary.  When is the last time a raid leader said.  &quot;Hey you know what, don't rod at all unless we absolutely need to.&quot;  Yes I rod before battles but between buffing/rebuffing/deaths and the like most of my time is spent rodding and not nuking.  Unless it is a weak mob then I get to nuke, but that is usually when we have overkill.<br>
<br>
All other classes do exactly what they do in normal exp grouping:<br>
<br>
-wizards nuke<br>
-melee fight<br>
-druids do what is necessary (i.e. utility)<br>
-enchanters buff and debuff<br>
-shaman buff and debuff<br>
-clerics heal<br>
-Necros deal long term damage (and do it well without pets)<br>
<br>
Now you can argue that other classes aren't as effective as they would like to be because of (insert what you want), but their role has changed.  If VI is listening, that is what sticks in the craw of most mages.  We want to be team players and win one for the gipper by doing what is necessary, but damn this is a game.  The object is to have as much fun at it as possible while you are accomplishing whatever it is you are trying to do.  <br>
<br>
That fun is derived from getting the perceived gratification out of the class that you select.  That perceived gratification comes from seeing how the class is described and then playing it and seeing how that matches up.  When that changes dramatically then the gratification and fun ceases or at the least is diminished.<br>
<br>
Therefore, whenever things are designed they must be designed with this in mind or people will never be happy.  Is the mage necessary?  Yes, in high level encounters you need those rods.  Can they be done by two boxing or having an alt mage log in coh/rod and then log out? Yes, it is done.  Is that how it should be?  Necessary but unfun?  <br>
<br>
People that choose melee (press A) or cleric (heal sit down-even that is changing with the new cleric spells but that is a different topic), do so knowing what they are getting into and have chosen that kind of game play.  Mages don't.  Please consider what we were/are/ and will be with the changes to come and ask yourselves; is this in line with how mages were developed?  And is the end game for mages supposed to change so dramatically with the turn of one spell (T-Rod)?  If it weren't for that one spell would mages, with their current spell line up be in demand like they are and as worth while to play in the end game?<br>
<br>
things to consider.<br>

Mages are a tough class to learn.I kept playing mine as<br>
mage friends quit because I had the time to learn to be<br>
good. Until just recently our pets were useless or downright dangerous in many places to xp or raid. Our<br>
adv skills were mostly crap and still are. Trods are awesome,yet one mage has provided mana for entire<br>
raids in every encounter in SOL. Unpleasant yes but none the less doable. I think most of us pressed on and played because deep down we still beleive that there will<br>
be a golden age of mages again and so far we have not seen it in 3 expansions. Perhaps Planes O Profit will be<br>
different somehow I doubt it. I perused a list of most if<br>
not all VT capable guilds and checked the rosters. I saw<br>
a minimum of 2 mages played as mains and a maximum of<br>
7.I counted in total 185 mages I don't expect to see a significant increase in these numbers post POP. I see more twink manaburn wizzies appearing daily I don't see<br>

Around February 2002 (I think), Verant announced that they would begin looking at caster balance, and one of the first steps at balance was focus items. Focus items in nature are designed to &quot;enhance&quot; a caster's ability to use magic.<br>
<br>
The first step towards focus items was to make the first wave of focus items Mage summons. Fortunately for us, all of the focus item summons are found in a relatively easy place to find: The Bazaar. This allowed for fast distribution for people to try out, and also allowed for easy changes.<br>
<br>
A few months later they retroactively added focus effects to existing items. Examples include the Obulus Death Shroud, Robe of the Oracle, Drachnid Thyxl, etc.<br>
<br>
How does this affect Mages? With little to no effort, we mages can substantially increase our offensive and defensive power, simply by summoning a couple trinkets for us to wear. And where our summons fail, there are droppable items to fill the gap. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ualucard101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alucard101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#333333>(9/21/02 4:16:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   focus.....</span><hr size=1> it's not too hard to get focus... <br>

<br>
It's biased. It's brainwashing ignorant mages... they didn't know about most of the times in the 'history' of the class, but now they know a little about them. That's good. The problem with it is ylaine only told what she wanted people to know &gt;&lt; I can't blame her at all for making the post this way. The idea of posting is to encourage people toward a certain opinion. But now I know people are gonna be quoting this post all over in 'mage is supposed to be dmg class!' posts, which is bad for the community. It's just not good to have people spreading information 2nd hand, that's like rumors, and we know how they get out of hand.<br>
<br>
What I ask is: that no mage take ylaine history as if it were full and unbiased. Just know that it does omit some stuff here and there, such as what silverblade pointed out. If you wanna think mages should be a dmg class etc etc fine. Ylaine's post is mostly facts, and the facts are easily discernable from the author's opinions. All I'm asking is for you, the reader, to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  acknowledge the fact that this post is not an unbiased history,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> but is a persuasive argument meant to prove her point. Also for this reason I disagree with it being moved to the library. The library is for factual posts and such, ylaine's history is, again, persuasive argument.<br>
<br>
So anyway, maybe I'll put together an altogether different history of a mage. I've been playing since EQ went gold, but haven't been mage all along, but since before kunark. Reason I post this reply is because too many mages replied with 'oh now i understand' and 'great job' type of things. This history doesn't look the same as the history I remember &gt;&lt; so i doth protest<br>

<br>
Yes this is meant to be persuasive since I've gotten sick of people saying mages dont do damage, when I still say if you look back at our spells from BEFORE luclin you'll notice the majority are directly tied to damage <p><a href="http://www.bladesofwrath.com">

But that's a moot point really, and not worth discussing. As they say, &quot;History is just a set of lies agreed upon&quot; (I love that sig Yanbun).<br>
<br>
I consider focus items unique to the class. Sure they're droppable and such, but no other class actually has to go looking for them with much effort (ignoring /bazaar). If a mage chooses to go without them, they can, and if a mage wants one on full time, they can. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufinrazielthemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>FinrazielTheMage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#333333>(9/22/02 6:12:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=335.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Magicians - From the beginning till the end - Long histo</span><hr size=1> <br>
/nod, Ylaine.<br>
<br>
Thats a fairly accurate history. I lived through it as well and can't say it is overly biased one way or the other.  It is simply the truth. <br>

Her view on history mirrors mine on all its important points. Please<br>
do post your history Krilen I am interested in reading it ). <br>
History is usually a bunch of stories about things that never<br>
happened written by people who were not there P. Maybe if<br>
an area was added titled 'My Experience as a Mage' was added<br>
. With no commenting allowed it would give many of the senior<br>
mages a place to post their thoughts on being a mage in Norrath. I respect the fact that she took the time to write this<br>
and I read your posts as well and find a lot of good things in them. I think one thing in common we all share is that we are<br>
attracted to magic in all its forms in these games. The day will<br>
come when we move on from EQ or it moves on from us. Thes<br>
e postings are important. In the sense that they may well help<br>
shape the development of casters in future games that we<br>
will play. Just my musings )<br>
