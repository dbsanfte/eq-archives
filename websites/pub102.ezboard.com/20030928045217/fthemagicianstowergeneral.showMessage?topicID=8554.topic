setup, but still when I move around the screen 'stutters' meaning it stops even if I'm still moving (freezes up) for second or two and then jerks up to where it should be. Any idea why it is doing this? Is this just due EQ buggyness or is there anything I could try to do to get rid of it? Only thing I can think it could be is the fact that I did install the SoL graphic updates on for old zones.<br>

<br>
If you are take it down to 256mb ram and you should sail along alot better.  I was running 512mb ram with basically the same setup except I am on dial up.  I was choppy as hell in PoP until I removed a mem chip to drop my ram down a noche.  I thought a card was screwed but I can switch them out and still sail along nicely, so it wasn't the card. Win 98 with certain setups/environments can give mega problems when running more than 256mb ram, it might be rare(?) but it happens.  <br>
<br>
If your running ME, go get yourself a &quot;non-beta&quot; version of windows :0)~<br>
<br>
Win 2K and XP your mem shouldn't be the prob (unless you have a bad chip or 2).<br>
<br>
Win 95, you'd be lucky to get EQ to load with.<br>
<br>
Make sure your drivers are all updated, goto windows update and let it tell ya what you need, might as well do that until you've DL'ed and installed every single update available, since they are always patching holes in their crap prog, erm.  <br>
<br>
If non of this helps, axe blackice (if your running it), it can create some serious problems with EQ, and rerun patcher doing a full file search (blackice, seemed to cause a mem leak that used to make some files into 0byte files, thus cause EQ to crash frequently, this might have been fix'ed but I aint going down that road again).  <br>
<br>
Load EQ goto options &gt; display &gt;and lower clip plane to 0%, that usually helps in PoK, some luclin zones, and on large raids (40++people).<br>
<br>
Nothing there working, reboot to DOS /fdisk to repartition and reformat, reinstall Windows, update windows, DL dx8.1, Reinstall EQ (starting from original and working through expantions in order), patch EQ, go get a 2nd tower to run your other programs from, so that you can keep the registry fairly clean on your EQ machine (or seperate your hard drive into 2 partitions, 1 for windows and apps, the other strickly for EQ, this won't keep the registry from getting screwed, but if your registry does get screwed it makes it easier to fix-without having to repatch EQ).<br>
<br>
If you don't know how to fdisk and such, pray you bought a gateway and throw it's restor CD in.  If you got a Dell, kindly print &quot;I am screwed for help&quot; on a sticky and put it on your forehead then call Dell and get told to reboot to desktop, &quot;ohh no problems at desktop?&quot;, &quot;thanks for calling Dell have a nice day&quot; (they will tell you to axe every prog in the back ground, make you sit at desktop with nothing open/running then politely say &quot;see it works&quot;).  If you got anything other than GW or Dell, GL on getting help there too.<br>
<br>
If you don't know what your doing and have Win 98SE (second edition), VERY IMPORTANT, not the upgrade but the full install.  You can just go through your hard disk deleting a bunch of cool looking name files that sound really important, insert the CD then reboot, if you axed the right files, Windows will not be able to load and it will hit the CD and automatically start reformatting your drive for you (I can't remember the names but theres 3 files that I know will trigger this), and it will automatically start reinstalling.  If windows loads, without hitting the CD, then you need to delete more cool sounding files.  If by chance windows doesn't load and it doesn't hit the autorun of the CD automatically, get to an A prompt (A<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), then guess what drive your cd might be (A and B are reserved for floppies, C is reserved for hard disk, D is for hard disk 2 if you have your disk partioned or have 2 disks, if not then D should be CD, if not D then E, (E<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
If all else fails, complain about your computer being a PoS to your work mates (only the ones that have any knowledge about computers), if they start asking questions, invite them to diner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wrathen@themagicianstower>Wrathen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/03 8:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8554.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Tech related ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

Dear God don't do this.<br>
<br>
There are much easier things to do if Win98.<br>
<br>
Know that cool splash Windows98 splash screen you get?  Well just before it loads it says 'Loading Windows98, please wait...' on a black screen (usually appears near the very bottom)<br>
<br>
Press Shift - F5 when you see this (you can hold down shift after it reads your BIOS and the computer *beeps* at you, then just tap F5 quickly) and it'll take you to a C prompt.  You can do stuffs from there.<br>
<br>
Or if your CD is bootable, go into your BIOS and change the boot drive sequence from hard disk to CDROM as the primary drive.  This way it will autoboot from the CD if it can be done.<br>
<br>
Honestly I think its some kind of conflict of the vid card but a bad ram chip can cause this as well.  I would try turning off all graphics (back to old world stuff) and see if it still does it.<br>

Basically, every few seconds some virus program was doing something (lord knows what evilness).  I could see spikes in CPU usage every few seconds, that matched the timing of my video &quot;pauses&quot;.  By trial and error I ended up deleting the application (it had some random name, but didn't show up under normal running applications, but showed up as a running process).  My problem went away.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't suggest deleting random files, but your problem does sound similar.  I'm no expert, though.<br>
<br>
Also, it might be due to memory leaks.  EQ has some buggy zones that seems to load into your video card memory and stay there after you leave the zone (emerald jungle for one)...if your performance is fine after rebooting your machine, but the problem starts to happen again after you play for a while and zone a few time, that might be it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azzabarr@themagicianstower>Azzabarr</A> at: 1/23/03 9:11:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=urgathbubblespawner>UrgathBubblespawner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#333333>(1/24/03 3:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8554.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tech related question</span><hr size=1> Try to run at the lowest possible resolution and see if the problem goes away.<br>

It could be texture loading when ppl zone in as suggested in a post above. if you are using compressed textures you might want to try to turn that feature off and see if that helps.<br>
