I'll just post some of the duels I've had...<br>
<br>
vs warrior and most melee: ds self, ds pet, make sure it's a water pet for backstabs, jboots yourself and kite the melee around.  cast scars of sigil once or twice, but your pet should finish him off.  sks and rangers would probably snare yer pet tho, so make sure you give him daggers of symbols they do help a little.  <br>
<br>
vs rogue: be careful he doesn't bs you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ds self, pet, kite rogue with water pet.  Probably won't even need to cast on him and just let the pet finish him off since rogues don't have as many hp as warrior, and if you stop you might take a BS.<br>
<br>
vs wizard: sic pet on the wizard, he will try to root pet to get the pet off of him.  try using an air pet for this it might interrupt his casting.  when he's casting root on the pet, just nuke him down.  if he doesn't have the good resists, we can nuke a wizard down before they can nuke us down.  <br>
<br>
vs. enchanter: they are mean lil things!  make sure you have a dispell out, he'll mez yer pet and all you gotta do is dispell it.  But they will mana sieve you like crazy so it sucks.  And they rune themselves! what nerve :P  I fought a few enchanters, the only one that got me was one with a pet.  I can't get that pesky thing off of me =(  I can kite it around but I never get to med.  he was lvl 60 tho with nice resists and I was only 56 at the time.  But the other enchanters I just nuke 'em down and they die.  keep your MR high.<br>
<br>
vs. druid: I'm not dumb enough to challenge a druid yet.<br>
<br>
vs. mage: pets on pets, nuke each other I guess.  I'd like to see what the botb was like.  nobody on vazaelle was able to attend cuz the server had just opened. :P  it all depends on the epic too.  <br>
<br>
vs. shaman: the only shaman i dueled I have really no clue as to what he was doing, but basically i nuked him down with my pet beating on him and he died. <br>
<br>
vs. cleric: no real challenge here they're not really a dueling class.  <br>
<br>
vs. necros: again, not dumb enough to challenge them. :P<br>
<br>
but always use your DS when fighting melee.  especially rogues and monks.  they hit fast but they don't hit hard, and a DS just chews through them.  And if you're in the arena, bind there, have gate memmed.  it throws people off.  always use scars of sigil for the fast cast time, and it's rumored that our low level magic DD will interrupt casting.  always have a dispell memmed.  When buffing, have 3 or 4 fakes on top for when you get dispelled, any clickables up top too.  then do phantom armor/elemental armor and then shield of the magi last.  wear the right resist gear - chanters MR, wizzies FR and CR, shammies DR and PR... etc.  <br>

Dispell necro/druid dots immediatedly after they land on you. Easiest way is to keep an open spot at top of buffs and then left click removing it to create space so anull only removes dot and jboots.  Use level 8 shock of blades because it has 2.1 second cast time and knocks people out of casting.  If you chain shock of blades a caster your pet will kill them if they are stupid and dont drag pet out range.<br>
<br>
Against bards, on vallon zek they have this really annoying bug that allows bards to charm your pet and /pet get lost  to make your pet go away.  Most people consider it an exploit but bards do it anyways because they are gay. Not really much you can do in defense other than hit them with a big nuke and use your wand of swords to give them 3 insta right clicks of death. <p>57 Conjurer <Dark Storm>

The ONLY class i will not duel is a level 60 shaman because...they are evil and stuffs =(.  Freakin DoT's and torpor suck.  Necro's arn't too tough, (i'm speaking from level 60 tactics here) basicly before the pet starts, i make an epic pet, hit it with see invis, then wait for him to DS, then i burnout him and then valient companion.  Then i dispell the see invis with cancel/nullify magic (not annull since it takes two), Fight starts, banish necro pet...epic pet is now on the necro...necro cannot fear because of the valient companion, and since the top buff spot on the pet is open because of the see invis dispelled, whenever he mezzes pet just dispell it off and the pet will basicly eat the necro alive, throw some nukes in too if you feel like not bein lazy.<br>
<br>
Druids, agian, keep that top spot open on the pet for dispelling snare/root, and give the pet the sow spell (cant think of the name atm since i rarely use it)  Tho snare will cancel it, epic pet has very high resists, especualy with daggers of symbols, so snare will be resisted alot.  Also mala is nice since the stun will actualy hit occasionaly if ya hit them with it.<br>
<br>
Also, against other mages...standing there and nuking each other is the stupidest thing i can think of, outside of standing there and doing nothing.  Any mage at level 60 that doesn't have respectable MR/FR should just retire, i myself have 234 fr and 177 MR self buffed with my normal every day gear on.  In the BOTB my tactic was to char/SoS the pet to death since pets have low resists and are NPCs so spells can hit them for full.  I tested damage of char/shock of steel on me with 200 fr/mr which is about what i had for the botb and they did about 150 damage on average...on the pet char will do 702 95% of the time.  Take 10 char's to kill a respectable mage on average and 4 to kill an earth pet...so i'm at 60% with a pet and the other mage has no pet, ya know, whos gonna win?  Heh but of course i screwed up cause i was on a new keyboard, hit my shielding 4 straight times in the buffing stage and well, started without a pet and almost buffless /shrug.<br>
<br>
But in general, the way you duel each class is something you have to discover for yourself, you have to know what that class can do at that specific level and you have to know what YOU can do with your specific level/gear.  Ohh yah did i mention level 60 shaman suck?  Bleh.  A good level 60 mage with an epic can beat any class in general, a good shaman is the only thing i'm still struggling with but i'll figure it out someday.  Thinkin i'll try banishing the pet, and chain dispelling torpor off the shaman while the pet beats on him....hmm thats a good idea hehe.  The most important thing while dueling casters is to keep the pets top buff spot free so you can dispell any roots or such while keeping burnout on the pet (the haste helps a TON in interrupting casters).  Well thas about it.<br>

DISPEL THE OTHER PERSON!  This will take off any hp buff or mr buff, which helps a lot.  Now, for the druid, (assuming this is higher lvl)  I would nuke them to about 60%, then unsuspectingly, while they are rooted from pet hopefully, throw sirocco on them, and nuke them at the same time while its raining...  a suprise 1500+ dmg on them while at 60% life = quick death, before they can heal.<br>
<br>
Enchanters...  hmm...  i would suggest not using a pet, its only dangerous..  they either mez it or charm it and send it on you..  first off, dispel them.  This will take off their rune and mr.  Then use scars of sigil, they will most likely try to keep you mezed or nuke you or whatnot.  and carry a mod rod.  you will probably need it.  If you have good mr, you will resist mez once and awhile and get that scars in.  a few shots with scars will down the ench.<br>
<br>
And sirocco + nukes = god in duels.  heh.  i casted it on a paladin once and it took him down so fast he couldnt even get loh off.  :&gt;  suprised nuked him to hell at 40% hp.  lol <p>Nilerek, level 55 Magician of Quellious<Br>Tilnam, level 32 Rogue of Vazaelle<Br>Kazdun, iksar monk of sullon zek (cant give away my level on pvp) :></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showPrevMessage?topicID=53.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showNextMessage?topicID=53.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=53.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.threadControl?topicID=53.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=53.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=53.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27>Player vs Player</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
