<br>
First; Get up early while most people are still in bed (or stay up late after most people have gone to bed) to eliminate most of the KS competition. 4am EST is a good time.<br>
<br>
Second; There seem to be three PHs for the AC. Watch for &quot;a mummy&quot;. Not &quot;a crypt mummy&quot; or &quot;a shriveled mummy&quot;, just &quot;a mummy&quot;. Second is &quot;a madman&quot;, not &quot;a desert madman&quot;. And there is a third who's name escapes me right now... Might be &quot;a tarantula&quot; instead of &quot;a desert tarantula&quot;. Something like that, sorry that I can't remember. If you kill all three of the shortened-name spawns, the Ancient Cyclops will spawn shortly thereafter. Within a few minutes.<br>
<br>
The rest is easy, Everlore has a good guide for the remainder of the quest.

<br>
If you're in your 30's, then you're pretty much stuck with the South Ro camp. Bring friends and kill everything on the sand. Dervs don't seem to matter but everything else is open game. Some people say concentrate on undead ... I haven't seen any first-hand evidence of that; if it moves, kill it. Be prepared for a long time of running around killing things and keeping your eyes open for the AC, since he has a number of different spawn points. I have seen him at the following places: Along the east wall just south of the derv camp; between the west derv camp and the dark elf merchants; just west of the eastern derv camp; and in the vicinity of Ortallius in the northwest corner. There are probably other places he can spawn as well. Oh, and be prepared for other players to attempt to KS you, because they will. Bleh. (and by KS I mean jumping on it after you have engaged it. Killing things in the desert doesn't entitle you to first dibs if someone gets there first, which is why you want to bring friends and keep split up.)<br>
<br>
If you're at least 40 with a couple of similarly-leveled friends, do yourself a favor and get the OOT camp. You may have to wait longer for an AC to spawn there, but when it does you will not be in a contest for it. Also, the cyclops placeholders there will give you experience while you're waiting. There is one spawn point on the island, and it's on a six-minute timer if I recall correctly. Placeholders can be Cyclops (much tougher than those in Lake Rathe, these are in their low 40's), a pirate (low level), Boog Mudtoe (or Goob, one of the two, high-teens warrior ogre), aqua goblin (low teens or less), or your friend and mine, the Ancient Cyclops. If you are really good at holding the spawn, you can even pull a seafury or two in downtime, and probably certainly if you get one of the green /con placeholders (i.e., anything but Cyclops or AC).<br>
<br>
I strongly recommend the OOT camp if you can hold it, as the headache, hassle, and frustration are insignificant in comparison to the South Ro camp, unless you're really really lucky.<br>
<br>
Best of luck to you. The 'quest' (LOL) is a pain in the behind, but the boots are oh so nice! <p><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

Kill everything on the sand (generally around the dark elf merchants) that wanders.  Watch where the sand giants pop.  Anywhere a sand giants pops, the AC can pop.  <br>
<br>
Turn your clipping all the way up, stand on hills and watch for the AC.  I have seen two in 40 minutes and I have seen none in 4 hours.  <br>
<br>
I sic my pet on one, and pull a second, I melee the second until the pet comes and then pull another.  A mage is a good class for keeping the sand red <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

I would suggest keeping SOW up if possible, you want to be the first to the AC.  Hit it first and then yell for your group.  Good luck.<br>

<br>
A couple things I want to add.<br>
<br>
The AC in SRo is near 100% resistant to fire spells.   Forget Blaze, Cinder Bolts, etc.  Go with the Shock line.<br>
<br>
If you have a group, you stand a better chance of getting the AC when it spawns, Rangers are especially nice here as they have the best track.  The downside of a group is that you are all likely to be rolling for looting rights, so you may lose out on that Ring.  Anyway, I was level 34 when I began the quest.<br>
<br>
When I went to SRo, the first time I zoned in, I saw the AC right away!   I started racing to it, and a stupid Dry Bones aggroed on my pet.  I foolishly stopped to kill the DB, and by then, the Dark Elf merchants killed the AC, what a fool I was.  I waited another 6 hours and the AC did not spawn that night.<br>
<br>
The next day, I brought a full group from my guild.  We killed everthing but the dervishes while awaiting the AC.  Nothing particular seemed to make him spawn.   Finally, after a few hours, it did spawn and we managed to get to it before the other groups.   We killed it and I lost the roll to the Ranger <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I then spent the next five evenings (in four hour camps) sitting on a sand dune letting my pet kill anything that came withing /attack range.  I endured constant threats from Necros, Wizzies and Druids (many in the 50s) saying that they were prepared to KS it.  Not much I could do about that due to the only spell available to me at the time that would work was low damage (Shock of Spikes).  I saw the AC on the third night, but someone else grabbed it in a massive KSing attack from someone else. <br>
<br>
Finally, on the 7th night, the AC popped near me, and I got to it first.  I did not even wait for my pet to engage before I started chain casting SoS at it.  Sure enough, a level 50 Necomancer was there only 20 seconds later and tried to KS it from me.  Fortunately, the first 20 seconds I had at the start were enough, and I outdamaged him.  He then ran &quot;inside&quot; the corpse with his pet and attempted to prevent me from looting it.  I clicked to loot and kept targetting him or his pet (what a friggin jerk).  He was trying to get the exclusive loot timer to expire before I could loot.   But, finally I was able to find a spot where the looting worked and I got the ring.<br>
<br>
That said, the Jboots are the best item I have, and the camp well worth the hell you go though in getting a pair, should you choose the SRo way.   I have died only once since getting them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Seek Pyremaker</b><br>

Being that it was a holiday weekend and my having Monday off definately helped.  The following is how it turned out for me.<br>
<br>
I decided to give the South Ro spawn a shot as my lvl 52 Bard friend who was going to help me with the OoT spawn was busy.  I began at around 11:00am PST on Sunday ... summoned up and Earth pet and began the usual &quot;kill everything that moves routine&quot;.  I did this for many hours occasionally chatting in /ooc with the other people in the zone who were also camping him.  After lots of Sand Giants but no AC, I decided to take a break at 7:00pm.<br>
<br>
I returned at 10:00pm (had to watch X-files) and found out from one of the people also camping the AC that it had spawned about 10 minutes earlier but a Necro tryed to KS it and feared into the Oasis zone which for some reason caused it to despawn.  DOH!<br>
<br>
I again started running around killing everything.  As there was a Hate raid forming and the Wizzy portal the zone was packed with people and I felt if I even saw the AC it would get pounced on faster than Speedy Gonzalez.  <br>
<br>
But it never spawned .. 4:00am rolled around and there was only me and a lvl 8 in the zone.  I continued clearing out what ever I came across and at about 4:45am another SG spawned .. arggh .. so I dispatched him and then went to sit on the hill next to the DE camp.  Right when I was about to give up and call it a night, I heard more pounding footsteps ... I stood up, turned around and there was the AC strolling by just North of the DE camp.  My pet was at 20% and I was at 60% mana but I pounced on him and took him out quite easily.<br>
<br>
Here's a few things I'd like to point out ... after 15 hours on this camp I have to admit that there is probably no one way to make him spawn.  It's completely random ... but I do feel it spawns in one of the SG spots so you have to keep killing the SGs to make it spawn.  I don't know if the Undead Tower spawn has anything to do with it but the game night before the AC spawned I killed it and then turned around to see the named Sand Giant Husam spawn just after.  So I waited until the next night (was at 8pm gametime) to kill the Tower spawn again and it was shortly thereafter that the AC spawned (2 SGs had spawned that night before the AC did).<br>
<br>
Instead of myself in one spot hoping it would spawn near me, I chose to run in circles around the zone killing everything in my path.  I think this makes your chances better of getting to the AC first or running into one of it's possible placeholders.<br>
<br>
Im not saying that this wasn't purely coincidence, but on this camp you need all the mojo you can get.  If you decide on the S Ro spawn, definately try to do it in the wee hours of the morning.  If the AC had spawned 3 or 4 hours earlier I know I would have never got him for myself.<br>
<br>
I went to bed and did the rest of the quest the next day ... and am now the proud owner of JBoots.  Thanks for getting me inspired and good luck to the rest of you.<br>

The AC had just spawned before I got there so I wasn't over optimistic. I got my ring about 3 hrs later and got another ring (for a friend who was there) about 1 1/2 hrs later. About 1 hr after I left the AC spawned again.<br>

In that time 5 of us got rings.<br>

I was 34 at the time and couldn't even touch it...I hadn't really expected to get a ring...but a good friend of mine who was 45 had invited me along.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usildaardm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SildaarDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/01 10:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jboot Help</span><hr size=1> Getting the JBoots is difficult, but they are so wonderful.

<br>
Magicians are one of the best classes to help with this too. We had 2 magicians running around the zone in circular motions killing everything in our path with our pets. And everyone else in the center killing things that wandered by. I keep a fast nuke memmed, and if I see the AC or an SG pop, I tag it with a fast nuke and pull it to the group. It works well, and very little chance of being KS'd. I've seen many agruments over this AC spawn, but most of the people on Brell have never acted like many here have mentioned. Everytime we have had the AC spawn, no one has ever attacked after we have engaged. I just can't believe the nerve it would take to do that. <p><img src="http://home.att.net/~amtek/Sildaarban6.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanamarinfernostorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanamar Infernostorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#333333>(1/18/01 8:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=455.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/windkull/SMRPhotoNanamar.jpg width=149 height=227></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Jboot Help</span><hr size=1> Damnit, now I gotta go try the camp again, I'm like almost the only 50+ caster I know that doesn't have the boots.

I have tried numerous time over about 15 levels with no luck.  Finally I show up in South Ro get a fire pet and burnout.  Then I stay near the southeast corner, triangle between drev camp, dark elf merchants and an abandoned towers with an undead spawn inside (this is very close to the grassy part).<br>
<br>
I killed undead, desert madmen, and orc, I did nt kill spiders (as that spawns Terrorantula, level 40 spider) and I did not kill dervs.  I was looking out for &quot;a madman&quot; and &quot;a mummy&quot; (as posted earlier).  After killing &quot;a mummy&quot;, few seconds later SG spawned, I took him down pretty fast and a few seconds later right by the derv camp AC spawned and killed a derv, while he was killing the derv I sent my pet and decided to burn (I forgot it was almost immune to fire, I was excited to finally see it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  Luckly my pet demolished it as my bolt was resisted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my precious ring.&quot; he said as he died.<br>
<br>
Good luck all, I love the boots!<br>

<br>
The times that I have seen the AC, it has spawned roughly in the same points and followed the same paths as the Sand Giants.   I do think that you should clear out the Sand Giants if they are popping (you will probably do that anyway, if ye can, for the cash).   The time when my group was there, we were killing SGs for profit and experience.   I suggest sitting on the high dunes near the DE merchants, or levitating around the middle of the zone.   <br>
<br>
Anyway, and I hope you won't get too mad at my &quot;uneeded&quot; luck Nanamar, but I was running through SRo the other day on my way to Rathe Mnts.   Lo and behold, the AC popped right in front of me!  It popped not very far from the Oasis zone line, a little off to the East side of the zone (slightly to the left as you zone in from Oasis).  I quickly cast the 'ol pet and a couple nukes and I got another ring <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    As I was still using PBBs on the arms, the Ring at AC5 and +5 Int is a nice upgrade (not to mention a great gift to someone who can multiquest with me, when I get something better for arm wear  -- if ever).<br>
<br>
The other two ACs I fought popped in a trainglular area (connect these with imaginary lines -- the DE merchants, Dervish camp on East wall, and the undead tower).  Not a big area at all.<br>
