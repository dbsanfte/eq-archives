<br>
1) Pet resists. Serious issue when dealing with AOE mobs, why aren't pets TOTALLY immune to their specific resisted element? Fire pets ARE immune to fire, but earth is only highly resistant to disease, same for air vs. cold, water vs poison.<br>
Epic pet has poor resists, why when it's meant to be the best of ALL? Why has no pet got good MAGIC resist? Epic has decent MR but not HIGH.<br>
<br>
2) Charms on pets. Pets almost NEVER resist charms, in PvP this is seriously imbalancing, and every time a pet gets charmed you may get the &quot;player can only have one pet at a time&quot; bug. I don't mind ME getting charmed, but it's *extremely* frustrating when doing a BoTB someone cheated, used charms and almost EVERY pet you make gets charmed.<br>
<br>
3) Mob resists. Mages get no cold, disease or poison nukes, and no lures, I can understand why if it's to do with game balancing but it IS annoying as hell, especially in places where you can't use pets. Despite recent changes I STILL wouldnt use a pet in TOV, PoH2 or VP, the risk is far too great, and many of the mobs are immune to our nukes. I didn't play a mage to be a &quot;rod monkey&quot; :&gt;<br>
Would a nuke that summons a bolt, a meteor or such that hits versus AC, not resists be so unbalancing? make it have  not such a great mana/damage ratio, as per wiz Lures, but do decent damage. A frequently over looked point is that not every mage is lvl 60 and every mob Maloed/tash/Ro's, low lvl mages get a hell of a time nuking many raid mobs, Naggy for example.<br>
  --Is this an issue, though?--<br>
<br>
4) Monster Summoning 3, Greater Vocerate Air still need damage upgraded in light of other pet changes. Could the Monster Summoning sries be made more useful, summoning an actual mob? Make the MS pets not affected by Burnout and mage pet heals since they are not elementals, would that make a useful pet? Would it be imbalanced? Should it use an expensive reagant? Would that counter the worry on Dire Charmed pets?<br>
<br>
5) Would it be better for the earth, air and water Vocerates/greater Vocerates to PROC their spells, rather than cast them?<br>
Can pets' lousy proc rates be improved? Note that pets have problems landing spells on high level mobs!<br>
   --Is this an issue, though?--<br>
<br>
6) Would the ability to summon weapons that proc stuns and a variety of DDs, maybe snare, be of use to improve pets?<br>
Would we want to be able to summon weapons useful to PLAYERS? Since the nerf on the Sword of Runes, mage weapons aren't really wanted by players, and are only marginally useful to pets in a very few situations (AOEs and the Hole specifically)<br>
  --Is this an issue, though?--<br>
<br>
7) It seems pets have a haste cap of 60% making high level buffs/Muzzle of Mardu redundant, this is a SERIOUS oversight and needs fixed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Frenzied Burnout needs drastically improved. It should work <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exactly as advertised</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with ATK, haste and Flurries, BUT, the duration should be 10 minutes, otherwise its worthless.<br>
<br>
9) Damage Shields seem weak at higher levels, considering the amount of hit points mobs have. Considering at low level you get a damage shield that does 5hp, when facing mobs that do 10-20hp, then at high level you get a 33hp damage shield against mobs doing 100-200hp!<br>
Shouldn't high level damage shield be 50hp as per Fire pets/epic?<br>
   --Is this an issue, though?--<br>
<br>
10) Call of the Hero should NOT be thought of by Verant as some kind of &quot;cheat&quot; to bypass content. Without it, many raids simply CANNOT HAPPEN, because an online game with players from across the world has a HELLISH TIME COORDINATING when people can join up to play! The coffin summon thing is total stupid waste of time, xp and money, players HATE it, it's imbecilic! verant needs ot change its attitude to CoH, it's as vital to raids as Rez and TLs, seriously!<br>
  By all means, disable CoH in spots you need a Key to get to, so as to prevent exploits, except Sky. Sky sucks, sky sucks HUGELY because of the problems with keys and no CoH, hasn't Verant noted its the most underused and generally most loathed zone in the game? Not that the zone isn't interesting or fun, just the hassles involved with it make for a very stressful raid.<br>
<br>
11) Some parts of the epic still need fixed. Phinigel Autropos should ALWAYS drop a random epic item, bards, mages, wizards and rogues all need him, one pal killed him <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> FIFTY SIX TIMES!!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to get his mage staff, that's totally bonkers on a 12 hour spawn mob who's a pain to do!<br>
Why Isle 7? If sky was less of a hassle to do, that wouldn't be so bad, but currently it's a MASSIVE pain and very few folk EVER go to Isle 7.<br>
<br>
12) The Focus staffs are too rare and hard to get, considering that apart from 2 being used in the epic, they are one of the few MAJOR upgrades a mage can get. The Air Staff *still* needs the same crown as the epic AND is so hard to complete its almost as hard as the epic itself!<br>
Magi P'Tasi, Mistress of Scorn should ALWAYS have Earth and Fire staffs. As noted Phinigel should ALWAYS drop one of the 4 epic items, and a mob in Sky should ALWAYS drop the Air staff.<br>
<br>
13) The Mass group Buff ability for mages seems almost useless, as we only get 2 group spells, both damage shields. Something more useful is surely needed? What about a full PARTY CoH? Summons the entire party to the mage? or an across zone CoH? Or something else? Any ideas? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Let me first start by saying I think the pet improvements were good, and well deserved.  I agree, there is much left to do.  <br>
<br>
Due to the fact that I attend many high end raids, some form of nuke variety is important to me.  This may not be the case for everyone depending on level and what they do with their time.  I do think we need a variety of nukes, ie cold, poison or something.  SoFB is a decent spell but not what we should get at 60, it need to do more damage, especially with the lack of cold, poison, disease based nukes.  <br>
<br>
Mana regen is a also a problem I have.  Wizards through familiars get much more mana regen.  Even though there only offensive ability is nukes, and we have pets, it's still somewhat unbalanced in my opinion.  Transon's should have 6/tick of mana regen.<br>
<br>
FT items need to be more widely available for all casters, at level 60 we have a pretty massive mana pool, and this is an inequality with casters vs melee.  While melees have continued to do more and more damage with post 60 levels, we continue to basically med at the same rate with increased mana pools, therefore, taking longer.  Like I said, FT is a good thing and needs to be made more widely available, even if it's in the form of FT 1 items.<br>
<br>
Summons, I don't want any more trinket summons.  I realize we're the summoner type class, but it gets a bit much to summon people (via CoH), then summon focus items, then summon mod rods the rest of the raid.  You want to have me summon a big Meteor (like silver blade said) that has some effect on the mod, I'm cool with that.  Heck why not have some kind of group based summon, as I've seen previously someone suggest summon a wall of protection that would act like a DA type shield.  /shrug just a thought.<br>
<br>
Damage shields, yes I think these need to be increased.  33 points on some of these high end mobs isn't as effective as it could be.<br>
<br>
Class type AA abilities, come on now, these aren't that great, another example of VI not putting a lot of though into the game.  Water illusion needs to be upgraded just to mention 1.<br>
<br>
I love playing my mage, but after 2.5 years of it I've learned a few things... one of which is it could be THE best class in the game if VI would put some thought in to what they are doing.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts. <p>Master Caldywen Lebeau <BR>

they could easelly give us a new damage shield spell that lasts aslong as KEI and gives like 35 points and gives 35 vs fire and cold it would really make massgroupbuff useful to us aswell.<br>
<br>
personally i think its kind of annoying to play sufficient and just keep a damage shield up at all times on tanks <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usinghaovercast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Singha Overcast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 257<br> <font color=#333333>(6/17/02 1:07:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So what is left to fix, or help mages? </span><hr size=1> <br>
Resists on rain spells. I've read many posts where people say how usefull the rains spells are, yet everytime I get a new one I try it out only to have at least 1 resist each and every cast and sometimes two and even all three. So to the back of the book it goes. I won't cast a 1:1 ratio damage/mana cost spell.<br>
<br>
Pet attack skill and pet level. Way to many whiffs at higher levels. This has been said over and over.<br>
<br>
Mana regen. I'm 55 now, three yellows away from finally getting mod rod 2 (which is selling for 7k on my server), the first form of mana regen for mages. That's just wrong. All casters need a bump in innate mana regen across the board.<br>
<br>
Post 50 nukes need a hard look. Most other casters have had changes made to their 50+ spells.<br>
<br>
The mage class is much better off than it was prior to SoL. I appreciate the changes made so far. I hope that they finish with a few much needed tweeks.<br>

<br>
1) Pet resists, something has to be done about the rate pets die at in AOE's, playing in certien parts of the new CT is just a pain in the ass.<br>
<br>
2) Pet heals, I think a 1000pt pet heal for 250 mana would hardly be overpowering considering the pets amazing lack of defence.<br>
<br>
3) An increase in the pets lack of defence, not nessecarily a huge one but considering the current state of the game I dont think 1000 ac for epic would be over the top.<br>
<br>
4) I wouldn't mind catching up some ground on bards when it comes to DS's, bards shouldn't be the best at everything.<br>
<br>
5) pet offence, could still use a bit of a tweek(at least end game)I am thinking of items that summon pet only weapons etc... for instance a wand that summons a pet only 40/30 weapon which procs blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
6) something interesting, with so many creative posibilities gimmie something new.<br>

All of our fixes so far have been fixes that other classes were involved in, and it seems to me that they never look at the Magician individually.<br>
<br>
Focus items (even summoned)-fix for all spell casters<br>
Pet upgrades-affected pet classes<br>
Reduced resists on mobs-all classes<br>
Mod Rod and Rod2- Similar in ability to necro Lich/Twitch combo<br>
Summoned resist items-All classes and raids.<br>
<br>
We haven't recieved any upgrade that simply affects us and not anyone else. This is kind of rough in my opinion since mages have been complaining about being under-powered or unbalanced for a long time.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
VI has often stated that Mages have a pet which makes them HIGHLY powerful in the offense category. They sacrifice defense and utility for a huge offense. In addition to that Mages take an xp penalty for their pet making their offense even more powerful. THEN VI puts the /pet hold command in the AA abilities and states that only a supreme mage can overcome the limitations of his pet.<br>
<br>
And to be truthful all of that sounded good to me. But they left our offensive capabilities slide pretty quickly. And then for balance they:<br>
1) Did not increase our combat effectiveness to that of pre-kunark.<br>
2) Removed the xp penalty.<br>
3) Made pets non-aggro.<br>
4) After making pets non-aggro they left /pet hold in the AA abilities.<br>
5) Added a bunch of utility to our class.<br>
<br>
So basically in the last couple of months they completely reversed their original &quot;vision&quot; of a magician. We are now manageable offense with some utility and VERY little added risk.<br>
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I really like my mage, but I preferred the difficulty of playing the class balanced by the kill power associated with that difficulty.<br>
<br>
The safer weaker version does not appeal to me as much.<br>
<br>
Of course all one has to do is look at our AAXP abilities and their funcionality to see how little thought the VI team puts into our class.<br>
<br>
I think the biggest thing we as a community could ask for would be for VI to look individually at our class instead of trying to generalize us.<br>
<br>

<br>
P.S. part of what irks me so much about the changes is that I spent 52 out of 58 levels in dungeons, my ability to control my pet in difficult situations far exceeded that of most mages. Now any mage who has spent 60 levels in outdoor zones killing easy mobs in low intensity situations is about my equal on a raid. Call me elitest but I earned the trust of my comrades on raids, now others have had it given to them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubrinthemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BrintheMage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/02 5:39:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=244.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: So what is left to fix, or help mages? </span><hr size=1> Oh on Phinigle, I have a wiz friend who killed him 36 times in order to get the wizard staff.

1. PoA: Making the keys stay again. Would need to be countered by lowering the drop rate on the crowns, so for  example 1 crown in 2 clearings would drop.<br>
<br>
The advantage of this is that it is almost impossible to get minor guilds to go 3 days in a row, but no problem to go on 3 separate days.<br>
<br>
2. Quilmane cloak.<br>
The most boring part of anything I ever did in EQ. Why make a subquest that is tracking based? A mob that is green on the verge of cyan, that druids and rangers kill... Big sigh here.<br>
<br>
Alternative could be to make Quilmane a static triggered spawn, level 60, that drops the cloak every time. Something like the druid Fay-dragon thing. Spare me running around in SK shouting desperately for Quill killing mobs a level 20 would get xp of. Please.<br>
<br>
Or there could be a strange magic sphere apearing around the mage and the mob, forcing the mage to solo a given (triggered) mob. =).<br>
<br>
3. Water staff:<br>
If the drop rates are still as bad as mentioned above, improve them. After killing Phinny for the 10th time, there is NO EPIC FEELING LEFT.<br>
<br>
Imagine if you where to make a book, telling about your (epic) adcentures. <br>

WHAT KIND OF EPIC QUEST ALLOWS THE WORDS ET CETERA?!?!?!<br>
<br>
sorry about that, had to let some steam off =)<br>
<br>
But basically: make him harder, but let the items drop every time.<br>
<br>
Non epic:<br>
4. Duration on DS:<br>
Would be great to have a DS that lasted much longer than the current one. It is simply boring to have to cast the DS over and over. 10 mins at 49, 15 at mid fifties, and 30 at level 60. Of course increase the mana cost accordingly.<br>
<br>
5. Haste cap on pets. Other thread says it all.<br>
<br>
6. &quot;Remove unused AA&quot;. While I dont expect this to happen, there must be some AA that has not been taken by a single mage, they are simply to randomly selected. <br>
<br>
7. Summoned weapons (for pets)<br>
I like item summons, and a new proc weapon for pet would be great. Several, in fact, spread over levels. Effects could be stun whips a la the ones from South Karana, cold based DD, an improved anti dummoned DD, snare, perhaps a super taunt item (isnt there spells designed to raise agro on a mob?).<br>
<br>
8. Summoned items<br>
Continue the line of items with minor spell effects, resists, and armour. They are great. Upgrade could be same effects, but a lot more charges. For example a flying carpet with 6 charges instead of 2. Or a ring of invisibility, 2 charges. Or a cancel magic staf, 6 charges. Mana cost accondingly. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Pet Haste Cap:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This is currently set at 60%, making <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> above III nearly useless, along with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Muzzle of Mardu</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This needs to be raised to 100-115%.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Fix Mage AA Class Skills:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Frenzied Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is broken, and would be unappealling even if fixed.  Even if it doubled pet damage output, it would be better just to let the pet fight for 36 seconds longer.  It is also not consisent with the theme of a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and the need to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;burn down&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a foe is better met by existing nukes.<br>
<br>
I propose a new skill, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Improved Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which adds +5 ATK per skill level times the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> level of the next cast of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  So a mage with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Improved Burnout 1</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> casting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Burnout III</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would add +15 ATK, whereas a mage with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Improved Burnout 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> casting <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Burnout IV</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would add +60 ATK.  The skill would have three levels, and cost either 3/6/9 or 5/10/15 AA.  As it would last 15 minutes, a refresh timer of 144 minutes seems fair.  It would allow <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Ancient Burnout V</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to someday function to provide a raid level pet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Soft Thirties:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There appears to be a weak spot in the 30's.  Adding a new more and more efficient pet heal at 29th level might add just enough back bone to get over the hump without having a dramatic effect.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Difficulty of Epic:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Oddly enough, I do not have a strong opinion on the difficulty of the epic.  No, I do not have my epic.  I agree that some parts are quite frustrating, but I can offer no suggestions here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Pet Resist Rates:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If we do indeed need to have more resistant pets, perhaps the following is a reasonable solution, as a 50+ spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Summon Belt of Elemental Protection</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: summons a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Belt of Elemental Protection</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which is RACE: NONE, CLASS: NONE <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  (meaning pets only)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, with plus 50 FR/DR/MR/CR/PR.  That might be sufficient to tip the scales.  It might also have some AC and HP.  It would have the advantage of only applying to prepared pets, not chain cast pets.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Mob Resists:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Frankly, I am content with my resist rate as I have experienced it so far, and do not desire to tread on the toes of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  As initially enamored as I was of the physical dart idea, saving against AC instead of MR, we already have one: it's called a pet.  I would rather solve pet problems and use those instead of invent a new class of spell, or get a cold or whatever based nuke.<br>
<br>
If such a bolt is deemed viable, then the easiest way to implement it without adding new game mechanics might be to add <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Summon Javelin of Destruction</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which is NO RENT, NO DROP, LORE, goes in the archery slot, is based off <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Throwing Skill</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, has a +100 ATK bonus <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  (so it might actually hit)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and does 500 damage, so it might be worthwhile.  Those numbers are off the top of my head, and might now be viable, but they avoid coding for a new kind of spell or resistance by abusing existing game mechanics.<br>
<br>
On a raid, I have three things I can do, and adapt according to the mob.  I can nuke, I can pet, and I can rod.  At least one of those things is likely to be useful.  While rodding may be tedious, so are the many of the roles others are required to fulfill on raids.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Left Behind Pets:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I do think <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Greater Vocaration: Air</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Monster Summoning 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should have their damage scaled up to keep in line with the other level 57+ pet spells.  However, we might want to test and see if the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Air</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pet is already stunning more.  It appears to me as if this might be the case, and if so, an increase in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  GV:Air</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> damage output might not be justified.  The disadvantages of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  MS3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> however, in particular the inability to equip weapons, suggests to me that an increase in damage output is justified and fair.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Damage Shields:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I am not dissatisfied with them, except a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Druid</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should never get a better damage shield than ours, even if they do worship <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Karana</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  As they are, under most circumstances, damage shields are incredibly mana efficient, and cannot be resisted.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Slow</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> reduces their value, but so what?  Some improved damage shields might be icing on the cake, but hardly critical, I think.<br>
<br>
I agree that a long lasting, kick butt damage shield at level 60 might provide some lacking oomph among our level 60 spells.  Where <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  KEI</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, our 60th level spell that people seek us out for?  Nowhere now.  If it were group, it might even make <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Mass Group Buff</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> worth while.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Summoned Proccing Weapons:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
More icing, except perhaps as NONE/NONE pet only weapons to address pet deficiencies, and there are alternatives.  We do have nice summons, the focus items remain quite valuable.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Staves of Elemental Mastery:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The epic essentially consumes <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>three</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> staves, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Earth</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Water</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> directly, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Air</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> indirectly.  It might be nice to decouple them, but is it critical?  The recent pet changes dwarf the effect of the staves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Earlier Mana Regeneration:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Simply adding a second charge to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Rod of Modulation</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, as argued in <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showMessage?topicID=1190.topic">PROPOSAL: Mini T-Rods</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and adding one charge net-mana rod in the 30's would extend the capabilities of rodding down to lower levels.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Resists on Rains:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Until I got <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I always tried to take advantage of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sirroco</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> whenever possible.  I have had no problem with rains.  I also make a habit of casting a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Malosi</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->-type spell early, usually pulling with it.  I have had no problems with resists on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sirroco</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Post 50 nukes:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
These have always seemed adequate to me, the only missing pieces at 60 might be an upgrade to the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shock of Steel</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> line, MR not FR, and a better <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  PBAoE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  A <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  PBAoE</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> version of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Malosi</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would also be sweet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Conclusion:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I think we are nearly fixed, and most of what remains is properly pet-centered.<br>

Yeah, we need better heals of some sort. Mob with AE, we need 2x as many heals if both we and pet getting hit... and stuff like that. I don't want some uber heals which are better than nuking under any cirumstance (that's closer to the beastlord area methinks) but our heals sux.<br>

Right. And you're saying that's not individual attention. Mod rod 2 is a copy off necros... but just because another class has the same ability doesn't mean it doesn't help us.<br>

The most boring part of anything I ever did in EQ. Why make a subquest that is tracking based? A mob that is green on the verge of cyan, that druids and rangers kill... Big sigh here.<br>
<br>
Alternative could be to make Quilmane a static triggered spawn, level 60, that drops the cloak every time. Something like the druid Fay-dragon thing. Spare me running around in SK shouting desperately for Quill killing mobs a level 20 would get xp of. Please.<br>
<br>
Or there could be a strange magic sphere apearing around the mage and the mob, forcing the mage to solo a given (triggered) mob. =).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I hate all those ideas. I like quillmane the way it is. Normally I say 'if you don't want to camp it, then don't,' but hell, with quillmane you don't have to, just buy MQ. Quillmane is non-issue too many mages complain about~<br>

The kind made by verant. Again, it's their game, they get to design it, thus they get to define the word 'epic.' Epic is subjective, mofakka, and your argument about quillmane being epic is basically forcing your opinion on VI, which is a battle not worth fighting.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If we do indeed need to have more resistant pets, perhaps the following is a reasonable solution, as a 50+ spell.<br>
<br>
Summon Belt of Elemental Protection: summons a Belt of Elemental Protection, which is RACE: NONE, CLASS: NONE (meaning pets only), with plus 50 FR/DR/MR/CR/PR. That might be sufficient to tip the scales. It might also have some AC and HP. It would have the advantage of only applying to prepared pets, not chain cast pets.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Actually, best solution is to kill 2 birds with 1 stone: add resists to burnout 4 and muzzle. Our pets are doing decent dmg anyway, haste cap doesn't really need to be higher (cept for frenzied burnout, which is based on increasing haste to do more dmg... which it doesn't since the haste is capped! it would have to be hard coded to exceed cap)<br>

I hate this summoned weapons idea. Maybe like 1 weapon with an interesting proc for pets, stun or such, or perhaps a 0 duration stun just for interrupting, but I really don't need or want more CRAP summons in my book.<br>

Pet casts do indeed reset the melee timers.  This has been known for a long time now.  That is why monster summoning had an advantage; it doesnt cast, so you get more melee out of it.<br>

<br>
Wow, now there's an idea. What a time saver on raids at high level. Or full group coth even.<br>
<br>
Or how about a summon from anywhere, or only zone in group or not? Long reset timer would keep the thing from being unbalanceing.<br>
<br>
Seems that more could be done to make Coth useful. Different type CoTH spells for each type of coth.<br>
<br>
Coth now is only a problem in that we are always having to leave group and be with someone that is bound at zone. Just slows thins down to the point of stupidy. <br>
<br>
I don't think anyone would want to leave a 60+ mage bound at each major mob spot. <p><BR><BR><BR"><center><img src="http://members.rogers.com/stellarthief/Intrigue01.jpg">

If you compare the druid spell moonfire and the mage spell shock of fiery blades they don't balance. Moonfire does more damage, had a shorter casting time, and costs less mana. It is all the way around a better spell than shock of fiery blades. Moonfire is also easy to obtain so it isn't like the wiz spell elnricks (sp). I am not quite sure why the druids were given the ability to outnuke the mage.
