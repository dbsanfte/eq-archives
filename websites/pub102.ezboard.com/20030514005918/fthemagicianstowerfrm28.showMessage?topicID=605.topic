This is not surprising, as they are among the best items a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can own, and far easier to obtain than our <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Epic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Earlier discussions can be found here: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showMessage?topicID=554.topic">The Gospel of Boots of Bladecalling</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showMessage?topicID=557.topic">Boots of Bladecalling Again</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
Simply put, these boots are awesome, and worth whatever effort it takes to obtain them.<br>
<br>
There are several disputes regarding these boots.<br>
<br>
First, many claim they should be ignored in discussions of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> damage output, as few <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have them.  While this is a valid concern, and non-bootied <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should be considered, the boots are important equipment, easier to obtain than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Primal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, harder to obtain than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> haste</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I think they must be included, as should non-bootied Mages.<br>
<br>
Second, it is claimed that these boots are practically impossible to obtain, because there is a narrow window where a guild would be interested in doing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velketor The Enormous Sorceror</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Either your guild is not yet capable of doing it, or has gone beyond him.<br>
<br>
Whereas I promised <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Grumples</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> not to say that anything is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;social problem&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->...uhm....uhm...I will say that once your guild is capable of doing it, it is a matter of convincing them of the importance of this item to you as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I discuss this in the Gospel referenced above.<br>
<br>
Here is a little history of how I got mine that may be of some use to you.  Our guild is an up and coming second tier guild, somewhere between the third and sixth most powerful guild on our young server, depending on how you measure.  For example, a couple days ago we did <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Vindicator</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for the third time.<br>
<br>
We are and were <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>well</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> beyond <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velketor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, at that time my senior and an epicked, bootied <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> ArchMage</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, went to bat with the leadership of my guild, and insisted that we slay <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velketor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  More than one officer was dubious, and thought the raid was not a good use of guild effort.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilea</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pressed ahead, and lead the raid successfully.  I now have my boots.<br>
<br>
Since then, I have made it clear exactly how valuable they are to me, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and the guild</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->, especially on long fights.  It allows me, if necessary, to dump my entire mana bar in rods, and nuke continuously without getting aggro.<br>
<br>
The attitude of the guild leadership has changed.  It is now a specific goal of the guild that every post-55 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> eventually get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Boots of Bladecalling</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The bottom line: you give a lot to your guild, a lot of play time that is frankly less than exciting.  You summon rods, focus items, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Call of the Hero</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like a good soldier, and you deserve your loot too.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velketor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is very straightforward encounter, and if your guild has moved beyond him, well, it won't take that much time to kill him, will it?<br>
<br>
You deserve it.<br>
<br>
If your guild is not yet capable of doing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Velketor</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then make it a goal to strive towards.  It is a classic fight, and represents a milestone for your guild.<br>

Velkator, on the chance that he may drop some boots that will help our one magician, or this Luclin zone, which can drop uber weapons usable by every single melee in the guild?&quot;<br>
<br>
It's hardly a choice.  It's frankly selfish to ask your guild to do an entire raid strictly for you, which is why I will never ask.  Sure, Velks drops other things, but his other drops for other classes aren't good enough to warrent doing it rather than some other, far more valuable raid.  Why should the guild stop doing something useful for the 12+ melees and instead go help their 1 mage?  I'm a big fan of efficiency and number crunching, and doing Velakator simply doesn't make sense.  That he happens to drop a valuable magician item is mostly just a shame, that he doesn't drop equally useful things for other people, too.<br>
<br>
Compare to a Kael/TOV type raid, where literally everyone can benefit.<br>
<br>
And I'm not sure how you can say they are easier to get than primals but harder than haste.  Um?  There is a haste item that drops in Runnyeye, another one that drops in LGuk and another that drops in Howling Stones.  These are all easily camped for and obtained.  Any level 50 melee who doesn't own at least a FBSS doesn't own one purely out of lack of trying.  I gave a FBSS to my cleric twink, for heavens sake, they sell for less than a Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring.  On my VZ guild, I didn't know of any melee still using a FBSS by level 51, and VZ was way behind the times in loot farming.<br>
<br>
And primals are &quot;easier&quot; in that your guild will be hunting for them a lot more than they'll be killing Velkator.<br>
<br>
Now if the boots dropped off of Ragefire, then I think you'd have a strong argument for factoring boots into mage balance: Ragefire has a lifespan of about 30 seconds, doing him is an event guilds tend to try to arrange as often as possible.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, this is also part of the problem with the mage epic: the only reason to go up so far into Sky these days is for the mage epic.  The warrior epic is, frankly, crap.  With that out of the picture, the main reason guilds do Sky is out of a sense of fairness.  Perhaps you can use that as leverage to talk them into going to Velks, but I find the whole thing to be rather tasteless.  &quot;Let's go to Velks and do a raid that results in me, personally, getting phat lewt.  Some of you may die!  But I'm willing to take that risk.&quot;<br>
<br>
Meh.  Maybe I'm just not enough of a loot whore, but I don't believe in doing raids that only benefits one class, especially a class that represents such a minority in the guild.<br>
<br>
<br>
That said, they are a huge boost to the mage who gets them, I just think they exist in a too far out-of-the-way place to factor them into mage balance.<br>

-  I don't believe in doing raids that only benefits one class, I believe in doing raids that reward the people that play and help the guild.  Guilds are made up of individuals that work as a team.  Sometimes the rewards go to those that can increase the team's power, and sometimes, I feel, that the rewards should go to individuals regardless of how it effects the overall team's strength.<br>
<br>
I love to know what one item each and every IO member would LOVE to have.  I would like IO as a guild to help each individual acquire this item (be it within our grasp).<br>

Most <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> loots in the game are frankly not very exciting, and are generally only a marginal or situational improvement over the item they replace.<br>
<br>
Further, in long fights the boots allow me to continuously nuke and export my mana in the form of rods.<br>
<br>
It is no more selfish that any other guild member seeking a specific and appropriate loot.<br>
<br>
I earned it, and it helps the guild.<br>

My guild is now arguably #1 on my server, or at least up there with what we kill and how often.  Most of the guild is lvl 60 with epic and insane loot.  So having all guild mages epicless is kind of embarrassing.<br>

Hopefully this thread will motivate them to start helping their guild mage with boots'n epics! <p><B><center><font color=green><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=36994">Eandori Raintree Arch Mage</a><a href="http://www.bloodofro.com">--== Blood of Ro ==--</a></center></font></B></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulaidee7.showPublicProfile?language=EN>laidee7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(3/29/02 7:08:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=605.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: take advantage of your status</span><hr size=1> Not to pick on you Grump (and to be honest I didn't read your whole post after you said it would be selfish to ask, so you may have addressed it), but look at it this way. You spend all your time with your guild on raids being their mana slave, and Coth'ing all those peeps who show up late, on a raid that will be minimally, if at all beneficial to you, but highly so to those you support. Far from being selfish, it sounds almost FAIR that your guild be willing to camp things that do directly impact your class as a mage, and help make you more usefull. Since this is something that would in the long run also be beneficial to your guild, I would think they would WANT to help you, regardless of how insignificant it may be to other members. I would leave in a heart beat if after all the time I put in being a good soldier, and doing my best to be a good leader, and officer, my guild refused to indulge me in an endeavour such as this. I think I'll not ever ask my guild to help me get these, but because I play on PvP, I must be selective about what I ask of my guild, as some things are just not feasible. However, I hardly think it selfish to expect my guild to help me camp/quest for something that truly would benefit all. Just my 2cp.<br>

However, to play devil's advocate, this might be the proof-is-in-the-pudding example that mages truly aren't valued in uber guilds. If you are a guild leader, and have a choice of getting loot for valued classes and a magician, the choice is clear. If all your active mages leave, who cares?

<br>
Helping ONE CLERIC get his epic is a massive help to the entire guild.  Cleric epics are a priority item for that very reason.  Even getting the maintank a new weapon can be a massive help to the entire guild: the easier time he has holding agro, the easier the whole raid will be.  Enchanter epics, while less of a priority, are also an aid to the guild.  (It's not like the enchanter wants to haste himself, he wants the epic to better haste other people.)<br>
<br>
By comparison, getting this present for a mage isn't even going to be a blip on the guild's raid effectiveness.  Not having a cleric epic on a raid = pain in the arse.  Not having boots of bladecalling = pretty much no difference whatsoever.  Except to the mage.<br>

2) Fair's fair, say you dp the CS dragon to get a melee a nice haste cloak, whats so big about doing Velk? Any guild has problems getting its casters right click nukes in preference to melee isnt worth being in.<br>

3) While the chanter items suck for effect (not bad stats but what twerp made a pb-aoe stun spell with, what is it, 12 sec cast?!!), the necro, wiz and mage items are very good.<br>
<br>
4) Right click items own for improving caster damage over time. Generally get 2+ 600 hp nukes per xp mob <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> without using mana!</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. xp mobs typically have around 5k hp at 60.<br>

9 second casting time, actually.  Which is really convenient in many situations... stun duration = 6 seconds.  Gate casting time = 5 second....  Against mobs with relatively low resists (caster frogs in Sebilis, Kobolds in Velks, for example), the rod/crown can prevent gates infinitely.  It's also very handy when duoing.  And not too horrible in AE groups... I've had a few pulls (40+ mobs in FG) where I used to run OOM but still be able to channel through rod casts... properly staggered with a second enchanter, they can be the key to survival in some cases.<br>
