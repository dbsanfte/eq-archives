There are those whom might not yet understand what it is like to smoke, for them I offer the following:<br>
<br>
Smoking requires a couple of things, we will go over them one by one:<br>
<br>
1) You need something in the shape of a stick of sorts, some are thin others are thick, one would normally keep these in a pack of sorts.<br>
<br>
2) You need an ignition of sorts this alone requires 2 things:<br>
    A) Fuel, this is the essence that is ignited and pushes the<br>
        ignition through the stick.<br>
    B)  Spark, this lights the fuel so to speak, it is only the <br>
         tool to start the process.<br>
<br>
Yes so addicting it is, to remove the stick from your pack, hold it ever so gently in the palm of your hand.  In an instance you can ignite it using the tools at hand and begin smoking, yes extremely addictive this habit can be.<br>
<br>
There are many different types of sticks one can use, and likewise there are just as many different types of ignitors that can be used, for the sake of keeping it simple we will demonstrate this in general terms.<br>
<br>
You pull the stick from your pack, placing it in your hands.  What is needed next is to ignite this stick, you sit for a minute and focus your thoughts on what pleasure it is to come.  Then and only then you lift your stick up a little, focusing your energies on igniting it to produce the desired effect.  With the seemingly mere utterance of a few words and a some flashes of light you have ignites the tool.  This tool is the words at your disposal, these words are of ancient origin and design and yet come so naturally to you.<br>
<br>
You focus your energies through the stick of sorts, discharging great energies and astounding affects.  The stick in use determines an increase in the effect thus an increase in the rush of smoking.<br>
<br>
Arising from your focus and utterances, comes an elemental of sorts, this is your pet and your means of pleasure in smoking.  He has come to your aide from an elemental plane and he will do the bidding you command him to do.  With a simple command you send him in to smoke the enemy at hand, and feel the sensation that only smoking can bring.  You have amassed great power in this elemental guardian, as such he can inflict great amounts of damage onto those who wish to free you of your habit.<br>
<br>
You smoke dungeon after dungeon, mob after mob, there is seemingly nothing in the realm that can stop you.  Be it goblins, ogre, bunny or giant your companion can lay them to waste in a matter of seconds.  Yes such an addictive habit this smoking is, one even more addictive than adrenaline itself.<br>
<br>
You travel to a far off land to see what pleasures you can get from smoking there, you bring forth another companion and send him in to deal with the new adversaries that are seemingly everywhere.  Ahhhh now this is true enjoyment, your companion is laying waste to creatures of great power as you are growing in knowledge and power, even having to demonstrate an occasional knowledge in the arts of fire and magic from time to time, yes this is power and you are addicted.  <br>
<br>
Throughout your career you have grown more and more dependent on your companions to act as a shield between you and your would be foes.  Through this time, you have found you needed stronger sticks from time to time, in order to give you better effects.  Your sticks at this point are now extremely long and devastatingly powerful, the affect they have on your companion is matched by merely no other.  Yet you catch a glimpse of a swirling stick that appears to have an ultimate power in it.<br>
<br>
You track the wielder of this ultimate power down and beg him to share his knowledge with you.  He informs you that to obtain power such as his, you must prove yourself worthy to the master, the master of all masters, the master of elements.  You gratefully head his advise and head out with a burning desire to obtain this power and mastery of insane and unmatched power.<br>
<br>
So the journey begins, along the way you are forced to clear many petty beasts in hopes that one of them carry a piece you will need in order to prove your ultimate worthiness to the master.  Many many days weeks months and years pass, and you are a step away from proving your worth.  Your anticipation grows, your greed for the power grows, and all mundane tasks start to give you a hatred for the power you wish to obtain, why ohhhh why must this road be so taxing on your soul, why ohh why must this road lead to so much hate.  <br>
<br>
Then you realize, the last piece you need is in hate itself, and you see the irony in this.  A gleaming smile grows across your face as you begin to laugh insanely.  You head to hate, a feeling you know well and will undoubtedly overcome.  Your mark is clear, the objective is obvious, and your hands sweat from anticipation.  This proves to be more of a task than you initially thought, just as you are about to be overcome by hatred, you obtain your goal and seek out the master.<br>
<br>
The master is pleased and hands you a scroll that will summon the stick of all sticks, the smoke of all smokes, yes such a great power lies in this spell.  Mobs that used to give you a hard time will now and forever forth feel your power and tremble at the thought of the companions you summon.  Your companion now lays waste to many many more powerful mobs, and you know what it is like to smoke zone upon zone upon zone.  <br>
