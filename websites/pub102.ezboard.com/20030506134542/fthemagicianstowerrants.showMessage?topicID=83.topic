Lack of respect.  People do not respect mages.<br>
<br>
I’ve been on several Hate raids lately, and the Word has always been, NO PETS.  Why?  Oh why?  They fear the pet will cause trains.  We, as mages, know the safe wall is safe for a pet.  We’re all professionals here.  We all know the tricks of the trade.  We’ve all ready Kylere’s post, and we all knew it before we read it.  /pet guard here, /pet back off, Earthen Boots for insta-pet death.  By the time you’re in your 50’s this is ingrained.<br>
<br>
We know how to control our pets.  So why don’t others trust us?  A mage without a pet is so useless.  Any other offensive class would be better on a Hate raid.  Any.  I nuke once, maybe twice, for a total of 1340 pts of damage.  My pet could do at least that much damage.  Perhaps twice as much.  I’m dead weight, just tagging along hoping for a piece of Apothic.  How demeaning.  How insulting.  I KNOW how to control my pet!  Do NOT tell me how to play my class!  I did NOT buy this character on eBay, I sweated though all 53 levels.<br>
<br>
We are not trusted to control our own pets, something we have done for, perhaps, years.  Pathing at the safe wall is acceptable.  Pets will not follow the wacky pathing that the mobs do.  /assist tank, wait to verify you’ve got the right one, yes, the tank’s clearly swinging at that mob right there, and yes, the mob’s name is flashing, /pet attack.  Pet runs straight to mob, kills it, and then comes straight back to the guard spot.  Simple.  We’ve all seen this before.  I have.  So have the very same raid leaders who have now, mysteriously, decided that pets are no longer welcome.<br>
<br>
Again, I’m talking about the safe wall here.  Yes, there may be places in Hate where pets are a no-no, and moving with pets is right-out.  But the safe wall is safe for a pet.<br>
<br>
I believe myself to be an excellent pet controller.  I do not cause trains, I always assist, and I never break mez.  Even if my view is flawed, I couldn’t be worse than an average pet controller.  I’m certainly not a bad one.  But yet, I am untrusted to do something I’ve done since level 4.<br>
<br>
Kylere made that post about what he told his guild.  That’s great, the way he posted it implies that they listened to him.  Unfortunately, my guild does not listen to me (and I am an officer).  They do not believe me.  They do not believe that the added risk of the pet is worth it – they do not understand the added benefit of the pet.  With the changes in Hate, a runner could easily cause a train (thus, wipeout).  What better way to stop a runner than a few Earth pets?  Doesn’t matter.<br>
<br>
I am the second highest person in my guild.  There is one higher.  He is a level 55 mage.  He, of course, disagrees completely with me.  He is perfectly happy to go to Hate without his pet.  He feels pets in Hate are too dangerous (though he’s used them in the past – what happened?!).  We have a Hate raid coming up, and he has said point blank that if pets are allowed on the raid, he and his uber-friends aren’t coming.  Others outside the guild have said the same.  This utterly baffles me that a fellow mage and guildmate would say such a thing.  Tensions between us have gotten to the point where I cannot ask him questions about this.<br>
<br>
I do not enjoy spending 8-12 hours as an ineffective, defenseless excuse for a level 40 wizard.  Why would anyone?  Yes, there is the lure of the Apothic.  But wouldn’t it be so much more fun to be up there with your pet, doing significant damage, helping out, getting your group some xp, and maybe even doing emergency crowd control?  Generally contributing something to the raid?  Like we’re used to?  (In non uber-encounters, anyway.  /sigh).<br>
<br>
Are we that hard to understand?  Leaders do not seem to understand how much we can contribute to a raid with our pets, and how little we do when we don’t have our pets.<br>
<br>
This problem has bothered me immensely.  I feel as though I need to take some drastic action.  Either retiring my mage outright, leaving my guild for one that respects mages, or perhaps even quitting EQ and getting on with my life.<br>
<br>
Thank you, your comments are welcome.<br>

In our guild, the only restrictions are (1) no pets till the first camp is set up.  (2) no roaming pets, have /pet sit down on all the time (3) no sending the pets to attack until our main assist not only targets the mob but starts beating on it... and of course (4) the mage must have bought summon companion <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
When camp moves from one spot to the next (to make life easier for the pullers <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   pets stay behind and are summoned to the new campsite rather than risking aggro on the way.<br>
<br>
I'd invite you to come to one of our hate raids to see the beauty of an extra 9-10 tanks but competing with 5 other high level mages for apothic and an earth staff is enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> (we let necros have their pets too, but they have to destroy them and summon a new one between campsites <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>

It's too bad they changed Inny, because pre-patch they sure laid the smack down on him when our main tank went linkdead <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Bad pulls happen (3 spite golems /shudder) and all those shaman and other casters feeding the clerics never hurts hehe even the tanks would get in on the leave combat for a sec and give a rod to the cleric thing.

<br>
Last night I went on a Hate run, and it was the guilds first time since the changes to Hate, so I did not even bother with the pet point. But things I learned...<br>
<br>
A level 53 Mage is almost completely ineffective against the new mobs on the upper floors in terms of casting, the failure rate was 90% when it was not malo'd and 50% when it was Malo'd. I tried all the tools available and had varying success.<br>
<br>
Shock of Swords: 1 in 32 stuck for full<br>
Elemental Maelstorm: Never stuck except with Malo<br>
Char: Best success but still nothing to write home to Jababer about<br>
Lava Bolt: Cannot remember for sure but I had one stick in several hours and the mob summoned and killed me.<br>
<br>
FYI my best luck was vs Knights of Innoruuk.<br>
<br>
The only time I summoned a pet the entire night was once when we ended up with like 7 mobs. I summoned a pet and so did the others ( I would like to think off of my lead :-) heh we had 6 mages there and I saw 5 pets as I camped out) I did not summon it until the order to camp out came, then I did so and sent it at the mob that was caster hunting (used the 51 Voc: earth) threw a BO at it and camped. I did have 2 people mention in tells that without the pet they would have died and added to the CR. <br>
<br>
But one thing seems apparent, the new mobs are not that pullable(hmm is that a word) it is best to move to them, then spend a while in each spot then move on, it is possible that on the upper floors, guilds may begin to change their thoughts on the issue, the mobs cannot really be mezzed, so extra tanks make sense.<br>
<br>
I would propose that talk with your guild and suggest that you have a pet group once you leave the first floor and that they are assigned adds as they come. This stops the splitting up of PC tanks and saves cleric mana ( not to mention gets mages and necros some well deserved exp :-)<br>
<br>
BTW the Maestro room does have pathing so bad, that it is the only place that I prefer myself not to use a pet, you can send it at a mob ten feet away and it will zig zag 10 minutes getting to it. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah and the AC22 16INT 10PR and DR Robe looks so good I will be dropping my pally pic soon :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzurrin.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zurrin</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 55<br> <font color=#333333>(3/20/01 7:36:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My thoughts</span><hr size=1> No rules about pets in my guild except if you can't control them don't summon them.<br>

<br>
Did you know that when Hate first opened, all the revenants had pets? And all the golems had pets? But the pathing in Hate is so bad that the pets were getting stuck everywhere, and causing major lag and trains.<br>
<br>
(plus back then mobs could have tons of pets....anyone remember the pet stacks in lake rathe?)<br>
<br>
Soo....instead of fixing the pathing...they removed mob pets. But player pets still get stuck places and generally pathe horribly.<br>
<br>
Therefore pretty early on it was established that one shouldn't have a pet up in Hate...and this tradition still lives on.<br>
<br>
Besides...when you already have 40+ people there, you really dont *need* to have a pet up. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usildaardm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SildaarDM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#333333>(3/20/01 10:11:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My thoughts</span><hr size=1> Well my thoughts are, keep an open mind and don't exclude viable options. Yes, many times pets are not a good idea. Pathing is really bad. <br>
<br>
I did Hate last night with my guild and we did a portal breakin. The breakin got a little hairy and the order was given to break out the pets. The mobs were beaten down in no time and life went on. When we moved, the pets died. When it was safe to use pets again, the order was given. Fortunately we had some great raid leaders who understood the value of pets, and their weaknesses. I was a bit concerned when pets were used against Maestro. I kept seeing about 8 pets being fluxed to the ceiling. I was afraid that they would agro the second floor but that didn't happen.<br>
<br>
I understand your frustration, my first Hate raid pets were not allowed, and I felt like a second rate wizard. But you might want to ask that question before you sign up for a raid if you feel that strongly. Personally I go for the fun...and if no pets are allowed then the raid leader better realize that they've just cut my right arm off. <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.owid.com/Sild-sig6.JPG" width="500" height="75">

That pet does do a lot of damage and if there's enough tanks around to taunt it usually manages to survive most of the fight.<br>
<br>
If I do use a regular pet I am usually the only one (I tend to do smallish raids) and let everyone know that I have hotkeyed my earthen boots and will use them if anyone so much as implies my pet is causing a problem or otherwise behaving weird.<br>
<br>
Pets are disposable in my book, no matter how buffed. /pet sit down is also a requirement, but even then sometimes they go wacky and it only takes one glance away from the monitor in a 6+hour raid to cause a TPW and much (deserved) hassle from the other raiders.<br>

<br>
When I go to Hate without my pet, I'm not having fun.  I'm ineffective.  A poor excuse for a (much) lower level wizard.  If you're not allowing pets, why bring a mage?  Bring another warrior.  Hell, at least he may see some Indicolite drop.  In 3 Hate raids I've only seen 1 piece of Apothic drop, because the Revs are too deep, and by the time you get to them everyone (mages included) want to go to bed.  But that's another matter.<br>
<br>
Can it not be argued that a Mage without their pet is the weakest class in the game?  We contribute the least.<br>
<br>
What frustrates me is that others dictate to us how we can play our class.  This is wrong.  We know how to control our pets.  The raid leader had a bad experience in Blackburrow, and now he won't raid with pets.  But the worst part is we follow him.  We accept his ignorance of our class, our pets, and our effectiveness, and follow for the lure of Apothic.<br>

I've been on many Hate raids, successfully led one myself already, leading my second in the new Hate on April 8th.<br>
<br>
Will I allow pets? Only for the new boss mobs, and 'Stro.  Why?  because I don't want ANYONE to end up having to put up with the crap from the rest of the raid if ANYTHING bad happens and is PERCEIVED to have been caused by the pet.  Also, being a mage myself, a LOT of mages don't know proper control of their pets (i.e. to keep from breaking mezzes, etc).  I'm sorry, you may say you can do it, but until you PROVE to me, and I can TRUST you, I wouldn't let you.<br>
<br>
Also, since it's someone elses raid, you have the option of going or not going, and abiding by THEIR rules.  If you wanna do a riad that allows pets, and they don't want to come, more power to them.  It's your raid.<br>
<br>
People need to learn that when on someone elses raid, you're agreeing to abide by their rules (be they posted on a message board at signup, being told in /ooc, /shout, whatever, etc).  You have NO RIGHT AT ALL to complain if they say no pets.  Go up, do what you can do, and be happy to be there.  Opposite is true when you run a raid and say &quot;We'll gladly allow you Enchanters, Mages, Druids, Shaman, Necros, etc. use your pets, you're responsible for them.&quot;  If you tell people at sign up for your raid those are the rules, and they still wanna come, that's their decision.  But I, personally, wouldn't want to risk OTHERS lives because of some fubar pathing problem, gfluxing to second floor and pet bringing back the whole thing before you can invis, etc.  Have some respect for those people too.  Things happen, we all don't blame them, but until Verant fixes the problems inherent with pets in general (pathing being the biggest), you MUSt understand people's trepidation.<br>

Except, how the f*ck are you going to prove it if you don't allow it in the first place? That is the entire problem in a nutshell. The percieved image is 'pets=train=CR'. And thats a load of bs. More trains are causing by rogues(scouts), people agroing stuff through walls/ceilings, and just plain bad pulls. <br>
<br>
Mages and necros should be allowed pets when camp is established. No other 'pet' class should, as they have other responsibilities(that shaman trying to slow the mob should NOT have a pet up).<br>
<br>
Before I pop a pet, I ask the lead enchanter. If they are alright, then I inform the raid leader. Pets don't do enough to warrant it? Sure, tell that to the spite golem that was kept busy by 2 mage pets, or that cleric that didn't get off 5 CHeals because of stuns. <br>
<br>
I think its a shame that fellow mages willingly go along with the 'no pet' rule. Because the next generation of mages see that and figure its true. <p><html>

<br>
And Meneldil, I already do other things (since I'm so ineffective offensively).  I make sure I'm the monk's supplier.  Woohoo.  And the DS the mobs have is the wizard DS, not mage, so it's a joke.  Annuling will frequently dispell one of the debuffs someone slapped on the mob and piss them off.  And that debuff is more important than dispelling the weak DS.  Doing other things can be fun, but for 8-12 hours?  On every raid?  Remember, since you're dead weight, odds are your group never gets the xp, either.  Yes, Hate is about loot not xp, but xp is nice every now and then.<br>
<br>
Marthisdil, you're right.  It's their raid; I must abide by their rules.  However, since they do not respect mages, do you think they post NO PETS on the signup board?  Of course not.  I don't find that out until after I've spent 2 hours waiting in SRo, and another hour or two waiting for the break-in to finish.  Only THEN am I told, via shout, NO PETS.  I just wasted 4 hours because mages are overlooked.  Gee, maybe we're overlooked because we suck?  Maybe we suck because we don't have any pets?  Now I get to look forward to spending the rest of the night as a poor excuse for a wizard, just dead weight really.  How fun.  I can't even leave lest I look like an @#%$.<br>
<br>
And the plot thickens Marthisdil.  I mentioned the upcoming Hate raid.  It's being organized by MY guild.  Yet still, my own guild will not let me have my pet.  My own guild.  It’s not that they don’t trust me, they don’t trust mages.  To make it even more interesting, it's being organized by my GF, who sits not 10 feet away from me when we play EQ.  Because so many cowardly, ignorant fools have said they won't go if pets are allowed, she has not choice but to prohibit pets on the raid.  I suppose the upside is that this time I know it in advance.<br>
<br>
Marthisdil, I'm very disappointed that you continue to promote the false rumor that pets in Hate (at the safe wall) are bad.  People such as yourself are the very reason we have this problem to begin with.  BTW, if feel that way, don't bother summoning them for the mini-bosses either.  They're not much tougher than the regular mobs, just more hps and hit a little harder.<br>

I understand your frustration my friend as I have been there numerous times.  The last Hate raid I was on happened to be with that lvl 55 Mage in your guild that you referred to.  We were the only two Mages there for most of the night and yes ... we were not allowed to use pets.  As a matter of fact, it was never even brought up until I asked the raid leader.  Being that it was a guild raid that I'm not a member of (thus feeling like a guest on their raid) I didn't say anything about it.<br>
<br>
The only time pets we're allowed was against Maestro which was for a whole 5 minutes of the 8 hours we were there.  I too feel I have solid pet control, but even I screw up sometimes ... and as a guest on a raid in a place notorious for horrible pathing, I chose that not having a pet was better.  Only because I would feel horribly if I caused a train that led to a TPW on a raid where I know maybe 10% of the players personally.  Yes I felt like a second rate Wizard ... yes I felt like a Mod Rod dispenser but I still had a good time and made the best of it.<br>
<br>
I strongly feel though Bala, that since it is a &quot;Guild Raid&quot; that you are talking about here, then your guild should allow you to have a shot and prove them wrong.  Sure, getting a bunch of your guildmates killed isn't a great thing, but at least it's people you are close to (at least I hope) and they would (or should) understand and simply say &quot;ok .. you had your shot bud and we had a wipe out presumeably because of your pet ... no more pets tonight ok?&quot;.  And that would be it.  I think hanging you out to twist in the wind before you even have a chance to prove yourself is not very fair nor respectful.  Good luck friend and hang in there.<br>

The problem is when your group is on the wall you must park your pet with guard here no the upper part of wall but not at top. If you leave your pet on follow mode and go to the very top of wall, there are pathing problems. And usually you always need to move upon the wall, to give mod rods or such things, so, as almost anywhere, /pet follow me mode is really not an option.<br>
<br>
 In such cases you usually fight mobs on the ground. For various reasons, you must not send your pet on attack directly from the  wall to the ground :<br>
 - when you're on wall, you might not be sure that the main assist has targeted the correct mob, and it always happen from time to time to have chainpuller targeting a wrong mob for some time, as mouse strafing or clicking on the ground can select some mob far away.<br>
 - if your pet is not guarding directly above the place where the chainpuller is (if the chainpuller is somewhat on the left for instance), sending the pet on attack might cause aggro by bad pathing.<br>
<br>
 So you need to put your pet on follow mode, and move slowly to the ground near the chainpuller while keeping your pet in tight range, then send your pet on attack. This means after the fight you will need to bring him up again somewhere not far from the top of the wall and make him guard again.<br>
<br>
 So provided you're in charge either of annul or of malosi, you migth as well forget using a pet. Even if you're not, it's pretty much boring to use one on wall.<br>
<br>
Once the camp is set on the ground, though, either on the ground near wall or in maestro hall, there is no reason for not using a pet. The only thing for maestro hall is that the camp must be set in  front of the throne far from walls, and the pulls must be made to the opposite wall (the one that the throne faces) the throne room. That will avoid any pathing problems.<br>
<br>
 I don't know how PoH is now, but pre changes, most non very experienced guilds would stay on the wall for a long time, while more experienced ones would fight on ground from the very beginning, thus allowing pets.<br>
<br>
 And don't be too upset if your raidleader or your guildmates don't let you use a pet anywhere in PoH. Mages are still very useful without pets, with best damage shields, mod rods, CoH at 55, annul magic, etc.. Discuss it quietly with the raidleader once the raid is over if you think pets should have been allowed when they were not. He might allow them next time.<br>

What really bothered me was someone saying earlier without a pet we are completely useless in Hate. This just is not true. With clarity 2 on I usually have the mana to cast thrice shock of swords for 1800 damage (haven't gone up since getting Char), I also DS all tanks in my group, do malosi/annul duty, and drop mod rods to the clerics who need them. I would say if you let yourself do it, you are the busiest mofo on the raid. Most hate raids i go on are all single pulls, so chanters are just clarity/speed bitches. So just have that clarity-bitch make sure you have that C2 on at all times to ensure maximum fun.<br>

<br>
I've been through 56 levels so far, been on many a raid where pets weren't allowed.  YOU are selling yourself short in stating that without our pets, we're poor mans Wizzies.  If that's the way you feel about yourself, that's fine.  if other people feel that way about mages, there's not a lot you can do about it - find others that think like you do and start your OWN guild.  Run your OWN raids.  By gods man, YOU are the one rolling over and getting upset because they take away our pets (by request of course).  BTW - if you don't like going to Hate because you can't use your pet, there's plenty of other places where you can.  Apothic isn't all that - you can do the Kael/Thurgadin quests and get the same/better pieces.  In PoG, I see that pets are accepted a bit more - mainly because pathing isn't as bad.  What else do you need from hate?  The earth staff....Well, to get that, run your own raid with your own rules to get it, then don't go back...sheesh<br>
<br>
Don't try and tell me that *I* am the reason people don't let us use them and assume it's people like me that keep giving people these perceptions you and everyone else sees.  People make their own opinions.  I can count too many things that a pet can do to make things go BAD over such very little benefit, it's not even funny, in a planar raid situation.<br>
<br>
And please, don't pull the holier than thou crap on me - you're no better than me, or a plethora of other mages out there that preach that we can all control our pets perfectly, etc.<br>
