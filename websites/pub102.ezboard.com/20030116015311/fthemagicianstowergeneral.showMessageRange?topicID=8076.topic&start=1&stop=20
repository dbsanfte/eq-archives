<br>
Even though my roots trace back to a MUDD called Armageddon (RP, hard-core PvP), I generally find myself not interested in duelling anyone.  That is, until about a week ago.  We have a wise-cracking rogue (good in-game friend) who is always duelling people.  Very competent player but I don't think he understood the capabilities of the mage.  At any rate, he continued to challenge me until I accepted.<br>
<br>
Him:  lvl 51 rogue, epic<br>
Me:  lvl 49 mage with focused water pet (armor, dagger x2, BOIII, shield of lava [heh, he didn't know I cast a DS on my pet])<br>
<br>
Really wasn't much of a contest.  I sent my pet to attack, I ran up and angled  surface and then levitated out in the middle of space.  Malisement stuck, then SoS.  Between that and the sick damage output of my pet it was over pretty quick.  I actually kind of felt bad.<br>
<br>
Anyone have similar or other entertaining stories? <br>

This actually just happened a couple weeks ago.....<br>
<br>
I was running to OT to transfer some peridots to my Girlfriends cleric twink when a loud mouth lvl 63 SK turns up in zone talking mad crap to a bunch of newbies about how uber he was.  He admited openly in /ooc he had never even BEEN to ToV but he was uber because he was lvl 63 and could easily school any one in the zone, a real bold statement in a zone full of lvl 30-40 people when you are lvl 63.  By the time I made it from PoP book at the outpost to the SF ramp where I transferred the peridots he had me annoyed enough (insulting my GF in /ooc calling her childish names had a lot to do with it) I asked in /ooc to please just leave the newbies alone.<br>
<br>
Of course being an oober dood he says duel me or shut up, and that a 63 SK could wipe the floor with a 61 Mage.  So, I decide I would see what I could do to teach the guy a lesson, I had lost a duel to a lvl 62 SK when PoP first launched so I was a bit worried, but I agreed to meet him at FM zone any way.<br>
<br>
At SF ramp I waited long enough to bind (some thing I had not done in my previous SK duel), make an Epic pet, equip him with the summoned belt, blades, armor, focus items (for the HP) and a mask, and headed for the FM zone.  When I arrived he greeted me with a /rude and a /duel.  I paused long enough to toss a BO4 on the pet, then got him in target window, began casting gate and at about 1 bub left I accepted his duel and finished my gate.  As soon as I popped at SF ramp I hit pet attack and high tailed it to FM zone.<br>
<br>
He thought at first I had used a shadowstep of some sort I guess because he spent some time looking for me, my pet was beating on him the whole time.  Eventually he gave up on looking for me and turned on the Epic pet, by now the SK was at about 60% life.  He dumped a HT on the pet which took the pet to about half.<br>
<br>
  Right about then I reached FM zone, sat back at max range with an extended range III focus tossed an annul then a malosini on him, then chain fired Firebolt of Talon with the 61 focus items and SCF2, I even managed to land 2 crits on him (/rude reduced PvP nukes).  In all this time he never saw where I was and couldnt afford to look for me with the pet there beating on him.  When I finally killed him (yeah I ignored his pathetic crys in /ooc to back off the pet, jerks like that get NO pity from me) my Epic was at about 30% life.<br>
<br>
The best part for me (besides watching him try to fool my pet with a FD, ROFL!!!!) was the laughter of all the newbies in the zone when it broadcast he had been defeated and they all shouted congratulations to me.  I have to say, most higher level people are decent enough, but every once in a while you get one that just doesnt get it.<br>
<br>
I am glad I lost the duel earlier to the SK, it showed me what to expect of an SK, I havent dueled on in a very long time and I had no idea how deadly they could be at higher levels.  Of course the fact that this guy was a moron helped too I am sure, LOL. <p><!--EZCODE HR START--><hr /><!--EZCODE HR END--><br>

Levitate and gain height off walls / slopes because PC chars dont have that unlimited vertical attack range that NPC's do..<br>
<br>
Bind a ways off and gate to force them to deal with pet while you come back in for artillery practice.<br>

<br>
Also make sure to buy a wand of swords (3 charge instant click shock of swords (lv 44 nuke)) and a wand of lava (4 charges instant click shield of lava). Those can be a lifesaver anytime, let alone in a duel. - They strip ds buff from pet, put it right back :P The lava wands average around 50 pp on E.Marr, swords wand is rare to see in the bazaar though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I also keep a ball of yarn (5 charges of snare - StoneBrunt Mtns quest) and Crystalline Silk Nets (2 charge root, 2 sec cast time) on me at all times.<br>

my most fun duel was against a 60 rog when i was 57. Was in SF waiting for ragefire so...yeah, we were bored. I bound up behind that one hill to the right, and we started. She kicked my butt at first because i couldn't see her with see invis,m but when i gated, she was lost.

She constantly picks on me (in roleplay), calling me &quot;Darkelf Trash&quot;, and &quot;that little blue slut&quot;.  One day things were being discussed in our little circle of friends chat channel and I made a suggestion on a way she could succeed in whatever she was having problems with.  She made some offhand comment about taking advice from a &quot;Stupid Darkelf&quot;.  I, ofcourse, pointed out the fact that atleast Innoruuk lived in a city like a normal person, instead of cowering up a tree like a diseased mutant squirle.  She (then 42) challenged me (then 3<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  to a duel in EC.  I told her I would be waiting.<br>
<br>
When she shows up, I tell her I am ready.  She asks me where my pet was.  It was then that I showed her that for my pet I had chosen a summoned Bixie (summon moster I).  She laughed and asked whatever I would want with that.  I told her &quot;This way, when the last thing you see is me laughing over your corpse, you'll know it wasnt the equiptment, or better spells.  You'll know it was because you suck and Innoruuk is supreme!!&quot;.<br>
<br>
We dueled.  Figuring she would start off with a big nuke right out the gate, I started with a lower level nuke that had knockback to interupt hers and then followed with my big nuke.  The pet kept interupting her spells as well.  At the end, she was dead (death by bixie), I was at full health and half mana, and pet was at 89% health.<br>
<br>
She, ofcourse wanted a rematch.<br>
<br>
She came back, cast wolf form, and buffed herself.  Then she charmed a Puma and buffed it up to be &quot;her pet&quot;.  I noticed right before we dueled, the charm broke and she had to re-charm it.<br>
<br>
Round two..  I Cancel Magic'd her pet which broke charm so it attacked her with all its buffs, and attacked her with my bixie.  I then chain cast Cancel Magic on her until I saw her loose wolf form and knew she was totally debuffed.  I then sat down to med.  She had to melee her own pet to death because my pet was interupting her spells.  When I saw her at two bubbles of life I stood and started nuking.  She only go t 2 spells off that I didn't resist, both of them dots.  She died, pet was at half health, and I was at 4 bubbles of health.<br>
<br>
She has not challenged me to a duel or insulted me since.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, yes I am the Bixie queen.&quot;<br>

<br>
I used to hang out in TD quite a bit after getting my epic doing the raptor isles for solo xp for short sessions at a time.<br>
<br>
The very first time I went to TD to check it out, I managed to find the large isle.  All spawns were up and nobody around.<br>
<br>
I starting killing one...then another..then this /ooc 'large camped, leave now!'<br>
<br>
I /ooc back that I was looking for a place to hunt and that I would gladly hunt somewhere else if you'd tell me where.  The reply? /ooc 'large camped, leave now!'<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, a raptor JUMPS me so pettums jumps on it.  Then the /tells start 'I'm petitioning, leave now'.<br>
<br>
Next thing you know, this dr00d wanders over and I get challenged to a duel.<br>
<br>
I politely explain that I've never been here and would like to know where to hunt (all they had to do was show me the small isle next door).  I ALSO explain that mobs are FFA and SOE doesn't support camps of any kind and that the petition would get nowhere unless I was KSing them.<br>
<br>
Well, the dr00d cursed and immediately went off and starting kiting 2 raptors...hmm...forgot to camp out the duel, eh?<br>
<br>
/dual accepted<br>
<br>
This poor dr00d is running around with 2 kited raptors AND my fully buffed epic pet wailin away on him.  Both pet and I resist all of his casts and I nuke the dr00d to Kingdom Come.<br>
<br>
I have always hated those self-centered power-trippin dr00ds (not druids, mind you) who think that all mobs and real estate are for their kiting pleasure.  That /duel was a moment I still savor to this day.<br>
<br>
Bring it on dr00ds... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=411018&amp;resize=true&quot;" target="_new">Talusini Petuccini</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arch Mage - Master of the Elements<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pbf.mightye.org?&amp;resize=true&quot;" target="_new">Peace by Force</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Tunare</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fashionmagician>FashionMagician</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://mywebpages.comcast.net/wirezend/Zress/AniPortal.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(12/6/02 3:29:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8076.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: BIXIE INCOMING!!!</span><hr size=1> OMG.. you sneaky devil you =)   ROFL.<br>

3 to talk about really.<br>
<br>
#1 was kinda funny, had a arena battle goin on for my guild, ended up facing another druid 1 lvl higher than me. if you ever watch druids duel it's kinda funny. we both died at the exact same time 20 seconds after the duel started, cast the exact same spells except one each.<br>
<br>
#2 was vs a ranger who liked to talk @#%$ with his bow though he was 5 lvls lower than me. so we dueled, and i stood foot in wall while he blew trueshot, and proceeded to root and dot him with my epic and bracer, and my largest dot. i had spent about 350 mana, and he's healing himself frantically. then he got CHed a few times, so i nuked him dead in less than 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
#3 would definatly hafta be a mage, who was 60 with me at the same time and talking crap. he didn't have epic, and pulled out a pet. i ended up blinding it outa the arena and dotting him, then healing myself faster than he could kill me. dot took him 75% down and then i nuked him once dead as his pet was finally runnin back at me <p>Venerable Jentriken Aspenbark - Permanently Retired<br>

We were both already a bit buffed at the time of the duel and I already had a 59 air pet out.  It was an epic struggle.<br>
<br>
We started the duel and I sent my pet and started casting Annul to get rid of his Ageo.  He ignored my pet and got to me before the cast time and interrupted the Anul.  I also had Ageo and stood toe to toe letting him beat on the 33pt DS while I tried to channel through his bashes.  I got Mala to stick after a few interrupts, called that good for the moment and started kiting him, by then I was at 40% health.  The pet was beating happily on him from behind but not really landing enough stuns to let me get any distance to cast.  Both people with Run 3 make for a pretty even &quot;kite&quot;.<br>
<br>
Here is where the adversity kicks in.  I was grouped at the time and one of the people in my group happened to be a bard.  While kiting I got within song range and he was playing one of his travel songs with an invis component.  /em waves bye bye to pet.<br>
<br>
Uh oh, I now had no pet and a large angry ogre bearing down on me.  Luckily the terrain (we were in Oasis at the time) helped.  I was able to cut back and forth over dunes and change direction enough to actually lose him completely for a time.  I got out a new pet, but of course buffs wouldn't stick in /duel mode.<br>
<br>
From there, it was basically just a long hide and seek game.  I couldn't survive long in melee range and he couldn't survive within casting range without being in melee range and we both knew it.  We would lose each other in the dunes.  I would find him and get in a nuke or two before he got into melee range or he would find me and pounce on me from over a dune.  Sadly, without velocity the new pet couldn't keep up well and was hardly a factor.  In the end, he won with about 2% of his hps left and I was not happy with the bard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=103898" target="top">Baron Evelle Fyrestrike</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

So I told him we'll both summon mod rods and beat the crap out of each other and I'll be the last one standing because I'm a human. Now since my 1hb was pretty bad and his was even worse it took a long time but after about 10 min he was down to his last bubble of health and I was down less than half a bubble. He managed to get a lavashield off as he hit around 10% health so I ended up at about 30% health when I finished beating the tar outta him.
