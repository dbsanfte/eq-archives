<br>
I've been thinking one of the big problems with getting our crown: getting to the 7th isle and staying long enough to clear it enough times for everyone to get one.  I'm currently saving for my crown, but would rather get it myself.<br>
<br>
I devised a plan which if executed should allow mages on your server to get their crown anytime they can muster the force to clear the 7th isle (2 - 3 groups).  This uses the standard summon corpse bridge used in so may sky raids to create an &quot;anchor&quot;.  So any raid can skip all the way to the 7th isle any time the anchor is available.<br>
<br>
This plan involves getting access to a  planes capable toon which can summon corpse (51 SK, 46 necro) and another which can revive (46 paladin or cleric).  Summon corpse toon should be bound in the bazaar.  You need exclusive access to these two toons for a few weeks at least, hopefully forever.  A small coffin corpse summoner isn't really necessary since you can always bring one later.  If you are able to camp a small coffin corpse summoner then use the appropriate sized coffins in the appropriate steps.<br>
<br>
This plan has two parts:<br>
<br>
PART I - Parking the toons<br>
<br>
Required:<br>
- 2 sky stones<br>
- 4 large coffins<br>
- 4 small coffins<br>
- A donation (optional)<br>
- Mage summoned chokers (optional) - Saves on coffins/sky stones<br>
<br>
Its a good idea to have both toons have at least one of each coffin.  Who holds the extras doesn't matter (they aren't for your use anyway)<br>
<br>
Get someone to park both toons on the first isle at anytime using your first sky stone.  Camp them and log them in periodically until you find people on the 7th island with 2 clerics, 1 wizard and a summon corpse capable toon who has at least one coffin of the appropriate type on them already.  This may take a while.<br>
<br>
Have the wizard invite 1st cleric (cleric1) and summoner into the group.  Have the wizard and cleric1 stay close together, summoner move out of port range.  Wizard casts Alter: Plane of Sky to port back to zone in.  <br>
<br>
Have wizard group your two toons.  Hand wizard a sky stone to replace the one he just used.  Duel and revive any characters going to the 7th isle.  That could be all 4 of you, or just two of you if the raid is breaking up and cleric1 and the wizard are going to jump anyway.  Don't duel close to any mobs.  The Efreeti in the quest room and Sirran will &quot;assist&quot; people being attacked.<br>
<br>
Give each character being summoned the appropriate sized coffin.  Since you don't know when first porting up what kind of summoner will be available you have 4 of both kinds.  Have necro summon each person, and cleric2 revive them again.  As each person arrives, hand the coffin to their summoner to replace the one it just used.<br>
<br>
Now would be the time to give your donation.  You are now ready to camp and come back and restart the 7th isle anytime you want.  Just make sure you know if/when your helpers are leaving so you don't butt heads.  They may be staying for another clearing.<br>
<br>
PART II - Restarting your raid<br>
<br>
Arrange before hand to have the wizard of the raid be in the bazaar with one coffin for your summoner to use.  This will allow your summoner to bring up his summoner (hopefully a small coffin summoner).  Being in the Bazaar, you can bank any fees.  Have the wizard invite your summoner into his group.  Your rezzer now revives your summoner and is back in sky on the 7th isle.  During this operation have the rezzer watch the corpse.  If its going to expire soon (it expires in several minutes from a duel) rez back the summoner and try again if necessary.<br>
<br>
*WARNING* The time the summoner spends not on the PoA is the one time that you could totally mess up your setup.  If for some reason the summoner can't be rezed back before the corpse expires, he'll have to pay to get back into Sky, summon his own corpse and wait until the next sky raid to get back on to the 7th island.<br>
<br>
Okay, so now you have a wizard who is the leader of a group.  Your summoner is back on the 7th isle.  If anyone goes LD, its not a problem, just repeat the previous step.  Have the wizard invite their summoner into the group.  Have their summoner duel, be rezzed to produce a corpse.  Your summoner summons theirs and your rezzer revives them.<br>
<br>
Next up is their rezzer.  Once their rezzer and their summoner is on the island you are done.  Both of your toons can disband and camp.  If you are going to bring up a raid yourself always make sure you don't operate at a coffin deficit.  Each extra summon/rez you do that person should have a coffin of the appropriate size on them.<br>
<br>
Even if you end up being the main summoner, as soon as you can you camp.  Although the island is non-agro better safe than sorry.  As long as you have access to those two characters you can do this as often as you like.  The cost of bringing up a raid isn't too bad.  They only use as many coffins as they have people plus as many sky stones they need to port themselves up, plus any fees you may charge.<br>
<br>
If you need to switch out toons:<br>
Have your summoner do the duel, get invited by wizard, get coffin, get rez thing.  Then wizard can port up the replacement, along with a rezzer, duel, rez, summon, rez the replacement.  Everyone else jumps off.  Cost 1 sky stone, 1 coffin.<br>
<br>
Make sure anyone using reagents uses a mage summoned choker.  Nothing like saving money on a sky stone or coffin.<br>
<br>
I think every mage community on every server should have this setup.<br>
<br>
I'm working to set it up on Tarew Marr.  I have a 47+ rezzer already.  Just need access to a corpse summoner. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uizarek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izarek</A> at: 7/17/02 4:52:02 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/02 4:33:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Restarting a 7th isle Plane of Sky raid at any time</span><hr size=1> Duh.

- Exact costs of setup<br>
- The minimal amount of people and resources needed.<br>
- Beyond the cost of the setup, raids incur no costs to the &quot;anchor&quot;<br>
<br>
Its also a suggestion to the whole mage community we can piggyback on one sky raid and turn it into an infinite number of raids at the cost of a few k for each one.  Remove the bottleneck.   This &quot;final piece&quot; of our epic will be a 2 hour effort instead of a 3 day test of patience for you and every single one of your friends.<br>

Most of the islands are.<br>
<br>
Guilds usually reserve it for 2-3 days at a time.  Everquest Raids is a good place to do it.  It would be polite to reserve a time.  You might just note that you are just doing 7th island.<br>
<br>
Also if a guild is starting their Sky raid the same time you are on the 7th island, its not likely to be a problem.  It takes 2-3 days to get there anyway.<br>
<br>
Also clearing the 7th island isn't likely to cause a problem for people.  If you haven't done the previous island and spawned the big bad mob on this island, you won't be able to spawn Sirran.  That would be the one thing that could screw up an existing raid because if Sirran is spawned on one island he can't be spawned on another.  But the way the 7th island is done its not possible if you just port up to 7th island.<br>
<br>
People park toons up there for crown farming all the time.  I'm just outlining how you would go about doing it so perhaps all mages can get their crown without paying 60k.  You don't have to be an uber guild to do this.  Just find a guild to help you park people up there for a long time <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Drake Island is 24 hour spawn time.<br>
<br>
An alternative to the necro bridge strategy is upon making it to island 7, one necro leaves a corpse up there with all keys on it.  After raid is over they head back up to air and summon corpse to Island 1.  Once per week, necro heads up to air, loots corpse and dies again.  This keep a corpse with all 7 keys on island 1 ready to go.<br>
<br>
To start raid, necro runs up through the islands, getting to Island 7.  Given how few islands have agro, and how few mobs see invis this run is fairly quick and easy.<br>
<br>
Once on island 7, they summon their group members using the normal duel, die, revive method.  If you don't have a pally, cleric alt to do the first summons you can even use a soul crystal.<br>
<br>
Advantage to this is you can keep your bridge open, for as long as you want without keeping alts stuck in Air forever.<br>

Izarek, Rordin's Everquest Raids site is NOT a reservation system.  It's just a tool to organize your raiding party.  On some servers (mine included, Bristlebane) most people don't even look at Rordins. <p><img src=http://home.sc.rr.com/kimmisc/TelVol.jpg></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uizarek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Izarek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 125<br> <font color=#333333>(7/18/02 4:57:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Restarting a 7th isle Plane of Sky raid at any time</span><hr size=1> Using a necro corpse strategy is kinda cool.

<br>
- You have to attend a sky raid and be there for the entire raid.  One of the reasons I suggested this strategy is that I will not likely attend a full sky raid ever again.  I don't have the fiance faction to spend 4 days straight (plus time for additional clearings)<br>
- Everytime you want to refresh your corpse you burn a sky stone.  Not a big deal.  But it is a recurring cost every week.<br>
- You don't know if someone else recently appeared and cleared the 7th island without burning a coffin (if you hadn't summoned it recently) and a skystone.  You could bring along a tracker friend probably to check.<br>
- Although I'm not entirely sure, why on the last sky raid I went on, when our wizard jumped off one of the islands naked (woohoo), when she came back and looted her corpse her keys were gone.  That could have been caused by her casting the sky port to get back up instead of jumping off, I don't know.<br>
- You burn an essense emerald everytime you restart a raid.  Again, not a big deal since you can get one before hand.<br>
- Your big risk is forgetting your corpse and it rots.  You need to do a while raid again to reestablish this strategy.<br>
<br>
Of course there are drawbacks to my strategy:<br>
- You burn two alts.  46 necro and 46 pally/cleric aren't trivial.  This is huge (as I'm finding)<br>
- You depend on finding a sky raid that reaches the 7th isle.  This could take a while.<br>
- The upfront costs are much higher, although the long term costs are non existant, and restart costs are also non-existant (beyond the normal summoning you don't need anything to restart the chain)<br>
- Your biggest risk is not rezzing the duel corpse in time.<br>
<br>
There are always multiple approaches to things in the game.  I'm glad we are talking about it.  There are non-brute force ways to do our epics.  MQ and camped alts (or necro corpses with keys) are viable tools for doing our epic.<br>

I'm sure you are right.  I guess that's why more people are making their raids on Everquest Raids private.  At least on Tarew Marr.<br>
<br>
If its FCFS there should be no issue with popping up there anytime you want to farm crowns.  If you are on a server which seems to use a reservation site, then its only common decency.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is with alts parked up there you can restart the raid when you feel its appropriate (anytime, according to some raid calendar, when you want to screw another raid, etc)<br>

With 2 people you need Necro with res crystal and someone to jump.<br>
<br>
Done it both ways and your right, its much better to have the alts parked up there, however, if your guild doesnt have 3 alts to burn.  The necro run strategy requires no alts (1 Res type alt on Drake island if you dont want to burn the crystal).  However, as you say it does require a necro main that doesnt screw up and forget to go up and refresh his corpse. <p>Cereberial Cortex<BR>Illusionist<BR>Desperate Measures<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwoonx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>woonx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(7/18/02 7:58:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=104.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Restarting a 7th isle Plane of Sky raid at any time</span><hr size=1> Simpler way i see it once you can get let's say a necro and cleric twinks up there.

<br>
That's not true.  You only need two, and no jumping required:<br>
<br>
Necro and rezer duel, necro loses, goes to bind point where a wizard (or actually any character who is going to be the leader of the group, wizard is logical choice) is waiting to invite you and give you the one coffin you need to invite the raid necro.  The wizard is the third character to lead, but doesn't need to be in sky.<br>
<br>
The necro gets rezzed (since it was a duel, revive will suffice so a 46 cleric or pally is enough) and is back up in Drake island.  The wizard is the leader of the group and can port people up to the 1st island.  Cleric goes with him as part of the first group so they can revive dueled bodies on 1st island to be summoned.  2 people only.  No extra ingredients other than what the raid porting up needs.<br>
<br>
Having someone jump off has drawbacks:<br>
- Requires 2 people with essence emerald, or 3 people without everytime a raid is restarted, plus 1 more coffin than the rest of the raid needs to get the jumper back to drake island.  Mine uses exactly as many coffins as there are people coming to the raid, not including the 2 alts.  Both scenarios burn a port up slot (1/6th of a sky stone as it were) on the initial port up.<br>
- For the 2 person jumper strategy you require a 53 necro.  Mine only takes a 46 necro or 51 SK and a 46 cleric or paladin.<br>
- A much higher risk of screwing up the setup.  When jumping off all it takes is the jumper or the necro going LD to screw the whole thing.  Since the jumper zones twice that could easily happen.  My strategy can only get screwed up if the necro or rezzer go LD for several minutes after the first duel and the corpse timer of the necro expires.  If anyone goes LD during the bridge, you just repeat the process.<br>
<br>
There are a few ways to handle getting your sky crown for your epic.  My strategy fits my needs because:<br>
- I don't have to do a sky raid myself, just piggyback onto an existing one before it breaks up.<br>
- I can get my mage crown by hunting for it without putting any friends or guildies (or myself) through any pain or suffering.  By burning two alts (which true can be significant) I can turn a mages biggest nightmare (right Nahualli? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ) into a quickie 2 - 3 hour raid whenever I can get people willing to go.<br>
- Its low risk of screwing up my setup.<br>
- It costs nothing to maintain (unless your alts are on seperate accounts you bought <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>

Apparently /qing out while you're in the loot mode of a corpse will bug the rez timer, so you can be rezzed until the corpse poofs~ <p>Draogan
