I'm one yellow from 52 and every time I try to compare the 51 earth pet with either the 49 pet or the MSII pet, it just comes up short. Why spend the extra 100 mana on the pet that isn't as good as a MSII pet(the one that casts the self-DS)? It seems like a joke.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this is the beginning of uneven scaling of pet power? Pets after level 49 just get *slighty* better while MOBs get harder and harder, I'm guessing.<br>
<br>
To be honest I haven't tested the pets against many mobs so my conclusion has shaky ground. I just wanted to see what my fellow mages thought about this issue.

<br>
You're right, the different between the 49 and 51 Earth pet isn't vast, but then it's not supposed to be. The jump is small. However, when you hit 57 and get that Earth pet, the jump is very large, and rightfully so, seeing as how it was 6 levels since you got your last one of that kind.<br>
<br>
However, there are some differences between the 49 and 51 Earth pet that make the 51 better overall. Just use it more, you'll see. <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller

The lvl 49 pets and the lvl 50 MSII pet all hit for a max of 56.  Now, the 51 earth costs 300 mana, the 49 pets and 50 MSII all cost 200 mana.  The 51 earth has more hps, hits harder and has a root that does damage...... BUt not 1/3 more powerful then the others I have talked about.  Really, for soloing, chain casting, type of situtations you would be crazy to go with the earth.  The earth will not last 1/3 longer then the 50 MSII pet.  The lvl 50 MSII pet has the hps of a lvl 49 earth, sometimes has the ds of a lvl 49 fire, and seems to have a higher natural ac a little less then the air pet.  The added bonus of having the pet not waste time casting on mobs is also a nice plus to this pet.  Also, with the root of the earth your pet ends up taking more damage when the mob should be fleeing.  This is great for places where a fleeing mob could mean a huge train, but kinda retarded for anywhere else.<br>

<br>
I never chained till 51, and I started with 51.  Its simply too effective not too.  Even a low blue will kill a self DS'ed MS2 pet at 51... and one heal for one half bubble of life eats up your mana difference.  The 52 heal heals a bubble, and costs almost as much mana as the pet.  All the gear you give your pet does not really change anything... two or three hits tops...<br>

I have played a ton and I have played with diffrent variations of pets.  As I said, earth is great when you want the root but when you don't it can kill you.  Also the 100 extra mana when chain sumoning is a lot.  Killing the allizewsaur I needed 5 or 6 pets and barely had enough mana.

I pretty much agree with what Marloon had to say in his first post. As an FYI, my hunting grounds is SF island in OOT. Seafuries are my targets - they run at about 20% health. MSII pets can take 2-3 furies before dying and Voc: Earth pets can take the same amount. HOWEVER, the earth pet roots the furies as they are running so Earth takes a lot more of a beating than the MSII. Yet, the difference isn't that great. I don't think it is worth the extra 100 mana, especially since I am chaining pets when they die, instead of healing.<br>
<br>
I can see the point about how the Voc: Earth pet is only a few levels above the level 49 ones and isn't really supposed to be as much of huge jump upgrade as the 44 -&gt; 49 pets were.

<br>
MS2 pet has almost the same hp as 51 earth, the difference is slim, it also gets hit alot less, and if your lucky enough to get a self DSed one its insane.  As for not being able to tank a light blue thats a crock, i used a self DSed MS2 pet to solo most of levels 51-55 in Lguk vs dark blues, the only mob it couldn't solo let alone destroy was the lord and frenzy.  It would consistently tank 2 or more dark blues with no danger of dropping before i could nuke or heal it.  Just be sure to hand it armor and you'll love MS2. <br>

I am as big a champion as you will find of the MS pets...<br>
<br>
My particular love with them is that I can use them to tie up a mob until it is mezzed... a MS pet cannot break a mez.<br>
<br>
But do explain... when chaining... exactly how it is you have time to summon a new pet and let it Self DS before the MOB is on you?  How do you get your MS pet to Self DS everytime? How much room do you require to get aggro off you and on your pet?  And, how many people do you kill daily with your trains?<br>
<br>
I agree that the MS pet is great in a group, and great for nonchaining... but a non DSed MS is not superior too, or even remotely equal too, a 51 earth... which would seem to preclude chaining. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=243737><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~moghedan/pics/mogtag.jpg border=0></a>

See, first off I don't nuke while I am using the MSII pet. Well I don't nuke with any pet. I pull with my first spell ever given to me, burst of flame.  I then run to my pet and pet it tank.  If it should happen to die then I just cast another one right before it dies and send it in. I do not wait for DS.  DS or not they still have almost the same hitpoints as a earth and get hit less.  Now, my pet takes argo without me every even getting scratched.  Now, where the ds comes in.  What I do is if my pet is lower then 30 health at teh end of a fight, I reclaim it and summon a new one. I then burn out it and go and pull. The time between burnout and when I get back, if it is a dsing one, he should have teh ds up. if not then I cast ds on him.  It's as easy as that.<br>
<br>
 Now when hunting the allizewsaur it was diffrent. I didn't want my pet to take argo from me. so I turned taunt off.  I would cast my pet and send him in untaunting and let the allizewsaur chase me while spamming /pet health. as soon as it started taking damage I would burnout and ds it.  Then wait for a few seconds and then start casting a new pet.<br>
<br>
 BUt now with the 54 water, these things are mute.  I can now take 4 seafuries with ease, since teh water heals so fast while pulling and because he takes them down so much faster when they are running.<br>

Have I had bad pulls sure, who hasn't...gate is your friend.  I have timed an MS2 pet vs the NPC next to zone to IS from Sro.  <br>
<br>
MS2 pets don't always cast their ds, but if you really want one to solo with then its not hard to spend 5 minutes summoning till you get one.  As for chaining I would rather have my 120 mana to help cast my next pet then bother with dsing the pet.  I don't have a free DS robe, or burnout pants, and personally i feel i get more out of the pet by spending the extra 50mana to burnout each one then to ds each one.  Most tanks I know would rather have a high haste/str/ac spell then a 25 point ds.  <br>
<br>
Its really not hard to chain MS2 pets...or other non-earth pets if thats your thing.   Like marloon i pull with a low nuke spell, usually lvl 8 shock.  This generates near zero aggro on me.  As for timing it I begin resummoning when the current pet hits 20 percent health, and when the casting time bar hits the last bulb I simply use the destroy pet command.  IMO anyone who waits for a pet to die (using earth) is taking a foolish risk of root breaking before the new pet is summoned.  With little lag this is not hard to do.<br>

But that is not the point... the point is, beyond the first cast, which might be self DSed, explain how you can possibly see the MS2 pet to be stonger than the 51 earth?  The 53 air and the 50 MS2 hit for the same thing.  Do you also believe the un-DSed to be stronger than 53 Air?<br>
<br>
Beyond that, as long as you aren't hurting anyone with your pulls, I guess you are welcome to do, believe, and play any way you want.

From what I have seen, the pet situation looks like this:<br>
<br>
Level 50+ Earth and Air pets are always better than level 49 Earth and Air pets.<br>
<br>
Level 50+ Fire Pets are different kinds of pets than the level 49 so they are not better in all situations.<br>
<br>
I haven't gotten to fool around with the 50+ water pets yet so I'm assuming from what is written here that the 49 water pet is better if you want a tanking water pet but the 50+ one is better in groups or duoing... whenever you can give your pet access to a mob's backside.<br>
<br>
Does anyone see anything horribly wrong with that summary? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umarloon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Marloon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(10/18/02 12:43:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=755.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Air pet</span><hr size=1>  Well, the air pet from what I have seen is weak.  I hated using him at lvl 53 to solo anything.  The stun is nice but overall he is just not a pet that I feel is worth the 100 extra mana above the lvl 50 MSII pet..  <br>
<br>
 Now, why I say this.  The MSII pet has the hps of a 49 earth pet.  The MSII seems to have a natural ac that is higher then elemental pets.  Although I would imagine that air has roughly the same ac as the MSII pet. Also, the MSII pet does not cast anything.  So while other pets are casting the MSII uses that time and gets another round of melee in.  This could be for as much as 168(this is max is your pet hits for 56 for 3 times. More if he gets a double attack for both hands and a kick in).  Of course with teh air pets stunn the air pet gets some free melee rounds without taking any damage so these pets almost even out except that MSII seems to end a battle with more hps on average then the Air pet.  THe best thing is that the MSII pet only costs 200 mana.<br>
<br>
ANyways, I have talked about pets in another thread so I wont repeat everything.  Use what you like. If you want to lvl using the lvl 4 air pet, go for it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Indeed. Welp, I've been using the 53 air pet on Seafury island and he does very very well. Can take about 4 furies with only a few heals thrown in for good measure. The main point of my latest post was to see if everyone agrees that the level 49 air pet spell really has no use once you get the level 53 one. It seems that way to me. No big deal, I find out as I go along anyway. Just trying to get some info beforehand =)<br>

The 52 Heal spell actually has some effect, and the pet can last as long against a mob as the 51 earth.  Because it has fewer HP, it, of course, regens much faster.<br>
<br>
Using a horse, a WCB,  and a BWS, I can heal the 53 Air every time I reach 100m and keep the pet completely healed while non stop pulling.<br>
<br>
In JPF, using this method, I can get 10% of 53 per hour.  I should break 54 some time tonight. <p><a href= http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=243737><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~moghedan/pics/mogtag.jpg border=0></a>

I'm not talking max, I'm talking the level difference allowing 51 to hit more often overall than the 49 earth pet.<br>
<br>
Chaining pets, where the DS does much of the damage, I use 49 earth.  If I expect the elemental to do most of the damage, I use 51 earth.<br>
<br>
Never got into the habit of using MS2 for anything other than cannipetting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showPrevMessage?topicID=755.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showNextMessage?topicID=755.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=755.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.threadControl?topicID=755.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=755.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=755.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29>Magician Pets</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
