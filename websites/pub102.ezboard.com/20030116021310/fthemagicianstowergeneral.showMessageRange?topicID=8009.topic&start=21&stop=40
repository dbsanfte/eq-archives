We grouped couple of times now and it was blast. Everyone wanted to do it again.<br>
<br>
All 5 epiced mages + shaman<br>
<br>
Four mages had 61 air pet and one had 62 water pet.<br>
We hunted at PoV and PoS.  Mobs drop so fast that puller coudn't keep up with the kills.  Air pet + slow is like &quot;can't touch this.&quot;  Mobs coudn't swing to hit pets because it's always stunned and slowed.  In couple of hours, I gained full level (62 to 63) plus an AA ding.<br>
<br>
If you are from the Seventh Hammer, send me a tell for mage group.  I'm always looking to form one.  I usually send tells to other mages to get to know each other.  I'm surprised that many mages don't know about power of the mage group.  They tend to shy away from it.  It's a shame that they don't know their own power. =(  <br>
<br>
Anyways, in mage group, 61 Air pet rocks.  Think about it... 5 Airpets stunning...  whoa... Epic is a ok addition but tend to get aggro all the time. Plus the procs and stuns don't land well.<br>
<br>
Go and make a mage group! have some fun and make amazing xp.  I hope there are enough mobs out there for ya. =p<br>

not really true, specially if your not in PoP.  inside pop, i have seen badly botted druids keep up. so simply a healer is needed.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Some even go far as to claim that all other group styles are &quot;gimp&quot; and a waste of time. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
as a foundation of 3 people, there is no better group that is capable of working in any environment. That is the key to the trilogy, they work anywhere, anytime.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There is much competition for the role of damage dealer in trinity groups, and usually a surplus of damage dealers. This can be frustrating for the magician, as many players still do not appreciate mage damage output.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
the key to a well played magician is sustaining DPS, while maintaining stratigic resources to deal with emergencies. watching a mage and his pet handle 1 of 3 adds by himself while the second tank and chanter handle the other two is an awesome sight, specially when each of the three is considered a group killer.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Thus pet-centered groups are easier to recruit and easier to sustain than trinity groups. Pet-centered groups have high damage output, and tend to dispatch foes more quickly than trinity groups. And as elementals are the kings of pets, so mages rule pet-centered groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
Pet groups have roughly the same damage output as other groups sustained. epic pets and 61+ pets change this pattern, often out damaging all tank classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Aggro must be carefully managed, for pets almost never take aggro from a player that is within melee range. This is not the best form of pet-centered group, but is acceptable for very small groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I disagree, its dirt simple to control agro in this case, simple stay away from the mob. this is perhaps the easiest pet group for use outside dungeons<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Earth is the simplest and most basic elemental to use in pet-centered groups. Root helps it take, keep, and regain aggro, and elemental root can hold creatures that are otherwise immune to root or snare. The fewer pets and the more aggravating damage dealers there are in the group, the more root will save the day. However, root means that the nearest pet will hold aggro, and other pets generally attack from a closer distance than elementals. Except for warders or charmed creatures, non-elemental pets do not tank well, and will die quickly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
in mixed company, and when an epic or 61+ pet is avalible earth is the LAST choice for a tanking pet.  its root ability is nice, but no where near the power of agro management that the air and epic have through procing stun and DDs. the earth is for tanking, and even then, only when you lack any support classes.  its only real use now is pet cannibalizing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Fire is an acceptable pet at lower levels with not many pets in the group, as its damage shield is quite impressive. However, depending on the pet mix, it may not have aggro, and its damage shield then is wasted. Post-50 fire pets act like NPC wizards, largely casting spells instead of meleeing, and are probably not a good choice. Indeed, most mages are dubious about the post-50 fire pets in general, although they do have their advocates.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
there are many fire pets, and prior to level 55+ mobs, some of them do quite well.  the pets are wizards, and are born with one of three possible spell loadouts.<br>
1. annul, root, stun, cold, fire, magic nukes.<br>
2. root, stun<br>
3. stun<br>
the fire stuns the wizard level 20 spell Tishan's Clash, which is a 5 second stun + 50DD. When you have a cleric in the group, a buffed stun only pet can hold agro as well as an epic, which is fine for low damage, fast hitting mobs. (shrooms in Fungus grove for instance) Its fire shield is only slightly better than a mages. so is mostly saving on pet maintenance.<br>
<br>
the 61+ fire should be avoided, they did not change its spell load out.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Air elementals stun, and where applicable this can be valuable against casters and hard hitting mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Air is by far the best tanking pet post 60, and is slightly better than the epic in most cases.  although not as good at keeping agro, or dealing damage, it does heal on its own much faster (like 3% per tick) as well as enrageing(as do all 61+ pets) enrage is a awesome way for a pet to really punish several adds before it dies, and almost always give the mage 12 seconds to decide what to do. The air pet as main tank is simply the best choice.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Water elementals are another good choice, especially post-50 when they act as rogues and can backstab the enemy. If the group contains a necromancer, you may decide to fear-kite, and the post-50 water elementals are ideal for this. If the group has enough pets and earth elementals can be avoided, post-50 is an excellent choice for killing the mob more quickly when it turns to flee.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
water should only be used in a group with another source of main tank and agro holding.  they do not hold agro at all compared to a epic or air pet. their back stab is a nice DPS upgrade, but if you find its not landing at least 50% of the time, dump it for a diffrent pet.  in a raid, a buffed water pet will out damage real rogues, but in a exp group you are not throwing raid level buffs on to enable this DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Epic is an awesome pet, especially pre-60. A pet-centered group with multiple epics is a sight to behold. The epic has high damage output, stuns, and an innate damage shield. If root is not necessary, the epic is almost always the best choice if available. Its only downside in these groups is that it is more costly and time consuming to replace the epic. Against high DPS mobs, it may be a good idea for the epic mage to memorize a second pet, just in case.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
outside of 61+ pets, the epic is bar none the best. its often overlooked proc is 141cold based damage, a class of damage mages do not get, also its casted stun+DD simply add punishment to the mix.  there is no pet that can hold agro better except, perhaps a pure stun fire pet.  the obvious advantages of the epic make the fire not even an option. Epic chaining is not advised, it is much betterto fully equip the epic, and find target it can kill with a single bar of health.  long term you will find your kill rate remains constant.  it is best to couple the epic with any form of healing, and let the mage himself unleash his full DPS on a target. having the best possible damage shield, that stacks with the (small) wizard damage shield is also a great source of added DPS<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Beastlords are a welcome addition to any pet-centered group. Not only are warders comparable to elementals in their toughness and damage output, but the lord brings slows, buffs and heals to the group. However, the warder usually takes aggro from the elementals, and costs more time and mana to replace.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
a beastlord will take less damage than his warder, so its perferable when adding a beastlord (unless another healer is not avalible) to allow the Beastlord to tank for all the pets, and use water pets for extra DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Enchanters bring a great deal to a pet-centered group. Besides the obvious mind candy, they can slow and mezz adds. Charmed mobs make very powerful pets, often dwarfing summoned pets for damage and hitpoints. However, this can be risky. As mentioned previously, it can be difficult for pets to take aggro from players, and enchanters are aggromaniacs. Therefore earth elementals may be best, especially if the enchanter is not used to this group style. Enchanters also have a relative weak summoned pet, which can be useful, but tends to take aggro from elementals.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
anyone that uses a earth in conjunction with a chanter needs to seek therapy.  unless the mob is stun immune, a epic or air pet will tank and hold agro well beyond the scope of a earth's root. Most enchanters i know end up being the puller, so forgo their pet to make this easier. A dire enchanter is the best of both worlds, and can often find a pet of equal offensive power and tanking ability of a mages pet. charmed pets are best in larger groups that have plenty of others that can immediatly handle a broken charm, but at 61+ and PoP, the charm benifit far outwieghs its risk. directly doubling a groups EXP gain is not unheard of.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Wizards are a good addition to pet groups, as long as they can avoid aggro. They have a variety of fast, efficient, and hard nukes. Although they have a summoned sword pet, it is useless in pet groups as it takes aggro and dies almost instantly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Wizards are the measure of agro holding.  a tank that can hold agro through a chain burning wizard is a keeper for sure, and where i have done all my pet testing (and player testing) the wizard pet will work along side mage pets in some zones.  the idea that certian pets will always take agro is false.  its largely zone/mob dependant.  Mobs are coded generally to attack the &quot;nearest&quot; target. this makes pets get agro in oder of proximity to the mob.  since epics tend to be the largest, and have the largest hit radius, other pets get inside their range and take agro. The deep is a good example of a place where cleric and wizard pets can simply never be used with mage pets.  they will always gain agro.  where as umbral plains, hammer and sword almost never gain agro, even when sent to attack first.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Druids bring nukes, heals and buffs. Unless there are a lot of pets or the groups is fear-kiting, they probably should leave Boo Boo Bear at home, since he tends to take aggro from the stronger pets. In some zones, animals can be charmed to great effect.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
if you were to ask the best duo partner for a mage, a druid would top the list.  bringing almost all the utility you could want except for slow and haste. boo boo isnt a pet, hes a role playing aid.  2dps sustained with max haste isnt a pet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Shaman are a great addition to nearly any group. Slow is an absurdly powerful ability, heals are nice, and their combat buffs are second to none. Their wolf pet tends to take aggro from stronger pets.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
once mobs get high DPS a druid is lost to a shaman as a mages best friend.  bringing heals, slow/haste, his own pet and nice buffs that tend to affect the pets better than players, there is no better single choice for a partner in the high end game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> <br>
Clerics, while not as valuable as in trinity groups, are also welcome. They can easily sustain an elemental tank without risking aggro. Death is always a possibility, and ressurection a welcome relief. They have a hammer pet, but it always takes aggro from stronger pets and dies quickly.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
clerics are not the best choice of the three healing classes, they are the worst. their only advantage is allowing you to fight harder targets, which you generally stay away from when EXPing anyway.  however, PoP and CT have larger uses for them, as their specialization and CH tend to allow for higher staying power, and longer fight times before med breaks.  (very useful for inserting into a camp for instance)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
In general, healers reduce the need to replace pets, and so allow the pet owners to devote more of their effort to dealing damage as God Intended: by casting a vengeful rain of fire and steel upon their foes (being naughty in His sight).<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
never forget to fully arm and armor your pet if you have a steady healer in your group.  spending the time to summon and equip a pet with armor and focuses (for the extra ac and hitpoints) adds at least 5% to any pets staying power.  not bad for 5 minutes work.  dont forget at 61+ to share your new weapons with others' pets as well.  all classes will wield at least one of the new summoned weapons.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
In general, melees are not welcome in pet-centered groups. Pets almost never take aggro when a player is within melee range of a mob, so player melees negate the whole premise of this strategy. There are some exceptions. With the right AA, high level Rangers can sustain significant damage through archery alone, and can also contribute to the group by pulling. Although the details are not well understood, Monks appear to have some kind of aggro reduction factor, and one or two monks can share aggro with epic and air pets so long as the elementals outnumber the monks and root is not used. Rogues might be useful when fearkiting, but are otherwise unwelcome in pet-centered groups. Bards can mezz and charm, but must be careful to maintain their distance from the melee.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Melees being added is only good if you have a source of healing.  PCs, even of lower level, tank significantly better than pets.  they may not deal nearly as much damage though. (specially true of lower level paladins/SKs) If a monk or rogue is levels above the casters, they will still most likely tank better than a pet, as well as adding a higher DPS than a pet.<br>
<br>
one thing often overlooked is the value of a mage in and of itself.  at any level, a mage can duplicate the DPS of a rogue without a problem, unless the mobs being fought are both fire and mage resistant (in which case the mage should be moving on anyway)<br>
<br>
Some mages play poorly and others are diamonds in the rough. Like druids, mages where the early solo class. often recommended to those that wanted to solo, or that lacked time to really group. this leads to a great many people without grouping skills. <br>
My pet mage for instance, almost never remembers to self buff. he is only concerned with mana regeneration, not pool size. Often when the crap hits the the fan, i hear his oom long before I'm at half with my wizard. this ignoring of pool and defensive abilities has often cost him his life. Never ignore things, because they seem &quot;trivial&quot;  it will often cost you more than the small trouble it takes to do them.<br>
<br>
Not mentioned was the decoy pet. often over looked, it is perhaps the best tank a mage can get until either a epic or 61+ pet.  having the same innate damage shield as a fire pet, a nice proc, and being lower level, tends to get the pet hit more.  however, its coded with a high ac, so mitigates a great deal of damage as well as having the same HP as an earth pet. <br>
this is perhaps the best pet for when you want a mob to &quot;kill itself&quot;. this pet also seems to have the best tuant skill of all.  you can almost be garunteed that a &quot;tuanting attacker master&quot; is followed by the mob ignoring everyone but the Decoy.  I have not had a chance to test its DPs since hte pet changes, since my pet mage achived his epic shortly before that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=erun>Erun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#333333>(12/2/02 1:57:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8009.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Very nice post Balanz</span><hr size=1> The last few months I have been spending a lot of time in Sebilis with a 56 Wizard and 54 Enchanter.<br>
<br>
We zone in, make pet, look around for any other non-melee LFGs, summon a pet, and head down.  While we are killing frogs, we keep an eye out for other non-melee LFGs.  If one comes along, wiz absconds, invites, and I CoH.  <br>
<br>
Make sure that when you make clear to any potential LFGer that you invite that it is a 'Pet-Centered' group (as the esteemed Balanz has dubbed it).  Many players are uncomfortable with this type of group, or they have a melee friend who they are expecting to invite once they are in the group and someone leaves, so it is good to be up-front about it.  It seems that the more desirable of non-melee classes for traditional groups (chanter, cleric, shaman) are hesitant to engage in these groups.  It is probably due to the fact that they never have to spend more than 5 minutes LFG in any zone, so if you dont tell them up front that they are being invited to a pet-centered group, they may arrive, look at unconventional group makeup, and disband and go LFG again (sometimes without saying anything).<br>
<br>
With another wiz and a druid we were able to take and hold Disco2 (although it was pretty tense).  With just wiz and chanter we can easily take and hold gang and exit.  We could probably take and hold chef, bar, and dpath (sorry if these camp nicknames are server specific), but for the camps with more dense spawns it is nice to have a healer along cause in dungeouns you are going to get hit, if even only for a few seconds while you run past the engaged pet or when a mob pops on top of you.  Having a evac'er is nice when things get a bit sketchy, but that is always true I suppose.<br>
<br>
The main problem we have, which isnt a huge problem, is that occasionally you die and have no rezzer.<br>
<br>
As for PoP zones, I have tried that only once when Calebe invited me to his PoP group (mage, mage, shaman, and monk for pulling).  The two mage pets were easily destroying mobs once slowed, and with only the three of us in the group, we were taking out mobs faster than many full groups are able to.<br>
<br>
As was pointed out, melees are strictly forbidden with the possible exception of Rangers, particularly the AA archery enabled rangers.<br>
<br>
As to the mechanics of aggro amongst multiple pets, I have long desired a mechanism which would allow us to exercise some control over which pet has aggro.  The weakest pet seems to always take aggro.  The idea of shrunken pets having an effect on aggro is novel, and hope to hear more about it and will do some research on it myself.  Has anyone had any success with having one pet's 'taunt' on while the others are not?  I havent noticed much of an effect of /pet taunt in these situations, but maybe you have.  Maybe if one of the pets is equipped with the new proc'ing weapons they can hold aggro, although I doubt it.<br>
<br>
I think once you are comfortable with these type of groups you will have opened up a larger array of options for camps and groups, so it is worth the investment of investigating it for yourself if you have not already done so.<br>
<br>
I would like to take an opportunity to point out one tactical aspect that you may find helpful in circumstances.  When a pet is tanking a mob and another mob (say a wanderer or a spawn) starts pounding on one of your groupmates,  target the new mob, use /pet back off and /pet attack in quick succession and in many cases the pet will successfully engage the add while the original target will follow and attack the pet, allowing the palyers to get out of harms way.  As you know it sometimes takes several attempts to get this to work, as the orginal mob will be attacking and re-agroing you try to get him on the new mob.  /pet hold may help in this matter.  Of course the vast majority of you who have read this far already know this.<br>
<br>
While I am writing about this I may as well point out another subtle tactical point, useful in some situations to those without Pet Discipline AA ability.  When you park a pet with /pet guard here, he will return to that point when his hate list is cleared, either by all mobs being dead or by issuing the /pet back off command.  However, the pet tends to return to his parking spot in a leisurely fashion.  If you are having trouble extracting your pet from a mob, it is sometimes helpful to issue the /pet follow command while it is engaged and get a decent distance away from him and then issue the /pet back off command.  The pet will typically move away from the mob at a higher speed, increasing the chances that he gets away from the mob before being aggro'd again.  In my experience, the Air pet is the easiest pet to extract from a tanking situation, however in single-pet pet-centered groups, Earth pet is typically the most desirable, due to his root proc and his large HP pool.<br>
<br>
Another underused and fascinating tactic involves Dyzil's Deafening Decoy pet.  While he has a low HP, his DS is very powerful, and his AE taunt is unique and effective.  Using these aspects of the Dyzil pet, and the fact that aggro is not transferred to one who heals a pet, it is sometimes very entertaining to send a Dyzil pet into a room with many spawns, and allow the healer(s) to chain-heal the pet while the mobs destory themselves on your pet's DS.  Make sure other members of the group allow plenty of time for the mobs to hurt themselves in this fashion before casting offensive spells on them to finish them off.  I do this in the chef room of sebilis (5 strong frogs densley packed) among other locations.  This tactic should not be attempted in PoP zones, as even multiple clerics would have a hard time keeping Dyzil alive against multiple PoP mobs.<br>
<br>
I may have rambled a bit toward the end here.<br>

Haven't had the opportunity to group with the other major pet class on either my beastlord or my mage often<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  But just one comment.  Yes, while buffing a beastlords pet is prohibitively expensive, they also get near-cleric level heals.  Just have the beastlord play pet-cleric.  It is what it sounds like-the warder tanks, and the beastlord merely slows and heals.  If ambitious, they dot and nuke, as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You left out the beastlords spiritual purity line of spells, though.  Since most pet groups lack mana regen, it's value as mana/health regen is amplified.  And if one pet is tanking, or you are not chaining, the beastlord can also buff up the pets with str/dex/atk/hp.  Handy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've done some beastlord and mage groups, and with necros, although not at the level the author is referring too(seems geared torwards 60+, I think), they seem immensely powerful, and fun.  Pet groups rock!<br>
<br>
A word of advice, if you ever group with 2+ beastlords-turn spell particles off, or the warder's procing will drive you insane(and laggy).<br>
<br>
Very well written article.  Mind if I cross-post it to the beast boards?<br>

The pet-centered group is less brittle.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Pet groups have roughly the same damage output as other groups sustained. epic pets and 61+ pets change this pattern, often out damaging all tank classes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My experience has been that the pet groups I have been in have killed the mobs faster than the trinity groups I have been in.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I disagree, its dirt simple to control agro in this case <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>[with a single pet doing all the tanking]</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, simple stay away from the mob. this is perhaps the easiest pet group for use outside dungeons.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I find myself often teaching this group style to lower level players who are unfamiliar with it.  In a trinity group, if a caster or priest gets aggro, a player tank will hopefully soon taunt the foe off of them.  Unused to pet-centered groups, these casters often over aggro, and are suprised when the pet cannot get the enemy away from them.  This is why I recommend earth in this case, they can flee more easily from a rooted enemy.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  its root ability is nice, but no where near the power of agro management that the air and epic have through procing stun and DDs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have neither the epick nor the 61 air, and have had less success with GV:Air in pet groups than perhaps others have.  I find in emergencies chaining earth to be the most efficacious, and root makes for a greater margin of error in managing aggro.  As I said, I am often teaching this group style to players, which is why I described it as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;the simplest and most basic elemental to use in pet-centered groups.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Mobs hardly move when three earth elementals are locking them down, and loose mobs are quickly rooted back into place.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurz:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  the earth is for tanking, and even then, only when you lack any support classes. its only real use now is pet cannibalizing.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Again, I disagree.  I have neither epick nor 61 air, and I am sure I am not alone in this.  For chaining into adds, earth is clearly the best choice.  Earth is also the only pet that lets me deal with two adds at once, by alternately attacking each mob, but backing it off after root sticks.  A poor man's root park, but this mage makes what he can of what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Karana</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has granted him.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> there are many fire pets, and prior to level 55+ mobs, some of them do quite well. the pets are wizards, and are born with one of three possible spell loadouts.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I will freely admit that I have never mastered these pets, and have little experience with them.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The air pet as main tank is simply the best choice.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Besides <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Firebolt of Tallon</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Servant of Marr</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Fireshield of Ro</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and that is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">it</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> for pop spells.  I have yet to win a single parchment in a group.  From what I read, I am not alone in lacking many spells for my level.  No 62 Air, and no epick for this poor mage.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> water should only be used in a group with another source of main tank and agro holding.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My experience is that elementals are the last to take aggro.  If I am in a group with non-elemental pets, then mine will rarely be tanking.  Necromancers prefer kiting, whether fear or aggro, and post-50 water pets are ideal for this.  Also, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Servant of Marr</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is my only post-60 pet.  I think my advice does apply for the non-epicked 54-60th mage.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Epic chaining is not advised, it is much betterto fully equip the epic, and find target it can kill with a single bar of health.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not epicked, but based on reading here and elsewhere, some mages find it worthwhile to reclaim epick rather than wait for it to heal.  The new pet summons may have invalidated this.  Again, I have not the spells myself.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  a beastlord will take less damage than his warder, so its perferable when adding a beastlord (unless another healer is not avalible) to allow the Beastlord to tank for all the pets, and use water pets for extra DPS.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I often find myself without any healer.  I generally leave the decision to tank up to the lord, but so far all withdraw from combat after the first few pulls.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  anyone that uses a earth in conjunction with a chanter needs to seek therapy.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Please refrain from assuming that anyone who disagrees with your obvious conclusion is not rational.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> unless the mob is stun immune, a epic or air pet will tank and hold agro well beyond the scope of a earth's root.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not all magicians have the epick or the 61 air, and my experience with GV:Air has not been satisfactory to date. Further, I often wind up teaching the style to others, as I have mentioned, and root simplifies matters enormously.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Most enchanters i know end up being the puller, so forgo their pet to make this easier.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I am usually the puller when I form these groups.

Sometimes I am in groups with more nukers than pets, and so the nukers push aggro.

My experience is as I have described.  Assuming you are right, these zone dependencies could be important to know.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Mobs are coded generally to attack the &quot;nearest&quot; target. this makes pets get agro in oder of proximity to the mob.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->In general, this is exactly what I see.  Also, the weakest or lowest level pet tends to get aggro first.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> where as umbral plains, hammer and sword almost never gain agro, even when sent to attack first.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This I have not seen, but is interesting.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> if you were to ask the best duo partner for a mage, a druid would top the list. bringing almost all the utility you could want except for slow and haste.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have found druids adequate but not especially good partners.  Some of this may be that druids prefer running fights, e.g. kiting, whereas I prefer static, in-place fights <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>(hence my preference for earth)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Slow is an absurdly powerful ability.  A 66-75% slow is essentially the same as multiplying group hitpoints and healing by 3-4 times, i.e. double, then double again.  A single shaman makes a far greater difference to almost any group than a single druid.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> clerics are not the best choice of the three healing class<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I have had much better luck partnering with clerics than druids.  They almost never let the pet die, and are workmanlike in rooting adds.  They seem better able to work in a limited space, which is my preference.  I find that people that play clerics are very attentive to details.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Melees being added is only good if you have a source of healing. PCs, even of lower level, tank significantly better than pets.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->But they introduce requirements the pet-centered group seeks to avoid.  Healing pets generates almost no aggro for the healer, so that all pet groups is more relaxing for the healer than keeping a player alive, especially in the absence of a slower.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Hurk:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If a monk or rogue is levels above the casters, they will still most likely tank better than a pet, as well as adding a higher DPS than a pet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->When building these groups, I tend to group with lower levels.

The mere presence of <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">any</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> adequate shaman, cleric, or enchanter adds more to the group than holding out for a higher level of the same class.  Lower levels are more impressed by the mobs the group is able to hunt, for them they are grouping <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;up.&quot;</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  And again, they return the favor with group invites later.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erun:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The two mage pets were easily destroying mobs once slowed, and with only the three of us in the group, we were taking out mobs faster than many full groups are able to.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is what I have observed as well.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erun:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The weakest pet seems to always take aggro<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Seems that way to me mostly.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Erun:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Has anyone had any success with having one pet's 'taunt' on while the others are not?

My hot-key is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>/pet hold, /pet back off</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which first, causes the pet to ignore its hate list, and second, to empty it. The near absolute control it gives you is well worth the AA.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Brin:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  my experience has been that a pet group in non-PoP zones is the best xp grinding group there is.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Of course, the vast majority of my experience with these in pre-PoP.

However, pet-clericking tends to be rather mana intensive, while I favor having longer fights that use less mana.  The lords I have grouped with have adapted either by pulling their warders out of each fight for a little while, letting the elemental take some beatage, or alternately, have their warder sit out some fights entirely.  I try to use between 10-40% mana per fight, ideally no more than 15%, keeping down time to a minimum.  I can accomplish this by chaining pets if need be, but this is not much of an option for beast lords.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Kegulik:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Mind if I cross-post it to the beast boards?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Please do.

<br>
The usefullness of the 61 Air pet pretty good in these groups as Canvashan mentioned earlier as a stunned mob is an incapacitated mob.  It would be good to see how the effectiveness would be introducing a few of the PoP fire pets, which like their lower level comrades, have the potential to be chain stunners.<br>
<br>
Personally I would not even bother with water in these groups as the stuns from the air pet would buy extra hits and save overall pet heath and help keep aggro on the pets.<br>
<br>
I would love to get a few BLs in these groups to add to the malestrom of damage while providing the all important slownage.<br>
<br>
I have had successful groups in PoV and in the PoN gobbie caves that are pet centered and they are a blast.  I see no problem with these groups in HoH in most circumstances and would be interested in trying them in CoD.  <br>
<br>
I look forward to these unorthodox groups that bypass the old style of thinking. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=canvashan>canvashan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#333333>(12/2/02 5:24:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8009.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Pet Groups</span><hr size=1> /wave Sarzan <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordgojirax>LordGojirax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 195<br> <font color=#333333>(12/2/02 8:57:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8009.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojhead.jpg width=98 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Pet Groups</span><hr size=1> Just a note about Wizard and Cleric hammer/sword pets.<br>

<br>
When you have two or more pets on a mob, aggro rules change.  They *can* hold aggro over PCs in melee range, assuming the pets are generating more aggro.  If you have three or four pets, and the melees wait a few seconds before stepping in and do not taunt, they can fight the entire battle without getting hit once.<br>
<br>
Beastlords notice this more than necros and mages because we are a melee class, rather than a caster.  When two or more beastlords group, they rarely take much damage themselves even though they are melee'ing along side their warders.<br>
<br>
Thus there is no need to completely exclude a warrior or paladin or whatever as long as you meet the requirements of two or more pets. <p><br><center><img src="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/notherkrag.jpg" width="500" height="200" border="0" usemap="#nothermap"><map name="nothermap"><area alt="Fury of Faith" coords="31,157,152,187" href="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/fury"><area alt="Tipop's Homepage" coords="186,157,321,187"  href="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/"><area alt="Kraggan's Magelo Profile" coords="342,157,465,186" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120506"></map></center>

This thread is a great show of what we can do united.<br>
<br>
I must second Tipop. I've fought in many pet-only groups and always, if there are two or more pets, I have never taken aggro from the pets. Try a group with a mage and five beastlords if possible on your server. You want to talk about &quot;assembly-line&quot; mob compacting? Yeah. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What we bring to a pet group is varied. We have mana regen buffs for the casters and decent stat buffs for the pets themselves. If aggro is centered on our warder, not only does he tank well but we can also heal him with extreme mana-efficiency; negating the need for chaining pets. We're not nukers, and we can't DoT as well as a shaman or druid, but we can add our own melee damage into the mix to make up for it.<br>
<br>
And if you want loads of sparks, if you've a mage that can summon the wrulan sword and fist of ixiblat, hand a couple to the warder to watch him proc three different spells. That's a lot of doom.<br>

<br>
Reagents.  I know that 50+ reagents for pets are comparatively cheap for necros and mages, but beastlords do not need them to summon our pet.  Thus if the beastlord pet dies its an even smaller loss.  Not to mention the more mana efficent heals.  The beastlord pet tanking seems to me the best choice.<br>
<br>
Spirit of the Storm:  This is a proc beastlords can put on their pets beggining at level 53.  When it goes off it not only deals damage but acts adds a substantial amount of taunt power (200) as well.  Thus should a healer or nuker generate too much aggro a beastlords pet with this proc can get the mob off of the player usually in just one proc.  It also helps raise the overall pet taunt of the pets.  As has been mentioned by fellow beastlords all pets on a given mob share a collective taunt that allows them to take the punishment from melee's.  Storm just makes it even easier for a melee to get in and not get hurt.<br>
<br>
Other than that, I want to agree that pet groups are awesome.  I had one with 2 beastlords 2 mages and 2 necros.  Was the BEST experience group I've ever had.  What really helped was the epic necro.  6 pets and 2 beastlords beating on a mob with 2 mages nuking, we were ripping them to shreds 2 at a time.<br>

The rule has to be more complex.  It is as if there are some multipliers or bonuses involved.  Stun has high hate, and so is more likely to take aggro.  I think monks have a hate reduction factor to keep them from taking aggro all the time with their low delay.<br>
<br>
There might be similar factors with both or either of lord and warder.<br>
<br>
But it is definitely <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">not</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> as simple as any two pets and any melee.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tipop:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Beastlords notice this more than necros and mages because we are a melee class, rather than a caster.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, I am well aware of who gets aggro in melee when you mix pets and PCs.

Also, perhaps warders have a bit more hate than other pets.  Thus the lowered hate of the lord exposes the extra hate of the warder, and that explains what you see.<br>
<br>
I bet you if you had a water elemental and warder, instead of two warders, the warder would take aggro.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Khati Sha:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I must second Tipop.

Actually, I think it's whatever pet is lower level... but of course, that generally means the same thing.<br>

It depends if the melee's are taunting, if they wait a few seconds before going in, and if they have procs or cast spells that add a lot of hate.  Shadow Knights, for example, almost always grab aggro from a number of pets because they can't seem to stop casting their high-taunt DoTs and taps.  (Force of habit, of course.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>While I do not doubt your observations, I know it is not as simple as this.

Perhaps the melee was taunting, or doing one of the other things mentioned above?<br>

<br>
Nope, I've done that before too.  As I recall, it was me and a mage at the kodiak caves in Great Divide.  I never got hit once, and my gator very rarely got hit, and the mage was upset because his pet kept taking all the damage.  He was a couple of levels lower than me, which explains it.<br>

That used to be the case, back when we had to level-buff the warder.  Now it's just summon warder, haste, and proc... costs roughly the same mana as a mage summoning elemental, burnout, and conjuring a weapon. <p><br><center><img src="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/notherkrag.jpg" width="500" height="200" border="0" usemap="#nothermap"><map name="nothermap"><area alt="Fury of Faith" coords="31,157,152,187" href="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/fury"><area alt="Tipop's Homepage" coords="186,157,321,187"  href="http://members.telocity.com/~Tipop2000/"><area alt="Kraggan's Magelo Profile" coords="342,157,465,186" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=120506"></map></center>

Just as one possiblity to mention, should make sure the melee PC isn't taunting, just one thought though I'm sure it likely isn't the cause.  Have to make sure the power cord is plugged in when the computer stops working neh?<br>
<br>
As for a mana count on the beastlord pet:<br>
<br>
Going to use post 60 spells for reference as those are the ones I trust as being most up to date, particularly with the semi-recent changes to the method beastlords summon their pets by.<br>
<br>
Level 62 pet Spirit of Arag 400 mana casting time 10 sec<br>
Level 63 pet hase Arag's Celerity 450 mana casting time 6.5 seconds<br>
Level 63 pet proc Spirit of Rellic 50 mana 3 second casting time<br>
(though numbers are pretty much the same for all pet procs)<br>
<br>
Total mana 900 and 19.5 seconds to be fully operational<br>
<br>
Now since I couldn't through a semi cursory examination find a list of Magician spells I'm basing these spells off of EQ Casters realm, so if they are wrong, I apologize.<br>
<br>
Level 62 Mage pet Servant of Marr 400 mana 12 second cast time<br>
Level 62 pet haste Burnout V is 150 mana and 6 second casting time<br>
Total mage mana = 550 and 18 seconds<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to compare raw time for readiness than yes mages have a few seconds over mages, and a substatial amount of conserved mana after hasting.  <br>
<br>
So if in a group the pets are expected to die, then the mage pets are faster and more mana efficent to replace.<br>
<br>
But if the pets are to live, and it is better to have all of the pets alive, not only for speed of damage being dealt, but in smaller groups simple security of having 2 pets instead of 1.<br>
<br>
Beastlord spell Healing of Sorsha has a 9 second cast time and heals 2100 health for 425 mana.  Comparatively Planer Renewl for mages heals 1250 hp for 400 mana in 7.25 seconds.  Clearly hear the advantage is in the beastlord.<br>
<br>
The level 62 beastlord pet has 3500 hp, enough to last long enough to be healed.  The question then becomes &quot;is it more efficent to have the MT pet alive all the time or let it die and simply recast?&quot;  If a 62+ pet deals ~65 DPS(a low number as I understand it), the 18 seconds that the mage pet is out of the fight costs the group 1170 points of damage and the beastlord pet 1267.5 points of damage.  If the beastlord pet is tanking mobs such that the healing spell is capable of keeping it alive atleast another 18 seconds, by casting a 400 mana spell -&gt; 1267/400 = 3.something.  A decent ratio.  And for those 18 seconds the mage is saved 550 mana on a new pet that they are now free to spend on nukes or malosi.<br>
<br>
Yes I am making a fair number of assumptions, I do however think they are reasonable ones.  In the pet group if a pet dies, that usually means the mob changes direction, something that reduces the damage of the other pets.  The damage of the collective pet group drops while the pet is being replaced.  I think it is more efficent both mana and time wise to try to maintain the MT pet, at least if it is a beastlord pet.  If the group does expect the pets to frequently die then yes the mage summons are faster and less mana intensive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=8009.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=8009.topic&start=41&stop=55>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=8009.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=8009.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8009.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.threadControl?topicID=8009.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8009.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8009.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral>General</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright 1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
