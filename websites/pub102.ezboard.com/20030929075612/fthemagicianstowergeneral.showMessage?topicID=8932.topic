Please excuse the shameless plug.  I'm a bard on the Firiona Vie server, and I wanted to invite you all to try out a little experiment a bunch of us from the EQDiva boards have started, inspired partially by some crafty mages we'd heard of.<br>
<br>
A while back, one of us suggested that some of us get together on a server and play in all-bard groups.  This seemed like a pretty cool idea to us, so after some discussion, we created Molto Expressivo.  I hear wonders about some all-mage groups, and we thought we could have a blast with this.<br>
<br>
Molto Expressivo is a team-oriented all-bard guild on the Firiona Vie server. All members have an Italian musical term as their name. Bards are the most versatile class in the game, and with our ability to fill any role in a group, we have found that we can fight very effectively grouped with only bards. The possibilities and challenges of all-bard groups makes for loads of fun.<br>
<br>
We've had to come up with different ways of taking down mobs.  One trick we do is, rather than having one person tank, we share the aggro around the group, and our regeneration song is enough to keep everyone healthy.  We also do group AE using some of our DoTs.  Down the road, we're looking at doing more intricate AE fights, when we get slows, fear kiting, group kiting, and a whole group using charmed mobs to take down our opponents very quickly (you all, being a pet class, would probably understand this pretty well).  The versatility of our class has spawned a lot of neat ideas that we'd love to try out in groups and raids.  However, if we're going to make our dream of all-bard groups and raids a reality, we'll need some more people.  At present, we have enough players to get a few regular groups going, but we'd like to bring in more.<br>
<br>
In Molto Expressivo, we fight together and level together. We have set goals for levelling each week, and we help each other to get to the weekly level goal. Most of us are alternate characters, so having a level limit isn't really all that constricting.  For those of us that play more, there are trade skills, quests, farming, raids, and PLing our newbies up to our level to keep them busy.<br>
<br>
Right now, our target level range is between 12 and 18.  Catching up with us will be easy, if you want to try us out.  The bard is one of the most effective soloing classes in the game, and we love helping to outfit and level our new recruits. We got one of our newbies from level 2 to level 7 the other day with belt turn-ins alone.  I personally have more than two bags of Crushbone Belts waiting for some newbie to take and turn in, to skip some of the trivial, time-consuming levels.  Of course, we'll expect you to put forward some effort to catch up, but for an experienced player, especially one who has played a low-level mage, the early levels are quite easy, and we bards have our own, very effective way of power levelling people. Playing a bard is pretty easy at the lower levels, but as you get more experience, it gets trickier.  You'll have plenty of experienced company with you in the guild to talk you through song twisting, fear kiting, chant kiting, charm kiting, and even swarm kiting, so if the class seems a bit too hard, don't worry.<br>
<br>
The Firiona Vie server is a PvE server with a twist. There are almost no NO-DROP items in the game, making many quests and items much more readily available without excessive camping times. Additionally, there is a trivial loot code that prevents high levelled people from farming valuable magic and lore items off of content designed for lower-levelled players. The server is one of the youngest in the game, and does not suffer much of the overcrowding that plagues other servers. As you might imagin, this makes for a unique and more dynamic economy, as players of all levels can acquire and sell items to players of both lower and higher levels. Most of the players on Firiona Vie are experienced players, and the role-playing friendly atmosphere is pretty neat. There is no common tongue on FV, but learning new languages is pretty easy, and you can find teachers in our guild without much trouble.<br>
<br>
If you want to know more, join the allbards channel and chat with our members, or check out our forum on the EQDiva message boards:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub142.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm83">pub142.ezboard.com/feqdiv...questfrm83</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Or take a look at our new website:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://213.133.103.14/~molto/">213.133.103.14/~molto/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
If you're wanting to have a change of pace from your main character, give Molto Expressivo a try. Just follow the following steps.<br>
<br>
1. Create a bard on the Firiona Vie server. <br>
<br>
2. Select an Italian musical term for a name. See the link below for some italian musical terms:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.pianoinstructors.com/musicterms/term.html">www.pianoinstructors.com/.../term.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
3. Choose whatever race you want. Bards can be Human, Half-Elf, Wood Elf, or Vah Shir.<br>
<br>
4. Choose whatever religion you want. Agnostic, Rallos Zek, and Veeshan are the most popular choices to date. <br>
<br>
5. Assign your stat points any way you want to. Most melee-oriented bards put all their points into stamina. Crowd controlling bards prefer to put their points into charisma and dexterity. All-Around bards tend to break up their starting points between strength, dexterity, charisma, agility, intelligence, and stamina. <br>
<br>
6. When you enter Norrath, join allbards, and say hello!<br>
<br>
7. Type /who all molto and say hello to the guild members.<br>
<br>
8. Put your character in the registry found in our forum, register with Guildmagic and Magelo.<br>
<br>
If there aren't many people around, we have our peak times on Thursday afternoons and on weekends during the day. As we get more members, this will change. We are still relatively new, and most of our members are alternate characters.<br>
<br>
Come hop on the bardwagon! We are all relatively low-level at this point, so catching up will be pretty simple. The sooner we play together, the better we will play together.  It's a nice change of pace for bards and mages.  <br>
<br>
I hope to see some of you soon.<br>
<br>

With all the multi-function roles that bards play, I could see an all bard group being very effective.  There are not many functions that a bard cannot do, and they get plate.  I do have to agree that the bard is a carpal tunnel nightmare. <br>
<br>
You need to post a guild shot.  It'd be cute to see a group of bards with names like Fortissimo, Fermata, and Vivace owning Crushbone.  With the new dyes, they don't all have to be  blue, either <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Limitless possibilities. <p><div align="center"> <a href="#"><img src="http://www.nemeandesign.net/eq/sig2.jpg" width="382" height="66" border="0" onClick="window.open('http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528641', 'morillion', 'WIDTH=800,HEIGHT=600')"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ferocefv>FeroceFV</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(2/28/03 4:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8932.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Invitation to Any who Want to Try Something Different...</span><hr size=1> Heck, who needs the dyes?  The newbie armors look very nice, they'll do.  We'll try to get some screenshots up.  <br>
<br>
I want to say one thing on the carpal tunnel thing... it's really not that bad.  You don't have to pound keys to twist, and there are macros you can use to cut the number of clicks necessary in half.  I twist by mouse a lot, and it works pretty well (I have a 54 minstrel on Veeshan).<br>
<br>
If you've tried playing a bard, but didn't like it, you might like this.  Grouping with bards only is a pretty neat experience, and constantly changes as we level up.<br>
<br>
Please do come by and give us a try.  I have 33 Crushbone Belts taking up a LOT of space in my bank right now (I can't turn them in; I'm still dubious to the dwarves, 'cause I worship Rallos Zek), and I just love PLing our new recruits.  I'll probably be online this afternoon.<br>

<br>
If I am lucky and work is slow, I may get 7 hours a week playing.  Most goes to my mage, now doing tradeskills to feed dyes to the mass exodus of newbies (and beggars <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> )that have invaded PoK.  A little time for my enchanter, charm soloing in the Karanas.  And about 1 hour so far on my twinkie frog warrior, now level 3, and owning everfrost with his centi short sword and a nice mix of crafted and phantom armor. <br>
<br>
I wish you luck finding people, though. <p><div align="center"> <a href="#"><img src="http://www.nemeandesign.net/eq/sig2.jpg" width="382" height="66" border="0" onClick="window.open('http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528641', 'morillion', 'WIDTH=800,HEIGHT=600')"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=8932.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=8932.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8932.topic&index=4><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.threadControl?topicID=8932.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8932.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8932.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral>General</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
