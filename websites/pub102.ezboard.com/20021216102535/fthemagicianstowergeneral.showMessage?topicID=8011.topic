<br>
In one way they were right (at least in the beginning). You do need a group to really hunt effectively, 4 5 6, but the concept was there. It is even truer in the trials were a good group of 6 is really required to win.<br>
<br>
Where it falls off is obatining parchments. The drop rate has been cut back so severly on etheral drops, your lucky to see 1 or 2 in a play session in tier 1 or tier 2 zones.<br>
<br>
It is even worse when it comes to Spectral parchments, they simply are not dropping in tier 1 or tier 2 zones, and I wonder if anyone knows a place where a stardard group of 6 can now hunt to get spectral parchments? IF so are they in a zone that the same group of 6 can access reasonably? PoS/PoV being the 2 zones that require a good group of 6 to access? (I chose these 2 zones, with the reasoning SoE gave before release, that a lot of content would be geared in that direction. Content should also refer to reward, not just exp)These 2 zones were made to be obtainable from a group of 6.<br>
<br>
The trials are fun, and challanging. However once you pass them, with the changes to the drop rates, and locations, those same 6 people will not obtain a Spectral parchment, and the whole scheme breaks down.<br>
<br>
Spells are the life blood of a caster. The trials, are not easy, but they were rewarding, because the drop rates were better in those zones. Risk vs: Reward  in full evidense.<br>
<br>
With the changes, the risk is there, but the reward for casters in the form of spectral parchments, and even etheral parchments are severly lacking or non existant.<br>

I have not been able to get flagged yet (guild too low in general, so I have to rely on pick up groups for the trials; play times etc.).<br>
<br>
I cannot say that the trials are easy (execution was the only one I tried so far, about 10 times now). My best group there so far consisted of 61 war, 61 cle, 60 rog, 61 enc, 59 monk and myself (60 mag). In the best (third I think) attempt we made it through second wave (I got aggro then from two mobs and went down fast). We would probably have done it with a few more attempts, but time ran out for some of us so it didnt happen that day.<br>
<br>
If the planes that you can reach after doing the trials do not offer some reasonable reward for the time spent to get to them...something's screwed up. And if the &quot;ideal&quot; group setup you have to have to get through the trial is an indication for the difficulty of the planes after that...I am not looking forward to them. Certainly nice if you are in a strong guild, but not everyone has such people around.<br>
<br>
PoP may have been built for small groups of players, but they definitely didnt have the &quot;average&quot; player in mind then.<br>

It has so many flaws that it aint funny.<br>
<br>
First of all, the stupid idea that everything need to do twice as much dmg as before made it near impossible to do anything without a slower. It is as simple as that, if you want a group that can make decent exp you need a slower, no exeptions.<br>
<br>
Second, the lack of good loot, same problem like with Luclin, there are no loot, I can think of one place in Tier 1-2 that drop any kind of loot (that aint a boss kind of mob).<br>
<br>
Third, they added parchments.....   SPELLS SHOULDN'T BE LOOT!!!!! This been a stupidity since Kunark. They now even added focus effects that would been a awesome way of getting casters nice items and upgrades in their loot, items that acctually improved their performance. Spell as loot if  horrible idea.<br>
<br>
Fourth, the best way of getting exp is still to duo. Sad but true, I hoped they would fix group exp bonuses, but they didn't. If you good at quading that still the best exp, if you have a shaman friend you as a mage make an AA rather easy each hour (plenty of mobs that take a min to kill and give about 1.5 blue each).<br>
<br>
Fifth, and this is rather the core......  Designers have no clue how people play this game. <br>
They got the stupid idea that people would work on exp a bit, then work on getting flags, then work AA, then work on getting parchments. <br>
Did this happen?  No, people leveled first, then worried about the rest after. This issue rather destroyed alot of things, getting L63+ spells are near impossible for none big guilded. Alot of L61-L65 spells are a total waste, many got Shield of maelini before Shield of Arcane, total wasted spellslots.<br>
<br>
And last (well from me atleast).<br>
People didn't test stuff enough, there are tons of stuff that look good on paper but not working, bugs that been added and still not fixed.<br>
Some critical bugs, that problaly could be fixed in Beta if it been reported and if Verant cared.<br>
<br>
Bolts graphics not working.<br>
Servant of Ro is green and can't land on anything over L54 or so.<br>
Host of Elements had wrong time in description (or was nerfed).<br>
Host of the elements are green pets with like 10hp each, a rampage or AE destroy them.<br>
You can't heal pet then you have Host or Servnat of Ro up (this make Servant of Ro even more useless at L3).<br>
Monster summoning aint working in PoP zones.<br>
Pathing is worse than ever (please try pul stuff in PoS).<br>
Tons of diffrent Flag issues, there is something wrong then a single person can ruin a raid. I seen people blew maze in PoN by just hailing. I seen a idiotic bard charm a Desert giant in PoS just to blew the Lord cycle (was petitioned, hopefully he get banned since it was on purpose). The list could go on.<br>
<br>
The core issue, Verant have no clue how we play the game. And next expansion I acctually hope they have people to test it first, people that acctaully like to point out the flaws instead.<br>

The same with the issues I listed. Maybe you not agree with spell as loot could be ok, but seeing all the complains about low parchmentdrops on diffrent boards and after people getting 10+ spell duplicates I don't think many like this system.<br>
<br>
You can either argue about not needing a slower, if you not got a slower you are alot less effective.<br>
<br>
You can't argue about not solo or duo is most effective to get exp, thats a simple fact.<br>
<br>
You can't argue about not alot of spells are a waste and a proof about the designer had no clue about how people play the game. How many here was L63 before they got either Shield or Arcane or Shield of Maelini?

<br>
There are only so many ways to make encounters hard, without being impossible.  <br>
<br>
-A ton of hp with lowered damage output.<br>
-High damage output with lowered hp.<br>
-Mediocre swarms of mobs.<br>
<br>
We had seen the incredible boredom that was high hp mobs with luclin..we begged them to get rid of it.  They did...but, how do you do that without reverting back to 3 year old content that is trivial? High damage output...<br>
<br>
Also, healing was a non-issue for most of luclin grouping.  An afterthough basically.  You got the highest dps group possible and threw in whatever healer happened to be around...sometimes you didn't even bother with that.  High damage mobs bring healing back as a much more vital part of groups...something priest classes, specifically clerics, needed.  <br>
<br>
Finally, this setup favors casters much more then long drawn out battles.  Its much more realistic for us to keep up high dps's over short fights...then the endless ones of old.  High damage, low hp mobs have always been the shining point of damage casters.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, it appears you play as much as you accuse verant of.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeem@themagicianstower>Zeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 484<br> <font color=#333333>(12/1/02 10:48:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8011.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Other options..</span><hr size=1> Making it near impossible to single pull mobs and make them unrottable and unmezzable would been alot better solution. <br>

<br>
<br>
This is not true, Casters also need equipement to be better. A caster with FT15 is way better off than a caster with FT 4 or 5. Equipement does matter.<br>
<br>
Who is better off, a mage with BoBc? Or a magician without them?<br>
<br>
To say a caster doesn't need equipement is wrong, we need equipement, and spells. <br>

They were all opinions. I obviously have to agree that every group &quot;needs&quot; a slower. Where I disagree with you is that you clearly imply that you find it to be a problem. I don't.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to something I only half disagree with you with, is the parchments being loot. I think spells being loot is a good idea. The problem I have with the spell loot system is that it's too hard. That brings us back to what I think is the original topic of this thread... spectrals can't really be done by a 6 person group.<br>
<br>
I've killed one mob that's dropped spectrals. We had to use a CH rotation on it... *might* be feasible with one uberguild group, but they'd still need a ch rotation, and I don't know what kind of well balanced 6 person group would have 2 clerics and a shaman.<br>
<br>
I'm not complaining about it though... If SOE doesn't want small but high level guilds like mine to ever, ever get spectral parchments, then that's their decision &amp; i trust them with their game... I'll level up my cleric for Condemnation. <p>Happy trails.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krilenspiritlink>Krilen Spiritlink</A> at: 12/2/02 8:40:40 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zeem@themagicianstower>Zeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 485<br> <font color=#333333>(12/2/02 10:31:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8011.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Hehe...</span><hr size=1> To tell the truth, there are alot of things I like with PoP and enjoy.<br>
<br>
But still, those bugs I mentioned need to be fixed and probaly could been fixed in Bete if they listen.<br>

... and you can't argue about the fact that duo group still the best way to get exp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=colleen2>Colleen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 275<br> <font color=#333333>(12/2/02 11:42:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8011.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.earthlink.net/~interruptrequest/gir.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hehe...</span><hr size=1> PoP is too geared to the high end guilds, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
There's ways to get to some tier 2 zones without killing a boss, yes, but beyond that, don't kid yourselves.  Even the guilds of lesser ability that may eventually work their way into teir 2 zones will not be getting much farther.  While I don't think everyone should get to see and do everything, I definitly see a big problem with how things are; 4 or 5 tiers, most people will only ever see 1 or 2.  And even if you ARE in a powerful guild, missing one single night can really trip you up unless you give out your info to a friend to get you flagged, it also forces guilds to have to do stuff multiples times just to get a few straglers flagged.<br>
<br>
It really was not a good idea to make the teir 3+ zones so hard to gain enterance to for non-ubers, I don't think everyone should see everything, but as it is the setup is pretty silly.<br>
<br>
As for spectrals, the best places are tactics arena and hobgoblins in pon, HoH was apparently nerfed, or I've had bad luck there, tactics has gotten pretty bad too <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78838">Colleen Ebonfyre</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->65 Magician<br>
