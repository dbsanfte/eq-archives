It takes very few snakes and kobold runts to get to level 2 and fire beetles will then take you all the way to four.<br>
<br>
At four, get your pet spell (water or fire recommended) and head to the qeynos sewers to camp Cuburt.  Cuburt is only level 4 but he has lots of placeholders and the spawn is incredibly fast, only 1-2 minutes at most and everything will be blue, white or yellow to a level 4 mage and the yellows aren't that tough to deal with.  Don't worry about the frogloks nearby, they're indifferent to erudites.  At level 7 the cuburt spawn gets a little slow with most of the spawns green or low blue so you can either stick with it or head to Qhills for large snakes and gnolls and in a little time you'll have made 8.<br>
<br>
Get your spells (earth pet recommended), and go to the giant snake ledge.  There are 4 spawns here, ranging from the rare level 7 giant snake, to the more common level 8 -10 snakes.  Easy leveling here since the snakes won't all aggro you if you jump one and trains are infrequent if ever because of the area the ledge is located in.  This will take you to 11 easy and then the last bit to 12 will work here, but it's slow albeit not nearly as slow as 7 to 8 in the sewers.<br>
<br>
Now you're level 12, congrats, get your spells (water or earth pet recommended) and head to wisp island for a bit.  The wisps are going to be all blue however with your pet, a damage shield, and burnout you can breeze through a lot of these in no time at all and get to level 14 or at least relatively close.  Also, I can't stress this enough, don't touch the spiders or bats.  Killing other things will result in a random spawn, half of which can be red and aggressive whereas if you leave the spiders and bats alone, you'll be fine.  Also for the untwinked mage or the mage on a brand new server the stones will be great cash but no matter what your situation is, save most lightstones and at least half the greaters.  <br>
<br>
Head to North Karana.  I don't think I have to tell you to be careful but just for the dimwitted, be careful.  Head to the gypsy camp near the EK bridge and hand your lightstones and greaters to the female gypsy whose name begins with an M.  It's some weird funky name.  She'll give you some valuable books and wonderful xp in exchange.  Sell the books to a nearby gypsy or keep them as you see fit and by now you should be 16 with enough lightstones.  If not, head to the stone bridge near the wiz spires and kill some mobs around there and you'll soon be 16.<br>
<br>
Get your spells (for this I went with air but if you're not up to a trek to OOT to get these spells, just go with water) and head down to lake rathe.  The 2 aviak guard spawn near the arena is great.  Two spawns, fast respawn, solo pulls, great xp and a zone right nearby if you get into trouble.  Not much else to say... gypsy camp in zone you can sell stuff to and it's possible this gypsy camp or one in rathe mountains has pet reagents for sale just in case you run out while camping the birds but I never checked.  This spawn will take you to 21 but it's really low xp after you reach 20 so just forget staying here any longer.<br>
<br>
Get your spells (earth is wonderful but it's a long trip to get that spell and water again will substitute fine) and decide for yourself where to go:  bard at North Karana wizard spires or South Karana hermit spawn.  The bard is a half elf chick that spawns at one of the spires in NK, she's about 18-21 with low hit points.  She hits on par with mobs her level but she carries a faction hit that's kinda nasty to those unfamiliar with how to deal with bad faction.  The other option is the hermit in south karana.  There is a lone hut (no idea of exact location, it's along the zone wall between the lake rathe zone and the treant spawn) with an NPC hermit inside the house.  The door is locked and there's no way into the house other than a druid trick that I know of, but to get the hermit out go close to the door and tell him something along the lines of &quot;I'm going to kill you hermit scum&quot; and he'll aggro you and jump through the wall so you can wail on him with your pet.  He's always level 20 and sometimes drops fine steel.  Dangers of both of these spots... level 30 guards sometimes wander near the bard in NK and will aggro you if you attack her.  A high 20's gnoll sometimes wanders near the hermit's house so after each kill, it might be a good idea to med outside the walls.  Either of these spawns will take you to 24 fast with your pet and your bolt spell beating them down.<br>
<br>
Get your spells (from this point on I'm going to recommend earth, water, and air in that order), head to sister isle in OOT.  There are 4 dwarves on sister isle as well as some elves and a pirate spawn.  Stick near the shore to avoid the pirate because he's a rogue and his backstab &gt; your hitpoints.  Of the four dwarves, one is a merchant.  Don't touch him, the other three are fair game.  The three of them are all level 24 or possibly 25 every spawn.  They lower faction with KaladimCitizen but don't worry about that faction as all it's gonna make you do is make you kos to a few non guard dwarves in butcherblock.  Make sure you have full mana and HP when you take these on at 24 and you'll be fine.  These will take you to 29 VERY fast but just remember to avoid aggroing more than one (they spawn far enough apart that you should be safe) at a time or you're dead.<br>
<br>
Get your spells and head to Lake of Ill Omen.  Head to the windmill area and keep going a little bit along the wall.  There are numerous mobs here that will be wandering in range.  They are easy to pull because of the low aggro range.  Don't pull tigers unless you have to because they don't aggro on you and the more tigers there are, the safer your pull experience will be.  Charbone skels, war boned skels, goblins, and sarnaks are the MOBs of choice here.  This will take you from 29 through your first hell level to 31 faster than you might imagine.<br>
<br>
At 31 hit frontier mountains.  The weakest giants are high 28-30 in level and are great xp and cash.  The occassional burynai and goblin are also great xp.  I'm vague on what to kill here because I just went after whatever was blue.  Out front of the giant camp is a good pull spot if you're careful.  There are some wanderers that come by but if you keep your eyes open you'll see them in time and be able to avoid them if necessary.  You'll eventually make it to level 34.<br>
<br>
After you get your spells, you've got a choice to make.  You can continue solo by going near the WW zone in the overthere or you can group up for giants/burynai in frontier mountains.  I'd recommend burynai because it's better loot and grouping is better but if you for any reason can't get a group, OT will always be there.  35 is going to be slow going but hang in there and you'll make it out and before you know it, you'll be 39.<br>
<br>
Get your spells and head to the yeti caves in dreadlands.  Here is the greatest xp spot I've ever found.  Easy, mellow pull area, good number of spawns, but no loot.  Don't worry, this will take you through hell level 40 and on to 43 quick but I found it wouldn't take me to 44, at least not fast enough so I headed to north wall karnors to get me that extra little bit.  Watch out here as if there are others pulling here, you're almost certain to have a train dumped on you.  It won't take long though and pretty soon you'll be 44 with a new pet and nuke.<br>
<br>
Get over to BW.  There's a spot right against the wall near the frontier mountains zone that is excellent for pulling as you get wanderers but nothing that comes close enough to aggro.  You'll know it when you see it.  Make a pet, give it two swords of runes and pull ash and cinder hornets.  I wouldn't recommend touching wurms, scoriae hornets, or sarnaks.  Just stick to the lower level hornets, maybe an ember hornet if you feel lucky, skels and the occassional lower level gorilla.  You'll cut through hornets the fastest though with your sword of rune wielding pet and shock of swordssince the hornets are summoned creatures.  They will take you up to 49.<br>
<br>
Congrats, get your spells and run to OOT.  In OOT there are seafury cyclops.  They are great xp, drop nice loot, are blue until around 53/54 and best of all, they don't hit hard at all, only for around 75.  With your 49 earth pet you'll see just how much of a joke they'll be.  You'll soon make 51 and get Vocerate Earth which will be an even greater asset against the seafury clops.  Also, if you don't have jboots yet, there is a cyclops spawn on the island next to the seafury island which spawns every 7 minutes and eventually spawns the AC which drops the ring for jboots.<br>
<br>
Where do you go to solo now?  If you still want to solo, head to skyfire or maybe someplace in Velious (I did all this pre-velious).  I recommend Karnors or Sebilis however, if you can get into a group.  I don't know how crowded those dungeons are on a blue server but they're not too difficult to get a group in on a pvp server.  Grouping is more fun and necessary for high level EQ, however soloing will give you a great deal about the weaknesses and strengths of the mage class which can help you when you eventually start grouping which at this level you should do as soon and as often as possible.<br>
<br>
Need loot?  Need to get it yourself?  You can camp pretty much whatever you need in game now.  You can camp the ishva if you're familiar with the area, or you can camp the crystalline robe in CC or the advisor robe in Mistmoore.  Batskull earrings are an easy camp now.  Earring of essence shouldn't be too difficult.  Woven grass bracers or PBBs won't take much time at all.  Runed circlet is a joke to camp.  Drakescale belt, and impskin gloves are easy camps, but are time consuming is all.  Student's homework could be dangerous but with your pet you should be able to handle it.  Etc.<br>
