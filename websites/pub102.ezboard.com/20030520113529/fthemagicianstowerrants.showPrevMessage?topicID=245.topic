When we met we were the same level. I quickly got 10 lvl's on him, but always offered him a group.  He whined a little about not being able to solo at his level, so I always offered him what I had solo'ed at his level, then offered him to join me with what I was currently solo'ing.<br>
<br>
Time came to pass, as I grew a little bored and began playing other characters, he caught up in levels.  My boredom of my mage left and I began playing it again and once again quickly gained a few levels on him (think it was 2 levels this go round).  I got to 50 and camped shardwurms as I needed bile and MS2, hence my xp was coming in a bit slow.  This afforded him time to catch up, and gain a lvl on me.  <br>
<br>
My first question to him when he obtained 51, was if the pet was alot better.  He quickly answered with &quot;ohh yeah, they will kick your 49 pets arses&quot;.  I was happy to hear this, as I was 2 blue from 51.  I got my level and all the sudden he started boasting about how he got help taking out a particular high level mob (which isn't a rare mob at all).  Of course I figured since the guild helped him, it couldn't hurt to ask for help as well.  Noone seemed interested at the time, so I quietly solo'ed the lvl 48 mob.  Sure it took me some time and quite a bit of malechite, but I finished him with FM and was proud.  Sent a /tell to my friend about my accomplishment, and my chat box lay there empty for several hours. <br>
<br>
He finally sends me a /tell that he's going to hate, and will be the only mage aboard so all mage drops will be his.  I congradulated him, but was disheartened by his wording.  He got a few peices of apotholic and I congradulated him but was disheartened even more by the wording he used to differenciate himself from me.<br>
<br>
Since this he hasn't spoken to me, other than one a small raid type group where we were camping something that dropped something a guildie needed.  They had been letting a MQ'able epic piece rot, so I asked if I could loot the next one that dropped and stated we should all probably grab the drop while we were there to MQ it for other guildies.  At this point, he quickly loots the next one to drop, send a /tell to a guildie that could of used it and tells that guildie that he's gonna MQ it with him.  I am fine with this, but was disheartened at how many they had let rot beforehand.  A few guildies get online that can use it, yet the only one came.  Next piece that dropped, I defered on since the guy could loot it himself.  My mage friend got irrate in group chat that he was MQ'ing it with that guildie.  Anyway he looted it, and I got the next one to MQ with a friend that could seriously use the help.<br>
<br>
No other guildmate that was there would loot 1 to MQ with other guildmates.  Which did shock me, since now we are going to have to go back to get them anyway.  <br>
<br>
My mage friend hasn't spoken to me since, and won't even acknowledge me in guild chat.  After a week of the silence I had become bored with my mage again.  He's the only one I knew in the guild and one of the few people in the game that I enjoyed talking to/playing along side.<br>
<br>
In my following absence, the guild went to several places that involved mage drops.  I took 2 weeks off my mage again to play another character in an attempt to keep from getting upset at my friends silent treatment.  As soon as I log back on to my mage, he starts guildsay'ing about all the mage gear he recently got (of which I was happy for him), he then requests that the guild goto a certain place so he can get some more gear.  I announce my existance &quot;/guildsay hello all&quot;.  At this point he guildsays &quot;nevermind, I don't need to go there now, maybe later&quot;. I am wearing the gear he was asking for help getting (tagged along with a druid friends guild, to several places).  I can't help but get the feeling that he is trying to get better gear than me, and doesn't want to share at all.<br>
<br>
Since my return this weekend, I have once again out leveled him, and he quickly /camped as soon as I announced my ding in guild chat, and he didn't come back on the rest of the day.<br>
<br>
My question is, am I over reacting to think his actions (as they appear to me) is a sign that he thinks himself as better than me, or is an attempt to not do anything that could possibly benefit me (as well as him)?<br>
<br>
Or is he over reacting, to me solo'ing a mob that he had to have alot of help doing? Since it all started with 1 mob, heck I was pharming stuff when that particular mob came reigning down on me, then I got the idea to see how far I could get the mob down. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uishapdarkfire.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ishap Darkfire</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 59<br> <font color=#333333>(6/24/02 5:28:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: over reacting?</span><hr size=1> Sounds to me like he wants to get everything first and if you go on a raid as well, he might have to /random with you.

<br>
/tell mage friend what's going on with u mate? ur not talking to me now? why not, explain yourself.<br>
<br>
depending on his responce make your choice, if he tells u to get stuffed, then it's his loss of a good friend whose helped him out<br>
<br>
if he apologises etc.. then u've gained him back, either way, at least u know.<br>
<br>
BTW he sounds like a loot whore, i'd tell him to piss off =) <p><p>

Part 3: Uber Attitudes. <br>
<br>
&lt;An adaptation from “Run”&gt;<br>
<br>
Great! I just got this cool game from the mall. It just came out. It’s called Everquest. I will able to make a character, run around and do quests and kill monsters. This is so cool! This game will rock….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in neriak. &lt;salute&gt; I created a Dark elf cleric. There were a lot of choices but I chose Dark elf because they are kind of evil, yet I’m a cleric so I can kind of help people out. I have a lot of role-playing ideas and playing a character, which is good and evil at the same time, should be interesting! This character will be fun….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in north karana. I met a couple people outside my home city. We are great friends now. Cboyd is a warrior and Timber is a druid, they said that we should go to the karanas and kill stuff out there. That’s pretty far from my homeland, but hopefully it will be fun. I don’t think anything will be able to kill all of us, Cboyd is really tough and Timber can fight as well. I just keep everyone healed. We are having a great time killing lions. Killing lions is great….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in West Commonlands. Timber teleported, Cboyd and I to WC after a long day of adventuring. She just got this spell and we were all looking forward to using it. Ouch! A druid is hitting me. I’m running for safety but that druid is fast. Cboyd is fighting the druid and is saving my life. Man, that was close! Timber is so funny, she makes funny mistakes like that sometimes. To bad we can’t keep hunting stuff, Cboyd’s real life girlfriend needs him for something, but that’s cool. KoS stuff isn’t fun….Roar!<br>
<br>
I am in Overthere. Man, I love this zone. My group just shoots arrows at the mobs and they run up to us. Whack, Bam, Boom and they are dead. Sometimes a Dark Elf guard walks by and tries to kill our warrior and wizard, but I don’t care really because they don’t try to kill me. And if they do kill anyone, I can just bring them back to life anyway. Only thing is that those silly guards really, really slow down our experience earning. Verant was pretty stupid for putting those guards in just wandering around like that. Verant isn’t smart….Roar!<br>
<br>
I am in Karnor’s Castle. My class owns! I just walk into this zone and people want me to join their groups. Exp is flowing like water here, but there aren’t many l3wt’s here for me. That’s okay tho, because I’m just trying to level as fast as I can so that I can join the best guild on the server, &lt;Uberrus&gt;. Hey, what is our monk doing? Pull for god’s sake, I’m full-mana. No, don’t go afk we don’t have time for that! It’s 11pm and I have class at 9am tomorrow, that only leaves me with 7 hours to play tonight before I have to go to bed…so pull, damn you pull! Ugh, slow pullers….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in Icewell Keep. &lt;Uberrus&gt; Roxxor’s. I hit level 53 and joined right away. I’ve only been in the guild for 2 weeks, but I already know how everything works and how Uber my guild is compared to others. I heard this guy talking about &lt;Uberrus&gt; and I flamed him good, bro. I so belong to this guild! Man, when someone flames us, you better watch out cuz I’m coming with both barrels d00d! Wha? Who’s that? Haha, what an idiot…he’s lost. How did this idiot get down in the dain pit? Stop inspecting me you stupid, n00b. Omg, get him outta here…if we kill the dain he will try to steal our phat l00t’s! Fear me l0ser n00b….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in Kael. &lt;Cboyd’s Crusaders&gt; are here trying to kill the “Might Giant of all Giants”. They are a bunch of f*ckin gimps, man. Ha, ha…what kinda tactic are they using? Omfg, they are all binding up here…holy shiznit. L.O.S.E.R.S. Look at the zergling rush! I can’t believe they are using a zergling rush like that. We can kill this guy with no problem and we don’t use gimp tactics like that anymore. Haha, no way…is Cboyd wielding duel “Adequate-blades-of-non-uberness”?? What a loser. Maybe if he spent more time in game, instead of hanging out with his dumb-a$$ girlfriend, he would have some good weapons. Cboyd’s guild sucks….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are in Western Wastes. &lt;Uberrus&gt; is going to North Temple of Veeshan, baby! And we are going to rock it! We know how to pull everything there now, and we know everything about the place. This is going to own so hardcore! 10 hours from now, we will be the first guild on any server to clear this whole place…@#%$ that is going to be sw333t! WTF, why is Timber sending me a tell? Holy @#%$, she is still level 45…what a loser! How can she still be level 45 when she can solo, I can’t solo and I’m level 60. Get real, I’m not going back to Cobalt Scar to rez you. Are you sick in the head. I’m in Western Wastes, babe. Only time I’m in Cobalt scar is to run thru that zone. Only n00b’s die in that zone. Incoming ToV….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are on Rant’s and Flames. Ha, ha. Did you guys read what &lt;Cockjockeys&gt; and &lt;Anal-Plungers&gt; wrote about us on Rants and flames? They are such losers. They just copy everything that we do, and then they claim that we kill their mobs. I say that if we have the power to kill the mob and you don’t, well…I guess it’s just too bad for you then huh? Get your shiznit together before you wanna play with the big boys, b*tch. Reservations….Roar!<br>
<br>
We are the best of everything! Everyone wants to be us, except for gimps that don’t know that they want to be us yet. Cboyd’s guild imploded and even he wants to join us now, hahaha…fear that gimp trying to join us. Other guilds are combining forces to try to take our spawns, but it just ain’t going to happen, bro. We are just t00 l00t and t00 st0ng! WE ARE UBER!<br>
<br>
So you still wanna be uber?<br>
<br>
This, of course, is not modeled after any guild, per se. More like a general model of alot of high-end guilds on a few servers that I've been privvy too.<br>
<br>
If this isn't your attitude, your not yet uber. <br>

Just curiouse though: you said pissed sob story reminded ya of that.  Though the way I took it Pissed said his ole bud was trying to get gear that pissed had, then backed down after pissed loged on.  It sounded to me like completely the oposite of the story you dug up.  Imagine a non uber person blowing off a uber one (or at least one with better gear, since the other mage was trying to get gear the shafted mage already has).<br>
<br>
Pissed, level..level hard, after you rock his arse in levels (and he hears you ding a few over him), ditch the guild.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uhobiewankenobe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Hobiewankenobe</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://myweb.thump.net/1363/pictures/Gonn.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#333333>(6/25/02 4:38:50 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.thump.net/1363/pictures/Gonn.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: UBAR</span><hr size=1> While yes, some people get that attitude, it's not always the case. <br>

That is no friend by any definition I go by. I am happy when someone levels, or gets any item they want. <br>
<br>
It is time to find a new guild, and some friends that are as happy for you, as you are for them.<br>

<br>
I'm more of a reactive person - ie, I'd tell him to spit out what's wrong, and insist until he tells me. If he didn't, or if he did make up phoney excuses, I would honestly tell him what I think of that attitude. And the filter over here wouldn't permit me to =) . <p><p><center><img src=http://utenti.tripod.it/Sirya22a/duke></p>

I am afraid your &quot;friend&quot; hasnt a clue what EQ is about.. there is no race to level, no &quot;I got the uberest gear&quot; that lets you sit back, and say, wow, I beat the game. There is no &quot;winning&quot; EQ. This game is the best example I know of for the saying, &quot;its not the destination, its the journey&quot; I have seen too many take the attitude that if they can outlevel, or get better equipment, then they are somehow superior players. To win in EQ is to gain the ability to log on and smile because your there. To have friends greet you, to experience a good hunt.. to test yourself against the mobs and your own abilities to accomplish what you want to do. My most memorable times rarely encompass how much xp I managed that day, or what loot I was able to get. There will always be selfish people in eq concerned only with what you can do for them, or view you as competition for that uber item that somehow will make them the best... and thats sad.. but dont let them get you down either... there are also some amazing people in the game... that amaze with their willingness to share, to help, to show a true spirit of nobility. Levels and loot are just a matter of time, period. If someone has to tear down others and try to climb over them to get there faster, then they are pretty pathetic because they havent a clue. Pity your &quot;friend&quot;... shake your head sadly...and move on to somewhere where there are people that make you feel good about logging in. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umalchite.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Malchite</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 4:29:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=261.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: over reacting?</span><hr size=1>   Man i feal so bad for you pissed, i don't know what i would do if my best friend did that to me, or any friend.
