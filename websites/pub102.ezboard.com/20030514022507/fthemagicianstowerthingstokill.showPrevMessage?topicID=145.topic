<br>
Now the time has come to move into the world, and I have met ppl, and we typically go take on a spawn with 3-4 mobs.<br>
<br>
How can a mage help in breaking a spawn? If one hasnt a enchanter or some other crowd-control groupmember, what to do then ??<br>
<br>
We tried some fancy stuff yesterday, pulling with long range bolt, and other group members picking 1 or 2 mobs off the ensuing 3-4 mob train, but that is hardly the way to do it eh?<br>
<br>
Also, if you pull that off, and kill whole spawn, they will all repop at the same second, giving same headache again. LOL.<br>
<br>
Any way for a mage to be helpful in such situations?<br>

Well first off in group mages have one main job, We assist, we can do other things, our pet can tank, we can nuke, we can even heal (100 bind wounds right here Woot!) just very poorly, but mainly we make great assisters, so first off, whenever you get in group find out who is main tank, this guy is the person you will have targeted half the time second, have an assist button, put it on a hot key page, and have it be /assist thats all it has to be, and keep your tank targeted before he pulls, when he gets there hit your assist button and sic your pet ( i also believe your assist button can be /assist &lt;tank name&gt; but i'm not sure of this), then DS the tank with  your most recent damage shield (always keep your main tank DSed, IMO it does more damage than our biggest nukes at the levels mana wise, right now at 41 my DS works out to about 600 damage total for only 100mana) after this, you can either med, nuke the mob once, malise the mob, up to you, depending on how my mana is doing and how many other mobs we have to fight I may or may not nuke, but thats up to you to decide when you feel comfortable nuking, and when you think you need to med, now you will fight this way no matter if you have crowd control or not, if you have a chanter, he should throw AE mez and everything but the one you are all fightig should me mezzed and you drop the mobs one at a time, if you dont' have crowd control, you'll still fight the same way, cause your group should always all be on the same mob, so as an answer to your question, if you wanna help break up spawns, learn to ASSIST, <br>
btw some other notes on how to be great in group, If you wanna impress folks, and get your name circulating as a mage worth having around, there is one main thing you have got to learn, its not when to nuke (though this is good tolearn), its not to DS the tank (though this is also good to learn) the only thing that a group sees in a mage, is how well you control your pet, your pets your weapon, use him well, and the group will love ya, break a chanters mez with em more than once, and the group will hate you, get good with /pet calm down, or in even more dire circumstances /pet get lost (better to lose ones pet, then lose ones Cleric because he got agged on becuase he healed the chanter, who was getting his face beat in, cause the mob he was trying to mez keeps getting broke by your pet)<br>
also get good with your assist button, you can avoid most problems if you simply make sure your on the same thinking with your tank, also i'd suggest letting a fight start before siccing your pet, let the tank start the fight, let the chanter lay down some crowd control, and after you have made sure your siccing your pet on the same mob your tank is fighting, then send him, better late then at the wrong mob. Also some other suggestions, first off, when your puller grabs too many and your chanter is gonna have a tough time mezzing em all, good way to make a chanter buddy is to hold your pet back and assist em if he gets in trouble, /tell em before hand to let him now what your planning to do, but if the tank pulls 5, your chanter mezzes three and two rush him, sic your pet on one of em, then mash back off, this gives the chanter time to land his stun, you to get your pet out, and him to land mez, its risky at times, but with practice, you'll have a friend for life if Jabober saved your chanter from two mobs beating him into a lil pulp, <br>
Okay one other thing then i gotta go, while i'm on the subject of chanters, and other what not, i was lookig at my spell book the other day and i noticed my level 39 AE based around caster nuke Flame Arc, its 173 damage to all mobs around me for 179 mana, now there is only one problem with it, I have to run up between all of them and try to cast it, and so far my sucess rate at that is 0 to 372, its suicide cause mobs hate casters at highere levels and will let the tank beat on em, if it means hitting your soft skinned hide, BUT, the other day i was sitting there and i my groups tank pulled 3 mobs (we were in OT, it was a rhino, a sarnak, and a cacti for those of you taking notes)<br>
well the tank yelled rhino first, then knight, so he got up there turned around and started in on the Rhino, i tabbed assist, checked to make sure it read rhino, and sent Jabober in to kick some butt, the chanter mezzed the other two with AE mez, i renewed the DS on the Tank, the Druid healed the tank once, and we all medded, well after the rhino dropped , the tanks started in on the knight, well bout this time Mez broke and the cacti rushed our chanter, well i stood up to assist the tank, i noticed the chanter ran up to the tank so the knight, and cacti were next to each other, he then proceeded to stun lock the both of em , the knight dropped quickly, then they finished the cacti<br>
i sent the chanter a tell and asked him if he always stunned on two mobs to go ( btw it it tough finding a chanter who stuns, most chanters don't utilize all the abilites they have ) he answered no, go right ahead and my mage brain started turning, I asked him if he minded if i thru in an AE nuke the next time he stunned, he answered yes, so i summoned Flame Arc, and we told our tank to pull two, well he came up with a berzerker and a knight, the chanter ran down to stun so i ran down, and started casting as soon as his first stun hit,his second stun hit and then Baam! my AE nuke hit, 173 damage to both of the mobs for 179 mana, I just did around 350 damage for 180 mana, and had a spell graphic to boot, and i softened up the next mob for the tanks, now i'll explain why this works, first off the stun lets you cast, cause they can't swing for 10 seconds, easily enough time for you to get your nuke off, second, mobs gain less aggro while stunned, normally AE is a bad idea cause you risk agging all of them but if you can get em stunned, AE is great for the mana efficiency (and the kick ass spell graphics ) so find a good chanter, get him to trust you, and throw in those AE! anyway i've jabbed till i can't jab no more, hope this helps<br>

Outdoors, druids and rangers rule in this area with harmony. It is far and away the best camp-breaking tool out there. Enchanters don't so much break camps as they fix bad pulls -- the results are often the same, but the mechanics and method is very different.<br>
<br>
Assuming you do not have any of these options, here's the way you'd do it.<br>
<br>
Assuming a camp of 3 mobs for this scenario...<br>
<br>
Have the tank pull, and have the healer ready to heal like there's no tomorrow. Pull a mob, which will pull the camp. Once the tank starts meleeing a mob, EVERYONE should /assist on him. Keep hammering away at the first mob until it's dead. Hammer this one hard and fast, as taking out the first mobs early will drastically reduce the damage your group takes.<br>
<br>
Wait for the main tank to melee the next target, and have everyone /assist him. Keep hammering.<br>
<br>
Do this until all mobs are dead. Now comes the tricky part.<br>
<br>
In most camps, the mobs will repop on their own timers, not as a group. And they're usually on the same delay, beginning when the mob is killed. As soon as mob one repops in, pull it before mob two comes in, and take it out.<br>
<br>
When the second mob pops in, pull it before the third one pops in if you can. Dispatch mob 2.<br>
<br>
When the third mob pops in, let it sit there for a minute or so. Then pull it.<br>
<br>
Take out mob one when it pops back in, and then when mob two pops in, let it sit there for half a minute before pulling.<br>
<br>
From here on in, pull them each as soon as they pop in.<br>
<br>
The idea behind all this is that each mob will respawn after a set time passes after its death. By staggering the time between deaths, you are staggering the time between spawns and spacing them out a bit. Once you have done this, holding the area is cake.<br>
<br>
Key things to note, which are always good advice but especially important when breaking camps via brute force.<br>
<br>
- Never take on a camp that is too big for you. If you can't take down 5 at once without a reasonable chance of success, either move on or build up your group. There is no downtime worse than death.<br>
<br>
- Always damage shield your tank BEFORE he pulls the camp. Buffs count for taunt purposes, and if he's pulled with an arrow doing one point of damage, you will probably get the mobs on you. Also, the damage shield will damage the extra mobs while you're taking down the first one, so they'll be that much easier to kill when it's their turn.<br>
<br>
- Make sure the healer knows about the taunt factor of healing. Things can go very very badly if all the extras decide the cleric is lunch because he healed the guy fighting their friend. Having a secondary melee type designated to aid the cleric in this event, then turn back to the main target once the mob is sufficiently taunted off of the cleric helps.<br>
<br>
- Of course, start the mega-pull fully buffed, healed, and medded. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But at level 12 in North Ro, I used to try to break up the derv camp, and even did it a few times with just me and a warrior (at level 14 or 15).<br>
<br>
What we did was use AE.  At this level, your AE is worth using.  I think your Column of Fire is the spell I used. (this was back in June last year or earlier).  Our warrior would pull for us, and I'd put my pet on a mob (not the one the warrior was on).  The warrior would attempt to taunt all mobs around him and I'd use AE spells to take them down.  If something agroed on me, the warrior would taunt it off me and then I'd AE again.  Once the mobs got to low health, they ran.  We'd kill one and wait for them to return, and kill another.<br>
<br>
When respawn came around we'd always have less numbers, either 2 or 1 for the first pull, and then take our time to get what's left. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/useek9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seek 9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#333333>(10/11/00 5:11:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How to break a spawn?</span><hr size=1> I vote that Ashby's post go into the library.

<br>
ST is basically a single target mez with a built-in mem blur. If we need to break up a room with three goblins in it, my wife will ST one of the goblins. Provided it isn't resisted, that goblin will stay put while the other two come to kill my wife.<br>
<br>
We pull those two a safe distance from the mezzed gobbie, then we set the pets on one of the two pulled goblins. Then she ST's the extra until we're ready to fight it.<br>
<br>
The earlier post about timing the spawns is a very important aspect of EQ. In my previous career as a paladin I was almost always the group's puller, unless a monk was present. I went out and invested in a cheap $2.00 stopwatch which I still keep next to my computer and use all the time.<br>
<br>
Spawn timing varys a little from zone to zone. Some examples would be: Qeynos Sewers repop in 1 minute, Permafrost repops in 24 minutes, Upper Guk seems to repop every 16 minutes, Sol A repops every 20 minutes, Lower Guk (if memory serves) repops every 28 minutes, PoF repops every 14 HOURS. Also sometimes specific spawns repop at a different interval than the rest of the zone. The Priest of Najena, Reckless Efreeti, fire giants, and dragons are good examples of this.<br>
<br>
When breaking a camp, start your stopwatch the instant the first mob dies. If you know the repop time, then you'll know when the camp will start to reappear. As was stated in an earlier post, each individual spawn will spawn that amount of time after his own death, so once you can pull them alone, the camp generally becomes cake. One notable exception seems to be the Shadowed Men camps. Their entire camp respawns at once sometimes.<br>
<br>
As a mage, you have only one camp breaking spell at your disposal, and it's not a very good one: earth pet root. I used root a lot when pulling as a paladin. A lot of people think root is a crappy &quot;anti-run&quot; spell, because mobs can still attack while rooted, it's broken by damage to the mob, and it cancels superior spells like snare and engulfing darkness. In reality root isn't an anti-run spell at all, it is an incredibly useful pulling tool. If you pull more mobs than you want you can always pull one away from the fight and root it. Root will stick for 30 seconds or more if the mob isn't taking damage.<br>
<br>
The point of that meandering last paragraph was that a skilled mage might be able to use root to break up a spawn. It would be difficult, I have a hard time getting my earth pet to leave the attack radius of the rooted victim, but I believe it's possible in a pinch. I'm not sure if earth pet root is anywhere near as effective as standard root, but it's all we mages have. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 32nd Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uezno.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ezno</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/posticons/eyes.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 185<br> <font color=#333333>(10/11/00 7:56:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Breaking camps</span><hr size=1> <br>
Ashby's post pretty much sums it up.   A Magician's job in breaking a spawn is to help take out the targeted MoB as quickly as possible.   Make sure you cast dmg shield on the tank(s) -- this is the most efficient damage spell in the game.  <br>
<br>
Once you gain in levels (not sure how effective this is at lvl 12) you can use your pet as semi-crowd control.   There are many places in the game where wandering MoBs walk near spawns.  If you are breaking a spawn site and a wanderer happens by and attacks you, a healer, or another caster you can have your pet back off the main target and send it against the wanderer.  This will keep the tank from having to switch targets, taunt the MoB off, and switch back to the main.   I've also been able to successfully use this technique when a cleric's heal aggro'd a MoB to get the MoB off of the cleric.   <br>
<br>
Working with Enchanters:  One thing I've always found odd is, when working with Enchanters, if/when your pet gets on a different target than the called target (and there is no way of preventing this sometimes) a lot of enchanters want you to back off your pet so that they may remez the MoB.   This can sometimes prove to be quite inefficient.   The main thing to remember is that, with the pet on the MoB it has the same (and perhaps even better) effect than if the MoB was Mez'd.  The pet is occupying it and to waste two caster's time trying to coordinate getting the pet off the MoB and the MoB remezz' can be inefficient.  It is sometimes more efficient to just kill off the main target and choose the one the pet is on as the next target.  When you are working with an enchanter that you are used to working with it is easy to get the pet off of a MoB and it mezzed, but when working with new people its easier to just leave the pet there and resummon if the pet ends up dying.   <p> <br>

There is no way really for a mage to do the trick. (Break spawn).<br>
<br>
Snare was not mentioned. Isnt it also a possibility to pull, snare a nr 2 and 3 mob, and then have more time to distract a few of the mobs, if your group is strong enuf to fight one mob each? I for sure am strong enought to maybe kill 2 blues with my mob. (Yeah, its nice to be a lvl 12 :-)).<br>

Mages can break spawns of 2 blues.  Once you get a spawn of 3 you are pushing it.   In a group it is more effective to use some of the stated tactics above to break the spawn.   If you have a group of 3 going up against a spawn of 3 it is far more effective for the group to concentrate on one MoB at a time rather than split the MoBs between them.  <p> <br>

<br>
  Pull Using your Cancel magic / nullify magic Line of spells.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I can solo at the Hole using this method and clear all 7 of the entrance mobs at my leisure. I have also tried it on many other mobs and It works even in tight camps. Nullify does not do damage and does not aggro other mobs that are linked.<br>

  You mean you pull one at a time with Cancel Magic when they are blue or higher to you?<br>
  If so, I'll have to try that one.  But if they are green, I don't believe they'd come at you more than one at a time anyway.<br>

I have used it before in other situation but always while grouped. This weekend I found that it works amazingly well. Give it a try, I would love to think that it would work for breaking up Orc camps and such.<br>
<br>
 I have only really tested it in a dungeon situation, but I would think the outdoors even easier. <br>
<br>
<br>
Yes im using it for blues. And they are linked together, (total 5) and very aggro, if 1 sees me they would all aggro. At the Hole, There are 7 Mobs at the entrance before the stairs. I can single pull all 7 using Null. I have used it other places, but never to single pull blue mobs in a dungeon.<br>

Any other spells that are low level that would give the same effect? <br>
<br>
- Anyway, with this tactic, I can break a spawn.<br>
- With Hodgies tactics, I can fight without a healer together with melee. And melee myself at lowlvl.<br>
<br>
So basically, I dont need crowd control and a healer, hehe, beat that.<br>

<br>
But using this tactic a Mage can break and clear groups of mobs solo without losing a single pet, or even getting Hit once.<br>
<br>
Again it may not work in all situations or on Mobs much higher level then yourself, but I have so far found it almost Uber- in terms of pulling.<br>
<br>
The spells you can use are:<br>
<br>
Cancel Magic (12)<br>
Nullify Magic (34) - The one I have been using at 52<br>
Annul Magic (53)<br>

 You make a pet and wait FM. pull the whole camp/room, and gate to the other sideof zone. Come back invis as fast as possible, and wait for only one mob to be left. make a pet, kill it. etc.. Just regular feign pulling).<br>
 The best way to do it for non stupid mobs if there are 3 or 4 int he room (most dungeon mobs), is in fact to target a mob in the room (invis if u ca't target them without aggroing non invis), then make your pet while keeping the mob targeted (don't handle weapons to your pet, dont buff it). Then press pet attack. All the mobs will start punching your pet first, inside the room. Quickly, one of them will leave your pet and go out of the room to come to you. Gate then, come back, and kill that single mob).<br>
 Only way i found to make cooks or Tower solo in Mistmoore at 49. And i must say it's risky, too=).<br>

Clerics are great for this. The have a reduce aggression spell(lull, sooth, etc.) stun and root. Have the cleric sooth all. Then let him med a sec. Get a the puller sow'ed if possible then have them pull. As mutliples coming running out have cleric hit one with a stun and root. You can do 1 of 2 things. let sowed puller run around with a train while you kill this single OR continiue to stun and root mobs off until you can get it down to 1. I like the first option, cause with the second you must maintain more roots. and make sure the one you are killing is out of melee range of all the others that are rooted, plus it can eat a clerics mana up. But is the first option is available i would do that. then once the single is killed have him run the train by and pick one off with a stun, then kill it. It also leaves the respawn times well spaced out <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showPrevMessage?topicID=60.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showNextMessage?topicID=60.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=60.topic&index=16><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.threadControl?topicID=60.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=60.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill>The Hunt</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
