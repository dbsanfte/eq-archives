Cleric/enc/wiz spells take precidence over mag.<br>
<br>
Glad I am not in FoH, if that is the case. <br>
<br>
I know it is your guild and your rightly proud of it, but being told my time I invested in the game is less valuable than other classes would piss me off.<br>
<br>
I know you agree with that sentiment they should get them first, but we will have to agree to disagree on that one. My time is as valuable as their's and I would be royally PO'd being told I have no right to any new spells till all the cleric wizards enchanters get there's. In fact I know I would not stand for it, no on should really in my opinoin.<br>

Kinda a no brainer.  Believe me I will get my spells, its just clerics go first as they benefit the most people at one time.<br>
<br>
Plus we have 3 active magicians (4 really but 1 is a tanks alt and another is not guilded as of this time) vs 12 or so wizards 12 or so clerics etc etc.  So not being first in line for parchment is not a huge issue, besides I am only 61 we have people 65 already missing 5 levels of spells should I take precedent over them when I cant even use most of my new spells? <p><hr>

FoH is probably the best guild across servers so there is no telling how many mobs they are able to clear in a 5 hour span to get 10 drops. I think that is the point being overlooked. Yes you know you will get spells because you are in a uber guild ect...I really don't believe everyone should have to go through this crap. Ubers need to understand that you can be a hard-core gamer (i.e. experience and spend 8+ hours a day online), and not be in a min/max guild.<br>
<br>
I don't feel I should have to join one of the top 3 guilds on my server to get spells that balance the class. Ancient spells should be rare and caster loot. Normally spells should be accessible to all casters with some effort. 12hours per parchment drop is insane for a 6 man group of level 61 to 62 players. Casters improve by loot as well however our spells are mainstays. We shouldn't be double penalized. I mean you can't possibly think that two mages with complete spell books are equal if one is wearing top-end Luclin gear and the other is in a tola rob. I know for a fact that i am more powerful with my BoBC then a mage without them. Loot is very important and mages seem to benefit the most from loot more then any caster class. No class should be double penalized like this.<br>
<br>
Also I have put in 2 1/2 years in EQ. I have two level 60 epic characters, and consider myself a &quot;hard-core&quot; player. Just because I choose not to be in a min/max guild doesn't mean I should have basic spells that balance the class held from me. Ancient Spells and Loot should seperate you and me, not the fact that I have 4 or 5 spells in my spell book due to nothing more then a insane time sink made to benefit the uber. I also feel that I am just as important as the cleric next to me. I have invested alot of time in EQ, and to be pushed aside to allow &quot;loved classes&quot; to have first dibbs over me would not go over well. It is those reasons why I am not in a uber guild.<br>
<br>
I spent 35 hours killing named mobs and white/yellow cons and saw two parchment drop. I got one and turned it in and got fire bolt of tallon. I am sorry but spending over 35 hours experience since release makes me a hard core gamer and to have only the store purchased spell is crap.  I know a great number of non-guilded folk that play there class at a high level. I am willing to bet some would make alot of ubers look silly.  This is a game and the basic workings like spells ect..should be accessible to all with some work. This is like the mage epic revisited.<br>

<br>
Also was there 60 people at those camps you got 10 spells in 5 hours at?<br>
<br>
Of course if you did, they wouldn't be hard to get, as you said they weren't bad at all.<br>
<br>
If it was a group of 6 or 12, and you got not even one parchment, that is wrong IMO.<br>
<br>
Mage damage has gotten a nice upgrade to make you a viable damage dealer, and the level 61-62 parchments are different than than the 63-65 variety. So it doesn't explaine why you didn't even get one of those, I do agree the higher level parchements should go to those people who can use them now, and not later, but you waiting till all the rest of the clerics enchanters and wizards get them is wrong, as I see it.<br>
<br>
I wonder once they get them if you will have to wait till the Shaman get all their new buffs, and all the druids get there improved heals as well.<br>
<br>
Not saying you will, but I hate seeing posts that suggest 3 tother classes need for spells are greater than my own. Weather right or wrong, it cheapens the class into a wannabe/not important/you can wait type of class.<br>
<br>
I can see a pickup group saying this as well. Listen Mage01 like all Uberguilds it was determined that Clerics/Enchanters/ and Wizards should all get there spells first, so you won't get a shot at any parchments. I am sure you understand that our need is greater than yours, as it will benifit any and all groups we join, and yes we know you will suffer, but it won't be as long as you think etc...<br>
<br>
Yes I know you won't be in a pickup group, but the thought process is exactly the same, but instead of a pickup group it is your friends and guild mates basically saying that to you, and with our new spells and pets, you will do more than respectable damage compaired to a wizard. Maybe not as much on some mobs, and maybe more on others. <br>

<br>
Do all of you know there are THREE OTHER WAYS to get spells right? I'm gonna repeat that just in case y'all missed it.<br>
<br>
THREE OTHER WAYS<br>
<br>
Three quest ways. Off 3 NPCs. One wants us to extract the spells from items that have charges of the spells in them, another wants us to combine new runes/pages/components to make new spells (like the old days) and the final one wants us to combine old spells to make new ones. Myself and a few other people are wracking our brains on these new spells and could use the collective brainpower of the rest of you mages out there to get thinking! See the other threads (one is even STICKIED) and burn some grey matter. This is why Verant will not up the drop rate on parchments, because it is only supposed to constitute 1/4 of the total spells. <br>
<br>
I personally am partial to the quest about combining older spells, and am trying to make serious headway on that one. However, the entire caster community seems to be stumped. So, help out! <br>

Also what about talisman of return or the blades of walnan the new pet I mean we are talking hardcore dps there. The problem with your guild as I see it is they are so brainwashed with the holy trinity they really havent taken a close look at these spells.

They're practicing something called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>teamwork</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  They have a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>plan</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and they're <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>working together</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to accomplish it.<br>
<br>
It obviously works very well for Jaytee, just click on his Magelo profile.  Do you think he got all that great stuff by yelling, &quot;Me, me, me, me!!!!&quot;?  No...he's the powerful mage he is because he's a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>team player</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
The proof is in the pudding.  Do the mages complaining about FoH's &quot;unfair&quot; treatment have as a good a gear as Jaytee?  No?  Then maybe Jaytee and his guild <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>know what they're doing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I've turned down nice items because other guildmates could use them better.  It really does work.  FoH is just setting priorities and they all know they're going to be taken care of.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=363562" target="top">Shazar Oom, 61 Arch Mage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.eqheroes.com" target="top">Heroes of Luclin</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silverbladetheenchanter>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magi Draconis</span><br>  Posts: 2136<br> <font color=#333333>(10/26/02 4:51:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1625.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: comment</span><hr size=1> For guilds who do NOT have access to VT (and lvl IV focus), parchments are actually pretty good to go to mages because of FOCUS ITEM SUMMONS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
... yes but since the spells are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>randomly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> distributed.... <br>
<br>
you in fact will not get 100 different spells .... <br>
<br>
not sure of how much the random rate is .... <br>
<br>
as in example of kunark trade in spells... <br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NEVER</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got the 53 air pet after at least 30 spells i traded in .... end up buying it <br>
<br>
if it's completely random for ALL the spells you get .... it's very hard to get the spell you wanted.. or needed.. <br>
<br>
you can of course look at it as casters' loots ... but the thing is with melee loots you know what you are going to get ... i.e. what weapon from what mob... <br>
<br>
you don't have to take rusty weapon_01 from boss_01 to trade in for <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>something</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that you may have already and can't use .... <br>
<br>
this is a bit unfair ... since <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>all</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spells from 61-65 cannot be bought .... <br>
<br>
note: i haven't done the research path to get spells... but from what i've heard it's nothing much easier than the spell drops either .... this just suck ... <br>
<br>
and remeber even at kunark times how many mages are without muzzle of mardu .... <br>
<br>
expect the same ratio that doesn't have 65 spells since u require to kill higher things to get 65 drops probably ... <br>
<br>
just IMO about the drop rate...<br>

I'm not even convinced these quests really lead to anything, and may be incomplete or broken. Some spell combinations have been found, but a couple seem broken (three were found the first day, two remain incomplete despite there being more people working on them). The one for breaking down items is even worse, nothing with an effect that I've tried has worked. Haven't worked on the words and runes, but someone else has tried nearly every single combination of level 49 words and runes with no successes. These quests could be fun, but IMO it's just too much guesswork and not enough actual puzzle solving. Guesswork really just amounts to being lucky, not good.<br>
<br>
Ethereal parchments should be much more common. Folks just will not be able to advance too far in PoP without their spell upgrades, and at the very least we should have access to our basic spells sooner than we do now. Hell, I've seen more pieces of actual gear drop than parchments (in point of fact, I have seen zero parchments drop).  Wouldn't bug me much if the spectral and shadowy parchments were hard to get, especially on the first tier of planes. But Ethereal Parchments just shouldn't be as rare as they are now.<br>
