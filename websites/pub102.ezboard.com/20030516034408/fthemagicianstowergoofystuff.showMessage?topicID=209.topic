<br>
I was in DS on Saryn server a few days ago when I hear the standard &quot;Train to NL!!&quot; shout.  I wasn't too concerned because we were off a ways...far enough to avoid aggro, close enough to watch the massacre.<br>
<br>
A massacre is what it was.  Four rockhoppers went straight to the zone and proceeded to simply decimate about 20 newbies in as few of seconds.  It was horrible, yet fascinating to watch.  That wasn't the kicker.<br>
<br>
While the slaughtering was happening, the rockhoppers went inside the little &quot;temple&quot; that leads to the NL zone.  All four of them are in there...this is important to the story.<br>
<br>
Here comes a lvl 30-ish rogue.  He is running his little heart out to go to the NL zone.  I see him run in.  About 3 seconds later, I see him run out with all 4 rockhoppers on him.  Heh, he lasted about 5 steps.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, there was a happy ending to this story.  A really nice epic cleric (Gordna?) came and rezzed everyone.<br>
<br>
I would have taken a screenshot but I was laughing to hard...heh.<br>

When we decided to call it a day, I gated to nexus and he just feigned and quit out i guess. well a few minutes later while I am about to camp, I see some naked people in nexus that were grouping in ME (recognized 5 people who were grouping out there) Thats when it dawned on me!

<br>
The first one, we were sitting in Maestro's lair, at the throne, pulling to there.  Not sure how, but the puller manages to bring back about 20 mobs or so.  Knowing we're about to get wiped out, I hit my Invisibility and try not to aggro anything.  I succeed!  The raid gets wiped, clerics camped, but nothing ever aggroed on me.<br>
<br>
This one is more recently, I have my epic now, and we were allowed to use pets.  A single spite golem is in camp, but nobody dispels it (We were just getting up, nobody had it loaded), so it runs SoWed when it gets low on HP.  Eventually it returns, with about another 20 friends.  This is an 18 person raid by the way.  It's 20 friends include The Deathrot Knight.  We have one enchanter, and our main tank is a 60 Ranger.  We kicked ass, a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> lot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of it.  /flex  The pets alone (We had like 3 Epic Mages there) tanked like half the train.<br>
<br>
Now, for the mother of all trains.  The train to end all trains, you will NEVER see anything like this again.  Again, in Hate, this time I was on a pickup-raid, with a bunch of people I didn't know (Back when I was camping in Hate for my Staff), and our puller is a 46 Monk who's never pulled or raided before.  A GM has told me before that on each floor of Hate are approximately 100-120 mobs.  Can you guess what this guy managed to pull?  The ENTIRE first floor.  At once.  To the camp.  This is a 70 person raid.  We got taken down in the time it took me to type &quot;/shout HOLY S***!&quot;, about 5 seconds.  Most impressive train I've ever seen, ever.  Beats out even bugged Ring Wars in the Great Divide. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uginneh.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ginneh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(10/16/02 8:07:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Sorry man was my fault had a bad pull, and had to run with the hoppers on me and well the cleric was a friends 60 cleric that I was grouped with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/ustehle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stehle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(10/22/02 6:47:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> np.  it was hilarious to watch.  i probably would have tried to help if I wasn't laughing so hard.  everyone in our group (even those who died) thought it was pretty amusing.  no harm, no foul. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=qaedainmagikot@themagicianstower>Qaedain Magikot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 839<br> <font color=#333333>(10/25/02 8:01:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=209.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> ME train:<br>

An old guild of mine was doing a run on Mistmoore, a druid was running late to the event so by the time she got their we had cleared to the top of the ramp. We went in to the castle and everyone got wiped in the first room except for a few. We all got Rezzes but we started hearing in Guild Chat, &quot;Help got four on me&quot; Well we weren't ready, rezz effects, no mana, etc, about a minute later same thing, we got a pop things started happening, about 45 minutes later we get a tell from an alt of the Druid. <br>
<br>
She had bound herself at the bottom of the ramp to the castle in Mistmoore when there wasn't anything there.<br>
<br>
There were so many corpse on the ground my first reaction was to get consent and try to spell out the guilds name. We got her a lot of rezzes and helped her get back the 5 levels she lost.<br>

<br>
I had discovered that I could get upwards of 2 plat a run on rusty weaps, and i figured this last run was going to get me that nice shiny Mino Axe, so I decided to push it just a bit.  By a bit I mean encumbered 152/75.  Of course I tried to take a shortcut.<br>
<br>
So I got myself a bit lost on the way back and found after about 15 minutes what I thought at last was the zone to the Greater Faymart.  This was a relief because I'd picked up a couple of orcs.  I thought I was just about to escape a pretty bad train.  <br>
<br>
I zoned in to &quot;Seven Silvers to Zone!&quot;  and face to face with a charming darkelf girl in full plate.<br>
<br>
They hit me so hard that the knockback threw me back out of the zone when I died and I found my corpse sitting outside MM, waiting patiently in a nice safe place to be looted.<br>
<br>
I never did.  The next day I made my mage.  90 str, 90 sta, 90 int determined I would never screw up my stats and be too weak to carry my loot again.

Being in a small guild we couldnt get ot the castle to get the drop one of our members wanted. I was talking ot a 55+ wizzie friend of mine named Plasma (awesome wizzie name). He offered to help us. Him, another mage and I were at the entrance, the ranger ran into the castle with invis, ran around to wherever he thought he needed to and then ran out and jumped off the cliff to run back. The other mage and I were staying out of the way being in the 30ish level and he brought the whole train strait to the wizzie who lit off his AOE's. There was so much going on my computer almost froze. Well the other mage and I added what we could in rains etc but mainly watched the show as the ranger died, then after a few casts the wizzie also died. This was frightening seeing as there was still 3 or 4 mobs standing, luckily they all had just a sliver of health left and we easily cleaned them up. The looting alone took about a minute for each of us, must have been 40 mobs. It was the most outrageous show of power I had seen up to then and it truly impressed me. Also got the gypsy drop for my epic wihtout knowing what it was, lol. The other mage wasnt too happy, =P.<br>
