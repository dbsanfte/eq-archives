I have to agree it all depends on you.  If you would enjoy playing this game if you had it, then do it.  It's all about fun right?<br>
<br>
If you're doing it JUST for the powerfull pet and item, then I would not bother.  It is usefull in many ways, but for the time spent you could level to 65 and get better equipment/armor in the time it takes to do epic.<br>
<br>
If you are close to finishing, I would definately finish.  Or if you have what I consider to be the 3 big pieces: Earth staff, Air crown, and Quillmane cloak.  If you want to finish it or not, that is a personal choice.  <br>
<br>
What I wanted to address with this thread, and I hope I stumbled my way to it, is that the Epic DOES still have use. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

Oh please... Sorry, didn't realize the level of censorship on this board.<br>
<br>
The original poster has individually insulted every single person who disagreed with him.  Didn't see you comment there?  Interesting...<br>
<br>
There have been a bazillion parses done of PoP pets, many people posting here, showing the the original poster just isn't doing his parses right, or long enough, or against appropriate MOBs to make his point.<br>
<br>
Which was my point.  Lots of people suggesting ways he could make his argument hold a little more water, but he repeatedly posts short parses, limited MOBs, and as a result, with numbers that don't match the vast majority of accepted parse to date.<br>
<br>
Thus, IMO, he doesn't get it.  That's not an insult, or an attack, but an assessment.<br>

<br>
Yes, People have parsed PoP pets.  People have parsed Epic pets.  Yes it's possible for large numbers of people to understand something wrong.  You might note I requested other people run the same parses as me to see what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
Lots of other mages have chimed in and confirmed it.  Epic pet DOES have some great qualities that still shine over PoP pets in some situtions, yes in PoP too.  If you don't believe it, then why don't YOU run some parses with epic pet on the same mobs I was fighting?  Run them 20 times, for 30 min each.  Please!  Then come back here, and tell us your results, I'll be happy to see them.<br>
<br>
If you want to know how to get to the mobs I was fighting, just zone into PoD, run along wall on the right side until you pass the water, then run just a bit farther up.  There is a large field of Rats, Goo, and Larve.  Pull a Rat or goo with Epic pet, and parse his DPS.  Do it solo, do it in groups.  Add in proc damage later, and you'll see what i'm talking about, and what other mages are confirming here.<br>

Since when did it become my full time job to run tests for you?  I made this post, and replied to comments because I want to help other mages see something.  I have a life too, I want to play the game more and spend less time doing tests.  If you don't believe whats being written here, stop complaining and start parsing!  Notice throughout this whole thread I'm asking people to run their own parses.  If I was trying to create a false truth or flat out lying would I be asking people to see for themselves?<br>
<br>
I'm not going to deny I get heated sometimes when posting on this board.  Wouldn't you if people just said &quot;idiot&quot; or &quot;no brain&quot; or whatever else gets thrown at me?  Fact is, I'm challenging the mentality that I saw as incorrect.  Doing that gets people angry.  Sometimes because I could have presented it better, and sometimes because they don't WANT to be wrong.<br>
<br>
Actually, I appreciate many of the comments and corrections that have been made in this thread.  Cyricus had some good tips, as did many others.<br>

<br>
No one ever contested the epic supremacy on non-PoP mobs that happen to be reasonably within its level range ( up to level 56/57 mobs ). Epic will lands its procs, its stun... It will inherently be much better than a pop air pet. I have my doubts that its DPS could surpass that of a 62 water pet, but it is possible; its cold proc and stun add a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
The point is : epic largely becomes much less useful as soon as you get out of the planes where no flag is needed. Is it useless? No... but I prefer the PoP pets.<br>
<br>
So? I'm sure 99% of the mages on this forum knew this. Yes, Epic is great, I loved it, I relished in its power. When I get out of PoP ( I seldom do ) to go to Seb to farm something, I take it out, gladly. I'm sure with LoY we will see a recrudescence of epic pets; the mobs there are not PoP mobs. They have more reasonable hit points, and don't hit for ludicrous amounts of damage. They are mage soloable ( I didn't say they were mage single pullable - but I can solo a dark blue in LoY without too much trouble, bar maybe nameds ).<br>
<br>
So? Why is this thread 7 pages long? Yes, the first parse was on OLD content. Kael isn't exactly today's news. On a mob that is probably not a good one for parses... Just like a soulbinder.<br>
<br>
I still fail to see the point of the original poster - unless he had doubts about the fact that epic &gt; PoP pets on sub-60 content. That's just a given, isn't it? Or maybe ( not a flame, just a thought ) the initial poster recently dinged 61, and thus did not have to spend months when the level 60 cap still existed... And so he didn't have time to just notice how awesome epic is? <p>Forever sharp is the sword of Justice.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=booperbustle>Booperbustle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 45<br> <font color=#333333>(2/28/03 4:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8858.topic&index=128>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Liesa The Bard</span><hr size=1> I think the entire reason Eandori is posting is because so many people are looking at the fact the epic pet is green at level 65 and not looking past that.  A few on the boards are saying the magician epic is useless now, and not worth doing at all.  Eandori seems like a pretty passionate fellow who is just trying to explain his results from testing his own class.  Sure it might have been done in the past, but he's probably hoping he has proven conclusively that the epic pet is still an alternative in some situations.  Pre-epic the highest level pet always prevailed in all situations.  Amazingly a pet that is a *over* ten levels under the highest level summoned pets in the game and can still outdamage and even in some situations outtank those pets is an impressive fact to note.  If he enraged and his proc/stun hit higher level mobs, I'd use him excusively for about everything.  <br>
<br>
That's the point though... He's simply just showing facts for anyone else out there that would read the post.  Just because YOU know this stuff doesn't mean everyone does.  Keep that in mind.  Do you flame newbies for asking simple questions?  If you do you have a demented sense of entertainment.  I used to come here searching for info (still do), and was mostly afraid to post &quot;stupid&quot; questions for fear of getting flamed simply for being ignorant.  Someone that is still working on the epic might be swayed by this thread to actually finish the epic, regardless of the fact it might become obsolete in some situations due to post 60 pets.  And in that regard I think Eandori's original post has plenty of merit.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=222062">Booperbustle Tinkermeister</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

You'll note too that it's only the epicless mages that are angry about the test. It's a bummer because they can't go out and see for themselves in game, and are forced to take peoples word for it. I suspect that they feel like most necros out there who get pissed if you say that a Warrior can dual wield better than a necro! Hehe. They're odd like that.<br>
<br>
Ignoring the illogical bards, etc, out there, the CON of the pet means nothing to me, (it's an NPC!  Helloooo!  Remember that green con giant on the Kromrif Military Leggings quest when you were lower level?  You, like everyone else said, bah, it's green....HOLY CRAP!  NUKE NUKE!  Hehehe) and escaped my notice for a long time till a guildy brought it to my attention. I use the epic and prefer the epic even in PoS against any non-giant-class mob because the kills are still faster! I know that's a horrible thing to say...and have NO idea why that would anger someone , but think about it. The mage epic is arguably the hardest of the epic-quests. I think this is Verants way of not entirely invalidating the quest. I think it was very well done that the epic and each of the 4 61+ pets each have their own advantages and none of them invalidates another. Now a mage has Five pets to choose from, instead of four. Pretty cool I think. I have read 4 parse tests to date, 3 I think on this board, all of which confirm the epics better dps (I've yet to see a test in high tier planes, maybe because these mages there have the high end focus gloves and therefore are on a completly different page, and don't care a wet slap about any of this. But I suspect the results will be similar...or not...don't freak). Get over it, and enjoy the advantage we've been given. . . and if you're a biased naysayer or bard who retired their mage...go get you mage out of the closet, get an epic and see for yourself. Your views would then be given much more validity. And if your a rogue or something complaining that we are just too powerful as a result of all this (hehe)...bring it up with Verant. We're (well, most of us) are okay with it.  <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=163088"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.attbi.com"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordgojirax>LordGojirax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 547<br> <font color=#333333>(2/28/03 8:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8858.topic&index=130>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojhead.jpg width=98 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Liesa The Bard</span><hr size=1> So.... you're saying that a Warrior can Dual Wield better than a Necro?!?!?!<br>

Epic Vs 61 Air</span><hr size=1> i think, what most of the people are disagreeing with is how 'useful' is defined.  i understand that the point is that on pre-pop mobs, and on pop mobs under L60 or so the epic does more damage, and probably tanks better, than the 60+ pets.  that the epic is better in those situations can probably be proven.<br>
<br>
the main issue i have with your points is that there is a line that has to be drawn between 'situationally useful' and 'so situational it is never used'<br>
<br>
for a lot of people, at 65, for real xp camps...it means nothing to say the epic is better on mobs under 60 in old world.  for the simple reason that they are fighting 62+ in pop.  the epic pet is useful in certain situations, i won't argue that.  however, i feel that the epic pet is NOT useful to the majority of L65 xp-group magicians out there, simply because they don't find themselves in those situations with any regularity.<br>
<br>
from my expierience..<br>
farming greens for an item: epic<br>
soloing lt blues when bored: epic<br>
xp group on L62+ mobs: water<br>
duo/trio with pet tanking L62+ mobs: air<br>
<br>
i know where most of my time is spent, and it's not farming or soloing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 3009<br> <font color=#333333>(3/1/03 12:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8858.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pet Parse, Low AC, Spell immune mob.

I stand by my previous assessment of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Liesa</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eandori</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
I respect no authority when it comes to mages.  Any number of archconvokers can be dead wrong.  The emperical method, messy as it may be, is the best tool we have for distinguishing fact from assumption.  This discussion illuminated many of the difficulties in making and interpretting parses, and so is of value.<br>
<br>
Much more valuable than hearsay about the opinions of unidentified archconvokers.<br>
