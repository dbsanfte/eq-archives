<br>
I had no clarity, so I was trying to optimize my use of right click nukes(Boots of Bladecalling).  I managed to keep my mana regenerating the entire time.  There was no &quot;full mana&quot; time.  I decided to try to put Kindir and his sceptre/ancient spell into my shoes, just to see what I'd get.  <br>
<br>
I found that I cast BoBC 165 times(17 seconds per), sofb 81 times(5.8 per), and FoT 3 times (7 per).  For a moment let's ignore mana.  I spent 3295.8 seconds casting spells.  Kindir figured 12.1 seconds per cast cycle, and you could fit 272.4 of those cycles into the time I spent casting.  At 1500 damage per cycle that would be 408,000 damage.<br>
<br>
My resist rate was about 6%.  I think it is more than reasonable to assume crits would make up for this.  I think 408,000 is reasonable as far as resists are concerned.<br>
<br>
Ok to summarize the numbers(and add a couple of missing ones:<br>
<br>
Camp session:  7714 seconds<br>
Time main warrior spent in combat: 4707 seconds.<br>
Time spent casting spells: 3295.8 seconds.<br>
Damage dealt:  408,000<br>
DPS (vs. the Main Tank):  86.7<br>
DPS (vs. the total session):  52.9<br>
<br>
Now, my realized DPS versus the main tank was only 39.  The huge difference comes from two main sources.  First, we ruled out mana regeneration and assumed Kindir would be using the click nuke and mana nuke an equal amount, whereas I had no clarity and used my boots almost exclusively.  Second, the ancient nuke has a higher dps, which would allow for more click damage assuming it was able to equal the damage done by shock of fiery blades.<br>
<br>
We can't -know- how mana would have limited Kindir, but we could guess.  I'm going to assume 33% reduction in mana cost (21% spec, 12% focus item)..  Sorry, but I think that is being somewhat generous.  In order for him to maintain the 86.7 dps vs. the MT quoted above, he would need to have 51938 mana in 7714 seconds, which is 40 mana per tick.<br>
<br>
Figure 11.5 per tick if you had a horse (7714-3295.8 to figure out time spend medding) That's if medding is 20 mana per tick.<br>
<br>
Then 4 from TPP.<br>
Then 14 from KEI, we're at 29.5 per tick.<br>
<br>
10.5 per tick from rods and flowing thought.  (Maybe 5 from rods.. and hell even I have FT 6.)<br>
<br>
Not too tough IMO.  The only thing is the fairly generous focus item figure, but even then you'd only need another 4 FT to make up for it.<br>
<br>
In order to achieve 125 dps versus the MT using my amount of time spent casting, you'd have to spend a lot more mana though.  Where I had you nuking 272 times with the sceptre and 272 times with the ancient nuke, to deal 125 dps instead of 86.6 you'd have to nuke 440 times with the ancient and 150 times with the sceptre.  This would up the required mana regen to 65.<br>
<br>
<br>
If your pet was doing 75dps, then I would say yes, 200 dps relative to another melee is at least in the realm of possibility.<br>
<br>
200dps is only uptime dps though, this would not be sustainable to infinity.  Given the uptime/downtime ratio, the 200dps in combat would be only 122 sustained..   But umm imo 122 sustained is fricking insanely high anyway so /shrug.  <br>
<br>
Flaws I see with this hypothesis:<br>
<br>
1.  Theoretically, up to 4707 seconds could have been spent casting spells.  In my experience, it isn't feasible to cast nukes for 100% of combat time,  but others may experience differently.<br>
<br>
2.  Switching me out with someone dealing a higher DPS, you'd change the conditions of the group.  The effect this would have on the analysis is unknown to me.  Perhaps it would lead to more downtime, perhaps less, perhaps the same with more mobs killed.  Hard to say. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2497<br> <font color=#333333>(11/28/02 7:15:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> btw I have read that thread from Mikar several times before, it's extremely annoying trying to sort out the discussion.  When you research something you typically summarize your methods and organize your results.  That thread is like listening in on a discussion and seeing some people's personal notes.  Of course now I'll go ahead and do the same thing, but this post won't get stuck in a library.<br>
<br>
For my test, I buffed myself with TPP and wore FT6(+10 mana regen).  I nuked myself oom, casting burn repeatedly until I got the insuffecient mana message.  I stood and timed myself standing until I reached 100% mana.  With FT10 and innate standing +1 my mana pool came out to be 3395 if it maxes at the beginning of the 100%, or 3430 if it maxed at the end of 100%.<br>
<br>
Magelo tells me I should have 3333 mana.  Honestly, my guess is that this is where they made their error.<br>
<br>
I then nuked myself to insuffecient mana with SoFB and logged the time, and after that nuked myself to insuffecient mana with burn.  I used several different methods to account for the mana left over after I recieved the &quot;insuffecient mana&quot; message, and the only case where I was able to round up to even 20% was if I assumed less than 4% savings on burn.  In no case was I ever over 19.8%<br>
<br>
I did come up with 21% savings if I used the 3333 figure for my mana pool and used 10% or lower savings on burn.<br>
<br>
From what I read of that thread, no one did a full, raw mana pool test, and the mana pool is a rather important variable.  The good figures I got from that were only relative to normal specialization.<br>
<br>
The ShowEQ guy did not use SCM3, he only used 2.  From what I could tell he just made an educated guess.<br>
<br>
<br>
In any case you my initial assumption of 15% from uncontrolled tests was definitely off.  But I still think 21% is a bit too high.  Based on my test it could be as low as 18%. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A> at: 11/28/02 7:24:32 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2498<br> <font color=#333333>(11/28/02 7:23:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> One other thing about that thread that doesn't help this discussion is that the underlying goal of it seemed to be figuring how much better SCM3 was than normal specialization.  People wanted to know whether or not it was a worthwhile ability.  By now we don't care about that, we know that it's a nice jump over normal specialization.  For the purposes of this discussion, all we want to know is the total mana savings we can expect.  How it is split between SCM0, SCM1, SCM2, and SCM3 isn't really relevant. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cydmab>Cydmab</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 674<br> <font color=#333333>(11/28/02 7:40:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=64>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> Boots of the wind; wind of mana: 20% mana savings on detrimental<br>

One thing I remember about the wizard SCM tests is that had zillions of observations, and collected results from 8 or so different tests, and there was quite a bit of variation on the mana savings calculated. I don't think we'll ever really nail down the %mana savings from foci and SCM. <br>

Someone posted above scepter as 7 seconds; I'm pretty sure its 8 seconds. Plus, there is oftentimes an end of and beginning of fight downtime. Beginning of the fight, wait for positioning, assist key to work, etc. End of fight, you need a full 8 seconds to get another scepter off. <p>Master Cydmab Promethean<br>

We were in the camp 7714 seconds, the MT was fighting 4707 secconds, I was only able to spend 3296 seconds casting(interrupts not included).<br>

I figure that if I can achieve that with sofb and boots of bladecalling, someone with the ancient nuke and sceptre should do at least that.<br>

I have a solution -<br>
<br>
When we get nerfed I hope that instead of having our nukes nerfed SoE nerfs septer and BoBC..  this way mages that don't have them don't get penalized for posts like this.

<br>
Yes, click nuke items are a lot larger intervals of upgrades. Whereas a melee would upgrade their damage slightly over time, mages upgrade in large spurts by getting clicky nukes. If you're concerned about that so much, I have some advice: get over it. Click nukes will never scale appropriately through all levels of play.<br>

It's not like they can go back now and make burst damage good.

Total damage from my nukes was 952,500; cast ancient 783 times, blazing heat 472 times. DPS was 62.1. Now this includes alot of &quot;dead time&quot; including fights where I only cast one nuke because of positioning, afking, fireshielding, confusion, etc. Pulls were almost constant; I went out of my way to pet canabilize and I only did it 80 times in over 6 hours. I had tranquility, SoA (sometimes down because of rods), 15 FT, XPG, and rodded regularly. I was using summoned bracer, lightbringer's ear, and boots of the wind. I had blessing of retribution on me about half the time. I was using pendant of malosini to malosini most mobs (needed for resits, and to help pet)<br>
<br>
I can only guestimate (by looking at a few specific fights) pet and meele dps since, while I had others hits on, I wasn't always in meele range. I had water pet up, about 50/50 backstabbing, with BO5, muzzle, pair of level 63 swords, focus of spirit, and either feral avatar or night's dark terror, but pet seemed to do about 75-100 DPS without procs (and proced *ALOT* with FoS and feral avatar); rogue was 140-170 dps; warrior was about 80-120. These figures don't include their downtime, while my 62 dps does, so these are probally high estimates for my pet and the rogue. So the rogue and I were somewhere in the ballpark of 150 DPS each in this indoors, constant pull situation.<br>
<br>
Incidently, the enchanter was doing well over 100dps with her dire charmed pet. <p>Master Cydmab Promethean<br>

<br>
As I mentioned, we did not have an enchanter in that group.. hence my unusually low number of normal nukes used.  This meant that we had no mez, so we had to rely on root for crowd control.. or simply tank two at a time.  <br>
<br>
This is a situation where burst dps can help.<br>
<br>
I found one situation in the log where we had more than one mob in camp and measured my nuke contribution.<br>
<br>
From the time we noticed the add until the time the first mob died, my nuking dps was 82.  This is more than double my average output.<br>
<br>
Normal group dps was something like (rogue105, War 70, unknown wizard (guessing 35.. wiz had kei but used root), 90 mage). Guessing on a 20k hp mob, but at 300dps the 20k mob should die in about 67 seconds.  Add my 42dps burst damage, and the fight is shortened to 59 seconds.<br>
<br>
Remember we have a wizard using root as crowd control here...  Suppose I was ignoring burst dps ability and just going along at 90dps instead of 132, root broke 60 seconds into the fight, and in the 7 seconds it takes us to finish off the primary target the wizard dies.  Bam several thousand mana's worth of potential damage down the toilet.<br>
<br>
Sure. 132 burn dps is normal for a high end rogue, but I'm not a high end mage.  I have no spellcasting subtlety, and I wasn't even using Firebolt of Tallon.  The tank was using a Twisted Steel bastard sword, not a Bloodfrenzy.  I also don't have casting fury, which can potentially raise burst dps.  Furthermore, I did find a spot in the log where I achieved 105 nuke dps for a short period.<br>
<br>
If you have access to increased short-term damage and choose to ignore it, you're only hurting your group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=braxxxus02>Braxxxus02</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 102<br> <font color=#333333>(11/29/02 2:01:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=74>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> &quot;i did the math, in fact i wrote that other post, please show me where i'm wrong? btw, you agreed with me on the other boards and disagree here... odd&quot;<br>
<br>
I did agree at the time, but I quickly realized that your numbers were off.  You assumed that you were saving 45% of mana cost on all your nukes, which is completely wrong.  I mentioned that assumption in my post here, so why did you ignore that, and tryed to just pretend I was flip flopping?<br>
<br>
As for pulling the 125 dps number from somewhere, i was wrong, I didn't know you were the same person (different user name).  But, the 45% mana savings is incorrect.  Mages do good dps, but lets just not get carried away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ylaine76>Ylaine76</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1164<br> <font color=#333333>(11/29/02 4:29:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> I still just don't see how 200 sustained DPS counting *all* downtime is easily attainable in an EXP group.

In PoV I mosty used maelstrom of thunder and Firebolt and my dps was around 60 or so I think...<br>
<br>
Again Im still not sure if the start of this thread is dealing with DPS PER mob or DPS per entire group session.. Since I honestly don't see how you can do 200 dps in a group session unless you got some amazing gear, like FT35.  Either that or you're grouped with a BST for spirtual dominion, a bard for chorus of marr and a chanter for tranquility.. However I would base mana regen solely off enchanter buffs since BSTs and Bards are not common <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/YlaineEQ/fullsize/cheersig2.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

DPS should only matter per fight, unless you are the one causing the downtime.  If you consider it that way 200 DPS sustained is difficult for most but sustainable for some.  Our DPS varies a large degree depending on what type of group we are in and what type of strategies are used, but regardless we are a high DPS class, near the top in almost all situations.  <br>

<br>
It is a language thing..<br>
<br>
I would agree that tends to be more practical to talk about per mob dps.  However, sustained dps over a long period of time *can* matter.  It was especially relevant in Luclin pre rod nerf, where single encounters were expected to take 30 minutes to do.<br>
<br>
Claiming to be able to &quot;sustain&quot; 200 dps means, to me anyway, the damage rate you can keep up to infinity.  Unless you qualify it to include downtime.<br>
<br>
btw I just ran some numbers.  Figuring 170 mana in 8 seconds for a pet-canni, and an innate mana regen of 35 mana per tick (including buffs), it would not be feasible to sustain even 125dps nuking over a two hour period.  At least, not without a click nuke.  You would not have -time- to reclaim enough pets to keep up with mana usage.<br>

Regarding your comments about &quot;my&quot; thread on Graffe. I had no idea it would end of in the library. So, I wasnt posting a finished project - but merely conversing - much like we are not.

I think you got horse med wrong. You are getting meditation rate while on horse *even while casting*. I have personally tested this. Hence a clicky nuke is a huge boon in a horse friendly zone.<br>

If you only count dmg/fight time you will look better the worse the group is at pulling - hence given the wrong impression entirely. <p>Mikar</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2503<br> <font color=#333333>(11/30/02 11:50:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7965.topic&index=79>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Is 200dps sustained Possible?</span><hr size=1> I completely respect what you did in that thread, Mikar.

<br>
Even the best groups typically have 25% or more downtime.  The only parses I've ever seen of continuous pulls where more than 80% uptime was achieved was in fungus grove.  PoV xp totally blows that away yet you can have much more downtime.<br>
