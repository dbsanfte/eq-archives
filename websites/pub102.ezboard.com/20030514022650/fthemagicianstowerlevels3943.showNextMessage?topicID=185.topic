The target: Zelniaks and Large Zelniaks<br>
The prize: Fast and steady xp at a not so boring camp.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I bound myself in Sanctus, but be wary. I'm kos to some band of vigilante types (Castrated Castrorum or some such) that wander the zone and you may be to. They never wandered over to the zone in by themselves, but they were trained there every so often. To be safe, bind over my the Mons zone in. It's further away for those people running for their lives.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Head just a bit north of the mushroom house on the Southwest part of the zone. Set up camp in the middle of the flat plain in front of the house. Zip out to an exterior view so you are aware of everything around you.<br>
<br>
The Zelniaks seem to have low hps for their level. Very easy to kill with 2 blazes or so and some help from Jibober. Small Zelniaks, Zelniaks, and Large Zelniaks are non-social and non-aggro. Med under them, kill their mother, they don't care. The &lt;modified&gt; Zelniaks (anything other than the 3 above, enraged, dazed, tenacious etc.) are out to attack, hit harder, and always drop twilight components (rare spawn though). <br>
<br>
Your primary concern are the wolves, and this is why you'll want to use your exterior camera (I hardly used it before I came here). Be constantly surveying the lay of the land while you are fighting and medding (no reading books or playing PS2 here). Wolves might spawn next to your camp (there are about 3 spawn points by the mushroom house) or they'll just wander on by. <br>
<br>
If you see a wolf coming, move so that your pet is between you and it. Once they get a whiff of Jibober they'll head straight for him. They can eat your pet pretty quickly at this level so if you're lom or you're pet is loh, gate out. Other than that, burn them to a crisp... you'll come to hate them. There are &lt;modified&gt; wolves as well, same rules apply... hit harder, drop twilight pieces.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want to go AFK, move up to the zoneline Southeast of the mushroom house. Tribal gatherers path up there, but you should start out indifferent to them. I've killed plenty and I'm still indifferent. Never had a problem being AFK there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Loot? Surely you jest. Straight xp camp. You'll get lots of Zelniak meat and a few twilight pieces from the &lt;modified&gt; Zels and an occasional twilight jewel piece from the Larges. 1 in 30 wolves or so will drop a Wolf Fang Earring, 4ac, 3str, 2sta. <br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know if this is a better place than DL, because I don't want to go to DL and play with the fiends there. I got steady xp, a yellow every hour or so. On a kill by kill basis, the Zels don't offer a lot of xp. But, they're easy to kill and there are a lot of them (there are some lean moments, but the lived for moments when 4 or 5 larges have swarmed the area and you're fm more than make up for it).<br>

It was and is buggy (especially soundwise), often bad lag and -worst for me at that time- no loot.<br>
So I VERY seldom was there and didn't like that place at all.<br>
<br>
yesterday -at lvl 42- I was lucky to grab a KEI (first time for me ;-) ) so I thought where to go with it. since no other place came to my mind, I went to Dawnshroud. (I knew I could take the MOBs solo and that many would still be darkblue to me).<br>
So I arrived there...summoned Fire Pet..tested it quickly (was lucky and got a 40 hitter at first attempt), gave it all possible equipment, medded up and then went straight south a bit from the Netherbian zone. (That place has a special name I think, but I dont know it. Its just a bit south and theres a hill where you can see a waste plain area).<br>
So I started killing there. all I can say is that xp really flew in.<br>
(Ok I had Kei at that time, but after Kei went out I stayed there and the xp is still amazing, at least 1 yellow per hour)<br>
<br>
Now as for the wolfs, I decided to take a pretty ofensive approach. I didnt wait for them to come by and jump me but pulled them whenever I saw one and could take it. If there was NO wolf to be seen I pulled darkblue large Zelniaks. (from that little hill you can pull absolutely great with a bolt spell)<br>
<br>
Now since I absolutely cannot get along with any 3rd person view I found another way to handle the wolfs safely. I can hardly describe it, but you HEAR the wolf a while before it gets close enough to aggro on you. Also, after a while at the same spot I you even can hear WHERE the wolf is. because there are only a few paths the wolfs take near you can pretty well say where the wolf is based on the loudness of its steps. May sound stupid, but it worked). so whenever I heard a wolf while already being in battle I already knew in which direction I had to move in order to get the pet between the wolf and me.<br>
<br>
Now with KEI I could kill non stop. But after it ran out I had to move to a safe spot (at the entrance from Netherbian) sometimes because I was OOM and Pet was low on health.<br>
<br>
and when you are there and you Pet has health again you can send it to solo lightblue but even darkblue Zelniaks (the large Zelniaks get the health of the Pet pretty low, but it never ever died against a Zelniak, the normal Zelniaks...not a problem, your Pet could almost solo them without a break)<br>
<br>
Now, from today on I will probably even get easier.<br>
Since your Pet (if its a good one) *can* solo any Zelniak and you won't have to outdamage it anymore to get full xp, you will hardly ever get very low on mana. I will only burn aggresively when I'm fighting a wolf (those need to die asap ,-) ) or when I'm fighting a Zelniak and see/hear a wolf coming. Then the Zelniak needs to die asap so you can concentrate on the wolf in case it aggroes you.<br>
(and that will be harder...until before the patch you could train the wolf on your Pet and usually manage 2 MObs for a short time, that unfortunately wont be possible anymore after the patch {note: I still am all in favour of the pet changes ;-) }<br>
<br>
Summary: before the Pet xp changes of today's patch I got about 1 yellow per hour there, now without the need to Nuke like crazy to get full xp it should be even faster.<br>
I really should have been there since lvl 39, would have had lvl 44 quite some time ago ;-)<br>

<br>
This happened last night, as long as I stayed away from the wolf, it could walk between the pet and mob without aggroing. what a fun change <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This may be in the wrong hunting section though, I've been in this zone steady from level 35 on. Great XP, as always, better with KEI.<br>

This has got to be the best place I've been to so far for soloing. In a weeks time I went from level 38 to level 46 on my warrior. If you want a place to solo this is the place to go. Only problems I had when pulling here were the wolfs hiding behind rocks while I was pulling another wolf. <br>
<br>
 The place to pull from / to is to the right of Netherbian  Lair. To your left will be the mushrooms and where 90% of the trains came from when I was soloing here.<br>
 Once you exit the building take a right along the zone wall, not far from the building is a large rock beside a hill... This is where I did most of my killing...Now with your back to the zone wall you can head straight out to where all those zelniaks, wolfs and lightcrawlers are. If you run out far enough you will come to a little pond. To the left of that pond along what looks like a dried up creek bed is where the stonegrabbers are. If you have never seen a stonegrabber they look like little black rocks laying there on the ground.<br>
This is the info that I can share on this zone. I hope this helps some of you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udrizzinn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Drizzinn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#333333>(7/19/02 10:40:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=84.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.shadowsight.com/graphics/footman2.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Zelniaks Zelniaks Zelniaks</span><hr size=1> If you play on Fennin Ro, you can expect to see my 41 Warrior up there tonight.

 I used this place aswell as a test.. Here are my results.<br>
<br>
 in level 40, with KEI and using a fire pet (ok im partial to them) I had minimal downtime ..and it was mainly due to the pets health vs my willingness to cast a heal on him. Switching to a Water pet and using BoC downtime was shortened significantly.  Outstanding Exp per mana consumption!<br>
 <br>
 My pull spot however is seemingly different than most others... I set up shop at the Snobby-elf and the two 'high on shrooms' gnomes., just infront of them and to the right, with back to them..looking into the zone...<br>
<br>
 Endless pulls with a Bolt spell from here. no wolves wonder directly to you, and only one even remotely close, but it is always killed by the gnome/highelf if it gets close.  A rare lightcrawler comes into visual, but never close enough to worry with (green and pet paste if it does aggro)<br>
<br>
 And as stated above..the sound issues and the random lagginess of the zone is rediculess. So much so that i have now only slated this zone for use when im in need of a quick few kills..<br>
<br>
and there is my 2 copper...<br>
<br>
 If you can get past the lack of sound at most times and the scatter brained lag.. the ease of exp makes this place well worth the trip  <p><A

At 35 you will still have quite some downtime, but after you have the 39 pets (I use the fire pet here), you will have basically NO downtime at all.<br>
Pull with the lowest DD spell you find in your spellbook <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      and let the pet do the rest (pet completely in Phantom Plate with 2 shiny baubles and 2 shiny rings, silver choker and 2 swords of runes).<br>
<br>
When a wolf jumpes you, you will have to throw in some hard nukes. For some of the Large Zelniaks a good nuke will help as well - otherwise you just sit and med and kill everything that is passing by.<br>

It took me about 1 evening per level.  I imaginbe with KEI I would never stop.  I currently use a water pet and generally can do about 10 pulls (using a white ceramic band) before I need to take a little med break.  I just don't have the cash at the moment to afford 100pp for KEI.  I got far better xp here than I did grouped in DL and than I did at the dwarf later at the chestboard in BB (half a blue per kill but 12 minute respawn).<br>
<br>
Did 43 in 3 hours with KEI.  I sat at the intersection of the dry creek beds straight out from the NL entrance.  Its where everything wanders through (just gotta watch for wolf and light crawler adds).  I have about 1957 int with gear so judge by that. <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50273"><B>Comminus</B></A> <BR>

I would advise sticking with the shrooms until lvl 34 at least but after that I have found that the zelniaks are killer xp.  Larges hit the pet hard but if you malise and nuke them down quickly you will actually conserve mana from what I have found rather than pet healing. <br>
<br>
I have also tried chaining pets but it is not worth it at lvl 34.  I have even been able to take on the named spawns in the zone be it wolfs or zels.  They eat about 4 or 5 pets each before i can nuke them down to where there running but I dont think this is worth it at all except for the fact that it will make you feel very cool taking on a red (with the expense of a near full mana bar). <br>
<br>
Have fun this zone is great but loot sucks bad so be prepared to do some money farming for lvl 44 spells. <br>
<br>
I would also advise popping your head into ME for the mage only loot in there.  You can ocasionally hear shouts about mage only items rotting.  There are some very good items that drop in that zone and a bunch all are lore and most are mage only.  Check it out I got a 7int medalion a 7int earing and a 30 mana earing.  You can find out more about them in a post in the quest section under the topic Mage only Neck item.  Just have some high lvl people keeping a eye out for you about the drops.  <p><a href=mailto:RavianVarior@hotmail.com><b>Ravian Varior</b></a> <a href=http://www.legionoffyre.net><b>{Legion of Fyre}</b></a><br><b>LVL 33 Erudite Mage</b><br><a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bxegony >Xegony</a>

Do NOT fight them near certain camps of NPCs. At one time i had my pet fighting a Zelniak and aggroed a wolf, so I started to run around with the wolf chasing me while my pet was finishing the Zelniak, and low and behold i stumbled near one of these camps ... Oh my, after 3 shots of around 115 melee it was a pretty mage's corpse lying one the ground ...<br>
These NPCs will assist the wolves if you get near them, so be carefull <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

When I needed to recover mana, I simply ran high up on the zone wall and took a seat without fear of wandering monsters.
