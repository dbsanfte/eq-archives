Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> first off, of course pets regenerate like animals, they are ANIMALS!<br>
but, to te Yetis.<br>
insane exp at 40! heres my spell slots:<br>
Shock<br>
Greater sheild<br>
Phantom<br>
Barrier of Combustion<br>
Blaze<br>
Cinder Bolt<br>
Expedience<br>
Bo2<br>
<br>
i mem my pet, then describe hehe.<br>
i buff pet, i usually have Braided Beard of the Coldain, so i usually give him Storm Strength, Bo2, expedience.<br>
sometimes a Druid will come by and buff me, and pet with regen etc.<br>
<br>
mana used per kill:<br>
35%<br>
mana used if an add:<br>
80-100%<br>
<br>
so, if theres an add, it sux hehe.<br>
<br>
exp per kill at 40:<br>
1/4 a blue on the higher ones<br>
<br>
number of deaths:1<br>
(dont ya just hate it when Gorenaire goes on rampage?)<br>
<br>
so, i get all 7 kills in about.... 30 minutes, so that 1 3/4 blues in 50 mins(counting spawn timer, and med break)<br>
<br>
that my friend, is AWESOME exp at 40, im staying here til 44, then moving to glaciers.<br>
<br>
other good exp at 40:<br>
Cynthia, she isnt AS good, but theres NO chance of dying if you dont just sit by her feet and say&quot;nuke me&quot;<br>
plus, at 39 you have time to go kill a clops, and still make it in time for Cynthia to spawn again!woot.<br>
<br>
also, i suggest Fire pet since they hit sort of fast, and mines dmg sheild does 34 dmg right back at him, then 40 quad, then 16 bash/kick...<br>

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> here's my yeti 2 coppers worth - c&amp;p style.<br>
<br>
I'm doing the yeti now...they are Cake!<br>
<br>
Rule #1 - Don't fight in the hallways you're better off near the entrance to the rooms and then in the rooms. The one that spawns in the hallway is ok to fight there but if the wondering on is out kill him first so u dont get 2. -- if no wondering and u have it all cleared NM! hehe<br>
<br>
Rule #2 - don't try to fight 2 . if you get an Add gate unless the first is dead or fleeing.<br>
<br>
I bound at the BW zone.<br>
<br>
Here's my method:<br>
<br>
<br>
Spell slot lineup<br>
blaze<br>
SoS<br>
Bo2<br>
DS inferno<br>
Renew<br>
malise<br>
&lt;switch slot&gt;pet, buffs, ect...normally keep pet up in case i need another.<br>
gate<br>
<br>
run to where the paths cross inside the cave. (this is for the one up in the NW corner.)<br>
Don't go all the way to crossing then back off about 75 yards.<br>
Get fire pet. give pet a coldstone,  get 2 runed swords. Bo2. buff self greater shield and phant chain. Med back up.<br>
<br>
ease close to crossroads...if no roaming yeti then i kill the one that spawns at the crossing. kill it right there in the hall.<br>
<br>
Kill method:<br>
<br>
send in pet<br>
nuke - blaze (cinder doesn't cast good in caves)<br>
heal pet--if needed only<br>
Nuke - blaze<br>
SoS if needed to finish.<br>
<br>
pet sit down<br>
plus i sit between all castings.<br>
<br>
then after i kill the one in hall i go to the room straight back or to the left of the one spawn at the crossing.<br>
<br>
I stand at the entrance to room then I kill the one to the left first cuz he seems to be the closest to me. pull with malise send in pet into room a bit. Usually i get an aggro and run through the yeti taking a few hits. <br>
<br>
Always remember to heal pet back up after each fight before sending him to the next.<br>
<br>
then i run into room where the yeti to the left spawned and kill the rest....same for the next room. Yeti are about 14-15 min spawn so its a great rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
good loot and xp at even at 40. plenty of mobs of u have the cave to yourself.<br>

At 42 got bored of them, and tired of having to hunt down the next kill every few minutes, so decided to try the yetis.  All I can say is &quot;I should have been here the whole time.&quot;<br>

Fast respawn, good loot as well (stackable flowers are so much more convenient than weapons), and i never have to look for the next kill.<br>

All the posts about them being blind is true, pull them easily from thier caves, or hunt inside, both are easy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urombo1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rombo1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_greenspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(4/28/02 4:15:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Which cave is which???</span><hr size=1> I just made level 39 and dont want to go to the Overthere....hate running from goons <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But one thing confuses me here.  On the map posted earlier which cave is which?  Is number 1 the tundra cave or the mixed cave?<br>
<br>
I think its clear that number 7 is the glacier yetis.<br>

If someone whos hunted there before can let the rest of us know for sure whats in which cave that'd be great <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I arrived here at level 39 and spent less than two days /played between level 39 and 44. Following the advice of the posters here, this is what I did:<br>
<br>
Bound myself near the entrance to the cave but far enough to where I could camp out if I had to(never had to, should have bound myself at the spires for a quicker Nexus sell port). I would start my grind by checking to make sure the cave wasn't camped. If so, I would summon the best fire pet I could get. The 36, 38 and 40 hitter fire pets do just fine here. I summon focus items, phantom plate, Spear of Warding and Dagger of Symbols for the pet. While I am summoning stuff at the beginning, I let the pet solo individual spawns while I med up. Usually the yeti needs one shock spell to bring it down or else the pet bites it if it is soloing.<br>
<br>
Once I am good to go, soloing the yeti camp is cake. I don't pull OUT of any rooms since these yetis aren't social - meaning you can be fighting a yeti pretty close to another yeti and it won't help - I just walk up to the yeti's spawn and /pet attack them. I BOII my pet and have it attack the next available spawn. I usually cast Lava Bolt or whatever the best bolt spell is named when the Yeti is at 80% health and again at 40% health. This will get you full EXP, it seemed. Once the yeti is dead, med up while the pet gets to full health. Once the pet is ready to go, kill the next yeti.<br>
<br>
You will have plenty of time between whole cave spawns to med up so do not med to full between each battle, it is just waste of time. If you are low on mana, just med enough to get mana for two bolt spells. I say this because once you clear the entire cave, there is a 10 minute or so break you have to med up. I usually practice my abjuration and divination in these breaks while I am waiting.<br>
<br>
At level 39, a whole cave clearing is a good chunk of a yellow bubble. At level 44 it is closer to 2 blues. Either way you slice it, the exp is awesome and the loot ROCKS. I was pulling in between 100-250pp per few hours. The yetis all drop between 5 gold and 5pp plus they have research components and Frosty Daturas(stackable flowers that sell for 1pp each). Most yetis drop 2 flowers. Also, you will get the occasional gem drop. I have gotten three peridots the whole time at this camp and a few flawless aquamarines as well as a few Golden Pendants or whatever that sell for 15pp!<br>
<br>
Another good thing about this camp is that there are always high level clerics running to and fro between the spires and KC, FV, FM, etc. Just do a /who cleric and send polite tells to the higher level ones asking if they are anywhere near you. You'll find a kind one who will gladly take a peridot and some plat to rez you if you do happen to die.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the information, fellas, it was a great camp. Came here with less than 400pp and left with 1705pp AFTER buying all my level 44 spells. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unophen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nophen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(5/13/02 4:01:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yetis.

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> I have to thank whoever found this place and told everyone!  I am having a lot of fun playing my mage, soloing which I have never done before.  I have played a rogue and warrior both over 50 with little soloing.<br>
<br>
Over the weekend I was able to get from 40 to 43 + 2 yellows.  I also made about 500pp.  I bound at the ice tunnel leading to the port areas.  Every few spawn cycles I'd head up to the nexus to sell/bank and get a type of clarity, lucked out 2 times and got c3!  <br>
<br>
If you get c3 this camp is a joke.  I was clearing all 7 spawns in ~10min.  Head outside find some snarlers and yetis to kill then head back to the cave.  Giants and spiders did get me killed a few times in combination with bad lag spikes/no sow.  <br>
<br>
All in all I will be soloing yetis until 49 most likely.  At 44 I'm planning on going to camp #7 the glacier ones, is there anything after them? <p><CENTER>

What a nice thread. I was here the last two nights at the cave in the NW corner. Great XP, decent drops too. I've grown weary of some of the Luclin XP zones that have absolutely no loot. I spent 4 levels in dawnshroud, and am way behind financially because of this. Its not uber pp or anything, just a nice steady flow of money for an evenings work. I cleared about 50p here after selling flowers and a golden pendant......<br>
<br>
I will echo the suggestion that you fight in the rooms themselves. I started out trying to pull the yeti's back to the cave entrance, but ran into some nasty wall-warping problems. Happily though, I play on stormhammer, and a nice gm came by within 5 minutes to /kill the problem mob. <br>
<br>
I've been keeping Summon Companion memmed, just in case jibobaner decides to run off......<br>
<br>
EDIT, I was here again today, I cleared well over 100pp in cash and items during the duration of a KEI buff. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Naladini <BR>

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> I am a bit dissapointed with this camp...<br>
 <br>
 calling upon my good friend Mr. jobober...39 fire pet... I cleared 1 roaming and 7 static spawns in cave #1 (thought there was 2 roamers?) and like the above poster said, it was a joke, it was so easy. Total time to kill...8 minutes.. (1 nuke each of Blaze and Shock per yeti, and one double kill due to aggro).. I ran to cave #9 on the above map and cleared it aswell. Time to clear... 11 minutes from start...Jobober got lost somewhere. <br>
<br>
 Sounds good right? well the dissapointment came when I, like a fool, looked at the good ole'  EXP bar... 2 1/2 blues give or take a pixel at level 40!??!!??  counting now, that was atleast 15 mobs in total (forgot the total of cave 9, but i do remember not running into a roamer in a hall)<br>
<br>
 I dont know if i got a bad streak of luck with them all being lower level yeti's or what..and I was only taking this time to check the exp gain per a clearing..unable to clear both caves again because I was on my way to work just before doing this.<br>
<br>
anyone else experianced an Exp gain shift between clearings of the cave(s) ??<br>
<br>
 I really hope this is a rare occasion. I like the placement of the caves, and the random chatter in the zone.. I am a solo player, and listen to the auction channel for laughter...but man, I want to get the most bang for the buck persay.<br>

<br>
At 44 I could get about 2 blue per cycle. I happened to go there right after the patch, so both wanderers were actually in the cave. This was the first time that had happened to me in the 4 levels i'd been fighting here. <br>
<br>
One quick bit of advice, I think the wanderers can make it out of the cave, so don't get too cozy fighting the static spawns. Its possible someone could kill one outside, and you'd get a rude surprise a little while later.....<br>

I'm going to try the glaciers tonight..... <p>Naladini <BR>

Ill add my 2cp......<br>
<br>
<br>
I came here at 39 and stayed till 44.  Great XP  Great Loot.  Here is the story<br>
<br>
The dreadland cave you want is the very NW corner of the zone.  Many people will run in there, thinking its the entrance to Lost Valley....just invis them and levitate them and send them southward and they will be grateful.<br>
<br>
This is how i did it.<br>
<br>
Make 39 Fire Pet. (focused)<br>
Give it Phantom Chain, 2 dagger symbols, coldstone and elemental defender.  Then Burn out 2<br>
<br>
You will get hit pulling for your pet, so cast GS and PC on yourself.<br>
<br>
Park yourself about 3 seconds worth of a run from alcove with 1st yeti.  Tell pet to guard here.  <br>
<br>
All you need on your spell gems is Blaze and Shock of Flame.  You pull with SoF....anything else and your pet wont be able to taunt mob off you and youll get beaten to a bloody pulp.<br>
<br>
1. Search for Wanderer. This yeti is a rare spawn...but if he is present in cave, he will be on a 16 min timer.  If he is not in cave, be alert.  He will pop at the worst possible time and become an add.<br>
<br>
2. Take out the Alcove with the 1st yeti in it.  Stand far back and cast SoF on it.  Run to pet and then sick pet.  MED untill Ganer pierces the yeti to 70% health, and chain nuke Blaze.  2 outta do it.  <br>
<br>
<br>
See how easy that was?<br>
<br>
When your pet walks back to guard position...run to the cave on the right with 3 yetis in it.  SoF the yeti on the LEFT or you will get adds.  Run to pet and sick Ganer on it.  2 Blazes from 70% health is all you need.  <br>
<br>
The Yetis have very little resistance, so expect your spells to hit for max<br>
<br>
Continue to clear out the right cave and proceed to the other cave.  All the Yetis are on a 21 min timer.  Kill all 7, then take a 21 min break and clean your house, change oil, wash the dog..etc<br>
<br>
Here is how many yetis i killed before i leveled (i kept track of it)<br>
<br>
Lvl 39  45<br>
Lvl 40  55<br>
Lvl 41  65<br>
Lvl 42 75<br>
Lvl 43 90 <br>
<br>
<br>
I did all of this in 2 12 hour marathons and 1 8 hour marathon.   I came away with gems, coin, words, runes, and flowers to give your EQ wife.  All in All i made about 3k.  Now i can buy my Coldain Boots   )<br>
<br>
If the  Roaming Yeti is present...be alert.  Wait till he walks away from ALL 3 caves..thats when you attack to assure no adds.<br>
<br>
Good luck Mages, but you wont need it here<br>
<br>
Hope this Helps<br>

Nothing fancy to my technique - just walked up close to alcove on the left with the lone Yeti, targeted him, and sent focused fire pet to attack him.  After pet had knocked a bub of health I cast a rain of lava spell.  As soon a my spell gems were available again I cast either Blaze or SoS depending on Yeti's remaining health.  I then went to the room opposite the alcove and pulled the furthest Yeti with a Bolt of Flame (lvl 16 spell to keep aggro down - I started with Malise but couldn't tell any improvement in how much my rain spells were resisted with Malise versus without it).  When the far one runs across the room he does not aggro the others.  I had the pet attack it as it hit the hallway and did my Rain of Lava /  Blaze or SoS routine.  I then went into the room and had pet attack Yeti on the right, killed it, and went for the one on the right.  Same tactic for room at the end of the tunnel.   I then went into the hallway facing the alcove and waited for the alcove yeti to spawn again.  Very same and easy xps and controlling all seven was never a problem in terms of mana - I would just give a minute or two between kills to med and let pet heal.  <br>
<br>
One key is after the first run through kill the Yeti's as they spawn - don't wait until all have respawned.  Sometimes other players come through looking for a quick kill or two.  If there's nothing for them to kill, they usually leave quickly.  Once or twice I got squeezed into camping one room, but for the most part I had the whole cavern to myself for hours on end.  These caves are a pretty well kept secret though.  One night there were 80+ players in dreadlands, no one in Yeti Caves except for me.  If the caves are crowded during peak hours on your server, then set the alarm clock for 2 in the morning and do it then - you don't need to be in top form mentally to run through the spawns. <br>
<br>
I started getting a little more than two blues per 20 min or so spawn at 40 and at 43 got a little less than that.  Was tempted to stay here awhile even at 44 because I still got 1.5 blues for all seven Yetis but finally had to leave because I was sick of Yetis.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukraygus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraygus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(10/18/02 5:37:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Yetis, Yes; Caves, No</span><hr size=1> Another alternative that I used from 39-44 was to hunt outside of the Yeti Caves (#7 on the EQ Atlas map), near position neg160,pos3400. This will put you on top of a mountain, overlooking the building housing the entrance to the #7 caves.<br>
<br>
Just to the north of this mountain is a valley with a very busy east-west highway of Drolvags, Giants, Yetis, Spiders, and Cockatrices. From 39-42 these were all in the dark blue range. At level 43, maybe 1/3 of these started to change to light blue.<br>
<br>
The strategy I used was to create a fire pet (focused and fully equiped), and park him at the top of this hill - right in the middle of the plateau. By using your new ring of flight (always keep lev on yourself) you can easily run between mountain ranges and use your level 8 bolt spell to pull NPCs back to your pet. If you cast from high on a hill, you don't even need SOW to outrun the NPCs. You'll be running in essentially a straight line (thanks to lev) back to your hill, while the NPCs have to run down the mountain, then back up to your hill (a greater distance). Always fight on top of this hill and you'll never pick up any adds.<br>
<br>
If you get drolvags, Yetis, or cockatrices, your pet can ususally solo them without your help. Ping them with your bolt (40 mana) pull them to your hill and attack them with your pet. Sit down (always in the middle of the plateau so you don't aggro any nearby wanders) and med. I found doing this I could hunt nearly constantly, and actually *gain* mana. (39 Fire pets regen very fast, and kill NPCs fast too!). Occassionally, I would throw in an extra DD just to help Jobobar along, and sometimes a heal if he needed it. These NPCs would drop occasional gems and misc other items, along with 0-4pp.<br>
<br>
Occasionally you'll hit an NPC at the outer limit of the bolt range, which is too far for the NPC to figure out who hit it. When this happens it will starting running away. (The yetis look hillarious when this happens.) You'll want to keep an eye out for this and run after them until you get close enough for them to &quot;see&quot; you. Having levitate on will help you catch up to them quickly, if you're starting at a higher altitude. Letting them go can have unpredictable results. Most of the time they just wander away never to be seen again. However, they're spreading your name onto the hate list of all the other NPCs that they come in contact with and you may end up getting more attention than you want later on.<br>
<br>
Giants are a lot of fun and drop items including tunics which sell for 60pp at vendors. Pull them using the same technique. The level 8 bolt only does 50 dam, so your pet easily gets the aggro off you. After your pet has dropped the Giant down a bubble, cast rain of lava on him and then heal your pet. If you're lucky the fight will be over. If you get resists, then you may need to add another 39 bolt (cinder). <br>
<br>
One other thing to note - normally the NPCs &quot;flee&quot; when they get down to 1 bub of HP. This gives Jobobar &quot;free&quot; time to finish the NPC off and regen at the same time. However, if Jobobar is down below 2 bubs himself, the NPCs (especially giants) will stick it out to the end. If the NPC is down to 1 bub and hasn't started to flee, stand up and attack it. Looking at your full health bar will cause the NPC to flee and Jobobar and wrap things up.<br>
<br>
In general, I avoided the spiders. Because they are casters, I would have to help my pet with additional heals and DDs, making them less efficient XP producers.<br>
<br>
Using this approach, I would get 1-1.25 yellow bubs of XP per hour, and averaged around 100pp per hour too (this would easily fund KEI, which would improve your hunting rate considerably - dang, why didn't I do that?). I found the variety of NPCs and the wide open spaces to be more interesting than just camping the caves. Good luck! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukraygus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kraygus</A> at: 10/18/02 5:44:29 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uravian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ravian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333333>(10/19/02 8:59:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=36>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  oh yeah</span><hr size=1> Good place to fight I am there currently.

I am moving on even though they are still giving me decent XP I want to get used to my next zone with my new pets at 44.<br>
<br>
I just wanted to post my experience here from lvl 38 on up.  I cam here at 38 so I could test it out and see how it was and I also could not stand DSP anymore.  I would be happy if I never saw a Zelniak or a Blood Starved Wolf Again.  First thing I did knowing that I did not have enough real fire power for this zone I made sure I got KEI before going.<br>
<br>
Well my only death came from the very first time I zoned into DL.  I started out by binding In the Nexus for easy sell and acquiring KEI.  It is a lot easier to get a port to DL from the nexus than to get a port from DL to nexus.  I bound in nexus got KEI and ported to DL.  I ran along the large snow covered side of the mountain just to the side of the spires until I came to the mouth of a small cave. <br>
<br>
This cave led to the other side of DL.  Upon entering the other side of DL I invised up and when I could I cast levitate.  This is where I died I let invis drop and didnt notice I got stuck by two spiders who cast root and DoT which killed me.  Stay away from the two spiders they hunt in pairs and hit hard.  When I got lev it made it a lot easier to travel to the yeti cave. <br>
<br>
Exiting the cave I took a right and ran along the snowy mountain side once agin until I saw to Stone pillars marking the ent. of the yeti cave.  The fist time in the yeti cave I was quite nervous but I soon got over that and it became very simple.  I summoned my earth pet so that I could chain them if I needed.  At this level I found that it was pretty easy to do but was not all that mana effective. <br>
<br>
I did it anyway and when the yeti was at about 50 health I blazed him up.  I would pull with malise.  and even though they are practically stacked on top of each other they all pull as singles with spells or pet fighting them in there spot.  I would pull with malise to make sure jobbers root would stick and my nukes would hit.  when you hit 40 or so malise is rarely needed. <br>
<br>
When I dinged 39 I broke out the new and improved pets.  I suited pet up with a full suit of plate and two swords I BO2'd him and expediance and DS some of the time.  You could tell a big diffference in downtime with BO2 and Equipment rather than without it.  I kept KEI up always which allowed for quick leveling.  I made more than enough money while camping this spawn to make up for the 50pp in Nexus for KEI and 35 for port back to DL.  <br>
<br>
After hiting 39 it was very easy to hold all 7 spawns so I got bored and decided to pull more from outside the Cave.  I found that the best bang for the buck were the Davalargs or whatever they are called.  There seems to tons of them around and they almost all drop 4pp at least some times more and they seem to drop gems that sell for 10pp a lot more often.  They helped me earn money and good exp while waiting for the repop.  They hit harder on the pet so you will want to burn them down quicker but they have not as many hit points as the yetis so they go down quicker.  <br>
<br>
I would also take down the giants when they were in bolt distance.  I would sit in the mouth of the cave and cast a bolt spell when there was a mob in range.  That way I stayed out of aggro of all other mobs this kept adds down to 0 only with the ocasional spider did I get any adds.  I did kill giants they drop gems 5g-5pp and axes that sell for about 2pp each and one out of about 50 droped a tunic that sold for 50pp to the vendor.  They were a better sense of accomplishment more than anything and were more fun but very mana entensive not nearly as exp effective as the davalargs. <br>
<br>
I would pull outside for about 5-15 minutes as long as there were mobs to pull and then I would go back in and fight more yetis. This made for almost non stop fighitng.  Pets health was the only real limiting factor and occasionally a little medding for KEI if you had a horsey you would never need to stop except for pet to regain.  I wouldnt bother with pet healing because they regain hp so fast when sitting.  <br>
<br>
I flew through lvls 39-44 here about twice as fast as 34-39 so live it up this place was great have fun it is non stop fighting.
