I really want to gather some friends and take advantage of this goldmine of a zone. I went once a few levels ago but was basically following a hihger level friend around as he killed various things, in hopes of getting some fire goblin skin for my robe quest. There were MANY spawns, many drops that can sell well or be used. Anyways, on Lanys this zone is rarely hunted in, only by monks who harvest the treasure within. So I would have to gather up a few friends before hand, and see what we could clear out. Anyone have any knowledge/tips/references for this zone? <p>Adelphi Etrigan

ALOT of stuff in here is green to me and does not give any experience, so you should be in very very good position to make decent experience. Everything in this dungeon is camped 90% of the time, so your stuck hitting the static unnamed spawns. There is a vendor in here you can buy/sell to, (im iksar monk, so I have to FD/SNEAK to get him to sell to me) Same advice here as any other dungeon, if you have a runner, your in trouble. If any spawn is wandering, its PROBABLY a placeholder for a named spawn. Most of this dungeon is static.<br>
<br>
Good luck, wish I could have told you more. its easy to pull to a zone untill you get confortable with it.<br>

Good luck!<br>

Kindle is a pretty decent camp at your level, so long as you have a good partner or a group.<br>
<br>
If you have a good group with a monk or other good puller, I recommend camping the room right outside the reckless efreeti. From here, if your puller is skilled and quick, you can pull the reckless efreeti (common drop: platinum armbands, a nice wis item, rare drop: Obsidian flamberge a useless no drop two-hander), blazing elementals (very very rare drop: power of fire), fire goblin captain (common drop: charred boots which used to be sought after but aren't very popular anymore, rare drop: charred gauntlets which might be useful to shadowsknights), Kindle (common drop: Obsidian ring AC 3 +3 DEX +10 hp which aren't very good, I sell them to newbie rogues for 16pp, rare drop: Impskin gloves +5 INT +10 mana oh yeah baby you want these), and Singe (Common drop: obsidian bead hoop AC 2 +3 INT +3 AGI earrings not bad at all, rare drop: drakescale belt +3 DEX +5 sv fire, also not a bad item, I'm wearing one.)<br>
<br>
If your group is very strong and you don't mind the faction hit, you could camp Gabbie's room. Gabbie's common drop is the mithril quill (a useless piercer) and her rare drop is the molten cloak (+4 INT +4 WIS, you probably want one unless you've got a Mystic cloak). From her room you can pull several clockworks, including the roaming EXG (common drop Charred shield, rare drop Charred breastplate, both pretty nice items.) Be aware that the clockworks are tougher than the goblins, and they are also highly resistant to magic. In fact, the EXG is 100% resistant, she cannot be cast on by anybody. Also in this area you can get Captain Bipnupple, but he's pretty rare. His rare drop is the gnomish environment suit, which is a nice piece of dragon resist equipment for classes that can't wear a dwarven ringmail tunic or an SMR.<br>
<br>
If you have a strong group you can also try the king room. The experience just blazes here, but the loot isn't as good, IMO. Also, the bar is good experience for groups, but not not much loot potential.<br>
<br>
If you're intending to solo at your level, I recommend the goblin foreman or kobold predator areas. Some of the goblins will con green to you, but you will be able to keep the situation under control. There is a convenient zone to Sol B near the foreman, in case you run into trouble. The foreman commonly drops the foreman's tunic (nice for druids and clerics) and rarely drops the obsidian scimitar. The kobold predator commonly drops the kobold hide boots (okay I guess) and rarely drops the the obsidian shard (a nice piercer, rogues and rangers love em).<br>
<br>
Sol A is rarely hunted by groups that can get experience there. This is a shame because it really is one of the nicest dungeons around, I love the place to death and spent as much time as I could there. Three things scare people away: 1. large races can't move around unless they are shrunk, 2. its a goblin dungeon, which means you actually have to pay attention and stay on top of the crowd control, and 3. there's lava. More on this below.<br>
<br>
Sol A is regularly camped by high levels waiting for a group in Sol B, or bored magicians trying to get a power of fire. Fortunately these people are more polite here than they often are in Permafrost. But a high level will often wander around killing an entire section of the dungeon, and frown on you trying to set up a camp somewhere on their turf. Just talk to them and you can usually work something out. But they won't give up Kindle, trust me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A lot of people worry about the lava in Sol A. Well, the only bad lava is near the Lavastorm zone. Throughout the rest of the zone, lava is just a dangerous decoration to be respected. Near the LS zone, though, it's a deathtrap. If you are running from a train, I recommend you run to one of the many zones to Sol B conveniently scattered throughout the dungeon. Some clockworks can throw you off the ledge, or if you hit a lag spike or get stunned, over the edge you go. It's much better to run to a Sol B zone, then gate to Lavastorm.<br>
<br>
If you do fall in here, you are dead. The only way to retrieve your corpse is to get a friend to levitate you. You can swim in the lava and follow it until you zone into Sol B. For Agnostic's sake, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> don't do this.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> You will still be in lava in Sol B, but worse, you'll be on the business end of the king room. It's even harder to get your corpse here.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this info helps. I encourage anybody in the low 30s to hunt in this great zone, just keep your wits about you and hunt smart. Some final notes on the good things in Sol A:<br>
<br>
- Good pathing. You'll have no pet trouble here except at one trouble spot near the LS zone.<br>
- Awesome loot. Even the common stuff is good, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> tons</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of fine steel, gemstones, and high quality ore.<br>
- 2 merchants in the zone, one goblin, one gnome<br>
- Many zones to Sol B. If you're ever in trouble, there's a zone nearby.<br>
- Lots of rare spawns to camp. There's usually one open somewhere.<br>
<br>
Oh, and one final note, don't use fire based spells here, stick to shock of spikes. The goblins are all resistant to fire. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 36th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=balthemal>Balthemal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333333>(7/6/01 5:25:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Anyone got Solusek A tips? </span><hr size=1> Anything here give exp at 39?
