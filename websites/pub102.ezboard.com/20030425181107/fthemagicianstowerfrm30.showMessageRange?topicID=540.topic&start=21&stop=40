The &quot;Efficiency Path,&quot; as I have described, affects all playstyles, and allows a great deal of flexibility when things don't go according to plan.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Get as many FT items and as big a mana pool as your playstyle will allow you, and go for those AA skills that help in this area<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
... or use pet canni during your downtime.  Pure evocation is intrinsically less efficient and needs to be heavily subsidized by Flowing Thought and outside Clarity buffs.  Heavy outside buffing of the pets helps as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>SCF is a total no brainer as first choice, or was for me,<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Really?  I would have thought that even for Evocationists, the efficiency of SCM would have been the no-brainer as first choice.  Like I said already, SCM maxed gives a 15% boost to efficiency for ALL spells.  SCF maxed gives 7%, and ONLY for nukes/rains.  Apparently a bigger bang is more important to an Evocationist than being able to sustain smaller bangs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As for the class skills, I even looked at QS, but frankly for the evocation mage, reduced time on CoH is not a good reason to spend so many points.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
QS 3= FT 95+ when using pet canni (deducting the mana regen bonus of meditate).  Without the summoning hastes, that drops to about FT 35+.  I can see why someone would not choose the mana regen benefits of Quick Summoning, being Evoc specialized and all...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Get as many <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FT items</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->... and go for those AA skills that help in this area.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Looks to me you just contradicted yourself.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And I think I will be buying 15 points in resists before I waste aaxp on IR or EP, things that are of zero use to me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is what IR means:  No matter how injured your pet is, or how low in mana you are, you will always have at least enough mana for one more pet.  That would benefit every single magician in the game, except you of course.<br>
<br>
This is what EP means:  No matter how little malachite you have, you will still be able to reclaim pets for mana, or get one more pet up for battle.  That would also benefit every single magician in the game, except you, like you stated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, it is another path.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That it is.  Perhaps not optimal, but definitely another path.  &quot;Optimal&quot; involves getting the most effect for the least effort and fewest AA's spent.  One way to optimize on the Quick Summoning path is to only get QS 2 and a Summoning Haste item.  That would save 9 AA points.<br>
<br>
As a side note, there is nothing wrong with getting the bigger bangs of Fury, but efficiency should be the primary focus, and in the order of greatest effect first.  I fully intend to increase my efficiency by buying Fury and Clarity, but they were not the highest priority early on.  With the advent of reclaim chaining, I can take my time getting those skills, since I am never lacking for mana anyway.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Get as many FT items and as big a mana pool as your playstyle will allow you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
LOL  I have FT 0, a mana pool of approximately 2800 or so, and like I just said, I am never lacking for mana.  I can sit if I want, or stand, nuke when I want (or need), refuse to buy or beg for clarity buffs, and still not worry about my mana needs.  This sounds quite optimal to me. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A> at: 2/12/03 8:44:35 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cydmab>Cydmab</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 787<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/03 9:35:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Optimal AA path for magicians</span><hr size=1> Quote:<br>
<br>
Pet discipline in a raid environmet I don't entirely understand. If I am engaged with our target, my pet is up and fighting. If not, I am using pet canni, CoH, summoning focus gear, or mass rodding. If nothing is being engaged, there is no need to have a pet up, but with QS 3, a new pet is only a few short seconds away. If aoe cross-aggro is an issue, then you are probably better off canni/nuking. If enrage is an issue, then either reposition your pet or reclaim it and resummon just before enrage ends (Quick Summoning helps immensely.)<br>
<br>
Enquote<br>
<br>
I guess this is how I see it. I have so much mana regen under raid conditions, that I very, very rarely need to cannapet. I'm aggro constrained. Even if I were low on mana, pet does a tremendous amount of aggro-free damage. Depending on your gear and spells, pet cannabilizing for extra nukes when you could be just sending in your high dps water pet can be a wash or even harmful. (Pet can do over 100 dps, including procs. If you get 5DPMana, then you must generate about 120 mana/tic from pet cannabilizing , including refresh times between spells, messups, pet suspends, (if you save an armed and buffed pet), and the time it takes to dump that mana into nukes. <br>
<br>
I have a higher standard of pet being fully controlled then just if there are aoe's about: I want the pet to be under full control when any adds are incoming, so enchanters can handle cc without any risk from me. To do this one can:<br>
 <br>
1. Use pet hold until things calm down<br>
2. Destroy the pet<br>
3. Use back off liberally and focus very carefully on what the pet is doing.<br>
4. suspend the pet<br>
<br>
Option 1 solves the problem nicely. Using option 2 regularly means it's difficult to keep the pet shrunk, and almost impossible to keep the pet armed with procing weapons (there goes 10dps of aggro-free damage). It also wastes 5+2.25 seconds to remake the pet, plus time to burnout the pet. If the time of pet control danger is short (say, a multi-pull and waiting 5 seconds for the enchanters to mez extra mobs) then this can be very costly. Option 3 means stress, lots amount of trust from my guild, and alot of focus, which can prevent me from nuking, cohing pullers/late comers, summoning rods, malosinia duty, or other functions. Option 4 is slow like option 2 and costs even more AA than pet hold. It also fails if the pet does accidently aggro something before you get the effect to work.<br>
<br>
That said, I must admit I sometimes take FT15 and the option to pet cannabilize for granted. There's a good case for the following initial AA lineup, especially if you solo/duo alot:<br>
<br>
run 3<br>
regen 3<br>
SCM 3<br>
QS 2<br>
Suspend companion 2<br>
<br>
I'm hostile to IR (kinda screwy effects with rathe's son, some good, some very bad), EP (don't need if you have rathe's son and I never found having a backpack of malachite a horrid burden), and QS3 (10% bonus for 9AA, and doesn't apply if you have a summoning haste focus or blessing of reverence). OTOH some of these objections revolve around the 65 pet. If you know you won't have Rathe's son ever, then they would not apply. <p>Master Cydmab Promethean<br>

<br>
Like Cydmab said, after aggro and other considerations mana is generally not really high on the list of limiting factors that go into most boss fights.  I hit pet hold on raids all the time, if I had to reclaim my pet every single time that happens I would go nuts.<br>
<br>
At the very least, /pet hold lets me summon, pre-buff, and pre-equip a pet no matter what the situation will be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">even an unknown situation</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  Using reclaim/resummon to pull my pet off every single time it needed to be moved would not only make me go insane, but would lower my pet's damage output, and quite possibly my nuke output as well.  I can even /pet hold mid-nuke if I want to.<br>
<br>
Yes, for some fights mana is an issue, although for a single encounter it's rare that you would actually want to take your pet off the target in order to reclaim nuke mana.  Chaining pets is also useful in certian fights, particularly if there is a nasty AE.  I'm not saying IRE, QS, and EP are useless on raids and /pet hold is godly, but to break it down by skill:<br>
<br>
IRE:  3 points for an ability with questionable use.. if you really like cannibalize it's already possible with the 49 pets.  That should hold you over for the 6 points needed to get pet hold.  Maybe reclaiming low health pets against AE dragons would be more useful than I'm giving it credit for, I just seem to remember my pets lasting fairly well through most fights, even with AEs.  But at 3 points I don't really think this one is a big deal either way.<br>
<br>
QS3:  This costs 18 points and all it really does relative to hold is make the raid workarounds go a little more quickly.  There are still hard drawbacks.  At the very least 6 points into pet hold is more useful than the 9 to upgrade QS2 to QS3.  I can see an argument for QS2 before /pet hold, especially since it works on CoTH, but I would still say /pet hold is generally more practical.<br>
<br>
Elemental Pact:  This is really only for convenience.  While there are tangible drawbacks that you will almost certianly encounter trying to reclaim/resummon pets instead of using /pet hold, you can simulate 99% of elemental pact by bringing a backpack full of malachite to the raid.  Sure, go ahead and get Elemental Pact, it most certianly convenient, but definitely not more than /pet hold.  I would almost suggest /pet hold over EP for a non-raiding mage.<br>

Subtlety, but frankly I basically never get aggro chaining FoT in groups as it is, so it is hard to justify it at the moment. <br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
mmm can you be more specific when you say &quot;chaining.&quot; Chaining means you start casting as soon as the mob arrives and do not pause for even one second between casts. If that's true I find it hard to believe you never gain aggro. If you aren't really chain nuking, just nuking heavily, say so. <br>
=============================================<br>
<br>
Well, 'chaining' only means, casting one spell after another with no pause until the mob dies. It does not imply starting at 'Inc' call, as well that is plain dumb for any nuking class *grin*.<br>
<br>
Ok, to be serious, take for example Bastion of Thunder, which is my favorite xp haunt at the moment, in one of the giant wings. With a good paladin or SK tank, give let them get the mob to 80%, then drop the giant by chaining FoT from horseback, no aggro, never FM, very good xp rate (if the group is strong). I am not saying Subtlety is useless, I am only saying, for me I do not think it worth the points at this time compared to other options.<br>

I know you love Pet Canni / Chaining as *your* style. You post it all over these forums, and you are entitled to do so, as can anyone. You are free to follow the style you like. You can even make claims of greater 'efficiency' or being more 'optimal' for your own approach, something many of us will not agree with but there you go.<br>
<br>
I put one line near the top of my first post saying I am no fan of Pet Canni [PC] (and implicitly of Chaining Pets [CP]), and went on to make my own recommendations based on an evocationalist wizzie+pet sustainer playstyle.<br>
<br>
You replied by ever so helpfully explaining how the AA skills worked, as if clearly those who do not follow your gospel do not understand, and then used the facts of how they work to somehow draw the conclusion that your style is more efficient. Sorry sir, we do understand, we just do not all agree with your conclusions; it is almost as if your post is designed by it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>tone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to start a 'fight' lol.<br>
<br>
I have a number of problems with PC/CP:<br>
<br>
1) I am a roleplayer, and PC makes no roleplay sense. I summon a being from another plane, to assist me. It is bound to my soul for it's duration by my side, and we become allies. It is not a captive enemy, it cons amiable. I do not senselessly and repeatedly murder it for ... mana gain. How anti-thematic can one be? /shrug, this is a personal thing.<br>
<br>
2) Roleplay aside, it still makes no sense, it feels like an exploit, or at least, a cheesy gimp tactic for those unskilled to do things 'properly'. Summoning and killing a pet to gain mana just seems wrong. Really, I don't feel it *should* work, and I'd be one mage who wouldn't miss it if it were removed totally [and yes, I know it does work for regening mana grandmother, eggs, etcetera, but there are other factors you are quietly ignoring].<br>
<br>
Now, ok, these are not going to worry most people, and I'd possibly push them aside if it was not for:<br>
<br>
3) It isn't fun, it is merely irritating. I've just buffed/armoured/armed my pet, I do not want to keep doing it over and over, and I want my pet at max DPS all the time. This is subjective, obviously. But it just isn't fun for me.<br>
<br>
With this point, I'd probably just ignore PC/CP even if it was slightly more efficient. <br>
<br>
However, and here is the kicker:<br>
<br>
4) For most circumstances the evocationalist mage chooses to encounter, PC/CP simply does not cut the mustard. The claims made by Jochan and his cohort are not deliverable.<br>
<br>
What PC/CP *does* allow is for magi to kill 'bigger' things, that cannot be killed using traditional evocation wizzie+pet tactics, even when taken as far as I take them. No evocationalist/sustainer mage is going to solo a WW dragon, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
But is this the objective, to be able to do such a thing? Well, for me, no it is not. The objective is to kill blue cons, preferably the easiest low blue cons, for max xp in minimum time, averaged over solo, duo and single group situations. In this domain, no matter how many words from you sir, I believe the evocationalist sustainer wins. I can output more damage and make a larger contribution to groups from 2 to 6 people than I could if I were a Conjure-based PC/CP mage. Your repeating of the opposite and your condescension toward others with other views does not change the fact.<br>
<br>
Pre-PoP, PC/CP as a tactic for mana regen and for killing mobs, is a joke. When such as I could go into Akheva or Fungus Grove at 60 with 42 AAXP points, and slaughter mobs pretty much nonstop for excellent xp, to my experience faster than any conjure mage with the same gear would be able to manage, I'd have laughed at any mage chaining pets. Sure, they'd use no mana, but they'd waste so much time, coupled with the risk that, sooner or later, they'd mistime it and die, or at least be forced to flee from zone. The fact is, with KEI, SCF, SCM, MC, and lots of FT, a fully buffed/equipped pet and nonstop rains and bolts cut through low blue con mobs like butter, with as close to zero risk as feasibly ever possible.<br>
<br>
Post-PoP, soloing is HARDER, much harder. At first glance, PC looks much better than it did before, for soloing, although in groups almost every mage I know will use the same blast, med and sustain techniques they always did and extremely effectively. But a closer look, at all those wonderful new equippable items to boost the DPS of pets past 80 (and even to 110 in groups), combined with the truly amazing DPS of Firebolt of Tallon, mean that if I can find mobs I can solo at all (a challenge, sadly, and one I would like to see rectified, but that is the subject of another thread), the evocationalist sustain+blast tactics remain solid and very efficient.<br>
<br>
Make ONE pet. Buff, equip and arm it as well as you can. Get buffs from others if you can. Get the most mana regen you can. Sit on your horse and destroy all that comes against you, and make sure that pet stays alive. Then do *NOT* PC, but sit still on your horse, med, let your pet regen (or, better, get a heal for him if available), and repeat.<br>
<br>
In short, in those BoT groups I so love at the moment, I can contribute more to the xp rate of that group than a PC mage can because of my specialization choice and playstyle. You are perfectly allowed to advocate your style, sir, but start rubbishing that of others, and the weaknesses in your argument will be shown too.<br>
<br>
I will deal with just one of your points directly, as it shows a lack of understanding of the evocationalist needs.<br>
<br>
======<br>
Really? I would have thought that even for Evocationists, the efficiency of SCM would have <br>
<br>
been the no-brainer as first choice. ...<br>
======<br>
<br>
I know the effects of SCF and SCM, I don't need to be 'educated'. SCF III gives +7% DPM +7% DPS, whereas SCM III gives +15% DPM zero DPS gain. The reason why SCF III is a no brainer choice for the evocationalist is that **DPS** increase. It is all about killing and killing fast - for low blues, killing fast = more mobs killed for less damage done on the pet and more medding time. Of course, the joy of those 4K+ crits is a factor (fun always is!), but there is also method to this madness. SCM is wonderful yes, but SCF is even better. For me, and for some other magi, at least.<br>
<br>
Open your eyes and accept there are other ways, and they just might be more fun!<br>

I'm not going to do another Suze vs. Jochan battle.  My choices not only speak for themselves, but I have already elaborated why they are superior.<br>
<br>
This thread is about the &quot;optimal&quot; path or paths for a magician.  My theory is that efficiency is the most optimal path.  You can argue roleplay reasons, you can argue about kill rate (and by the way, you are wrong.  Without subsidizing your evoc tactics with heavy doses of FT and clarity buffs, the chainer will come out the exp winner in most any zone, vs most any mobs.)  You can argue about virtually anything you want, but you can't easily argue against efficiency.  Efficiency allows you to kill more in a given amount of time by reducing or eliminating downtime.  Once you are at the point where downtime is eliminated, you can add more evocation style tactics (i.e. more nukes/rains) to reduce kill time as well.<br>
<br>
Pet Discipline is useful and helpful in a variety of circumstances, but it does very little for efficiency.  As such it is a lower priority than Spell Casting Mastery, for example.  Subtlety has its merits as well, in groups, raids, and solo, but once again it's doubtful it should take a higher priority than, say, Spell Casting Fury.<br>
<br>
Once again, when you reach a point where you have maximized efficiency in a variety of tactics, the rest is all personal tastes, or special needs.<br>
<br>

Pets don't die when reclaimed, they return/despawn and leave energy to be absorbed.  They die when the mob beats them down to 0 hit points.  Expert magicians have discovered how to harness reclaim in such an efficient way that they can reclaim more energy than they spent to summon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=suzannadreamingheart>SuzannaDreamingheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mistress of Evocation</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#333333>(2/13/03 2:30:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Optimal AA path for magicians</span><hr size=1> ======<br>

So why did you start one, seemingly purposefully, when you attempted to belittle the evocationalist playstyle with your usual patronizing language in your previous post?<br>
<br>
======<br>
My choices not only speak for themselves, but I have already elaborated why they are superior.<br>
======<br>
<br>
This is classic Jochan.<br>
<br>
No, you 'elaborated' why YOU THINK they are 'superior' (according to your own criteria, judgement and limitations). There is no absolute truth in something just because 'Jochan said it', even if Jochan thinks there is. Others have differing criteria, and others can and will make different judgements, and others may not have the same limitations, and they are not all wrong for coming to different conclusions.<br>
<br>
You would be better advised to simply advocate your own path as the most optimal, and let others advocate theirs, and let everyone else decide for themselves, based on their own experience.<br>
<br>
======<br>
you can argue about kill rate (and by the way, you are wrong. Without subsidizing your evoc tactics with heavy doses of FT and clarity buffs, the chainer will come out the exp winner in most any zone, vs most any mobs.) <br>
======<br>
<br>
Sir, you try to sidestep the killer blow, but it is still there.<br>
<br>
What is this 'subsidy' thing you complain about yet again? We magi can and do all get KEI just about whenever we need it. I have many chanter friends to go get KEI off, and if none are available, I can get it from my group, or from the group next to me, or at a push I can go buy it in Nexus in 5 minutes. FT items are not hard to collect, even for those like me in tiny guilds who almost never raid. And MC is a wonderful AA skill for the evocationalist.<br>
<br>
Your whole position is based on 'Without KEI and lots of FT ... chainer wins ...'.<br>
<br>
What evocationalist worth their salt ever hunts without these things??? When I have them (which is like, doh, always), with the mana regen at my disposal, why in the world would I employ such a clumbsy cheesy tactic as CP in normal low blue xp-grinding situations? For high mana regen scenarios, the evocationalist will win on xp rate just about anywhere they choose to hunt (as would a high mana regen conjure-based sustainer for that matter, at least compared to a chain caster).<br>
<br>
======<br>
LOL I have FT 0, a mana pool of approximately 2800 or so,<br>
======<br>
<br>
From your previous post. Well, with a setup like that, combined with refusing to buy KEI, you are handicapping yourself so badly, no wonder you feel forced to use CP so much.<br>
<br>
But keep your head in that sand, Jochan, you will believe as you wish. If you would not be so condescending towards other styles, you would not have to have it pushed back at you.<br>
<br>
======<br>
I'm not going to do another Suze vs. Jochan battle.<br>
======<br>
<br>
Yes, I know, I repeated it. I suspect you didn't mean this, but if you did, then you won't need to reply to me further, now, will you.<br>

Getting buffs from outside classes is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> something that should enter into &quot;optimal AA path&quot; discussions.

I'm not handicapped in any way.  I always have mana, can always get a pet up if my sustained pet falls (in standard grouping scenarios), can nuke as frequently as I dare, and can form up successful groups with virtually any class as a duo with NO downtime and good experience rate.<br>

A few weeks back, I was in a 4 magician group in Valor.  All the other magicians had KEI.  I did not.  We had a three frog pull.  The &quot;Evocationist&quot; in my partners came out and we nuked one of the frogs down, leaving 2.  One magician died due to overaggro on his nukes, leaving 3 of us and 2 frogs.  We chained.  I reclaim chained, and they, not having trained 3 points in IR, chained in the normal fashion.  The other TWO magicians went OOM, while I was still chugging away.  I cannot solo two frogs.  We all died.<br>

<br>
Been trolling the boards for a long time with a few posts along the way.  Just dinged 101 AA pts and want to give you my thoughts and what skills I have bought.<br>
<br>
Run3<br>
Regen 3<br>
Int5 - went for AC and Hp prior ro the rod nerf and was at 220 int - also spent 4 points in pop int.  With some recent upgrades my int is 245.<br>
<br>
SCM3 - the best skill out there.<br>
SCF3 <br>
Mental Clarity 3 - lots of controversy but having innate mana regen3 is great.<br>
<br>
Pet Hold -definite must have.<br>
Mend Companion - followed by haste mend 3 - 9 min recast time on a 1980 pt heal.  This rocks for solo.<br>
Water Elem 1 - looks cool but wish it had a faster recast time.<br>
Next class skill will be QS 2 and Elemental pact - for faster pet canni.<br>
<br>
Pop Int 4<br>
<br>
Suspeneded Minion 2 - this skill is fantastic.  Get a pet up and buffed/armed/ds, suspend, invis yourself and run to your camp with a pet ready to go.  Also, great for pet canni - I use MS2 combined with summoning efficency3, conj spec and and SCM3, fm comes fast, and will be faster with QS2.<br>
Host of Element 3 - impresses the yokels, does a nice piece of damage and if you are quick you can surround the mob with 9 pets = )<br>
Fury5 - Just bought, and from what I have read it's a 12% crit chance - I have noticed more crits =p<br>
<br>
So, there are lots of ways to go.  SCM3 is a must.  I like the idea of trying to save as much mana as possible, followed by maximizing mana regen and finishing it with a large mana pool.<br>

======<br>
<br>
Absolutely. There are only optimal ways for various playstyles, and of course, those who follow those playstyles unsurprisingly choose the best approachs and hunting grounds for themselves. Which is why people have different opinions.<br>
<br>
To someone who doesn't use PC, and I know many who practically never do, and especially to those who bias toward groups and almost never raid, QS is not an exciting or vital skill, and EP and IR are as useful as Innate Charisma.<br>
<br>
To someone like Jochan, they are vital and worth their weight in gold.<br>
<br>
To recommend to other magi, listen to all and decide for yourselves, based on your own playstyle. Horses for courses, all things in balance.<br>

<br>
More arrogance, defining YOUR path as 'the' Efficiency path. It isn't. And yes, I just did tell you the evocationalist path is superior to the PC one, at least, for many magi it is, even if it is not for you.<br>
<br>
I'll remember when a chanter comes ask me for focus items for KEI when I log in tonight, as happens many nights, to say no, as that would be powerlevelling myself (and him!) ROFL. Geez I've heard some nonsense in my time ... LOL<br>
<br>
Keep making sweeping and condescendingly arrogant statements on public messages boards, giving biased, unbalanced and even plain bad advice to others, and you will keep getting refuted.<br>
<br>
It seems, noone can have a different opinion than Jochan without being 'WRONG'.<br>
<br>
I'm done here. I don't go attacking your posts on other threads, even if I think you are talking manifest nonsense. Kindly give me the same respect, and we do not have to have these 'exchanges'.<br>

Very very true.  In many cases, those buffs are essential for the raid.  I still view it as a bonus, however, rather than the status quo. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 937<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/03 7:25:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Optimal AA path for magicians</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I'll remember when a chanter comes ask me for focus items for KEI when I log in tonight, as happens many nights, to say no, as that would be powerlevelling myself (and him!)

My humble apologies Suzanna, for seeming to start a war between magician factions.  I did not say that outside buffing is wrong, but I did say that many take it for granted.  Also, I did say that it should be viewed as a bonus to make things more efficient, rather than the baseline to which you compare effectiveness.<br>
<br>
I also did not try to say that every magician should be reclaim chaining as their standard tactic.  It is amazingly efficient and flexible, but I will not try to bend another magician to that style ( I heartily encourage all to try it out, however.)  In fact, that is not the only style I use, either.  I try to be flexible based on group needs and mob strength.  Whatever is most efficient, with the least amount of outside assistance, is my primary aim.<br>
<br>
One thing I will state is that if you follow my AA path, it will give you a great deal of flexibility and confidence, as efficiency affects all playstyles.  It will allow you to chain pets mana free, resummon pets quickly when needed (such as during possible wipeout, or in raids where the pet falls too early), allow you to gain back mana at a rapid pace, nuke as freely as you dare, and maximize experience rate in both ideal and less-than-ideal grouping settings (from 2-6 people, or even solo, with a huge range of player choices as partners or groupmates.)  In CoTH situations, you will not be dependent on outside infusions of mana to bring the whole raid to the designated area, and there will be minimized delay.<br>
<br>
To me, at least, that is what the &quot;optimal&quot; AA path is all about. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2902<br> <font color=#333333>(2/15/03 4:20:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=540.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Optimal AA path for magicians</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Suzanna</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Jochan</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are both vocal advocates of different approaches to magery.
