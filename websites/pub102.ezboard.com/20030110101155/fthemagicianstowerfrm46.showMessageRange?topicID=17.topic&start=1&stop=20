<br>
While I would never claim to speak for all magicians, I do carefully observe a variety of styles and preferences here in this forum and in play, and think I am qualified at least to expound my own vision, which should not be terribly alien to the readers.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Gobaner:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  The principle reason I play a mage and not some other class is my boon companion <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  My warrior in a bottle, he kicks ass and takes names when I uncork him.  I want him to be powerful, I want him to win.  I want people around me to be glad they are on the same side.  He is my sword and shield in a hostile world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A thousand fiery blades:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  But even then, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is but a means to an end: holding off the enemy while I rain woe and ruination down upon.  I think you will die now.<br>
<br>
Those were the basic facts of magician life for quite some time.  Once upon a time, they were even both true.  This initial vision, however modified and made more complex, must remain the core of what it is to be a mage.  A mage is a classic, self contained group.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> melees the foe while I support him by buffing, healing, and nukes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Temporal Powers:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Many class abilities can be viewed from the perspective of affecting the pace of encounters: lengthening the fight through healing or mezzing, shortening the fight by dealing damage, buffs and debuffs, haste and slow, and so on.  Magicians are no exception.  The temporal powers given to us, besides pets and nukes above, include creating and redistributing mana using rods, call of the hero, damage shields, the malosini line, and various summons, especially focii.  This succinctly describes most of our spell set, and are the tools with which every mage works and becomes strong in.<br>
<br>
The question is, knowing this, what more might mages be offered with an additional five levels that would build on their strengths, preferring to modify old roles than establish new, especially unrelated roles.  In other words, how to preserve the class and thereby the customers who enjoy it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> New Pets:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Something like another circle beyond <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Greater Vocaration</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  If they have special powers or cast spells, please do not make them stupid.  I would prefer fightings pets.  Elemental pets for 61-64, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Monster Summoning 4</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at 65.  Give MS4 some power.  Damage shield.  The pets must keep pace with the mobs, and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> be nothing more than a weak but mana efficient damage over time spell.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A bigger nuke:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Obviously.  What ever nuke or nukes seems appropriate: a fire based bolt, a conjured based shock, and an evocation based rain.  A new nuke every other level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> A bigger damage shield:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Single target DS somewhere 61-3, group DS 64-5.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Upgraded Self Buffs:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  One Upgrade each in the Arch Shielding, Elemental Aura, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> Phantasmal Armor lines.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Upgraded Pet buffs:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If not in the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Burnout Line</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, something else, like a mini-avatar that consumes a gem, perhaps as an AA skill.  Something: at least one combat related pet buff.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Summons:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Two summons.  A belt worth wearing, and weapon worth summoning.  Either one or both can be pet only.  If I have to have a stupid summons, let it be to summon a bag of caster wearable pajamas, with maybe a little stats or resists on them and low AC.  They can and should look dorky, marking the wearer as an obvious Corpse Recovery.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Malosini:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  If we want to be little creative, extending an existing role a little ways, how about a PBAoE <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Malosini</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Gives me something to do to aid enchanters, but requires some personal risk.  An upgrade to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Malosini</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
So how does what has been revealed on test go with this?<br>
<br>
New pets, check, except MS4, and who knows how good the pets will be?  If they suck, we suck.<br>
New nukes, but they aren't the right ones.  Back to the drawing board.<br>
Bigger damage shield, but group only.  Give us the targetted DS upgrade.<br>
Upgraded self buffs, but again, they aren't the right ones.  Too many archshields, too many elemental shields and those are weak, and no phantasmal upgrade.<br>
No pet buffs.<br>
No summons.<br>
Malosini upgrade okay, but I still want PBAoE Malosini too.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, they give us:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Mezz Summmoned:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I am not given easily to profanity, but WTF?  I do not know how to mezz.  Never, ever, in my darkest imaginings, did I ever consider that I might ever mezz anything ever.  Please god no.  I don't care how useful it might be, on one, two or more planes, but I do not care.  If you want me on crowd control, either give me PBAoE Malosini, to support the enchanters who already know how to mezz, or, if you insist on giving me a crowd control summoned spell, give me <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Root Summoned</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Now root is a spell that many magicians have coveted for years.  If we must have a new crowded control toy against summoned, let it be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Root</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  Mages have been thinking about what they might do with root for a long time, and they would actually <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>enjoy</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> rooting, as opposed to mezzing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Charmed Summoned:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I suppose it had to happen eventually, what with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Dire Charm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and all, but I am not excited.  I will accept it if necessary.  But I tell you what, trade you charm and mezz summoned for PBAoE Malosini and Root Summoned, and you will have some happy mages.  Oh, and it had better be a damn good root too--summoned only.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Imbue Elements:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I do not care if I can sell them to tradeskillers for a thousand plat each, or you can use them with tailoring to make robes I can sell for 50K in bazaar, really, no thank you.  This is just eating up spells slots.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>IF</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> we must have this, then I suggest the following.  Give this line <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>also</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to enchanters, but give mages enchant silver, electrum, gold, platinum, and steel, so we can enchant our metals for tradeskilling.  <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>IF</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> I am made into an imbuer for tradeskills, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>then</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> I want to be able to do something for myself to help myself skill up.  Otherwise, I would rather do without the imbuer role entirely.<br>
<br>
I make no stand as to the relative value of nukes, as the ultimate value of them depends on how good our pets are, which is unknown.  I understand that every class must now be a damage dealer in order to raid.  I do not want to become more like an enchanter.  Fix the numbers on the spells, and give me some pet support, and I will be a happy mage.<br>

I definitely agree that VI should focus on improving our abilites rather than adding new ones. Looking at our spell lines, these are my thoughts:<br>
<br>
Pets:<br>
I dont worry about the epic pet getting useless. It will still be the strongest pet by far I think. I rather expect the new pets to have special abilites, and hope the fire pet will get some serious use again.<br>
Personally I would prefer if our major upgrade came through the new pets, rather than through<br>
<br>
<br>
Nukes:<br>
We have five spell lines of nukes:<br>
- Evocation based shock spells. These roughly double with each step, look at Blaze, Char, and now Sun Vortex. I think Sun Vortex is a reasonable upgrade.<br>
<br>
- Conjuration based shock spells. If you look at the proposed upgrade it is nowhere near the upgrade from SoSwords (44) to SoSteel (5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , then SoFB (60). Black Steel definitely needs some tuning to be a valuable upgrade, with 1200 damage it would be in line with its predecessors. If the manacost for Black Steel could be kept as it is now it would make it a good all day nuke.<br>
<br>
- Evocation based bolt spells. Taking a look at our spells again, the proposed upgrade is perfectly in line with the predecessors Lava Bolt and Seeking Flame. On the other hand our bolt spells always had an advantage in damage for the reduced easy of use, so Firebolt of Tallon might need an upgrade to make it worth using over the new shock spells. 1400-1500 damage? Seems ok.<br>
<br>
- Evocation based rain spells. Maelstrom of Thunder is a true upgrade damage wise, but the mana cost for it is much too high. If this could be reduced a bit I think the spell would be well balanced. 550-600 mana seems reasonable.<br>
<br>
- Anti summoned nukes. I dont think we need an upgrade here. Unless there are lots of summoned creatures and the spells would truly have an advantage in resists (which they dont have it seems).<br>
<br>
<br>
Debuffing:<br>
I love your idea of a PBAoE Malosini. Gets expensive manawise if you have many mobs there and want to support the chanter <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
However an upgrade to Mala / Malosini? Seeing this proposed and the number of lure spells for wizards it might well be neccessary, but I hope it wont.<br>
<br>
<br>
Damage shields. Do we need an upgrade here? Of course wouldnt say no to one, but I dont think thats of priority.<br>
<br>
<br>
And the other new toys?<br>
I really see no use in giving mages summoned mez, without giving them means to stop the angry mob if mez breaks (stun, root,...). Our pets wont always be able to help us out. For the same reason summoned charm is worthless, even more because of the one pet limit (of course if we were allowed to have two pets up then...this would be an entirely different story).<br>
And I again agree with Raz that imbue spells have no place in our book. Thats not what we do.<br>

The solution is to teach your guild how to /assist on a raid rather than break mezzes. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Usually anything that an enchanter can't tank when mez breaks is something that root / stun won't work on either.<br>

A traditional group has a reserved spot for a CC person.  Allowing a mage to fufill that role in one or two zones could be interesting.<br>

I would have to say mez. Pet's don't (or shouldn't) break mez, they won't be tempted to attack a mezzed mob because its hitting the pet, and you don't need to worry about staying out of range of a rooted mob.<br>
<br>
In a grouping situation, you will most likely have an enchanter, so unless the summoned mezzes stick better or something, they would be pointless. Root may have better uses in groups but it still really depends on who is in the group. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urazdaleblack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razdaleblack</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(9/22/02 6:36:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> Charming uber elementals might be fun. Could even be a way to get improved pets in some zones but the danger would be very high. With no traditional Jabober to hold the mobs at bay I generally don't like to engage. I suppose the elemental mezz could be used to control the pet while you got your charm off again but I can't stand up to a  beating from most blues in Luclin now for more then a few rounds. How much worse of a beating is a PoP mob gonna hand me? <br>
<br>
I can't remember what the dire charm lvl limit is but I seem to remember postings on this board complaining that Chanters could DC a pet that would eat up our epics... If this is indeed true and our &quot;charmed&quot; elemental pets were on par or better then the DC pets it might be a good thing. I certainly imagine PoP mobs are gonna be tougher (weighted by lvl) then most of what we currently face. Perhaps this is one way they can fix the poor DPS we suffer on raid mobs without giving us wizzy nukeage/lures while maintaining a risk vs reward balance. <br>
<br>
If I can summon a pet with 20k hp's who quads for 200+ and doesn't cast any useless spells I'm the most powerful dude on the block. If however I have to charm the same pet and risk him quadding for 200+ on my butt. I'm still pretty damned tough but if anything goes wrong I'll see ...Loading Please Wait before I realize I was resisted This would also allow us a pet more powerful then the epic without trivializing all the work the epic wielders have done, or buffing the heck out of our epics and our post 60 pets. I don't want to be as overpowered as the druids are just balanced.<br>
<br>
I remember what mages were in Beta and Pre Kunark (The Golden Years). I remember the dark times of Kunark and Velius. I've almost wept for joy when I've seen patch messages that improved our pets or increased the drop rates of items we need. (Hate staff especially even though I still don't have one lol) <br>
<br>
Perhaps Verant figures our Focus items into the equation when they figure our nuking power? I don't wear any of them much any more but they do technically increase our DPS by reducing cast times/aggro and increasing damage and they are always available to us. the extra damage would for the most part put us over the max damage of the enchanters keeping us #3 for raw per nuke damage. Our DPS is still higher when nuking because our recast times are much shorter as well. Yeah we need a bigger nuke then they do. I agree with that and I'm sure most of us realize they need to nuke decently as well to be needed for these raid encounters. You only need one Tash after all. I don't think this Enchanter nuke is Lure based is it? So if we can't hit it neither can they I imagine.. &lt;/shrug&gt;<br>
<br>
My main fear is that T-rods won't be needed any more with shortened encounters. I HATE dropping rods as much as anyone. I'm a team player though and I like to see big crap die so I do it. The only reason I'm welcome on a lot of raids is my rod dropping abilities and I realize this. &lt;/Rant On&gt; I do however hate when I pull my face out of a wall and see a druid digging through my pile of rods so he can nuke the hell out of something with my mana. &lt;/Rant Off&gt; Wizzy's, Clerics, and Chanters.... Rod away. <br>

<br>
Further, while magicians complain about enchanter nukes encroaching on mage territory, wizards are complaining that mage nukes are now encroaching on wizard territory, using similar reasoning.<br>
<br>
Worse, I think all this arguing over nukes is essentially fighting over table scraps.  Nobody's nukes are likely to keep up with the new mobs, but we just know melee weapons will.  This has been the trend for some time.<br>
<br>
Upon reflection, I am not threatened by the enchanter nuke, especially after I churned out the actual numbers for alternating nukes.  Really, I am concerned about pets, which is the proper sphere of mages.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Goladus:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  I agree especially given that there are many situations where people do not want the group damage shield.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->My guild is full of rangers.<br>

I am less upset about the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Imbue</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> line knowing that enchanters have the spells, and they are just being added to other classes as well.<br>
<br>
All in all, I am willing to give <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a chance with this all.  However, feedback is important, and even emotional feedback can be telling, because after all, the point of the game is to have fun.<br>

<br>
Here's why I think the new nukes are fine for mages, at least for the moment:<br>
<br>
Mages have always had 3 main types of single target nukes.  Conjuration Shocks(magic), Evocation Shocks(fire), and Evocation Bolts(fire).<br>
<br>
The bolts have typically been the most powerful spells number-wise, but their utility is more limited than a normal nuke because they can be blocked by objects, the ground, a wall, or most frequently another player.  Bolts have also typically been Evocation-based, so for a mage to take full advantage of their relative power he must sacrifice some Conjuration ability.  As a partial compensation, bolts also have a nice long range.<br>
<br>
So.. I think bolts are balanced when they have a bit more power for their cost(level/mana/cast time/aggro/rarity/difficulty) than other mage nukes, so long as they are evocation based.  <br>
<br>
Firebolt of Tallon seems to fit this description exactly.  It is a fire based, evocation bolt with a good DPS and mana effeciency ratio.  It's the lowest level spell of the new nukes.<br>
<br>
I always thought of the Conjuration Shocks as the work horse nuke for mages.  They are solid and dependable magic-based nukes.   They aren't bolts, there are no recast times to fuss around with, and they are conjuration-based nukes.  These tend to have average or better than average ratio and dps relative to other mage spells.  Additionally, for a mage specialized in conjuration, the Conjuration Shocks are typically the most mana effecient spell of the tier.<br>
<br>
Black Steel seems to fit this description quite well.  It is a clear upgrade to Shock of Steel.  It has a large increase in mana effeciency, and a fair increase in dps.  Black Steel appears to be the clear choice for a Spec: Conjure magician who is interested in conserving mana while dealing good damage.<br>
<br>
To me, the Evocation Shocks are the fire-based alternative to the Conjure Shocks.  They had similar features but were Evocation based.  A mage not specialized in Conjure would probably find these preferable to the magic shocks for everyday use, and even a Conjure mage would utilize the fire-based nukes when resistances encouraged it.  Evoc shocks changed a little with Kunark.  The only real Evoc Fire Shock was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Char</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which featured a low cast time, med-low damage, and average mana effeciency.  It seems to me that the implentation of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Char</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was an attempt to distinguish the Evocation Fire Shocks from the Conjuration Shocks, and in my opinion it worked well.  I think Char is a great spell.<br>
<br>
I do not see an Evoc Shock with Planes of Power..  That seems like a hole to me, but I believe that is because of the new conjuration nuke with luclin, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This new spell was unlike anything mages had before, an conjuration based fire nuke.  Except for over a short period of time (when Char or Scars is superior), SoFB had the best dps and best mana effeciency of any nuke in the mage aresnal.  Basically, rare is the situation where a level 60 magician will want to use a nuke other than SoFB.  To me, this is somewhat unfortunate and takes away a little of the skill needed to play a magician well.<br>
<br>
There is no direct upgrade to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in Planes of Power.  Instead, they have planned <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sun Vortex</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which is a fire-based conjuration nuke but unlike SoFB is not superior in every way.  Even so, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sun Vortex</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a clear and significant upgrade to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Shock of Fiery Blades</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  That it doesn't appear to be the no-brainer best nuke at level 65 does not concern me much.  For a truely superior nuke, get the ancient spell.<br>
<br>
I think that the ratios on Firebolt, Black Steel, and Insanity could be toned down a tad to make wizards feel better, but otherwise our nukes look quite appropriate.  The only thing I find lacking is a real upgrade to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Char</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>

Can you stop doing that?  I would like the summoned mez spell, not a summoned root.  Above all I'd rather have neither and get more offense upgrades.  Mez and root make less sense for our class than Rod2 does. <p><img src="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dsf3/EQ/rhionsligo.jpg" align="center"><br>

A summoned only root spell has got to be about the most insane idea i've ever heard, especially as a reason for getting rid of a VERY USEFULL mez spell.<br>
<br>
This does not 'change our role' but puts us more in line with how we should be.  We have always been imo the kings of vs summoned casters.  Necros being the same of undead.  Throughout the entire game necros have had undead only charm, undead only nukes, undead only slows, mez spells etc.  While none of them were as good as a enchanters, it gave them some utility while fighting a specific set of creatures.  I always wondered why mages didn't get similar.<br>
<br>
I, for one, would LOVE the new mez/charm spells.  Mez would come in VERY handy as solo i could handle multiple pulls, or add even more versitility to a group while fighting summoned creatures.<br>
<br>
This spell is no where near good enough to replace a enchanter with mez duty... Our role is not being redefined, we're gaining versatility vs a certain type of creature.<br>
<br>
You realize that when a mob is mezzed it IS rooted... It also doesn't attack anyone.  It also has a memblur effect... It also lasts for a specific amount of time (in this case 5 ticks or 30 seconds).  Root has always been dubbed 'ghetto mez' and rightfully so... Root doesn't have many uses aside from saving your ass when you don't have a pet up.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I do agree, however, that we should get a upgraded anti-summoned nuke... But NOT in the place of these VERY USEFULL spells.  The charm spell will almost guarantee us the chance to charm a better pet in some circumstances than what we can summon.  We gain the risk of having it break every 20.5 minutes... Ok, just mez and re-charm.  <br>
<br>
I WANT these spells, and they will IMPROVE my class.  If you get them nerfed or removed, personally i'll be very angry =P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucyricusbloodbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 962<br> <font color=#333333>(9/23/02 4:36:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=17.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> Since Black Steel was made public it was always Conjuration based.

That is, I have heard many mages wish for root, and I think it would be fun.  I never thought of mages mezzing, nor have I ever heard any mage proposing that ability.  Given that, I thought it would be more <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>fun</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to play with a root, rather than a mezz.  I do understand that root is weaker than mezz.<br>
<br>
It is just one idea out of many, and it may not be a good idea.  But really, mezz?<br>
<br>
I still don't want to be like an enchanter.  I don't think many mages do.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dilandu:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  You realize that when a mob is mezzed it IS rooted<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Well duh.<br>

You <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>do</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> realize that a small but vocal minority of mages have been asking, inappropriately in my opinion, for root for ages, for example:<br>

I didn't make this up, and I don't agree that mages should have root.<br>
<br>
However, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> seems pretty insistant on giving us some form of elemental crowd control, and I put two and two together and got an idea.<br>
<br>
Seriously, how much would you pay in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Bazaar</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> tomorrow for an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Earring of Living Slime</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> if it were for sale?  And you can tell me that a lot mages do not want <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Root</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?<br>
<br>
All I did is try to forge a compromise between what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> sees for us, and what at least some of us see for ourselves.  It was not a sin, nor was it the stupidest idea in the world <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (way too much competition for that)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Dilandu:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  This does not 'change our role' but puts us more in line with how we should be.

Of course if we had had those abilities previously, we would have been in an uproar over the lack of summoned mobs.  Presumably, there is at least one or two new zones with lots of elemental mobs, and ideally more zones with at least some summoned mobs.<br>
