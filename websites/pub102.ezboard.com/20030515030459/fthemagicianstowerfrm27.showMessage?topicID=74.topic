Why is that so?<br>
<br>
I can think of a minor pet, fear and HT ... <br>
<br>
My idea is a fire pet (I'm 49th level) against the SK. And run away from him, as usual. Even if the pet might be slower than the SK it can still nuke him if I stay close enough to the pet. If it is feared I run into the general direction of the pet so it can attack the SK again when fear wears off ... and while he re-fears I can throw in a nuke. The rest is standard mage duel tactics, isn't it?<br>

There's a well played evencon SK I've fought for probably 3+ hours over 2 days in Burning Woods.  I was 53, not sure of his level.  Never could kill each other, though I dare say the danger level was a lot higher for me.  (He killed me once when I was 51, but only because I didn't realize his HT did over 60% of my hp bar.)<br>
<br>
Interesting SK abilities at high levels:<br>
<br>
1) Darkness on your pet.  He never did this, maybe it's not worth it, but they can do it.<br>
2) Fear on your pet.  The real problem here is if you dispell the fear, you'll probably dispell Expedience too, and that's going to handicap you.  I usually let the fear stay on the pet just so I can keep expedience.  Good news is fear is relatively expensive for an SK to keep casting.<br>
3) Strength drains.  They have a new one now, Luclin spell I think.  I haven't looked it up, but it's lifetap resist, -30 STR, fast cast time.  I was 60/63 encumberance, that spell would have gotten me killed if not for the giant beards I had on me with charges of +STR buffs.<br>
4) Lifetaps.  Can't remember the number off the top of my head, but he could lifetap me for about 260.  I imagine that's the level 49 tap.  Seemed like a relatively fast cast time, though I understand the recycle time on it is extensive.  Higher SK's get more lifetaps available, though.<br>
5) HT.  His HT, if I remember right, was about 650 damage without his discipline.  Basically if you lose 2 bubbles of health, RUN, FOO'!  Lifetap+HT will put you close enough to death by itself.  One good sword wack in there and it's curtains for you.<br>
6) Feign Death.  If you're fighting in a zone with agro mobs, it's trivial for him to run into them and FD so the mobs agro your pet.  Liberal use of Summon Companion can help stop this, but that means you fall behind on the chase.<br>
<br>
<br>
#5 is undoubtedly the worst, though.  You seriously can't let the bastard land a hit on you, because it won't take much to put you into HT range.  When I fought, I didn't try to channel anything.  I cast when he stopped chasing, if he came at me I didn't wait to finish casting, I ran for it.  It was just continual running with my air pet slowly beating on his back -- I used the air pet because with expedience it was able to keep up well enough with his SOW.<br>
<br>
I didn't have Scars of Sigil, though, that might have really changed things.  Char is too slow to cast on someone that's running at you with SOW -- you'll get hit, and getting hit is bad.<br>
<br>
<br>
So yeah, you have the right idea.  Run like mad.  At 49, though, you don't even have Char, so it'll take a miracle to get off a shock or bolt, especially if it's an ogre/troll SK that can slam.  Basically you just run until he runs out of mana and your pet beats him down.  Hope that he's dumb enough to get irritated and fight your pet.<br>
<br>
Versus that SK, by the time one of us had to run away I still usually had all or almost all of my mana, simply because I could never get a 4.5 second break to cast anything.<br>

60 vs 60 you will lose if he has even elementary pvp knowledge.  There's nothing you can really do about it other than hope his isp bogs down and lags him out so you can kite him.  Maybe you can chain click those shaman instaheal pots if you have the cash.  Primal axe/shovel of the harvest/etc caliber weapons will leave you in HTdisc deathtouch range after one decent double attack if he scrubs your buffs with a golem wand first.<br>
<br>
As a dark elf on vallon zek I had the good fortune to meet up with the uberguild equipped erudite sks and the pointlessness of it was an inspiration to mages everywhere.  <br>
<br>
It's not just sk vs caster either.  The other privileged pvp classes(ranger, rogue, monk) complain about how hard it is to deal with a high level sk in pvp.  The only class that seems to do well against them are paladins. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrumples.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grumples</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 265<br> <font color=#333333>(2/17/02 6:48:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=74.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hrm</span><hr size=1> Yeah, true -- if they scrub you with a golem wand, you're done.

<br>
High level SK's with the discipline can kill a caster in 1 HT, after a scrubbing with a golem wand.  Instant, unresistable, no other spells or sword whacks required.<br>
<br>
Probably the only way to beat an SK is to have so much HP gear that they waste their HT without killing you, and that you then have enough time to run around and regen with your phantom armor line.<br>
<br>
So the best policy for SK's is to just avoid them.  Even a trained monkey with a 60 SK should be able to defeat any veteran PvP caster.<br>
<br>
Once every 72 minutes, at least.<br>
