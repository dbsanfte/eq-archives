The popularity of a particular group style and hence, the popularity of classes that mesh well with that is largely a social issue.  Other classes, such as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mesh better with other group styles.

Look at the thread <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=3744.topic">Mages of TM Unite!</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  It shows that other group styles are possible, and can even be made popular.

<br>
More boring personal monk experience:<br>
<br>
I wander over to The Grey.  Already have all the decent drops there, at 60 I just want some AA points out of the shissar there.  I solo along, takes 10-40% life to kill any given mob depending on adds and dependability of Instil Doubt, etc.<br>
<br>
Mage wanders in, shouts LFG a few times.  I'm in antisocial soloing mode, I pay no attention to anyone LFG regardless of class.  Finally mage shouts &quot;LFG or port outta here&quot;.  Catches my attention, I call her over to the temple, and we go at it.<br>
<br>
So what's &quot;wrong&quot; with this situation?  According to you guys, the mage is 100% worthless here.  Pet doesn't tank, mage doesn't tank, rogue would outdamage, shaman would be safer, pet might train, only buff is a DS, mage can't heal, mages suck, rogues rock, life's a bitch, blah blah blah blah...<br>
<br>
Well neither of us gave a S#(*, she fired up a DS and a water pet and we killed mobs approximately twice as fast.  I never ran out of bandages, what's that worth?  Pretty much as a monk who is always at 24.8 stone while AC reduction point is 25 stone.  Rockfiend add? /shrug, dead in less than a minute and I doubt I outdamaged the mage, those have ridiculous AC.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my point...we had a good time, got a little XP out of it.  Could I have gotten more solo?  /shrug.  Would I have gotten more fearkiting with a bard?  /shrug.  Would I have gotten more if I was a rogue with two other rogues and a cleric and chanter and warrior and we had a mob vending machine that spat out 1k HP level 90 mobs that hit for 10 and had a very low AC?  Yeah, I admit, probably.  But then again, how often do you find those.<br>

Has very little to do with &quot;social science&quot; and everything to do with the class design of the mage. I honestly think the garbage about social science and 2 pages of analizing is kinda weak. I never hear anyone say bad things about magicians or pets taking experience.  People dont take magicians because in dungeon crawling you need a tank, cleric, enchanter/bard. That is 3 spots taken up in most dungeon groups so that really only leaves 3 spots and with all the rogue/monk twinks running around those class are a better alternative to the mage.  Well I guess the perception is that magicians dont really bring alot to the table and that is basically the case.  With rogues asassinating everything in sight with there epic candy and monks pulling and breaking difficult spawns, and rooms a magician brings only damage to the normal experience group and that just isnt enough anymore. 95% of the groups i am in never require mod rods or CoTH. Those are basically raid skills and fall short of helping the average experience group.<br>
<br>
I love my mage that is why I continue t play him. I have fun when I am playing him and normally i am always grouped never solo. Also there are alot of times that I am not in classic style groups and other types of groups work just fine some even better then the classic group. But at the end of the day that still doesnt change the fact that magicians dont offer what most othe classes offer.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unikatjef.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nikatjef</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(3/27/02 1:00:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/nikatjef/Everquest/Rogue.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Difficulty with grouping in 50+ or just cause I am a mag</span><hr size=1> Greetings,<br>
<br>
   Contrary to popular belief, Rogues, don't always have it easy getting groups.  In fact, until *I* learned how to get groups it was not uncommon for me to sit LFG for hours, just like some of you are claiming that only mages experience.<br>
<br>
   At the same time, perhaps it is where I camp, but I have never seen a mage LFG for more than 15 minutes or so. If I am group leader and I have an opening, I will take a mage over any other class in the game, unless I have a specific need.  In fact, one of the best groups I have ever had was my Rogue and two mages.<br>
<br>
   As has been stated, the grouping problems are mostly social sciences issues.  Yes, class balance does have an impact, but the real culprit is the social aspect.<br>
<br>
   Tell ya what, any mage on Xev is more than welcome to look me up (See my signature below for char names).  If you find me on and I am not AFK.  Send me a tell, I'll group with ya.<br>

Finding a group isn't always easy.. people do tend to be biased about mages until they learn about them.. And yes, if you get a good rep (have your pet offtank two adds in velks when your chanter goes LD, and let the recognition flow) then people aren't grouping with a stereotypical mage, they're grouping with the &quot;exception.&quot;<br>

Evidently mages problems are solely based upon coding, and as a class are a bug leftover from the beta days. That being the case, don't worry, they'll remove the &quot;mage class&quot; bug in a future patch.<br>

<br>
Raz I like your points, to be honest I feel you are 70% true. The 30% left are class specific problems.<br>
<br>
As a computer scientist, I am one of those guys that feel the mage problem in RL, being a bear in his lair. As you already experienced it as a scientist too (if I understood you well). I had to learn social science (or maybe social charisma buffs) for work. What I hate really in your points (mine too) is that working such skills means that I cannot be trully myself while in &quot;social mode&quot;. Working those skills means you want to &quot;look like&quot; and not simply &quot;be&quot;. For work, I have &quot;social buff on&quot; and it is all. For private life, I have &quot;true mode on&quot;, a small friends list but those are great and know my true nature which is by far more important to me than anything else. I think we both agree that social science is important in RL and EQ. My point of view is that this is crappy. I'd like to have your main feeling about it. Not big sentences just a good or crap.<br>
<br>
About the game and the &quot;find group&quot; problem. I'd like to point out to the original poster a question. How about your guild ? I think most high lvl don't make anymore pickup group but more guild group. I'd say try to build guild group, you'll have better time and experience. And since they will know you for long they will remember fun stories that you will make you able to smile about during long med break or raid prep sessions.<br>
My best time with group for the moment is Me and a druid, we duo a lot and when a guild teamate is lfg for long we take it so he has fun with us. Maybe an immediate solution for you. Find another soloer in your guild and try to work out strategies. I personnally hate to solo, if I have to I will log my alt monk and wait for a guild call (and my monk don't lvl fast).<br>
<br>
Does mage need upgrade ? YES PLEASE.<br>

<br>
I continue to stand by this thesis. The popularity of a particular group style and hence, the popularity of classes that mesh well with that is largely a social issue. Other classes, such as Magicians mesh better with other group styles. Stereotyped group styles are a social problem.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Raz, I was just pointing out that you later in your argument said that in certain situation some classes have an easier time getting into the most popular group type.  Both statements cannot be true since the primary grouping form in the game is though the &quot;classic group&quot;. So &quot;Grouping&quot; as defined by the majority of groups in the game has to include the &quot;Classic Group&quot;. All this to say your first statement &quot;Grouping is primarily a social problem&quot; cannot be true by your own admission if in some cases certain classes have an easier time getting into the most popular group type.<br>
<br>
Once again I'll clarify, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> the solution is social, not the problem.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

Usually the only people in a group who don't want a mage are literally some idiot druid or necros rogue or sk twink.<br>
<br>
If a rogue and  mage are equal level I suppose they will take the rogue, but any group who takes a low 50's melee over a high 50's mage aren't worth grouping with anyways because they're inherently incompetent.<br>
<br>
Low 50s mages definitely have grouping problems though, which isn't much of a social issue at all. Because I know plenty of clerics and enchanters who are @$$holes who are only marginal players at best who get groups in no time simply because of the nature of their classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalanzsonofanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 1085<br> <font color=#333333>(3/27/02 7:25:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Difficulty with grouping in 50+ or just cause I am a mag</span><hr size=1> Thank you for your thoughtful replies.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Raz I like your points, to be honest I feel you are 70% true.

Simple fact remains.  I cut my hair, shaved, put on this business suit, and all of sudden they pay me a LOT more money, and I have a nice house in downtown San Jose.

I will do my best.<br>
<br>
Objectively, as defined by game mechanics, a group consists of a leader and up to five other players whom the leader has invited and whom have agreed to join the group.<br>
<br>
A group style is set of roles and tactics for the members of a speficic group.  All group styles are social constructs.  That is, the roles and tactics are creations based on choice by the potential group participants.<br>
<br>
There are some constraints on successful experience groups, which I have described before.  A successful group must include adequate damage dealing, and adequate damage mitigation.  These minimal requirements comprise the only objective roles in the group.<br>
<br>
All specific group styles and the roles they contain are created solutions to the essential problem of killing things and not getting killed.  They are chosen by the participants.  This thread has already named several different group styles.  These include <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Classic, Area of Effect, Pet Centered,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Fear Kiting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Each style has it own set of roles, and different classes differ in the ability to fulfil the available roles in that group.  For example, pure melees are generally sub-par in pet centered groups as they tend to take aggro from the pets, defeating the main advantages of that style.  Likewise, melees are generally sub-par in area of effect groups.  From this should I conclude that melees are sub-par, and in need of dramatic improvements?<br>
<br>
Of course not.  I would never pretend that area of effect groups are the end-all and be-all of groups, and the central basis for judging the relative merit of the various classes.<br>
<br>
However, for some reason you claim it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;objective&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that the classic group style is the standard against which all classes should be judged <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (and so Magicians found wanting)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  How can this possibly be?  The only criteria you suggest is:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...as defined by the majority...the most popular...<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Can you <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>really</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> mean this?  Does popularity of an idea imply its objective truth?<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that the classic group style is quite adequate and performs well under a fairly broad range of circumstances.  But neither its adequacy nor its popularity elevate it to some objective icon of truth.  Popularity is at best suggestive, it is never conclusive by itself.<br>
<br>
Have you some criteria in mind?  Although you have not suggested anything other than popularity, here are some criteria we might judge groups by:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Experience gained per hour:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This is a common argument made in favor of the classic group style, and for certain camps it has few peers.  However, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Area of Effect Groups</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can easily outperform it, as can the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Six Mage Group</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Applicability:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Another advantage of classic group is that it works in many places.  However, due to the popularity of the group style the best camps for this style are well known and often occupied.  The vast majority of classic groups therefore instead make due with merely adequate camps, which do not live up to its potential.  While it is true that other group styles, such as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Area of Effect</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Fear Kiting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> may have more strict requirements for spawns, other styles, such as <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Pet centered</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, prosper where other groups do not.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Robustness:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How does the group cope with changes in composition.  The classic group, especially in optimal camp for that style, are brittle, and must break up or surrender the camp if a key member leaves.  If either the main tank, or the healer, or the crowd control leave, the good times come to an end.  In contrast, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Fear Kiting Groups</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has only two key roles, and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Pet Centered Groups</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are very flexible for replacing members. By this critera, the classic group is inferior.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Recruitment:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How easy is it to recruit members for the group.  By this measure, the classic group both benefits and is limited by its own popularity.  On the one hand, because the form is popular, many players have chosen character classes that are appropriate for that style, but on the other hand there is intense competition for recruiting key classes for the group.  There are many camps where if you cannot recruit an enchanter or bard, then there is no group.  Time spent recruiting the group is time not playing, and time waiting to be recruited is also time not played.  In contrast, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Pet Centered Groups</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> being more flexible in the allowed classes, many of which do not face heavy competions, are easier to recruit.<br>
<br>
There are perhaps other criteria one could propose for measuring group style effectiveness, but even in this short list, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Classic Group</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> does not necessarily stand out head and shoulders above other groups.<br>
<br>
In any case, one must <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>chose</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a set of criteria and weigh their relative values.<br>
<br>
Nothing <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>objective</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> about that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>choice</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.<br>
<br>
Popular != Objective Best<br>
<br>
If you mistake the shared opinions and choices of a large number of people for objective truth, then you are destined to driven blindly about like some herd animal.  I prefer to examine my assumptions, and the assumptions of those around me, to see more clearly what truth might be contained within.<br>

Woot, my insult got italics. At least you didn't start by trying to say I was someone I'm not, like you've done to a couple other posters rescently to silence them. So I will assume this is a good thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me try to simplify what I was trying to say.<br>
<br>
You said: <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is the point that most everyone disagreed with you on.<br>
<br>
I showed that your word &quot;Grouping&quot; must include &quot;Classic Groups&quot; since the majority of groups are &quot;Classic Groups&quot;. Yes I agree it includes other groups, but they are not as numerous, and therefore not as inherent in the word &quot;grouping&quot; as it relates to EQ. Thus definition is influenced by &quot;popular&quot; belief.<br>
<br>
You later said that some classes are better suited for the most popular (therefore most numerous) grouping style.<br>
<br>
My point being your statement cannot be true, if &quot;Classic Groups&quot; are better suited for some classes.<br>
<br>
If Classic groups are better suited for some classes then &quot;Grouping... has less to do with class than is generally supposed&quot;, cannot be true.<br>

I will do my best.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is not intended to be an insult, but an observation.  I am not really sure how to argue when you insist that the most <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>popular</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> group style is somehow objective.  No matter how I try to explain things, you seem unable to even consider that popularity of a group style might possibly be a social issue, or that choices made by a group of people are likewise social.  It is literally a blind spot, and it implies nothing negative about your character.<br>
<br>
All of us have blind spots.  We are all of us, only human.  My use of the term, if it expresses any emotion at all, says more about my frustration at being unable to find an explanation that makes sense to you.<br>
<br>
I have thanked you for your well thought out contributions in this thread more than once, I would hope that it would make it clear that while I strongly disagree with you, and beleive you are missing something important, I still respect you.<br>
<br>
It seems that we have reached a deadlock.  I think the limitation is a lack of shared language.  I think it fair to assume, without implying anything negative about you, that you are either not familiar with the terminology and methods of social science, or that perhaps you are prejudiced against them, and have dismissed them to be without content, and therefore not useful to you.  Therefore, when I make an argument that something is a social construct, or that choice brings social science into play, or that assumptions are not facts, it is basically so much meaningless noise to you.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I showed that your word &quot;Grouping&quot; must include &quot;Classic Groups&quot; since the majority of groups are &quot;Classic Groups&quot;.

On the contrary, I gave the literal definition of group, which does not include any mention of tank, healer, and so on.<br>
<br>
This is what caused me to say you have a blind spot:<br>
<br>
You argue that the most popular group form is objective, and refuse to acknowledge that popularity makes it inherently a social issue.<br>
<br>
If you do not understand that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> popularity =&gt; social issue</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then really I am at a loss as to what to say to you.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If Classic groups are better suited for some classes then &quot;Grouping... has less to do with class than is generally supposed&quot;, cannot be true.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What is generally supposed is that, barring friendship and personal reputation, class nearly strictly determines group desirability.  Many posters have claimed this exact thing, including yourself as I recall.  I claim that class does not objectively determine groupability for a number of reasons.<br>
<br>
First, group styles are choices, and take place in a social, not objective context.  You cannot prove, through logic, like a theorem in geometry, that the classic group is the necessary outcome of the rules of the game.<br>
<br>
Second, the existance of choice and other group styles means that there are other ways to measure the viability of a class other than comparing it to the most popular group style.<br>
<br>
The mere popularity of a particular group style does not mean that the definition of that style insinuate themselves into the definition of a group, as you claim.<br>
<br>
A group consists of one character, the inviter, and up to five other characters who have accepted an invitation to the group, and who have not left the group.<br>
<br>
An experience group is any group that gains experience for its members by successfully killing monsters.<br>
<br>
In order to kill a monster and gain experience, only two things are necessary.  First, the monster must be slain, and second, you must not die.<br>
<br>
That is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>it</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> for the short list of objective attributes of an experience group.  Everything else represents a choice, a response to the environment, and takes place in a social contxt.  No specific response, no matter how popular, is objectively implicit in the definition of experience group.<br>
<br>
In fact, here's a little exercise.  In order to demonstrate the subjectivity of your definitions, and their existance in a social context, I am going to start another thread.  In that thread, I am going to ask for the precise definition of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;classic group&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I predict that there will be minimal consensus on the definition, and there will be nearly as many variations as there are posters.  I further predict that you, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nandail</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, will disagree with several of the definitions.<br>
<br>
And let us start by asking you first, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nandail</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=4580.topic">what is the definition of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;classic&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> group?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I mean people pick classes based on what they need and what will be the most benefit.  Try doing King in sebillis with no bard or enchanter. They doing pit in Velks with no bard or chanter. Or better yet try doing both with no cleric or bard/enchanter. Classes are picked based on what they will provide of a given group. Most peope want enchanter/bard, cleric, tank in there group.  That takes away 3 spots in a group.  That leaves 3 damage dealer stops left. More times then not people will pick a monk or a rogue over a mage because those classes will out damage mage. Magicians cannot keep up there DPS for very long and regular pets against jugs and other higher lvl mobs just dont cut it. It is so obvious to everyone except you?

<br>
But the fact that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> may be sub-par in this camp, and even other camps like it, should not be generalized to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in groups in general.  Yet, in fact, this is exactly what people do.  Possibly because even if they do not have such a camp, they are hoping that they can get a group that can take that camp.  That does not mean either that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are sub-par for the camp they have, or that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in general are sub-par.  It does suggest that people have a tendency to over generalize.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> argue against points that are just so obvious<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I maintain that this is not nearly so obvious as you think.  That obvious, more often than not, means unexamined, unexplained, or assumed.<br>
<br>
Class value is situational, and what I am saying is that people have over-generalized.  That is, they have taken some perfectly valid observations about a perfectly valid group style that performs very well for some camps, and adequately well for many others, and made the mistake of concluding that the relative value of classes in that group style apply in general.  Worse, by seeking only variations of those camps which are appropriate for that style, it reinforces the impression.  Repeated often enough, the uncritical accept this as being objectively true.  Certainly it is easier that way, and implies that analysis is worthless and contradictory evidence can be dismissed as anomolies at best.<br>
<br>
Popularity of a particular view is not sufficient to demonstrate its truth or objective value.  A whole lot of people can be very, very wrong.<br>
<br>
I persist in the folly of trying to rebut this because it illustrates some very important points generally.  The central point here is that things which are obvious are often exactly what should be most critically examined.  An assumption that you do not even know you are making can be a crippling blind spot.<br>
<br>
I think you would be hard pressed to claim that I do not have adequate intelligence.  I demonstrate competence with language, arguments, and math, and analyze, create and refute complex logical arguments.<br>
<br>
Why not, even just as a thought experiment, consider the possibility that I might be correct, and that there is more here than meets the eye.  That that which is obvious is not obvious, but perhaps even false.  Just as an intellectual game, if you will.  At the very least, you will find the ability to see things as others see them an invaluable skill in motivating and convincing other people.<br>

I demonstrate competence with language, arguments, and math, and analyze, create and refute complex logical arguments.<br>
<br>
I see the above statement as nothing more then ego massaging. It basically implies that because you are educated and write well that you are somehow superior in your thinking to those that have not attended college or have experienced higher education.  Note that the FBI reports show that those that are most educated (college grads or higher) fall victim to cults and groups of that kind more often then people that have not been apart of &quot;higher learning&quot; so to speak.<br>
<br>
Alot of people in this thread do not agree with you and I happen to be one of them. Everyone is entitled to there own opinion and rightly so you are entitled to yours. To continue to analzye what everyone is saying and to put out the perception that because you have attended college and have a way with words that you somehow have the upper hand on thinking, and because they dont agree with you they are somehow not clearly looking at all the evidence is simply wrong and a bit snobbish.<br>
<br>
I have been playing EQ for almost 3 years now. I have a 58 bard, 58 druid, 56 magician and a 52 monk as well as some other classes lower then 50.  You have said more then once that you do not have any alt nor do you wish to play any. Well IMHO this makes your point of view short sided. If you played another class (enchanter/bard/cleric) then you would see that alot of magicians problems have nothing to do with perception and alot to do with reality.  A magicians will not get a group in a indoor group or out door group as quickly as a enchanter/cleric/bard/warrior/rogue/monk. People learn at a very low lvl that enchanters have breeze, clerics have rez and monks make the best pullers.  Rogues and monks even at the low lvls now due to twinking are seen as premier damage dealers. If a enchanter or mage is shouting for group even if the group doesnt really need crowd control they will take the enchanter.  Being able to slow, clarity, mezz, haste, and provide nuking is enough to win out over merely  damage dealing in most cases. It is the same at higher lvls when it comes to damage. A rogue will most always get picked over a magicians. It is because those classes are better at what they do and post 50 everything is about specialization and magicians are just not specialized.  <br>
<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why not, even just as a thought experiment, consider the possibility that I might be correct, and that there is more here than meets the eye. That that which is obvious is not obvious, but perhaps even false. Just as an intellectual game, if you will. At the very least, you will find the ability to see things as others see them an invaluable skill in motivating and convincing other people.<br>
<br>
I have a proposal for you. Why not as a experiment you try playing a enchanter/rogue/cleric for two weeks. Get them to about lvl 30 and then tell me if everyone that is against what you are saying is wrong? It is easy to say it is perception when you have not played another class. I think because you have not you lack perception and dept on this argument because by playing only one class you have blinders on.<br>

We don't have the information we need to find that out. Nor will we. Ever.<br>
<br>
We would need a comprehensive database of damage dealt per level, for every class. A list of all possible ways of controlling mobs. A list of all other useful abilities a class has to offer. Their dependancies on others, etc. It comes out to be an insane amount of variables. <br>
<br>
If we were to take the results of that study(which is somehow unbias), and then come churn out a ranking system for each class, then we could determine the answer to our question. <br>
<br>
In order to answer this we would have to prove that the magician is, in all circumstances less viable than any other class. Its an unprovable point. Balanz will win by default because we KNOW that social issues do indeed play a factor. <br>

Just for the reason mentioned being a problem. Magicians can keep up with the damage done by most melees. There are several logs on this board that shows this even. There are classes that does have problem with this thou. Both necromancers and wizards have this problem. Necromancers because their dots generaly dont have time to run their course in groups. Wizards for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
There are ofcourse the classes more wanted then mages, like clerics and enchanters. But aside from the obviously more group valuable classes so are mages in a decent position. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kryskin>Kryskin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 40<br> <font color=#333333>(3/28/02 11:46:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=59>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Hmmmmm</span><hr size=1> The &quot;holy trinity&quot; may well be an optimal solution for non-AE fighting, but the supposed &quot;non-optimal&quot; solutions including &quot;less desired&quot; classes (Hybrids, pet classes) are only marginally less efficient <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> if at all</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at good playing skill levels.  The lower the playing skill (and I mean everything right down to target selection, pulling speeds/splits) the bigger the gaps.  The eq-playerbase mindset is by enlarge trapped in the metastable holy-trinity solution .  If the aims are &quot;targetmonster XXX&quot; rather than simply Exp (where your real criterion is &quot;blue monster kills per unit time in high ZEM zone&quot;), then more constraints do come in.<br>
<br>
Now, it is unforunate but most &quot;EQ Lore&quot; such as this is derived from the opinions/abilities of the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;, where those &quot;gaps&quot;between the more fluid playstyles demanded by non-trinity groups and the rigid mez/assist setup are chasms, but if you want to play EQ with those people who can only follow formula, be my guest.<br>
<br>
The only class I know of that has really significant problems being useful is a wizard without at least a Velk robe,  as their entire killing ability is 100% linked to the prescence of mana regeneration in the group, plus they have no force-multiplicative powers, just addative/auxilary.  Can they still be useful?  Yes,  but they have a serious efficiency problem there unless you're designing pulls for pillaring etc...<br>

 I predict that there will be minimal consensus on the definition, and there will be nearly as many variations as there are posters. I further predict that you, Nandail, will disagree with several of the definitions.<br>
<br>
And let us start by asking you first, Nandail, what is the definition of the &quot;classic&quot; group?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see, but thus far there does appear to be consensus from most, but not all. I would also be most interested in the initial responses because those would give the view as it currently exists, and therefore the view of most EQ players.<br>
<br>
Off topic some. I will say that &quot;Classic Group&quot; was a term coined to simply show the group that is the most popular. If the world of Norrath were very different and there were enough content to support unlimited AE groups, that would be the classic group. The point of defining the most often created group, and showing that there are fewer spots available in that group for Mages than other classes (which you agreed with) it still shows that Class (role) does have an impact on getting into a group.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it will be interesting to see.<br>
