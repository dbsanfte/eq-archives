One of the raid leaders has flat out said, &quot;no pets&quot;.  This is a sore spot for me.  Its like asking a warrior to take off half his armor and throw away one of his weapons.  I havent been given any real good explanation for this attitude towards pets.  The only thing I hear from them is that just there presence attracts unwanted mobs.<br>
<br>
Is this true?<br>
Is the mages role in plain raids soley as a caster?<br>
What is different about a plain as opposed to other zones except that they are tougher and have better loot?<br>
<br>
Please advise,  Im almost 46 now and have till March to get ready for a couple of raids in hate and fear.  Id like to know how to approach a leader of a raid that is prone to keep pets out of the event.  If for some reason pets arent a good thing in these plain raids it would be good to know why so I can rest on the issue.  Thanks for any input you may have for me. <br>

Mage stuff drops in the north east corner as well as enchanter stuff.  but after the clerics are done and they cant get any more loot and they have been there a few hours they get tired and leave hate and the raid collapses with out cleric healing.<br>
<br>
in Fear some mobs will run and if your pet follows you will again get a train that will wipe out the whole raid. and there is not much in Fear for mages other than to say you have been there  and help out your friends.<br>
<br>
Sky is a neat place and pets are usually welcome there on most islands. the only pet  you can use in sky is an air pet and it looks different from any other pet you make but it acts the same as  your air pet always did.<br>
<br>
Also know that most mobs in Hate and i think Fear con even to a level 52. so if you are 46  your pet will do as much damage as a 46 warrior  ie  not much. and most of your spells will be resisted.  the higher you get the more damage your pet will do and the more your nukes will do.<br>
<br>
Have fun  it is a rite of passage to do your first Planar raids.<br>

but for sure, pets could be headache in any raid if the owner cannot control it well.  so make sure no not summon ur pet during break in hate / fear.  once clear camp spot, i never been told not to cast pet.<br>
<br>
remember, ALWAYS assist ur main tank.  make a shortcut key &quot;/assist &lt;main_tank_name&gt;&quot; so that u (and ur pet) always targetting the mob ur main tank fight.  especially in hate, SW corner got some bug path which pets will run away and then back to kill the mob which was actually in the camp.  and don't sent ur pet unless u see ur main tank already hit it few times.<br>
<br>
ALWAYS know what ur pet killing and don't allow it break ur chanter mez in any situation.  if it does, hit &quot;/pet back off&quot; continuous and wait ur chanter to mez it.  if ur pet is too naughty that still wanna /duel with the mob, kill it (/pet get lost).<br>
<br>
sometimes the mobs except the one tank killing might hit u or ur pet.  pet will go /duel with that mob once it finish killing current one (that 2nd on pet hate list).  if u not sure whether ur pet have aggro any other mobs rather than the one killing, try &quot;/pet back off&quot; fews time to clear it hate list.  ur pet should always assists main tank rather than all tanks assists ur pet.<br>
<br>
role for a mage in plane usually is KS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
depends on ur guild, if there are many shamans who can malisement/malosi mobs, then u just have get a clarity, sit and nuke.  if not, u will have to debuff mobs for enchanters and casters to land their spells.  and giving mana rod to clerics and enchanters who lom, summon dagger/arrows for puller (monk usually)/tank, damage sheild on tanks...... actually just do what u normally would do.<br>

(YAY Apothic Crown and Kilt btw.)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
For the first part of the night I was in a group with a rogue/bard/cleric/enchanter/myself.  What did I do with this group.  Not much at all.  I cast Boon of Immolation and Malise.  Occasionally I'd throw in a nuke or two to help grab a kill for my group, but I didn't nuke to often as I like to see the kills get spread around.  The reason I was casting Malise was that we had only two shamans and only one other mage.  One of the shamans and the other mage are both lower than myself and were getting resisted on almost every cast and the other shaman was busy with Turgors so it feel on myself.  Also during this time I supplied Arrows/Daggers/ModRods to anybody wanting them.<br>
<br>
As the night went on, we progessively had fewer and fewer people until after the Maestro we were down to around 19-20 people I think.  I was then moved into the main pull/tank group.  What did I do then?  Pretty much the exact same thing that I did earlier in the night to be honest.<br>
<br>
Now some people will think that this would be extremely boring and unrewarding.  Personally though I think even though I wasn't nuking that my part in the raid was one of the bigger reasons for its success.  Sure I'm not landing the 600-800dmg nukes in there, but I was landing the Malises that were allowing the other casters to hit those same nukes.  And those damage shields I was throwing out were doing the same or more that a single nuke could've done.<br>
<br>
The truly boring part of a Raid like this is in the more than likely case of a wipeout at some point.  This was my guilds second time in Hate and we actually improved and only had one wipeout.  When this happens if you didn't get camped out try to get yourself rezzed quickly since it will be you that will help the raid get back on it's feet again.  Get into a group with the clerics and bard and feed ModRods and you'll cut these recovery times in half.<br>
<br>
As for the pets not being allowed.  I still suffer from the fact that I can't have a little Goner out slapping the Revenants around.  But as was said earlier they are a MOB magnet in Hate.  Pathing is screwy and it is extremely easy to lose one.  I was allowed a pet for all of about 10 minutes and then told to put it away.  Why?  Because it truly scares many of the other raiders to see a pet that not only is low enough level to aggro like mad, but has pathing issues also.  This isn't to say though that you shouldn't have a pet spell up and ready though.  You never know when a quick pet might make the difference in a tough fight.  Just be ready to hear the order to &quot;LOSE IT NOW&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I get to try Fear out this upcoming month and I'm really looking forward to it since pets are generally allowed and I have never been there to boot.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Just in case you read the advice from Siudd.  I hope that you don't like being on to many raids as you will be promptly be told to leave and not come back in all my experiences.  On any planes raid you follow the rules of the raid leader or you don't return with that plane leader. <p><a href=mailto:Zaknafinis@Hotmail.com>Zaknafinis Convoquer (Elementalist of the 54th Level *woOHoo*)</a><BR><a href=mailto:Zaknafinis@Hotmail.com>Lyrin Jytus(Bard of the 21st Level)<a><BR>Proud member of  Shining Alliance on the Prexus Server</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzaknafinis.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zaknafinis</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10> at: 1/29/01 2:26:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Dumonyu</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(1/29/01 8:54:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Raids</span><hr size=1> Obviously Siudd hasn't been on many raids if he thinks he can use a pet in any situation. I know for sure on Tunare you'd be raiding Crushbone with that kind of attitude. Hate=no pets until Maesto and Inny for starters period. Many other raids have places where pathing is so bad pets come down for a bit 'til you pass the rough spots. Good pet control is one thing, and we all practice it as best we can, but putting an entire raid in danger is another. It's simply a matter of the risks outweighing the gains. Sometimes you have to put the safety of the whole above your need to have more fun stuff to do. <br>
<br>
Sure it's boring as hell to play a Mage without a pet, like everyone else I hate it. Just malise, DS, and nuke as best you can and try to accomplish what you set out to do. The most important thing is to listen to the raid leader as it's his job to call the shots. Talking to the raid leader about pets after before or after the raid is a good idea, but not during as he will have a lot to deal with as it is. If you flat out can't stand the way things are handled, consider raiding with someone else next time around. <br>
<br>
Remember, it's all about fun. Just try not to have it at the possible expense of others. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uextra411.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Extra411</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#333333>(1/29/01 10:01:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/extra411/magician6.jpg height=195 width=170></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   About pets on raids</span><hr size=1> Ok...<br>
Let me be the first person to say I agree with Siudd.<br>
IMHO - it's the way you want to play your mage. <br>
If you are a casual player who wants to play EQ every once in a while and join whatever you can, then it doesn't make a difference at all if you make pets or not.<br>
<br>
But if you have the time to devote to your class, want to play your mage YOUR way and you have the ability to do it, then by all means don't let people talk you out of it. And this is written for the latter.<br>
<br>
From my experience - most high lvl Dungeons/planes ARE pet friendly in most areas. In some areas such as hate, bringing the pet with you when the camp moves is dangerous - so don't do it. However when the camp settles down and the raid party will be stationary for a while - you can certainly use pets. Pet pathing is not so horribly bad that it is impossible. Is the risk there? Certainly. Not more than anything else (I've had bad pullers kill the camp 2 to 3 times a day). Let me suggest that before you try to use a pet in a certain situation - <br>
first be familiar with the area. There are certain parts of certain zones that DOES make pets impossible, and surely stay away from using pets at those areas (therefore, it is recommended that ou begin your raids without pets...until you see other people start to use them in certain areas, etc...or ask around). Secondly, always have Earthern boots ready so you can kill pet IMMEDIATELY if needed. And third - always assist MA, and make sure your pet ONLY aggros on that mob (which means if another mob hit your pet, make sure to have /pet back off to clear aggro before sending it in after the main assist again)<br>
<br>
Now with that being said, the rest is up to you. Once you believe you have acquire the necessary skills to properly control and use a pet on a raid, then let the raid leaders know. Unless they give a good reason (or you REALLY want to join this raid) about why pets are NOT allowed AT ALL (I would settle if the raid leader told me to use them LATER as opposed to not at all when I KNOW it is feasible), use one. Personally, I will NOT join the best guild in the server if their first rule was &quot;NO PETS AT ALL ALLOWED ON RAIDS&quot;. Screw that. I would (and I do mean it) rather either start a raid myself, OR make my own guild where the rule is that if you know how to control your pet, then make one. It is rather simple - as long as you don't mess up, it is all good. EVERY ONE should be given that chance. Just because some idiotic Mage let his pet ran around like crazy and kill the camp therefore no future pets are allowed, then I *would* leave. There are plenty of stupid tanks who do not assist the MA and runs off to attack some other mobs who the enchanters are trying to mez and eventually end up killing the camp. My point is every one makes mistakes - and everyone should be given a chance before they make one. If I DO let my pet get loose and kill the entire camp then it is of my own incompetence, and I myself would leave the raid. And if the raid leader will not allow me to join his raids with a pet again, or his raids at all, then it would be a legitimate reason. And here is another thing - by showing proper use of pets not only are you defining your own character, but of your skills as well. <br>
<br>
I have used pets in Hate before, at both NEC and SWC (has nothing to do with either Maestro OR inny). Used pet in Seb, Skyshrine, the Hole, CoM, Kael, etc...basically any place I went.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind...I'm not saying everyone shoudl do this. I'm saying people who have lots of time on their hands and really devote to their class should do this. It's rather simple...if you don't liek the rules, make your own. It's a game, rules can be changed...players change. They come and go. Nothing is &quot;this is the way it is&quot;, as long as you show it otherwise. Creativity is what draws different players apart...and the boldness to do it. The first people who tried to use mass PBAoE must be some very courageous people - and well, they discovered something very powerful and very feasible, yet not commonly used because the general public of EQ are too worried about their characters &quot;dying&quot; (or in other words wusses). Start standing up for what you believe is right - and trust me with the amount of time you put in, you CAN change how everything works.<br>

i have been on hate consecutively for 2 weeks everynite last month, simply becoz our guild enchanter need a last item drop from Revenant for her FA.  not to mention those b4, and dont want to count how many times i have been planes but obviously im did (and still doing) joined many plane / non-plane raids and know what im doing most of the time.<br>
<br>
yes i agree cashmason and Dumonyu PoH pathing really terrible for pets, guess no one will argue on that, especially ur pet class. indeed, if u know how the pathing are bugged (SW corner for example), then we should be able to control ur pet well enough if u want to.  i totally disagree with &quot;Hate=no pet until boss type mob&quot; that kinds of statement (honestly, no flame)  this seems implies &quot;Hate is not mage and necro friendly&quot; is so why verant make mage armor drop in Hate?  they just want the wizard port u there and loot the uber items but disable ur abilities there somehow??  surely not. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
surely u have to listen and try to coordinate with ur raid leader, i am doing, too.  but they don't know well what we mage can do.  what i had said on my first message is &quot;if the raid leader tell u not to summon ur partner in ANY (yes ANY=ALL) situation, i suggest you refuse to join the raid&quot;.  that's what im saying.  and being a mage, u should know what situation is pet safe and when it shouldn't.  do some research on that plane BEFORE u going any plane raid.  method to breakin, mobs behaviour, spawn times and location, their pathing, roamers, etc. (oops, should included what they will drop that u can use <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  whenever u feel insecure or have a question, ask the raid leader or ur fellow mage what u should or shouldn't do.  being a good raid leader should know when pets are allowed and generally they will &quot;/shout pet up&quot;.<br>
<br>
if, ur raid leader told u &quot;i dont want to see ur pet appear in hate, ok?&quot;, i suspect they got a really bad experience on pet class before.  try to explain to them what situation u can call ur friend up, and ask if they can give u a chance show them ur pet is not as naughty as they might thinking or experienced.  if they say &quot;ok, lets see and u pet up later on&quot;, make extreme care on ur pet behaviour when it with u.  that's important becoz its you times to build up OUR MAGE REPUTATION to other non-pet class.  if u success and let them at least feel easy when u pet up, man well done!!  if u fail, ok sorry u should throw all ur remaining skills point on &quot;pet controlling skills&quot; until it max before joining plane raid later, since u become burden of ur raid leader.  i guess i will fall asleep if i'd been ordered not too touch my main shortcut keys for more than 4 hours.<br>
<br>
i chose to play mage simply becoz it have a pet (tho the look not really cool and already feel bored for 55th season).  and i can't stand if someone not knowing what we can do but just say we're not trust worthy. <p><font color="#580400" face="Vardana, Arial" size="3"><b>siudd oldest</b><br></font><font color="#800808" face="arial" size="2">fennin ro col bloody gnome conjurer</font></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usiudd.showPublicProfile?language=EN>siudd</A> at: 1/29/01 5:33:22 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kryskin>Kryskin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(1/29/01 11:45:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Deary me</span><hr size=1> Its not PETS chasing runners that cause trains,  its the damn RUNNERS in the first place.

I'll agree with the others.<br>
<br>
A raid leader into the planes that says &quot;absolutely no pets&quot; just isn't a good leader.  If they were good/experienced they'd no when pets should be up and when they should be down.<br>
<br>
Not allowing pets is just bringing down the efficiency of the entire raiding party and showing the inexperience of the leaders.  <br>
<br>
There's no place in Hate that I've seen that had bad enough pathing that pets shouldn't be allowed.  They should always be taken down for moving to different locations unless its just a short hop, but most of the standard places to set up camp are pet friendly.  <br>
<br>
There are a couple of spots next to the walls where you have to be more pet concious.   There is one spot near the port-in that pets are sometimes disallowed.  You set up next to one of the 'bad' walls and a pet following a MoB up on a MoB could be trouble.   <br>
<br>
You could still have a pet out though.  You don't have to just target and hit pet attack.  Tapping pet attack then back off will have your pet attack for one round.  This is a controlled burst.  You just tap back and forth and anytime a MoB moves (and they tend to jump around a lot in the Planes) keep your pet backed off, move to where it went, and continue.  Never follow up walls or move past the edge of the camp spot.  <br>
<br>
I think its easier for raid leaders to call for no pets in some of these spots, but there really isn't a spot in Hate that I've seen that was so bad a pet can't be out and controlled.   Now, the side courtyard by the castle in the Hole has some bad pathing (unless its been fixed), but Hate isn't really that bad.<br>
<br>
Pets following MoBs that are running doesn't cause trains. The MoB is going to cause a train if not stopped regardless. Its the pet's path back to base camp that might cause trouble. Anytime a MoB takes off outside of the edge of where the group is camping you should back the pet off. Its just safer that way.  <br>
<br>
But, honestly, pets are usually more of a scape goat then anything else.  As many times as a pet caused a train there are just as many (if not more) that a player caused a train that got blamed on a pet.  <br>
<br>
Fear and Air I don't know so well so can't comment as much upon.   But, from what I understand, the same rules apply. Usually a pet is safe, you usually take them down for moving base camp, and there might be a spot or two where they aren't as safe, but for the most part they are. <br>
<br>
Most of all, you should do what your raid leader says.  That's what makes successful raids successful. But you need to go on raids where you have confidence in the leader's ability, and it doesn't sound like that one has either (1) much experience or (2) much ability.  If he's a member of your guild you might suggest he go on some raids with other more estabilished guilds to gain more experience.   (Or that might just piss him off, some people are insecure and all that).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, thats all the copper I have on me. <p> <br>

Especially in NWC.  SWC is better, and I have never had a pathing problem there.  Just don't summon while still on wall.  Once on the floor, by all means summon a pet.<br>
<br>
Tips to good pet control....<br>
<br>
1)  In Hate us /pet sit down instead of /pet guard here.  That way, after the fight, the pet will not try to find its way back to you and get lost in pathing.  If pet is in a bad spot after fight, then /pet follow me, reposition, and /pet sit again.<br>
<br>
2)  Be aware of AoE spells casted by mobs.  Here is what happens...  You /assist and send pet to mob1.  Mob2 does an AoE before chanter mezzes it.  Mob1 dies, pet jumps on mob2 and breaks mez.  Lesson.... be aware of your pets aggro.  If you see a mob do AoE, then /pet back off, /assist, /pet attack.<br>
<br>
3) In a raid, or any situation where someone is mezzing, toggle your pet's taunt off with /pet taunt.  That will help the pet to NOT attract mobs when several are in camp, thus making like easier for the enchanter as pet won't get &quot;stuck&quot; on mobs.  If pet does gets stuck on a mob, /pet get lost immediately.  If is far better for you to have to resummon a pet, than for your pet to continuously break mez and earn your pet a bad reputation (which affects all Mages).<br>
<br>
I've been in hate before, and after only ONE TIME of a pet getting stuck and continuously breaking mez (which caused the chanters death) the leader called &quot;no pets&quot;.  One mage with bad pet control can screw all the pet classes there.  Your pet may do more damage than the tanks, may even save everyone's ass a time or two.....one time in hate me and another mage chain casted pets and saved a lot of peoples behinds.  Those stuns from air pets that interrupted that CH may have saved lives, but no one will praise the pets for such actions. BUT, it will only take one bad action to get him and other pets banished.<br>
<br>
Although some raid leaders will sometimes use &quot;bad pathing&quot; as the excuse for not allowing pets, I know that a lot of times it is not bad pathing, but more the fear that pets will break mez.<br>
<br>
Good luck in your adventures fellow Magi!<br>

<br>
Keep and eye on your pet at all times. Use the /pet guard here command and back it off anytime it does something unexpected. Do that and you shouldn't have promblems at all.<br>

Another VERY handy item to have is the earthen boots or any other instant invis item. Very easy to kill your pet off when its to far to reclaim and you can't find it.<br>

Hate isn't a good zone for pets but if you stay alert and play it safe you won't have problems. The more familer you get with pathing and pet behaivor the easier it gets. <p>Zurrin Zypher <BR>

<br>
The main problem with pets in a place like Hate is not the pathing, but the one time a pet agros on the wrong MOB, the ENC dies, and the whole house comes crumbling down. Now if I had the only pet on the raid, I would imagine this could be avoided 99.9% of the time. I've had 56 Lvls to master pet control and I can't imagine it being done much better. That being said I'm not sure I want every pet class on the raid to have a pet and put my entire guild at this level of risk for a less than appreciable gain, not in a place where the MOBs are SO deadly, and where one mistake can cost so many so much time.<br>
<br>
You can yak about &quot;Mages need to have pets...&quot; and so forth, but the fact is very few people go on a planar raid to have fun. They are BORING. People go for loot or quest drops, or to help others get them, and if your guild/group can't handle the MOBs without pets, you probably shouldn't be there.<br>
<br>
I've been on more planar raids then I can count, some very smooth, some where I watched people lose multiple (read this again...MULTIPLE) levels. If your style of play includes this level of unnecesary risk for others, by all means go for it.

The reason for this is somebody got burned my a mage that lost his pet.. doesnt matter if is pathing, etc.. if a pet breaks a mez... or pulls a train.. weather after a runner or not.. the View will almost ALWAYS be &quot;The magician/pet did it&quot;<br>
<br>
To keep this from happening if I am asked not to summon a pet I wont until I KNOW that the group will work well with a pet.. and accept it AND the danger.. even a good pet handler has things go wrong.. <br>
<br>
Most of the people I group with WANT me to summmon a pet.. even those who were first &quot;No Pet&quot; people.. I have had to tell some of THEM no.. <br>
Example.. going thru MM, we went in the back door and I wouldnt summon a pet in the stairs cause before I had noticed that some of the paths are too close to walls and will agro things in other rooms.. I had to REFUSE the pet.. <br>
<br>
So dont worry about being asked not to summon a pet.. once you learn the area.. then ASK to give it a go... most people will let you once you show that you are not being arogant.. <br>
<br>
for those who said &quot;no Pet, No mage&quot;.. then /wave see ya.. if you have that attitude I agree you wont be on many hunts once people hear that..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uextra411.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Extra411</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 79<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/01 7:02:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/extra411/magician6.jpg height=195 width=170></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: What is role of Mages in plain raids?</span><hr size=1> Ok, a few more additions...<br>
1) Asked for no pets at all is ignorant. Last farm party I went to in Hate refused any pets because &quot;A shaman's pet got loose and killed the camp&quot;. Umm, ok. That makes a lot of sense...having Shamans summon a lvl 30 pet that doesn't do jack squat and then ordering no pets at all. Personally IMO, that shaman should be kicked out of the raid for ALL puposes.<br>
2) Unnecessary risks? For whom? Like you said if you control your pet well there IS no unnecessary risk. Everything in the planes is a risk. Other classes are just as risk causing as our pets, if not worse (afterall we can kill pets immediately if anything starts to go wrong). What we need to do is change the reputation of pets (and it is improving on my server, might I add), instead of not using them at all because they'll be taking the blames for it. I see it pretty simple - either help to improve the situation and improve the pet reputation, or things won't change at all and pets will always be taking the shaft. People tend to generalize and that's where they are wrong - in EQ it's ALL about the player, and NOT the class.<br>
3) And lastly I think this is a misunderstanding - It's not a &quot;no pet, no mage&quot; type of situation...think of it as more of a rebellion versus the ignorant raid leaders and all the other pet blaming losers out there. It's ridiculous some of the crap I've heard about how pets are messed up on raids when it's obvious that some of the players have done it - and this gotta change.<br>

some more about train camp, i see tons of examples which making a raid fails.  pets train ofcoz one of the most common i have seen, this i can't disagree.  but people not assisting at all becoz they get boring and blaming on puller not doing well, nukers ping-pong nuke or nuke too early making tanks can't taunt it off, agruing on loot assignment during room spawn (that's true, i have seen once), player running back camp site even he knew he aggro many behind, not listening order and pull train (we've tried Overking in Chardok while puller get 9 and want to split, but a ranger go &quot;take a look&quot; and aggro all), no one doing snare / stun and runners bring alot of friends back or got summon.  what im trying to say is, for a succussful raid, everyone should know how to play his/her own class, not that really specific to pet issue.<br>
<br>
&quot;no pet no mage&quot;...... i do really feel that true when i running accross newbie zone and got killed by greenish. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   don't wanna agrue on that much, but just think if someone asked u to kill ur pet (no matter on raid or not) without giving reasons, but u actually tried tons of time killing there with Kober.  will u kill it then? <p><font color="#580400" face="Vardana, Arial" size="3"><b>siudd oldest</b><br></font><font color="#800808" face="arial" size="2">fennin ro <a href="http://pub7.ezboard.com/bcoreoflegends"><font color="#800808"><b>CoL</b></font></a>  bloody gnome conjurer</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> AbMagFab</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(2/2/01 7:09:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Well, 2 sides</span><hr size=1> <br>
I am a seasoned mage, and rarely have problems with pets, even in bad pathing situations.  Even so, Mages often get bashed the first time there is a problem caused by a pet (oddly, chanters are allowed to make tons of mistakes, as are tanks, etc.).<br>
<br>
That being said, raid leaders who don't fully understand a class and then limit what that class can do, usually do so out of ignorance, and I sure don't want to follow them into any situation.<br>
<br>
Mages also get a great raid pet, Rage of Zomm, that costs 200 mana, quads in the upper 70s, is huge, and is target based.  So pathing issues are gone.  If a raid leader won't let you use this pet, they are truly ignorant.  Zero risk, since if it's feared, or you call it off, or whatever, it will die.  It also has almost no HP so it will die after it gets hit a few times should it end up aggroing.  Only useful on raids and fear-kiting.<br>
<br>
But, if you agree to go on a raid, you have to follow what the raid leader says.  I suggest you find out the pet rules, try to talk about the raid pet (if you have the spell), and then decide to go or not.  I have made the mistake of going on a raid, assuming that I was going to be trusted, and then being told by the cleric leader what I could do with my pets.  So after clearing it with the appropriate people I left.  I will always check ahead of time now.<br>
<br>
I also wouldn't go if you get the &quot;fine, you can use a pet, but if it screws up ONCE, you can't use it anymore&quot;.  Huh?  Do we do the same for chanters?  &quot;Hey chanter, if you screw up mez ONCE you can't mez anymore.&quot;  Bah.  People make mistakes, but ruling with an iron fist out of ignorance is exactly that - ignorant.<br>

But when moving, running to a area &quot;further&quot; in or whatever he has the chance of aggroing, bad pathing, bad control etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
  ..never been to planes..just observations from other upper lvl close quaters raiding. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umonrmon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MonrMon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/01 12:07:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well, 2 sides</span><hr size=1> Since my guilds first plain raid is comming up, and the leader of the raid is a bit nervous about it, I will be backing off a bit on asking to be allowed to summon up a pet. However as we learn the plains first hand then we can make some better judgements on the, when too and when not too have a pet up.  From what Ive been reading,  Its 50 50 for and against.  Which leads me to believe that its going to have to be taken one raid at a time.  Ive read some good arguments pro and against.  Seems each one has a different experience in the plains which is good.  I like to get as many perspectives on it as possible.  <br>
<br>
So in summry,<br>
<br>
1. Work &quot;with&quot; the leader of the raids.<br>
2. Never insist on a pet.<br>
3. Prove in time that you are a sesoned mage with good pet control.<br>
4. Be one mage that turnes the tide of the bad attitude towards pets with excellence in service.<br>
5. NO POUTING.  lol<br>
6. For those learning the plains,  take your time.  Be rdy to kill that pet if it gets out of control.<br>
<br>
One other Question.  How did you all do on the first raid in Hate or Fear?  With all the neg. stuff about pets werent you a bit afraid to summon one up?  When did you feel comfortable getting Gober?<br>
<br>
One thing I have learned recently is never send pet until mezz has taken effect.  Pets do switch targets.<br>
<br>
Any who.  thanks for your input on this matter.<br>
<br>
<br>

Monrovia,  47th mage,
