<br>
Hi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     My last post was to help others to try and understand the history of the Magician class, so as to not judge us as some mana battery with no offensive capabilities<br>
<br>
This post has a lot more numbers to it and will try to cover the nuking comparisons between Wizards, Mages, Druids, Enchanters, and Clerics as they were before Kunark, during kunark, during velious, luclin and the PoP spells as they are now.  Some remain skeptical about our nuking powers diminishing while others just want some numbers, I'm gonna provide those the best I can <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Granted this isn't going to be all-inclusive and most likely I'll miss a few things but it's my best shot at determining damage output and honestly Im writing this before I even see the numbers so they'll be new to me as well <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Now, a few things to take into consideration when viewing these numbers is that I tested DPS with no focus items or AA and then again with those two added.  Also, I further divided the tests into 5 minute fights, and then a 20 minute fight to try and simulate some Velious and all Luclin encounters.   Old world and Kunark are not included in the 20 minute fights as there were none.  The Planes of Power numbers are not going to be completely accurate as I had to make some educated guesses on mana pool.  The following is the adjustments and constants in the tests<br>
<br>
Old World Era<br>
Constants: The mana pool of players were limited to a max of 2000, to include gear and Int.  Then I added in mana gained through Bard songs and Clarity and added that total to the max mana of the player. No one had flowing thought as it was not in the game.  <br>
Adjustments: Wizards gained 250 additional mana from Harvest but lost 10 seconds due to the stun.  <br>
Total base mana in 5 minute test: 2650<br>
<br>
Kunark Era<br>
Constants: The mana of players were raised to 3000 to simulate the increase of 10 levels and slightly better caster gear.  The upgraded spells of Clarity 2 and Bard songs were added as well<br>
Adjustments: Wizards gained 326 additional mana from Harvest, but were stunned for 10 seconds<br>
Total base mana in 5 minute test:  4200<br>
<br>
Velious Era<br>
Constants: Mana pool of players is raised to 3700 to account for the much improved gear in Velious.  Gift of Brillance and Protection of the Glades were added to mana regen of all players ontop of Clarity 2 and Bard songs.  All characters were also given flowing thought 2.  <br>
Adjustments: Wizards gained 326 additional mana from Harvest and an extra 3mana/tick from their Epic.  <br>
Total base mana in 5 minute test: 5450<br>
Total base mana in 20 minute test: 10,650<br>
<br>
Luclin Era<br>
Constants: Mana pool is raised to 4200 for all players.  Kodiac’s Endless Intellect, Protection of the Glades and Bard song are considered to be on every player.  All players are also considered to have Flowing Thought 8 and be carry a single Rod of Mystical Transvergence.  For the modified tests all players have Spell Casting Mastery 3 and Spell Casting Fury 3.  <br>
Adjustments: Wizards gain 326 mana from harvest and 150 mana from Greater Familiar.  Also they have an additional 7mana/tick regen from Greater Familiar and their epic.  They are also given Spell Casting Fury Mastery 3.  Enchanters are given the Gather Mind ability but they only gain half the normal mana assuming you fight a mob every hour and the skill has a reuse time of over 2, Magicians are considered to have Elemental Form: Water 3, Druids have Quick Damage 3 as well.  <br>
Total base mana in 5 minute test: 7426<br>
Total base mana in 20 minute test: 13,310<br>
<br>
Planes of Power Era (Estimated)<br>
Constants: Mana pool is raised to 4600.  All players have the improved mana regen spells from both Bards, Enchanters and Druids.  Flowing Thought is raised to 13 and each player has a Rod of Mystical Transvergence.  Players have the same skills as before and same adjustments.<br>
Adjustments.  As before, but wizards now gained 450 mana from the new harvest spell.  <br>
Total base mana in 5 minute test: 8160<br>
Total base mana in 20 minute test: 17,360<br>
<br>
Total Mana for Each Class in 5 minute Test<br>

<br>
To figure out the number of nukes that a class could do I just divided their total mana by the spell cost.  Then I took the amount of time it took to cast that number of nukes and subtracted it from the total time in seconds (300 for 5 mins, 1200 for 20 mins).  After I figured out the remaining seconds I divided that by 6 to see the amount of ticks, then multiplied the number of ticks by the amount of mana you gain through meditation (20 in pre kunark, 24 after that).  The mana gained from medding was then divided by the nuke cost again to see how many extra nukes the class could of done with the extra mana.  To get the DPS (damage per second) for the class I just multiplied the total number of nukes by the damage of the nuke and then divided it by the total time in seconds.  What I did would look something like this.  Sorry Im not a math major J complete opposite<br>
<br>
Total Mana/Nuke Cost = # of nukes<br>
# of nukes * (castingtime+2.5) = # of seconds it takes to cast # of nukes<br>
Test Time - # of seconds = Amount of seconds left over<br>
Amount of seconds left over / 6 = # of ticks<br>
# of ticks * Meditation Rate = Bonus Mana gained during fight<br>
Bonus mana gained / Nuke cost = # of bonus nukes<br>
# of bonus nukes + # of nukes = Total # of nukes for the class<br>
Total # of nukes * Nuke damage / Test time = DPS<br>
<br>
If the total casting time exceeded the Test Time then I just subtracted an equal amount of nukes so that it would go below the Test Time.  AA and Focus effects tests were basically identical except the numbers were modified and I added in crits after I figured out the Total # of nukes (14% for wizards, 7% for everyone else).  Also the mana cost for Chanters and Clerics were based on 50 Evoc Specialization as I have never met one with 200.<br>

I’m really tired of math <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     so I’ll let you guys figure out what all this means J I just did the number crunching and I don’t really wanna speculate on how the classes should nuke.  However notice that specialization on druids and then on Enchanters.  If enchanters specialized in Evocation they could do higher DPS than Wizards? Hm strange really, I suspect Insanity will be changed to be more in line with the cleric Condemnation spell. I hope these numbers help, Ive been working on this for 2 days so I’ve probably forgotten to mention something if anyone has questions.<br>

<br>
First.  5 minute test is probably the worst idea you can do.  The first 5 minutes is when the classes will not show their true power, but their imediate advantages.  I.E. wizards should shine here because they have the best ratio on nukes here.  But, in the long haul, a wizard will go oom if they try to compete with a class with better mana regeneration.  <br>
<br>
2nd.  I have no idea what all those mana pool numbers mean.  Why does the wizard have more mana?  Is it because of harvest?  If so, you might want to add mod rod for mages.  If so, then with a cleric/sham, a mage's mana pool in a stretch of time will be dependent on the healer, but nonetheless will dominate any other class.<br>
<br>
Then, for mages, you might like add up pet dps to the numbers, which will help mages excel here.  <br>
<br>
What situations do you want to run these tests for?<br>
<br>
Soloing? grouping? High-end class comparisions? low-end class comparisons?  <br>
<br>
Depending on what you choose, you very likely might get different results.  I.E. a high-end mage soloing will give you quite pleasing dps numbers compared to a mage with 1k hps, no epic, soloing. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucyricusbloodbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 969<br> <font color=#333333>(9/23/02 8:04:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Analysis of Nuke damage from Wiz/Dru/Mag/Clr/Enc - Long</span><hr size=1> This is a nuke comparison, NOT pet comparison. <br>

<br>
And I did add in mod rods, this isnt all inclusive just a general idea of DPS based on a very constant set of circumstances<br>
<br>
Yeah Im sure mage DPS could be higher if you had 2 dedicated healers on you, but wizard DPS couuld be higher if they had a mage and healer on them as well shrug..<br>
<br>
There is more than a 5 minute test, and I know it's silly hence why I did the 20 minute test <p><a href="http://www.bladesofwrath.com">

Personally I would rather mod feed an epiced wizard, due to their massive dps potential, and great mana ratio.  Mages can nuke, but why not let the kings of nuke feel the power of infinite mana :-D.  They come crawling back to me EVERY time after they get that sample of power *laugh*<br>
<br>
I don't see what will come from a 5 minute/20 minute test of only dps from nukes.  It will not really hold any value for a mage in the experiment.  First, a mage in a raid will have access to heals.  This warps the mana pool, and potential for the mage.  Also, 5 minutes is going to yield warped results due to the fact that the initial mana pool is full(most likely scenario I assume you are going to start from). and that means that you can chain nukes nonstop till you eventually go oom.  In reality mana-regeneration determines how quickly a class will dump their mana in long duration fights, exp groups, etc.<br>

This test used a constant set of rules, thats why it didn't take into account heals, etc for rodding.  It simply shows that *ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL* what a damage caster will do over a set period of time.  It is an excellent baseline study to compare abilities.  You can add in variables afterwards to modify this, but you need a baseline to begin with.<br>
<br>
Heals for rodding can boost ALL of the aboves' DPS, so its a moot point in a non variable study.<br>
<br>
Note: For the most part Manaburn *lowers* wiz DPS in a long manadraining fight.  It is an awesome skill, but in fights where a Wiz can land spells and has time to generate regular DPS (ie a fight that is longer then 20 seconds), he will likely do better without MB.<br>

It is alot better then anything I could have done so I am not going to knock it hehe. At least someone is putting forth numbers instead of crying. I really think that our new nukes really need to be raised to druid standards. They are getting all new dots and nukes. It just isn't fair that our nuke are laging behind compared to other non-nuking classes. If we except it being ok for enchanters to out nuke us then the next expansion clerics will clearly out nuke us. Soon we will be saying how it isn't far that rangers get a better nuke then mages. /shrug<br>

<br>
The below test is done using Basic Comparisons...The numbers are Averages taken from some board magelos/Myself.<br>
<br>
Both the enchanter and the magician have 3100 mana.<br>
Both the enchanter and the Magician Have C3 Active on them.<br>
Spec/Mod rods were not counted in the comparison as chanters can also specilize in evoc and use mod rods. <br>
<br>
I gave the mages c3 because simply the 5 minute encounter below is a raid comparison and both the mage and the enc should be buffed. I did not however give them Both PoTG because it would have simply inflated the numbers. Both have a standing mana regen of 15 mana per tick.<br>
<br>
This test is done only using standing mana regen...I am doing another one now using med times however due to work I dont have the time to finish it out (it will be much longer). I have a feeling however in the med time ones it will be almost even but the mage might have an edge.<br>
<br>
The below fight is using a 5 minute fight....Many luclin fights run 30 minutes while mana kunark fights run 1 minute...So I chose an &quot;in between&quot; number...Here is the blow by blow.<br>
<br>
Both can cast 11 times before going oom. The mage will take aprox 99 seconds to cast his mana bar while the chanter will take 154 seconds.....OR 17 ticks for the mage/ 26 ticks for the enchanter. During this time the mage will have regened 255 mana the enc will have regened 390.<br>
<br>
1:39 seconds into the fight mage deals 11,000 Dmg 255 mana<br>
2:32 seconds into the fight enc deals 12100 dmg 390 mana<br>
+3 ticks later (18 seconds)<br>
1:57 seconds into the fight Mage 12,000 damage 25 Mana<br>
2:50 seconds into the fight 13,200 damage 160 Mana<br>
+7 ticks later (42 seconds.)<br>
2:39 seconds into the fight mage 12000 damage 130 mana.<br>
3:32 seconds into the fight enc 13200 dmg 265 mana.<br>
+2 ticks later (12 seconds)<br>
2:51 seconds into the fight mage 12000 damage 160 mana<br>
3:44 seconds into the fight enc 14300 damage 20 mana<br>
+9 ticks later (54 seconds)<br>
3:45 seconds into the fight. Mage 13000 Damage 20 mana<br>
4:39 seconds into the fight enc 14300 Damage 155 Mana<br>
<br>
Ech tick + I went through I calculated in cast time+recast time and gave them mana regen for both...I also used the cast time+recast time to write in the next tick shown. After the last point shown neither class will regen enough mana for another nuke. The finale results are.<br>
<br>
Mage DPS Using the pure magic nuke. 43.3 DPS. 13000 dmg.<br>
Enc DPS Using the pure magic nuke. 47.7 DPS 14300 dmg.<br>
<br>
Pretty close...I think when I finally get to do the med times the numbers will be diffrent.<br>
<br>
I posted this on the spells section but I thought it might be intresting to get some thoughts under this thread as well...This comparison is only between the magic based nukes of the chanter/Mag...I will be doing another one that involves spec/med. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uuman2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uman2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(9/23/02 10:09:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> good stuff, Ylaine</span><hr size=1> can you do Shaman nukes as well in this same format, please? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usuzannadreamingheart.showPublicProfile?language=EN>SuzannaDreamingheart</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#333333>(9/24/02 1:52:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> ...</span><hr size=1> The Magi figures would have been of some interest to me if you had included spells I actually memorize (and, incidently, spells with better average DPMs under many circumstances than those listed).

<br>
As for the comment about all classes having access to rods.  I disagree.  This just isn't realistic on most raids that I know of.  I do not make rods for druids, or enchanters(nuking), or any other class that wants to waste their time doing that.  Wizards who are epicced can use rods, and it makes sense for them to, because they don't waste mana healing themselves.  <br>
<br>
Until Druids actually get an efficient heal, they would just be wasting my mana on rods, since they would have to spend most of the mana they get from me just to heal themselves with their &quot;less than stellar&quot; healing:mana ratios, compared to clerics or shamans.  And for enchanters... lol that would be even a bigger waste of mana, since the clerics would have to heal me (for rodding) and them for rodding.  Just too many &quot;middle-men&quot; to be efficient.<br>

Lol, assumption?  Thats a fact.  Sorry, but that was sort of funny.  <br>
<br>
1.  Wizard uses a rod.  drain, drain, drain . . . wizard loses a few hitpoints on his epic. <br>
<br>
2.  Enchanter uses a rod.  drain drain drain... 900 hit points are gone<br>
<br>
If you don't notice the horribly skewed difference here, then I really don't know what to say.  Its obvious which class is being less than efficient.<br>
<br>
P.S. Why would a mage feed an enchanter, when he could just save the cleric the trouble, and use the mods himself to nuke?  Its not efficient to have a cleric healing 2 different ppl just because a class that shouldn't use a rod to nuke, wants to.

<br>
Umm, I am not sure which hypothetical heal and situation you are using.  But druids can not heal as efficiently as a shaman/cleric(more so clerics, who are the core of the mod users).  A semi-competent cleric does not cast some heal on a 900 dmg mod hit.  Rather, they mod down to 40% or so and use complete heal.  High-end raid clerics are above 4k hps easy.  so 60% of 4000 hit points healed for 400 mana(and alot less including specs etc).  2400 hps/400 mana will beat out any druid heal.  <br>
<br>
In terms of efficiency, and leaving sentimentality aside, it is not a good idea for a druid to eat mods to nuke.  Wizards have far superior nukes, and would gain the full 660 mana on their dmg absorbing epics.  Druids will not be so fortunate, and will not even have better ratios on their nukes.  There just isn't a reason to do this.<br>
<br>
If PoP comes out, and druids get a CH spell, then I definately could see them getting as many rods as they want to help with healing, but that is not the current case.<br>
<br>
