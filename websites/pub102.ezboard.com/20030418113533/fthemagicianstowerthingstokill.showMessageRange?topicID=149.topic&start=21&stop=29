1. mobs hit Gober, and hatelist of Gober included those mobs<br>
2. u being hit, since Gober always aim protect master on first place, those mob included also in Gober list<br>
solution:<br>
backoff Gober (for clearing hatelist), re-assist tank, and send Gober to kill again<br>
<br>
sending Gober after all mobs mez except the one tank killing lower the chance of Gober breaking mez after current mob died.  hope this help<br>

Sure enchanters etc makes more mistakes but here's the thing - the raid can't go on without them. The raid sure can go on without a pet. That's just how it works...the &quot;essential&quot; ones are allowed to make more mistakes because, well, they are essential (I was surprised that the raid party still decided to use the monk puller in hate even after he trained and killed the entire camps twice. No other monks availible kinda gives you the &quot;either him or no raid&quot; at all situation). So basically to us - the lesser mistakes the better - perferrably zero.<br>

Bout the only place i'd say never use pets is chardok royalty palace and sirens grotto(stuff in grotto can AE when aggro'd, and hit your pet even without LoS, but hit nothing else, this is BAD BAD BAD, seeing your pet take off, hehe) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=faulk>Faulk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/01 4:09:11 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   pet pathing</span><hr size=1> Regarding pets chasing a running mob and &quot;aggroing a train on their way back&quot;. Last time I checked, pets and mobs used the same pathing in EVERY ZONE THAT EXISTS. If the mob got from A to B without aggroing other mobs, then it followed a set of nodes from A to B layed out on the map, and your pet followed these same nodes from A to B, and will follow them back from B to A without any course change. It's only logical, and I've seen it thousands of times.<br>
<br>
This is no different in Hate than any of the 150 or so other zones in the game. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uommundanrii.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ommundan Rii</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://home.cfl.rr.com/exarch/x.bmp BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master of The Hunt</span><br>  Posts: 145<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/01 4:28:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=149.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.cfl.rr.com/exarch/SUMMON.BMP WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   A few observations...</span><hr size=1> A few points I'd like to add:<br>
<br>
  I've mentioned this before, but thought I'd add it here. I think alot of the problems stem from so many of us soloing so much many people have not had too many experiences with mages. This leaves them to go on things they've heard to augment their few experiences.<br>
<br>
  Bad things ALWAYS stick in peoples minds more than positive ones. How many times have you told friends about good customer service in a store or restaurant? Now how many times have you passed on horror stories about terrible customer service? A really good supervisor once told me it takes AT LEAST three &quot;atta boys&quot; to make up for one &quot;oops&quot;. Sorry, but it's not like we mages get oh so many chances to show off our pet control. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
  As crowded as most servers are (with raid schedules for who can go on what days) if one guild or raid leaders rules annoy you, find another. Or like others mentioned: Organize your own raid or guild. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
  As opinionated as this thread is, everyone has stayed remarkably civil. I'm glad for that since when I first saw the subject I was thinking: &quot;here come the flames&quot;. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

If you want a real headache of pathing, try siren's ghetto, my god that place sucks, I killed 24 people today with my pet there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, to the point, it depends which plane you go to and your lvl. For the most part, I find damage shields not worth the mana on raids with more the 18 people. Especially with a shaman to slow, it just doesnt do the dmg a nuke would to keep them up on some many people. I suggest working with shaman and enc with malosini and dispell. This is where mages who use their class to the fullest pull ahead, you can really do a lot of utility. Once you get 55, you can aid the puller with call. Hell, last time I went to hate a 60 shaman pulled with me using call to split the pulls, was helluva fun.<br>
<br>
As for pets, in PoG, PoF, PoA, PoH, i have never had a major problem with pets pathing and making trains. If you find it a reak problem, keep earthen boots hotkeyed till you learn the area better. Today in siren's grotto, I made a poor choice and popped out uber marshmellow to fight in a very small area against very hard mobs. Well, as luck would have it, as the monk feigned some outside in another area, the radius hit my pet through the wall and out he ran before I could stop him. Basically, if you really dont know the area, dont use a pet or betetr yet, ask someone who does know the area about pet snags. In most cases, a pet is fine even to learn the area, in a zone like hate with the 50+ lvl cap, you should be pretty safe from most mistakes with an enc or 2 up there.<br>
<br>
to summarize : pet usually good, use your judgement, nukes can always help, debuffs can be a big help if you are lacking enc/shaman, and dmg shield is really only mediocre in large raids unless about to fight a large, unslowable mob (like venril, maestro, trakanon... the list goes on) but usually not worth keeping up. CoH is also a big help when working with a puller, not so much in the old plains if you have a monk or rogue, but moreso if you are doing PoG ect.<br>
<br>
GL, most important part of any raid in eq is to have fun, dont get caught up with every technicality or you'll burn youself out on them.<br>

<br>
3 things are true of mages<br>
1. Pets can always be used, only ignorance says they can not, maybe my guild is just blessed with great mages, but the only time we ban pets is on initial break (when things are too bloody crazy anyways) and when moving.<br>
2. A previous poster pointed out that most of the problems with pets is actually caused by other people not doing their jobs, the pet is just the visible example of this. This is entirely true. Sometimes you just have to educate those you raid with about the mages options.<br>
3. Avoid letting someone who has been clicking melee and chasing mobs for 50 levels tell you how to play your class. Take the time when NOT on a plane run and discuss this with them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Single largest tips for PoG: Water Pets seem to be best option and your biggest danger is that so many mobs cast AE spells, and you end up getting to far away from pet to back it off very easily.  <p>Kailere Drowsbane of Veeshan -Paladin of 55 summers<BR>
