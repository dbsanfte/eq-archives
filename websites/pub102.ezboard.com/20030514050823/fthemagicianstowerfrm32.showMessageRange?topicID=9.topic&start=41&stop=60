<br>
This is an attitude you seem to share with Verant.  It's a bad attitude and it's a big part of the problem.  A lot of people <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> have</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> quit their mages because they got tired of waiting for fixes.  Some of us are a lot more tenacious and unwilling to spend time on another class that may simply also get nerfed.<br>
<br>
Mages have gone from damage dealing powerhouses to utility mana-batteries.  Why should I switch to a wizard, spend all that time getting him to 60 when they may be next on the list for nerf batting?  I'll leave <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> that</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> kind of move to the suckers of the world.<br>
<br>
Don't forget that once upon a time, mages could hand their pets low delay weapons and the pets would use the delay but retain their normal damage-per-swing.  THOSE were the good old days.  Warriors using their uber Ykeshas (&quot;Y-whats?&quot;) or, rarely, uber-uber-Bloodfire, couldn't hope to compete.<br>
<br>
These days, our pets do less damage and you can't <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> give</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Ykeshas away.  Twinks already have better stuff off of lower level Kunark mobs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> (shaman/enchanter/druid/bard/necro/shadowknight all DEBUFF better then we do overall). <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
lol, yeah, those SK debuffs!  Whoa!  We can't do raids without them around.<br>
<br>
I agree with your underlying principle, that mages are far weaker than they should be, but let's try to stay loosely in reality.<br>
<br>
IMO, the one big change Verant needs to do is a universal upgrade of our pets, starting at level 4 and ending with the magician epic pet.  Every single one needs to have it's damage re-evaluated compared to same level melee characters with appropriate level equipment.<br>
<br>
It was balanced 3 years ago, but a lot has changed since then, and it needs to be rebalanced across ALL levels.<br>

<br>
You don't always have to waste your mana on a big fight on mod rods...nuke away...enjoy yourself...its fun.  Summon the mod rods before the fight.  Make sure the entire raid party has one in their inventory, and drops them before the fight.  With mod rod 2 and a 40 man raid...that is 27,000 more mana added to the fight by the mage/s.  How is that not useful?  Not to mention you get to use your mana during the fight for much needed damage, unlike the necro who has to sit there and feed directly in the fight.  <br>
<br>
Mod rod 2 is a godsend spell for mages.  My guild generally find mod rods just as pressing or even moreso at times as having all the melees buffed and ready.  After every tough fight we win...there is generally a resounding &quot;OMG, I LOVE MAGES&quot; from all the clerics, because they wouldn't have been able to keep the CH circle going without that boatload of mod rods on the ground.  And don't say just add another cleric instead of a mage.  5 clerics + 1 mage that has dropped 27,000 mana on the ground &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 clerics BY FAR!!  We are an excellent support class...GOD people, when will you see that?<br>

<br>
Yes, we can sit around summoning mod rods before every fight provided our guild leader is a dope and only pulls a mob once every 20 minutes.  That will give us plenty of time to summon them, med up, nuke during the fight, med more, summon more, med more and be ready for the next mob, 20 minutes later.<br>
<br>
No thanks.<br>
<br>
And in some cases, of course, you can't nuke because the mob is immune to all but Lures and/or you cannot use your pet because it creates more danger than it's worth.<br>
<br>
In a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> normal</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> raid, mobs are being pulled as fast as the guild(s) can handle them.  The mana batteries are residing in a near permanent state of OOM because there's always someone who can use more.  If there's not, you're not pulling as fast as you could.<br>
<br>
Is it useful?  Sure.<br>
Is it powerful?  Sure.<br>
Is it fun?  No.<br>

<br>
3 years ago it was NOT balanced.. We was on tbe top of the pile and thats what happens when ppl see how stronge a class can be they start bitching. VI starts looking at the problem. Do you remember how much it SUCKED to be a warrior. Well they got their fix and now they can deal the damage, remember rogues that sucked too.. They got their fix.. So basically your looking at others and wishing, not a good thing you will always find fault with your own class..<br>
<br>
You know the mages that quit because they didnt like the class.. I say GREAT!! I want ppl in the mage class that understands our power be it damage or support or even both. To the ppl that say ppl dont want me in groups.. Well we all have bad grouping days..  But 90 percent of the time I can get a group, because ppl know what I can add a group. But if not, I have my solo spot and I go there.. And you know what there are only 2 classes that can handle these mobs.. Shammies and Mages thanks Mala line.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I know I can kill things other ppl cant, I have done it and I know alot of these ppl that bitch here WANT TO BE THE MOST POWERFULL.. Well hate to tell ya not going to happen anytime soon.. They saw how ppl ABUSED pets and we will never have pets as strong as they use to be in the old world. Think about it. A pet that can kill a gaint in SoV would just wipe anything in the old world.. Not going to happen. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I understand the after kunark was released we started to lose power. Well hello VI told us they are catering to GROUPS not solo play.. They said that there will be solo spots but they will be tuff fights.. Want to know the first class to get 60 on TM. hahah it was a mage.. Yep your all correct, we suck!!!!<br>
<br>
What sad is ppl dont want to learn to change. Well if you dont change you dont grow!!! Yes it would be nice to have stronger pets but I just dont see it happening in the near future... Only thing I saw that may work is the bane swords that would be a GREAT summon item in my eyes..<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
and also your order is off in the debuffing.. Let the chanter lower the ressists and slow and see what happens... Either a DED chanter or a healer wasting mana on healing.. Our mala line IS LOW AGRO. Tash is not and tash only does magic too..<br>
So I still stand by that we are 2nd best on debuffing(lowering ressists)<br>
<br>
Also yes mage put out damage FAST but we was not king of damage I still say a necro was the strongest caster back in the day.. Yes it took longer but in the end they had more mana and they had less down time..<br>
<br>
Bottom line here is you can wallow in your distaste in a class that NO ONE is making you play. Or learn to change with the flow...<br>

Like POH..ok yeah mod rods might be more burdesome than not there.  But I know on raids we don't keep pulls of Lendi the Keeper, Dain, Velk, Telk, various TOV dragons, etc... coming over and over.  I wish we could...the loot would own.  I think your definition of raid and mine are VASTLY different.  When we raid, we have an end goal/mob in mind.  I was talking about mobs like that where you DO spend 15-30 minutes of pre-fight time buffing and preparing.  If that makes my raids crappy..then so be it...but I'd rather spend 20 minutes buffing up and preparing for a mob with 400k HP than just pulling him/her fast and getting pwnt.<br>
<br>
In a &quot;raid&quot; situation where you do want to keep mobs coming, IE Kael, TOV (regular), TOV (HoT)....you can keep those mobs coming much faster and much more furious with a couple mages there keeping a stockpile of rods on the ground, and dealing damage when needed.  Once again in this instance..3-4 clerics and a couple of mod rod 2'ing mages &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 4-5 clerics all by their lonesome.  Not to mention Druids who spend half their mana with every cast of PoTG, and various other buffers able to not hold up the raid to med because of our nifty little rods.<br>
<br>
Maybe our raids are crappier...maybe my guild leader is a dope...because they understand, and hold in HIGH value, the utility of a well played magician who is there to help the raid succeed instead of bitching that they don't put the hurt on mobs like they used to.<br>
<br>
I don't blame VI for ignoring mages....we raise an outcry about not being useful on raids because we can't use our pets..so they give us spells like COH, Mala line, upgraded Mod Rods, summoned items with pretty damn good resists, lowered resistances on high lvl mobs so our nukes will land, but even with all that...we still bitch and bitch.  /shrug  I agree with the above poster who said you need to learn your new role and embrace it, or just stop (per the subject)..cause it is useful.  Roles change...it happens...you need to learn to grow into them.<br>
<br>
note: Get me started on COH abilities in Luclin, and you'll see a Jekyl/Hyde turnaround.<br>

Obviously there is a big difference between raids he's talking about and one's you are.<br>
<br>
Let's break it down ... there are raids like Hate, Fear, PoG, Kael and HoT where you want clear MOBs as fast as possible.  Mod Rods aren't always needed and can sometimes be a hassle.  There isn't too much use for them unless maybe on a CR if you don't happen to have Clerics there with a Mr. Limpy(tm) stick.<br>
<br>
Then there are raids where a single MOB takes 10 minutes to kill and requires a 5 to 6 Cleric CH chain.  Mod Rod 2 is a godsend and adds a HUGE amount of value to Mages being there.<br>
<br>
And Tomlyn said it right ... Mages get KEI from a Chanter ... Mages summon MR2s and hand them to EVERYONE on the raid.  Mage meds back to full (doesn't take long now with KEI and AoE Mana song) while raid is still buffing/preping/pulling.  Right before the MOB arrives everyone who doesn't need a rod drops it on the ground.  Mage nukes to his hearts content to help kill UberMOB_001 while Clerics/Wizzys/Whomever picks up the rods if they need them.<br>

Fact 1 We do not rate with any of the other damage dealing classes in the game.<br>

Fact 3 We are no longer in the top half of the soloing classes.<br>

Though, I suppose it could've been 30 seconds with a Necro and Summon corpse. /shrug. Either way, I saved time and hassle and cash (my 5pp pearl, time, a necro's 160/80pp coffin). Once I was breathing again, I was actually pleased. Learned something, too. (Always have your puller targeted on pulls) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Of course, praying they live doesn't hurt either.<br>
<br>
I've also saved time in other ways. Rushing Trak for the bard epic, I got to let latecommers arrive, get down to claim our spot, and bring everyone down for a successfull fight. I lasted 5 seconds, myself. I tried to Malosi Trak from afar. He disapproved. Needless to say, though, with us still winning, it was a good day. ToV? Let's see, ensure that the main tanks are lit up with a nice damage shield, provide resist gear, occasionally mod rods, sometimes CoH in new people, and nuke nuke nuke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Even got a few killing blows to my name there now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Was I as effective as a wizard? Well, I suppose not, but how simplistically can one judge the usefullness of a Magician? Certainly not on DPS. How would you calculate that anyways? Damage taken by DS'd tank, damage resisted/not taken due to resist gear/DS bonuses, damage from nukes, damage/time from CoHing people in. Heck, I even salvaged one ToV raid that went badly. We got wiped, as did I, but the remainder of my group succored to zone. We get rezzed in, but we get attacked, and people start dying again. Clerics in the fight are lom, we're struggling to kill these things (adds and all), but lo and behold, I have a cleric in my group. 2 now, actually, full of life and mana. CoH them down, and whee, salvation has arrived <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, of course, all this is purely circumstancial. I could not've saved any day if my group druid didn't have his Evac stick (which he saved us the first time with, too). My role would've been (and has been) diminished before because of other magicians along for the ride, but hey, if I don't have to do all the work to get people around, more power to me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  More fun for all.<br>
<br>
It is also kind of sucky that my place has gone form raw damage dealer (groups) to supplimental support, but that's not always the case. Rage of Zomm has come in usefull against big bad nasty lifetapping SK mobs. Heck, often even do considerable damage before they get whacked due to VI's aggro code (why aggro something doing 250 damage a round when there's a PC in range.. not.. quite doing that much at all, and getting owned fast in the process?). My pets still serve usefull places in fights (Velk anyone?), so long as they don't AoE too much, or I can quickly select the pet that will take the least damage from that AoE. There is some tweaking that should be done, but Magicians are still quite versitile. Damage dealing when needed AND usefull utilities? Kinda beats a necro out, don't it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>

<br>
I could say the same thing about you.  Substitute &quot;content&quot; with &quot;unhappy&quot;. I believe I have addressed the utility of mages in full...but I'll recap<br>
<br>
1.) COH - By far, the most useful spell we are given.  Some raids I'm on would take hours of just getting the raid to the fight spot...not to mention not being able to add others to the crew after everything is already set up.<br>
<br>
2.) Mod Rods - I won't go in to this again...read above posts<br>
<br>
3.) Debuffing - A lvl 60 mage is just as effective as a lvl 60 shaman in magic debuffing a mob with mala/malosini combo as opposed to malo/malosini combo (Note I say &quot;magic debuffing&quot;.  A shaman blows everyone away with their melee debuffing with slow spells and cripple.)<br>
<br>
4.) I have yet to start a big fight where the Main Tank does not ask one of the mages for a DS.  On mobs with fire AE, I generally get /tells from multiple groups asking for a DS, and with /targetg, I happily oblige<br>
<br>
5.) Don't fool yourself into believing we are not valued for our summons.  I am constantly getting tells throughout a raid for various summons...unlike most mages...I love this.  Half the reason I made a mage was to be able to conjure up little knick knacks...if just for a role-play issue.  It's very cool to know that I can offer something with that ability.<br>
<br>
That's five things.  Fool yourself into believing that any one utility class (Enchanter/Shaman/Druid etc.) have more to do than 5-6 different things in any one raid, and I can see where you would get upset.  Many make the arguement that these things are not vital to a raid, and I'd make the same arguement about any of the other utility classes for certain raids.  Utility is about making a raid go smoothly...which is JUST as important as getting the raid going at all.  IMHO, I'd rather just not raid if its not going to be a smooth one.  Now if you're not happy with these roles, than I can't argue with you, but its YOU who must face up to the fact that we do, in fact, have utility.  I enjoy my role, I do it well, I let people know about what I can do..no..I FORCE people to know what I can do..and they love me for it.  I am never told I'm not needed by any one of them...in fact, its really quite the opposite..when I log on, they want me where they are, cause they know I will be bringing the value of a well played utility mage to the table.  I ask you...what do YOU bring to a raid besides sulking and bitching?<br>
<br>
Now on to your fact two...hey you're right.  We no longer deal damage like we used to.  We can't KS an entire raid anymore (ok..I have recently with sirocco, but that was situational <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), but we do deal damage when we so desire.  Case in point...I was in a TOV farming session in a group with a cleric/paladin/druid/and shaman I believe (might have been a warrior instead of druid..I don't remember).  Well...we were far from the KS group.  Monk pulls an ice wurm, and I make a snyde comment in group about getting exp on this one.  I cast sirocco 4 times I believe.  It hits for full almost every wave and I end up doing probably around 6k damage to the thing in a relatively short amount of time.  Our group got the exp <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Another example of how we can use our damage....I was attending a Lendi the Keeper raid.  She got to around 40 life...I looked around and there were still some mod rods down from the initial drop because the fight was going textbook well, so I decide to step out and nuke instead of mod rodding.   Oh did I mention that I hit her with malosini at the start of the fight? (but that has to do with utility <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )  Well I step out and hit her with about 12 - 57 shocks. None of them were fully resisted, and I venture to say I did about 7k-8k damage to her.  Its not great, but its damage...and its damage that we're able to dish out after we've performed all of our utility tasks.  We're not wanted for our damage..that is true..we're wanted for our utility (at least I am), but we can add damage when we wish.<br>
<br>
You complain about soloing as your third fact.  I ask you to back up your arguement that we no longer rank in the top half.  With a full bar of mana I kill (give or take) 7-8 mobs depending on the particular mob it is.  Then I sit down and regen my mana nicely with a brand new self only mana regen buff we were given with Luclin.  I med for 6-8 minutes to full, and spend the next 20 minutes to half an hour killing those 8 mobs again.  That's not alot of downtime respectively.  I can easily say I spend more time on my feet fighting than I do medding these days when I'm solo.  That is a direct contridiction to how it was when I was supposedly in the top half of soloists.  You tell me I'm not a good soloists anymore...that's news to me....I think I do fine.  In fact, for the first time in a good long time, I'm getting better exp solo than in some groups.<br>
<br>
Blah...I've spent far too long arguing this.  But I've made my point.  I've backed up my claims.  I enjoy my roles.  You don't.  That's what it boils down to.  You can write me off saying I've done nothing and that I'm still just giving 'fluff', but that'd be pretty lame of you....but I guess you're used to being lame because you play such a lame class, right?<br>

Your joking right?? <br>

I will call you on your FLUF.. Prove these fact please.. I feel i have given my points, But since I DONT agree with you!  You pay them no mind.. PLEASE be proving me wrong.. Your a funny person or just a troll that wants to start fights?<br>
<br>
Bottom line here if you dont like the class and you dont like how they are moving us.. Please start an alt.. Because your just hurting yourself playing a class you dont think is worth anything. Thats what I dont understand myself.. Mages have been lowered off our perch of top for a LONG time. And your still not happy.. Do yourself a favor and move on to a class that will make you happy.. <br>

BTW, one again you want to prove me wrong for some reason. But if you see my example about the tash and slowing.. Let me explain something to you it called agro managment, you dont not want the healer flipping targets(before the MT even has agro!!!) you want the MT to be the only person to be taking damage and with the higher end mob the LAST thing you want is a pure taking agro..

<br>
1) &quot;We do not rate with any of the other damage dealing classes in the game&quot;.<br>
<br>
In my experience, pre-Kunark, doing PoH/PoF raids, the caster groups were always the XP (&quot;KS&quot;) groups.<br>
<br>
These days, it's the group with the most melees in it.  The word you would use to rate mages with the other damage dealing classes would be &quot;lower&quot;.<br>
<br>
2) &quot;We do not rate with any of the other utility/support classes in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Necros can be mana batteries, but their ability to battery has the advantage of not taking away the target's health.  They're much better self-contained batteries, converting their health into mana, sucking up health and transferring mana to whoever needs it.  I still maintain that this is the most insulting ability in the game, but at least they have a good implementation of it.<br>
<br>
Shaman and enchanters are all the debuffing you need.<br>
<br>
The only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> real</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> service that magicians provide is COH.  The rest of our summons are largely a service to people who forgot to bring something.  Like their own food.<br>
<br>
While this is ammusing, I wouldn't call it a great support ability.  I don't think of the coke machine down the hall as a great support/utility device towards software development.  It's nice to have, but I could always bring my own Cokes to work if it wasn't there.<br>
<br>
3) &quot;We are no longer in the top half of the soloing classes&quot;<br>
<br>
#1) Enchanter.  Trickier, but fastest leveling class if well played.<br>
#2) Wizard.  Most efficient quad-kiting.<br>
#3) Druid.  Second most efficient quad-kiting.<br>
#4) Necro.  Heals, mana regeneration, fear kiting.<br>
#5) Bard.  Insane kiting/charmfighting ability outdoors.<br>
#6) Shaman?  Shadowknight?  Mage?<br>
<br>
If we're in the top half, it's a close call.<br>

Why is playing an almost vital part in a raid's success considered insulting to you?  And if it is..why the F are you still playing one?  BTW....Mod Rods are 10X the utility of Necro pumpage IMHO.

<br>
Being Lvl 40, I can't use experience (obviously) from attending plane raids or the higher level areas, so If you're a stickler for facts and data crunching offensive efficiency is your mantra, my words will probably mean even far less.<br>
<br>
On that note, I think that some players are too enveloped in the idea that Verant somehow actually works for it's consumers.  The basic fact for the groundwork of EQ is time=money.  The more time you spend playing EQ, the more money Verant/Sony gets.<br>
<br>
Now, if Verant is able (*cough* willing) to make our well-known biggest issues solvent, then where does that leave them?  They've replaced their addicted-disgruntled consumers into content- and arguably, BORED players.  Verant will never shoot themselves in the foot like that.  <br>
Dev_team_00 says: &quot;Cripes, let's make this work like they want it.&quot;<br>
Corporate_suit has slain Dev_team_00.<br>
Corporate_suit says: &quot;Ignorance.  They'll leave us.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you would leave.  Because fact of the matter is if we had nothing to bitch about, and we didn't have a reason to vent at Verant, then we'd become detached from &quot;our&quot; game.  We'd start looking for something new.  City of Heroes, Galaxies, etc.  Something that we could have a &quot;say&quot; in.  Because this game is valuable to us.  <br>
<br>
You and I probably put more time into it then we'd admit to our family.  And that underlying value to us keeps us coming back.  But if it were all well and good, and there were no class issues, then it just wouldn't be as interesting....<br>
<br>
or fun.<br>
<br>
Therefore, for as much bitching and whining as you hear from any class, and especially mages in general I leave you with this..<br>
<br>
$#it or get off the pot.<br>
<br>
You don't like how stuffs goin'?...Leave.  Go raise your blasters and lightsabers in Galaxies.  Cause nothing's really gonna change.  There will still be massive &quot;problems&quot; in this game.  Because that's how Verant wants it.<br>
<br>
And that's how it should be.  Imperfect.  It will never be balanced.  And I am fine with it.<br>

2.) You'd be surprised, I think.  There is a huge jump in power from lvl 55-60 for the soloing mage.  There are spells to help in it not to mention the equipment many mages pick up along the way.  I'll have to try what that monk was doing sometime, and if I can pull them solo...I'm sure I could do exactly what he was doing.  Not because my spells are much different from yours..but because my equipment allows for that sort of thing, which I'm almost positive is the case with the monk you saw. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uextra411.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Extra411</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#333333>(1/18/02 9:56:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> &quot;Fact 1 We do not rate with any of the other damage dealing classes in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
How so? Any hard evidence?<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact 2 We do not rate with any of the other utility/support classes in the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Define the parameters of &quot;utility/support&quot; classes please. It's ambiguous when you put it like that.<br>
<br>
&quot;Fact 3 We are no longer in the top half of the soloing classes&quot;<br>
<br>
That depends. Where do you solo? Soloing the most difficult mob? Soloing the most number of mobs before downtime? Soloing and killing mobs the fastest? <br>
<br>
And Grumples...I couldn't disagree with your list more. First off a lvl 60 shaman is WAY up there. With torpor/cann/manaless DoT/DD, slow, buffs...they are a soloing machine. lvl 60 Necromancers with root/DoT soloing strategy has nearly no downtime. lvl 60 Monk with fungi could solo an entire dungeon...and I really do not consider Bards and Druids to be up there. <br>
<br>
And if you are saying Necro mana transfer is BETTER, then I just don't know what to tell you other than you are experiencing the worst case of class envy (not to mention downplaying Magician's abilities). The mana transfer rate is HORRIBLE for Necros. 400 mana to cast for 150 mana given, while at the same time mages give 660 mana for 900 hp. Unless it takes 510 mana for the person to heal himself, mod rod 2 is way more efficient than twitching.<br>
<br>
Orbit - I play Daedolon in the game...I think you probably have seen me running around .

Stateing that mages solo better post 40 then enchanters do is so rediculous as to further comment on it would insult us both(I have played a chanter and I STRONGLY suggest that you either play one and find out or dont get into this). Druids are one of the few classes that I don't have extensive knowledge of at 60, I can't comment on them although by there own claims they solo a margin better then we do, and certienly FAR more safely.<br>
<br>
Soloing classes at 60 go approx. depending on circumstances;<br>
chanter(w/dire charm), druid(w/dire charm), necromancer(w/dire charm), shaman/monk(tied for best really), necromancer, druid/wizard(quad kiting), enchanter, sk/pal/bard, War/rog/ranger(there is no telling however what unlimited arrows will do for this class), mage(I would guess that beastlords would fall about were we do). This is all from first hand or commonly accepted information, the classes I have experience with at this level are monk/mage/shaman/cleric/warrior, I have personally witnessed or played(although not to the huge extent I have with the previously listed classes)rogues/rangers/sks/paladins/bards.<br>
<br>
Something I didn't understand about your post Tom, you said you did between 12-57 shocks after lend was already at 40%?<br>
I assume your using your 58 shock, at 8 seconds a pop thats 12x8 1min 36 seconds to 57x8 7 min 36 seconds? am I interpreting this information correctly? you don't remember how many you got off but it was between 12-57 while chain casting and standing in the aoe the whole time of course.<br>
<br>
As for mod rods vs. necro pumping, there very different server different purposes, necro pumping is faster, safer and of more use during most fights, mod rods reduce downtime and are also a form of mana storage. If I had to choose one or the other it would probably be mod rod 2 but thats certienly not true of everyone. BTW I was one of the mages to give the biggest cheer over this spell, its simply incredible and I have no doubt that after VI has some of luclins bugs fixed it will be in the first round of nerfing along with dire charm.<br>
<br>
As for us being on par with shamans for resistance debuffing, well imperically we are not, FACT we simply do not debuff to the same degree they do on our top of the line resistance debuff. Although I will admit in resistance debuffing we are both valide and useful. BTW I would like to thank you for implying that were a utility class on par with enchanters/shamans/druids I am sure that you just entertained many people and not just me.<br>
<br>
Some of you seem to question what I put, well here we go.<br>
<br>
First off, for damage, damage is different in every situation, I am talking about end game(as I always am as its where I play). Put a mage at 60 with epic bboots/kt boots blah blah whatever dream equipment you want next to a warrior/monk/rogue/sk/paladin/ranger all equiped with primal or better weapons. I suggest that every mage do this on there own to learn for themselves just how far behind we are. My personal logs show mages approx on par with meleeing bards on average(there is a very large range which we fall into however because mages are affected to a huge degree by which mob we fight).<br>
<br>
My second point when I say utility classes I mean utility classes, shamans/enchanters/druids/Sk's I could include monks here simply for FD. We do not compare to these classes in any way shape or form for combat utility(hell we don't compare to ANYONE for combat utility).<br>
<br>
Soloing, this is rather straight forward, given a top 25% spot for any paticular class who will solo with A) the most gain and B) the most safty. Quite simply who soloes most efficently for XP as this is the only real use of soloing in the end game.(there simply is no equipment in the game that can be taken off a soloable mob that my character would use). You talk about having 8 minutes of downtime after fighting 7-8 blue mobs(there are many blue mobs that would rip your pet to 5% and leave you with 10% mana, so please specify exactly which mobs your talking about because I would really like to know your secret, obvioulsy your a better soloer then me) and you seem to think that compares to virtual 0 downtime for necro's/monks/paladins noticebly less downtime for warriors/rogues/sks, same downtime for wizards/druids(a little less actually) but with FAR more saftey then we have.<br>
<br>
As for orbit and his continual claims that a mage was the first person to 60 on his server all I will say is that the first person to 60 on any server was a RANGER.<br>
<br>
And my favorite statment is orbits about tashing, this is if nothing else shows just how much of a newb you are, ever heard of suicide tashing? never played a chanter have you? well suicide tashing is something that most end game chanters know all about, tash is a HUGE aggro(used to be more) dieing to get a tash in early is just something that a chanter does. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujayteebushwacker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 191<br> <font color=#333333>(1/19/02 1:09:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=60>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> I do the MOBs like Avatar of War every patch.  These mofo's have some fricken HP out the arse, and hit for a ton.  Do i make rods for these?  I make 1/2 a bar before the pull.  I am usually the only mag there.  Our clerics dont run out of mana on the AoW.<br>
<br>
So basically if you have your clerics equipped right you dont really need rods desperatly, they are there for assistance and some back up.  Are they wanted? Yes.  Are they boring? Yes. That all I bring to a raid? No.  That all I do on a raid? No, I refuse to just make rods, and I am very useful to my guild arguably the best in the game.<br>
