<br>
As you are aware we have been deem to be overpowerful by Verant for a very long time and now might be on the verge of being seen as a balanced Class.<br>
<br>
This is quite a long post, so if you just want to see the suggestions which IMO could solve this issue head towards the bottom of the post.<br>
<br>
******************************<br>
<br>
The question that pops into my mind is why and how could they come to that conclusion. In this post I would like to illustrate why they might consider us overpowered.<br>
<br>
I would also like to state that I'm an avid follower of Mage issues and other issues on various boards, even though I rarely post. The Mage Compendium is definitaly the best by far IMO. I'm a lvl 55 Mage without epic, with 2-3 PoG items (no bp or such), but have been starting to encounter more issues since i was lvl 49.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Why could we be overpowerd ?</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>1. Relative strength.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
From lvl 1 to approximately lvl 29 we are by an acceptably strong class. From lvl 29-38 we start to notice a  decrease of our power, however from lvl 39 to 49 we are once again good Damagedealers. This is in the context of no twinking, which has been pronounced massively in the last 2 years I have enjoyed Everquest.<br>
<br>
Could it possibly be that Verant has not noticed the average twink-lvl of players nowadays? I personally think yes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>2. Paying Customers</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
All of us are paying customers, but a sizeable portion of the Player community tends to move towards Classes, that are deemed the strongest.<br>
<br>
This in turn leads that these Classes expand their numbers and thus leads to more paying customers. In a business you try to satisfy the majority of your customers coupled with the lowest investment.<br>
<br>
Int-Casters as such, excl. Enchanters and Wizards at 60 with their GBS, are deemed as not too strong and thus don't comprise a large portion of the game resulting in generally less attention being brought to them. This I personally think is a pure side-effect and in no way intentional.<br>
<br>
Could it perchance be possible that when Mages were still supposedly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Kings</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> pre-Kunark that Players were playing many Int-Casters, and this led to the impression they were overpowered, which by all accounts I've read they were ?<br>
Were these perchance even used to create the new Main-characters of today and thus the number of Int-Casters is still very high, even though rarely played, still leading to the conclusion that Int-Casters are very plentiful and thus ok ?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>3. Chain-casting</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
As every Person tends to learn by experience, try and error in some cases, all manners of different possibilities have been tried over and over again; especially considering that 400'000 players had/are/have been playing for eons (in the gaming world 3 years+ is eons *g*). (sidenote, who still remembers IoK on Compuserve or Drakkar *chuckles softly*).<br>
<br>
Thus Magicians have come up with a very simple solution of how to maximize their gains with a very low cost. Imagine at the 50th lvl cap, a mage chainsummoning (and ds). With few exceptions Mages just were able to do almost anything and with the exception of a probably insignificant number of Players in today's EQ cannot match up in pure power.<br>
<br>
Reality is that I don't see that many Tank or other Twinks that stack up to a average equipped Mage using Chainsummoning at lvl 50. Reality also is that while some might be of a similar efficiency or god forbid even enhanced only a similar insignificant number of Players are vocal about issues outside of the EQ-environment.<br>
<br>
Could it just purely be that Mages are stacked up to this reality that is IMO quite valid until lvl 50 and thus the rise to power was slowed?<br>
It definately seems to be what we are seeing and might explain some of the lackluster statements we have seen.<br>
<br>
Could it possibly be that even though there are many asking for defense, that in effect truthfully you don't need much defense when your offense is overpowerful ?<br>
I think so, as the pet when existing provides us a HUGE defense and a Great offense until lvl 50.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>4. Complexity</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
As a likely majority of casters probably thinks, Casters tend to be very intriguing, complex and tricky for quite a long time in their life. I would even be so bold as to suggest non-casters have nowhere near the complexity, possibilities casters have.<br>
<br>
Could it be that the complexity draws a certain type of player to the casting classes?<br>
From my gaming experience of online RPG's(over 15years) when you have a large selection and classes like in Everquest, 'power' classes are the most played ones and 'complex' but not power Classes are the least. <br>
<br>
At the present time a majority of players is considers Mages to not be that powerful of a class in certain areas and thus our low numbers.<br>
<br>
With the same background in mind could it be that Players with complex classes tend to be more lenient, patient and hopeful of what lies behind the mountain ? <br>
Again I would answer this with a definate 'Yes'.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>5. Items</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Items are one the cornerstones of any game, however in the case of most casters, they are not too relevant for as long as they increase their power with new spells. This is the case with all casters at least up until level 50 as the power upgrade from items is quite minimal, while non-casters are defined almost only by items. Of course everyone likes a new shiny toy but what is more important to 'YOU' as a caster for a long time in the game.<br>
<br>
Could it perchance be that in the beginning of Everquest items were especially sought and requested in a vocal fashion by non-casters, while casters didn't really care as much and this led to the low influx of items for casters?<br>
I think so, as a Mage with Cloth clothing is nearly as efficient as a Mage with good items for a long time. This is reflected for example that intelligence items bring one additional mana point per int every 5 levels with 57 being the last(12mana per int).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>6. Afk-Xping</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
This is possible at all levels of play, even moreso enhanced by the epic pet, with the 'static' nature of Everquest. Whether there is a risk attached to it as long as you can get a gain over time and whether it be miniscule or not it leads once again to power.<br>
<br>
Could it be that this gain, going from large to small, is dangerous for Everquest.<br>
I definately think so, as this kind of issue was the ultimate downfall(for me) of the 2nd largest online game called UO. All those 100's of hours I spent becoming a GM Smith/Miner were diminished when players could suddenly do this without sitting in front of their computer for 24 hours compared to my 4 hours.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Conclusion</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
All of the reasons above could imply that Mages are overpowered, even though many on this board do not feel that way, if i'm not misinterpreting their messages.<br>
I'm also aware that not all of them play a similar role, with the Chaincasting and Afk-xping being the most damaging.<br>
<br>
**************************************<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Possible Solutions</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Take away these the main 'damaging' features, these being Chaincasting and Afk-xping by making them inefficient or void and then enhancing our class from there. <br>
I will address possibilities which I could imagine and I think both these addressed issues are lame to say the least, though I do perform Chaincasting in those few times i still solo.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>1. Chaincasting</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Greatly enhance the cost of crafting materials from the world and forming sentient beings from them by increasing the mana expenditure.<br>
<br>
The pet mana cost would increase a large amount, e.g. 1500 for lvl 49 pets, 2000 for lvl 51 pets, 2500 for lvl 57+ pets. (mages perspective).<br>
At this time the pet is basicly not worth anything at all, except having a certain number of token hits in the range of 500 hitpoints(would fit for the lvls i mentioned and better not be in some AE).<br>
<br>
To improve it to its 'current' resp. 'future improved' strength you cast your Burnout line. The cost will remain exactly the same as they do know resp. free if you have the BOIII leggings.<br>
<br>
This Burnout would then add all abilities, resistances, additional hitpoints, haste, regen, etc.<br>
<br>
Between this would also work for other petcasting classes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>2. Afk-Xping</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
Since it would be very hard to change the 'static' content of the game, your pet would not be capable of ever soloing an exp mob for any time longer than the Burnout would last, it would directly imply that the Mage or a partner must actively take part in the killing of an Experience-Monster.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   Additional Improvements</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>1. Pathing</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
It has been clearly stated that this is considered to be an issue of risk/reward and occurs seldom. It is also seems to be something that is tricky to improve should this be wanted as per the 'Vision'. I will take this premise to both leave the risk in but also gain the reward. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
The main risks being AE, Fear, Charm, and switching of targets.<br>
<br>
Pet control is also something that is very doable by Pet handlers in many situations. However it does take experience, knowledge of the pathing and usage of the tools at our disposal like pet commands(incl. pet hold), Summon pet or the killing off the pet.<br>
<br>
Pet control is also a matter of contention between experienced Pet handlers, inexperienced Pet handlers and non-Pet handlers. Even experienced Pet handlers will sometimes, albeit rarely, make mistakes and breaking mezzes is what i categorize a mistake.<br>
<br>
Pets are disallowed in the EQ-World in some areas with risks due to the capability of performing the same goal with addition of other classes that are not limited by the risks imposed upon them by pets.<br>
This an absolutely valid argument as it could lead to 30people losing hours of time, loot and other things. (even I tend to disallow pets in some areas).<br>
However it also hurts us in many ways.<br>
<br>
How can we get this issue addressed without taking the risk part out of the equation ?<br>
<br>
1. /pet attack (or kill)<br>
Enhance this that upon this command the pet instead of running to the monster that is targetted, it teleports directly to the monster and attacks it. It will remain on this monster until dead and will following by continously teleporting to the monster when the monster ist not in its hit range anymore. It would work similar to summoning except the pet is summoning itself to the mob.<br>
When a mob gates the pet would follow and you better not let mob get away with it or you hit your Earthen boots in a very timely fashion and possibly do an aggrolog.<br>
<br>
2. /pet back off<br>
Only if your pet is engaged with a monster, it will try to return to you. This again is done with the teleporting method back to your side.<br>
If your pet is not engaged it performs /pet follow (see 3).<br>
<br>
3. /pet follow me<br>
The pet will use the pathing lines determined by the environment, thus following you, returning to you, etc. This is the default.<br>
<br>
4. /pet hold<br>
Solves the problem of issues like AE or being attacked by another mob, especially if used in conjunction with /pet back off.<br>
<br>
5. AE<br>
Will have same effects as now if no /pet hold exists.<br>
<br>
6. Fear<br>
Pet will be teleported to you and then immediately start running away from you using the pathing geometry. You get a couple of seconds, to take measures like destroying it.<br>
<br>
7. Charm<br>
After charm breaks it will instantly resume the /pet attack method of teleporting back to the monster.<br>
<br>
The effect of this would not reduce risk for mistakes by not reacting or doing the wrong things, but removes any issues with the pathing geometry in place. I also can't imagine it to be too hard from a coding standpoint (i know where monster is, I send it where the monster would summon it too).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>Additional Improvements</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
There are many improvements we could use as all other classes would also expect.<br>
However removing potential 'overpowering' qualities could give us things like AA-skills that allow our pet to perform similar to a 'Dire-charm', proccing summoned items, etc.<br>
<br>

Should the suggestions have a certain validity in your opinion use them in whatever fashion you deem fit.<br>

I will not be sending them to Verant in any case, as I feel that our great Ronaldor Vladimir has their ear right now.<br>

I notice that especially when I play with some of my lowbies, which are non-twinks and only have what they earn. These players exist and there still is an influx of them, albeit rarely.<br>
<br>
However new non-casters(mainly tanks) must invest quite some cash to equip them well enough that they seriously compare to mages in the lower levels in my experience which differs from yours.<br>
<br>
I think that Verant thinks twinks are a lot more uncommon than they are reality, especially seeing the numerous boasts (I have a 50+ character). And a good number of the influx have friends already playing and thus get good 'overpowered' items.<br>
<br>
So the average number of them twinks in reality is much higher and thus int-casters in general lose out in the lower echelons as well because their is no effective way of twinking them. I personally find this better, but it would have to be equal for all classes.<br>
<br>
This is the main point I tried to make and the question why don't they see it or don't want to see it.<br>

I concede the point because you are right. Editing out way more powerful to acceptable.<br>
<br>
Most of it was philosophical and boy was it hard to make it not sound generalized. What I was hoping is what mages think on 'nerfing' Alt-xping, Chaincasting. Would mages be accept that if the updates would compensate us for it ?<br>
<br>
Would the pathing suggestion be usable and allow our pets on raids (though I like the /pet drag approach as well).<br>

<br>
Although I cannot decide whether <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chaining Pets</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is really a problem, my initial reaction are these.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chain Casting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is our only defense besides <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gate</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> when the spawn hits the fan.  Personally, I have only applied the techinique in emergencies, to avoid death.  But I do see how a skilled <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> could employ <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chained Pets</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to solo more ambitiously than I do.<br>
<br>
At this time I am strongly against dramatically increasing the cost in either mana or components for our pets.  A more acceptable remedy might be to move more of the strength of a pet into <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Burnout</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and if necessary, weaken unbuffed pets slightly.  This is just my initial reaction though.<br>
<br>
I am not certain that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chaining Pets</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is the reason that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> considers <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be over-powered, but it certainly is a possibility, and one I have not given much thought to.<br>

It was much easier to solo a oger warrior to 35 then it was to level my human mage to the same level.  You will not do either class to that level very quick but overall it was much easier for the warrior.  Post 35 a mage can solo where as a warrior can not but there are other problems that hit the mage that will slow him/her down.  <br>
<br>
Post 50 if you look at every class the way they where intended to play (mages solo, necros solo, druids solo and group, melees group with clerics and bards), and you gather a group of 50 of each type that they where intended to work with. Then you tossed them in their zone where their epic is (where ever that may be) The grouping classes will survive,  and there will be 50 mage corpse on the floor.  What i am trying to say there is a philosophical incongruenancy with the life path that mages naturally take compared to all the other classes.<br>
What i challenge VI in doing is not to change the mage class but instead make the mages work with the people who most understand the problems of the mage class, (other mages). <br>

<br>
If we are to petition <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> successfully, we must address <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>their</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> perception of the class.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has been remarkably closed mouth about exactly <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>why</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.

<br>
For example, suppose <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has decided that we are over-powered because of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Tactic X</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

<br>
In any case, I have come to the conclusion that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chain Casting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is no more unbalancing than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Ordinary Kiting, Fear Kiting,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Quad Kiting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, all of which <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has learned to accept despite their misgivings.<br>
<br>
The main impact of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Chain Casting</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician Class Balance</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would then be that existing pet strength would form an upper bound on raw pet strength.  That is, we are unlikely to see in increase in power in the pets we can summon.

<br>
I do agree that even if Verant were to increase the lvl 57 earth pet damage from 60 to lets just say 70 and the epic from 67 to 77, I doubt if they would do it to the pet itself. I think they would do it with some level increasing high mana cost pet buff or probably high mana cost summoned items. That way they could insure chain casting wouldnt become more overpowered. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uethelwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ethelwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/02 1:57:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Issues</span><hr size=1> Raz &amp; Wezloc *BINGO*.<br>
<br>
Even though I might have been been long-winded in trying to reason why Verant might consider us overpowered I agree with you totally.<br>
<br>
Pet &amp; Burnout &amp; DS lets say 600mana with a full bar = 10k pets, taking a hit at 100 = 25 ds * 50 = 1250 damage (usually its double = 2500-3000dmg). Pet hitting 3*40 (guess of average) * 50 rounds of survival = 6000 dmg = 11k damage total with little risk if no lag.<br>
<br>
This is more on the conservative side as if you have DS robe &amp; burnout legs you can triple damage. so lets say 20-25k overall. That is alot of damage if nothing goes awry and more or less risk free.<br>
<br>
So i agree pet buffing should be via spells of improved power and cost.<br>

Has anyone post 50 been sucessful at getting groups?  No, of course not, because in most cases peeps do not think provide enough power to warrant our exp take.  Sure we can be a vending machine and do CoH on raids and such, however it only takes one mage to do that.  And since the pet is not something the guild usually wants areound on events (the risk of bad pathing far outweighs the reward of damage output), the mage epic is last on the list.  So, our epic is the hardest, every class agrees on this, and the least coveted by the guild that makes sense doesn'it it... NOT! At this point there is an obvious flaw in the mage class, the need to group to accomplish the epic and other uber items and the underpowered ability of a mage in  a group.  I personally feel that something needs to be done.  After 1,2 or 3 years of playing to find out that you chosen class is shunned by others is not a good thing!  What is the fix?  Let everyone who is mage get a pick for an equal lev int caster they can switch to LOL!  Seriously,  I think our nukeage needs to be increase how in the world can a druid be our equal in firepower that is not right.... Druids can heal, port, buff, and also NUKE more than a mage?  BAH!<br>
<br>
So, when there should be a line of spells that are only able to be used when you do have a pet.  This is very simple to code and would allow the damage output to warrant our presence in high level groups and on raids.<br>
