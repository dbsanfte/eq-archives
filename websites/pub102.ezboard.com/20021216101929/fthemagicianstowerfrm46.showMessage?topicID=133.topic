This brings a &quot;frenzy&quot; pace into combat, as you need to drop mobs quick before they drop you.<br>
<br>
Mobs have much lower resistances than Velious and Luclin.  In fact, for XP groups, most mobs don't need any debuffing, or only one level of debuffing, before spells land for full damage.<br>
<br>
Due to Low HP and Low Resists, more mobs are thrown into encounters, making tools like Mez and Root valuable again, bringing back utility in a big way for Enchanters, Bards and Necromancers (mez), and in a lesser way for Clerics, Druids, Shaman and Wizards (root).<br>
<br>
Other spell lines (other than Mez and Root) have made a comeback.  Fast hitting low HP mobs make Damage Shields valuable.  Lower chance to resist Lull type spells have made Clerics, Enchanters and Druids more usefull for assisting with pulling.<br>
<br>
Melee classes have been reshuffled in their abilities.  Warriors, Shadow Knights and Paladins had defensive caps raised and bonuses granted to mitigation to become much better tanks, which helps tremendiously against the hard hitting mobs.<br>
<br>
The Clerics role has been strengthened by the best patch heals in the game, while the other priests (druid/shaman) were given Complete Heal variations to assist their roles.<br>
<br>
The classes that severly needed attention, such as (in no particular order) Shadow Knights, Beastlords, Bards and Mages have been given decent upgrades, though you need to largely obtain the PoP spells, levels and abilities before they become &quot;balanced&quot; again.  This doesn't help Casual gamers or those who have not got PoP.  Also, there's a lot of argueing that now some of these newly &quot;balanced&quot; classes are too powerfull (ie: Beastlord pets vs Magician pets).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, spell parchment drops in the first tier planes are still very rare, though apparantly they drop much better in the 2nd and 3rd tier planes, but those are hard to get to for most non-uber guilds.<br>
<br>
Zones and respawn rates have been well designed to allow single groups to move through them to gain XP and have fun while doing so without severe personal risk, rather than find a camp and pulling back to it.<br>
<br>
For groups who want explore tougher areas, if you wipe your corpses are returned to the zone in &quot;graveyard&quot; after 15 minutes.  This means easy corpse runs, and not a compulsory need for a Shadow Knight or Necromancer friend if you even THINK of doing something harder than normal.<br>
<br>
Player roles although diluted in some areas have been more clearly defined in others.  The damage dealers are doing their damage, the tanks are tanking, the priests are healing, etc.  For the first time in a long while, people have been looking for &quot;someone who can mez&quot; or &quot;someone who can heal&quot; rather than &quot;We must have an Enchanter&quot; or &quot;We must have a Cleric&quot;.<br>
<br>
Loot drops aren't as frequent, causing mudflation to be slowed.  The items that are dropping thus far are good, but not 5 times better than Vex Thal, which again helps to slow mudflation.<br>
<br>
The Blue Con range was reduced to force those 61+ seeking XP to move out of the lower zones, and largely populating PoP.<br>
<br>
PoP abilities have low reuse times (3 minutes, 9 minutes, or a whopping long 22 minutes, etc) which means they can be used much more often than Luclin abilities (Divine Resurrection anyone?  48 HOUR reuse), making them more appealing, and less of a &quot;I must save that for later!&quot; mentality.<br>
<br>
Level 61+ deaths with a 96% XP rez seem to lose virtually no XP, meaning less fear of death or taking a Paladin's 90% XP rez, especially combined with the graveyards.<br>
<br>
All in all, it feels more like the Old EQ, before Kunark, or early Kunark, where spell lines all had a use, players had roles they could fill while being somewhat interchangable, and you could get a group of odd classes and have fun and get XP, without the &quot;WE MUST HAVE Cleric/Warrior/Enchanter OR WE CAN'T DO IT!&quot; mentality.<br>
<br>
Yeah, it has downsides too, but it's the best expansion that's been released in a long time.  Only truely negative thing I can say for it is that it doesn't offer much for those below 50 other than quick travel. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kathodos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Battle Cleric of Tunare - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style=""><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365">Kantreach</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Arch Mage Antagonist - Tholuxe Paells</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kathodos>Kathodos</A> at: 11/1/02 12:56:41 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallerus>Gallerus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/02 8:49:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is PoP worth buying?</span><hr size=1> If youre not lvl 60, dont buy pop.<br>

So far to me, all pop is is a bunch of dreadlands type zones, with about the same amount of excitment - you end up sitting on a zone wall or in a safe spot in a cave or corner or something &amp; pulling mobs to grind out another 5 levels - woofukinghoo.  Some tasks like the trials to get marks for access to other zones are interesting, but everything i've seen requires you to lean towards group optimization, rather than tacits, like they wanted.  The zones look awesome, but overall, I think this expansion sucks &amp; is very boring.  I was really hoping to have like 20-30+ raid targets along the lines of velious/non-boring-ass-time-sink-required-sol stuff, but instead, you get a buncha dreadland type zones with a few tough boss type mobs &amp; some interesting trial type encounters.  Xp mobs, in general, hit hard enough to almost require slow + ch + mt.<br>
<br>
Blue con changes basically ruined casual xping &amp; farming parchments to get spells = more gay than chain research if thats even possible.<br>
<br>
ffs, they havent made a decent dungeon zone since freaking kunark was released.  I'd kill for new dungeons in the sebilis/hs/chardok mold + some more encounters like KT/statue/ntov/tho/IV/etc <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=moontaylesilverleaf>Moontayle Silverleaf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/02 10:32:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is PoP worth buying?</span><hr size=1> Don't listen to Gallerus.

<br>
I agree with this. If you mostly solo, this is very hard in the planes, and once you get about 62 the majority of pre-pop solo spots will now be green.<br>
<br>
However, personally I also agree that this is the best expansion released. The skills, while not super powerful, have a nice cool factor to them. The zones and graphics are amazing. Youll know what I mean when you first step into the prep chamber for the trials in PoJ.<br>
<br>
The exp zones and high end encounters are very well done too. Gone are the 30-50min marathon battles. Fights now last 5-15min, and are pretty much balls to the wall &quot;kill-it-before-it-kills-you&quot;.<br>
<br>
Overall, Im very impressed.<br>

<br>
Sorry, but I think you guys are nuts.<br>
<br>
pok = basically gives everyone ports to all cities...its just nexus2.  In the next month, you will find probably 85% of the population of eq bound there.  Since pretty gimpy to me to build a zone that basically encourages everyone to bind there - makes the game less diverse, etc /shrug.  <br>
<br>
/raid = distributes insignificant amounts of xp over an entire raid instead of a few groups that happen to have high dps by accident or design - nice, but hardly earth shattering &amp; in no way worth $30 imo.<br>
<br>
I think velious is by far the best expansion vi has done. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=logicalentity>LogicalEntity</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/02 11:03:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.badassbuddy.com/images/buddies/badassbuddy_com-meditate.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Is PoP worth buying?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
Less diverse? It's making the game MORE diverse, now people will be able to journey farther, rather than having to worry about how to get back to where you &quot;know where you are&quot;. When i first started i was scared to leave crushbone because it would take forever waiting on the damn boat!<br>
<br>
Would you rather sit and wait for the boat or a spire to take you somewhere? Traveling has always been a bitch in EQ, and hopefully this will take some of the burden off the poor Druids and Wizards around EQ who have been acting as PoK for entirely too long.<br>
<br>
It's a good thing to have one centralized place where you can always find new things. It's not just a porting place, there's tons of quests, spells, vendors, people. That my friend is the definition of diversity.<br>

<br>
It's not <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> an Exp feature. Do you think people who go on raids are looking for exp with 20+ people? Most likely, no. It's a God send for raid organization, raid communication, and Looting. Everyone is aware of whats going on and whats being looted.<br>
<br>
Verant has done a great job with this expansion so far.<br>

The /raid feature is very useful, and can help out smaller guilds a lot on raids.<br>

The Plane of Know-How is a great place. You'll save time, bind there and you can port to every single city in the game (including FV, Shar Val, Nexus, ect).<br>

Thing is its geared mainly for the 55 and up I would say. The zones are neat, nice to fight in new territory, discover new events, quests, items, monsters. <br>
<br>
Don't underestimate the raid feature. It may yeild a minimum of XP, but IMHO any XP on a raid is good xp. I raid alot and if I dont get in the KS group, well your spending hours of your time not getting a single xp message. With raid feature you may get 1-3%xp depending on situation and amount of time on raid, but in my opinion that 1-3% counts for something. Xp isnt what you go on raids for anyways, but the functionality is great. Its nice to know everything that goes on.. great job VI.<br>
<br>
The flag trials are well scripted and actually alot of fun. Its nice to have to work your way into a plane. Its nice to actually have to use TACTIC to get that flag.. How many times we failed the valor quest before we figured out the right combination to get that sucker completed? hehe.. I hear so many times in Poj with the zone message that another group failed. Hell its great accomplishing something, having fun and it being in new territory. Seriously, though.. overall I like this alot better than luclin.. and while we work to gain access to new teir in planes, im going to have a blast..  <p>Nathanius Firesong</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calyxto>Calyxto</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 7:21:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Diversity</span><hr size=1> You are parked at a zone wall pulling singles and at the same time complaining that binding in PoK is ruining diversity.
