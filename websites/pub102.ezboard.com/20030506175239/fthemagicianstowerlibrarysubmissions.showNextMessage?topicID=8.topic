The first will be solo, the second will be grouping with at least one more magician.<br>
<br>
There are certain essentials if you wish to start practicing this somewhat offbeat chaining method.  For starters, the minimum requirements are as follows:<br>
<br>
1.  You will need to spend 6 AA points in your General skills, 12 points in your Archetype skills (Spell Casting Mastery is preferred), and 3 points in Improved Reclaim.  Naturally, this means you have to be at least level 59.<br>
<br>
2.  You will need an item with an instant-click Reclaim Energy effect.  Some good suggestions include the Solusek Ro pet focus items (Stein of Ulissa, Shovel of Ponz, Broom of Trilon, Torch of Alna), the Kunark-era focus staves (Staff of Elemental Mastery Water, Fire, Earth, or Air), or the Luclin-era Gloves of Dark Summoning.  Although there are other items with a right-click Reclaim Energy, the instant-click variety is greatly preferred.<br>
<br>
3.  Particularly when soloing, you will need to have access to your highest level Earth pet spell, specifically Greater Vocarate Earth (or for those with Planes of Power and level 65, the Rathe's Son spell).  The Earth pet root spell is almost essential when soloing.  Access to Malosi/Malosini/Malosinia is also nearly essential as well.<br>
<br>
4.  Although not required, it is helpful to have a Summoning Efficiency 3 or 4 item, as well as a Summoning Haste 3 or 4 item.  For additional AA skills, Quick Summoning and Elemental Pact are helpful as well.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">SOLOING</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
<br>
1.  As was already mentioned, pet root is practically essential, so have your highest level Earth pet memmed.  Also memorize your highest level Malise-type spell.<br>
<br>
2.  Pull your mob with a low aggro spell.<br>
<br>
3.  Send pet in and make sure you cast your highest level Malise-type spell to minimize mob resisting the pet's root spell.<br>
<br>
4.  Watch carefully how quickly the pet is losing hit points.  If the pet is losing hit points rather quickly, you may have to reclaim rather quickly as well.<br>
<br>
5.  Ideally (and this is not always possible, particlarly with giant mobs that have an extended reach) you will want to stand close enough to the mob that you can see whether or not the pet root landed.  You will see the message &quot;&lt;mob name&gt; sinks into the ground.&quot;<br>
<br>
6. At some point you will need to reclaim your pet.  Against some mobs, it's when the pet is below 30% hit points, against other mobs it may be as early as the pet's second cast of its root spell.  You will need to time this recast with the pet's landing of its root spell.  The moment the spell lands, immediately right-click your Reclaim Energy spell.  The mob will be rooted in place, giving you time to recast your pet.  <br>
<br>
7. Pet root lasts as long as 18 seconds, but it could potentially last less time.  For this reason it is a good idea to reduce the cast time on your pet summons (Summoning Haste item and/or Quick Summoning skill, summoned spell haste ring, cleric buff, etc.)  The moment you reclaim your pet, immediately start resummoning.  If you have a Summoning Efficiency 3 or 4 item, you will have enough extra mana to cast your highest level Burnout buff on the pet.  If not, it will take a bit longer to kill your mob.  While resummoning, it is a good idea to have your pet attack command ready.  The fastest way to do this, in my experience, is to type out /pet kill &lt;first few letters of the mob's name&gt; then hit enter as soon as the pet is summoned.  For example, if the mob's name is &quot;a Shimmering Rockfiend&quot; then your typed command will look something like this:  /pet kill a_sh<br>
<br>
8.  At some point during the fight, you will need to do at least some direct damage to the mob to prevent your pet from taking 75% of the experience.  Burst of Flame and Shock of Blades work for this, or you can use a heavier nuke if you so desire.  If using a heavier nuke, be aware that it may take a little time for the pet to regain aggro or land a root, so it will put you at greater risk than using a small nuke.<br>
<br>
9.  Once the mob is dead, loot at will.  You will discover that you will end the fight above 80% mana (or if you started the fight at less mana, more mana than you began with), so meditating between fights is totally unnecessary.  You can immediately pull again. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A> at: 3/7/03 7:16:23 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Gospel According to St. Jochan</span><br>  Posts: 973<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/03 4:52:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   THE BASICS OF MANA FREE CHAINING OF PETS pt.2</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">MULTIPLE MAGICIAN GROUPS</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
This piece focuses on having at least one more magician trained in Improved Reclaim.  Pet partnerships do not require that both have it trained, but it does make the situation easier to plan.<br>
<br>
1.  You will still be benefitted by pulling with a low aggro spell.<br>
<br>
2.  Unlike the soloing circumstance, the earth pet is more optional than a requirement.  The Air pet works well in this scenario.<br>
<br>
3.  Casting Malosi/Malosini/Malosinia on the mob is also optional, but still useful.<br>
<br>
4.  You will likely have more time to med during the fight than you would soloing, so maximum efficiency is less necessary, but once again it is still useful.<br>
<br>
5.  You will still need to do at least some direct damage to the mob in order to keep the pets from taking 75% of the experience.  Aggro is less of a concern with two pets on a mob, so heavier nuking is less risky than solo.<br>
<br>
6.  The key to successful chaining groups is making sure to time the pet recast such that there is always at least one pet on the mob.  This may mean staggering your recasts so neither magician is reclaiming at the same time, and neither pet is near death at the same time either.  This will take some practice.  Also, it will probably mean that pets will have to be reclaimed prematurely (before they drop too low in hit points.)  Since mana is not an issue, reclaiming pets early shouldn't concern anyone.<br>
<br>
7.  Once the mob is dead, loot at will.  You will be able to pull again immediately.  Just like in the solo circumstance, meditation between fights is completely unnecessary. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Gospel According to St. Jochan</span><br>  Posts: 974<br> <font color=#333333>(3/7/03 5:07:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=117.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   THE BASICS OF MANA FREE CHAINING OF PETS pt.3</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: Enrage</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
Against enraging mobs, it may prove difficult to keep pets on the mob for very long.  Enrage is an effective defense against pets, who characteristically hit rather fast.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of effective ways to deal with enrage.  The first is to have your heaviest nuke being cast just before the mob enrages.  This is much easier the more magicians you add to the group.  The second is to have Pet Discipline trained.  Have these two commands on a hotkey:  /pet sit, then /pet hold on the next line.  Pet will stay in melee range of the mob, but the pet is taking no riposte damage.  You can then use a smaller nuke, if you desire, and cast just after enrage starts.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES: mobs that summon</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
In multiple magician groups, being summoned will almost never be an issue, as long as there is a pet on the mob, and nuking is tightly controlled.  Solo you will need to use some special tactics.<br>
<br>
1.  You will need to have your pet summoning hasted to the max, meaning 5 seconds.  This can be done by maxing Quick Summoning, or by having Quick Summoning 2 plus a Summoning Haste 3 or 4 item.<br>
<br>
2.  As soon as pet root lands, you will need to spam /pet back off, or alternately use /pet hold if you have that skill trained.<br>
<br>
3.  The moment the mob summons your pet, reclaim it, and recast as per the first post in this series.  You will need to type the /pet kill &lt;first few letters of the mob's name&gt; while recasting, and hit Enter the moment the pet is finished resummoning.  There is nearly ZERO room for delay.  If you delay, you may get summoned before the new pet starts engaging the mob.<br>
<br>
Good luck, and have fun with your new chaining skills.<br>
