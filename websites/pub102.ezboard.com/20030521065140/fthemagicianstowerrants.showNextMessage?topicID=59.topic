I had to use great restraint to keep from  really going off. After I calmed down, I thought well ok this guy just doesn't know alot about how the mage class works and is comparing it to how he plays his class.  Then i get almost the same comment from another wiz in another group and guess what his mana level was when he said that---50% and mine? 20%. Anyway I was just curious to see if any other mages get little snippy comments like this from wiz and what do you tell them?<br>

The one time this happened to me, I just told the group, in groupsay, that the following needed to happen:<br>
(for reference, the group was 1 warrior, 1 cleric, 1 magician, 1 druid, 1 ranger, 1 wizzie)<br>
<br>
Ok, from now on, [druid] needs to do the damage shields, and pick some extra healing on [warrior], since I can't feed [cleric] anymore.  Also, [Ranger], you'll probably need to start healing yourself, and no more arrows for pulling.  Oh, and [wizard], I need you to keep an eye on my pet.  In fact, see if you can find an enchanter to sit with us and keep him hasted.<br>
<br>
The response to this was the ranger and warrior in groupsay, and the cleric in tells, all saying, more or less, &quot;what the hell are you doing?&quot;, and the wizard saying &quot;just kill the pet, he isn't helping anyway&quot;, to which the ranger, a friend of mine, responded &quot;[wizard], are you %&amp;$^ing crazy? That thing is outdamaging ME!&quot;  Strangely enough, 30 minutes later, the wizard was gone, and we had picked up another mage.

<br>
I have grouped with a couple of wizards that didn't seem to mind if I didn't lay down a nuke at all.  They were very happy with me just malising and doing damage shields.<br>
<br>
but Naginata is right, some people think we are nothing more than 2nd grade wizards with tanks.  Or we are that class that summons different pets instead of just the same looking one. <p><p><font color="#0000FF">Crispinskyhawke<br>

There are many people out there that have no clue about how other classes work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Heck, I've played and talked to people in their 30's that still have no clue how to play their own classes.<br>
<br>
That being said... there is merit to just being a nuke machine every once in a while <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
For example, if your mobs drop very quickly anyway maybe that DS really isn't worth it when another nuke would do more damage. Also true with multiple taunting classes or (very nice) Rogue and Warrior ping pong going on. It is simply not worth the mana to DS two people when neither take a lot of hits.<br>
<br>
Now on Mod rods... I haven't used the spell, but following similar reasoning as above, would the mana spent on the mod rod enable another nuke? Would the nuke save more damage from the tank than the cleric can heal with the mana you give with a mod rod?<br>
(killing mob faster = less hits on tank = less for cleric to heal) <br>
<br>
And arrows for pulling? Burst of fire works good in a pinch and takes a trivial amount of mana (probably recovered by the time the ranger can make it back to camp anyway) the only plus being our arrows are free (although at the levels you mentioned I sell 3or 4 dmg 150 rng arrows to high lvl rangers like they are water, even at 3-4x my cost <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What's my point in all of this? Try not to get too offended by someone who's tactics are from a different mind set <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Could be they do not speak much English, and &quot;Mage needs to nuke more&quot; is all they could translate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Of course, could be they were the typical know it all kid assuming since he grouped with a nuke nuke nuke OOM type mage and it worked before that it's the only way to be <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I've done both methods at different times. Both can be fun and most of the time both will work. Only the spawn timing, and your group's timing make the difference on which you can use <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I like being able to provide SOMETHING for everyone in the group. So a majority of the time I summon like crazy during down times and do not do too much other than &quot;/pet attack&quot; and Bolt/Shock then med through a normal fight. When ever I am in this mode, I like to occasionally nuke three times and watch the melee types whine about only getting in two hits, or the wizzy whine about his wasted third DD <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Just as a reminder to the group that I can burn with the best of 'em.<br>
<br>
On very rare occasions I'll send good old Vobartik to beat the crap out of something SOLO while the group fights a different mob. It's stupid since I loose a safety margin of the extra back up mana, but I have NEVER been told maybe I should nuke more <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Most of the time I get &quot;Why do you group? You just soloed the same MOB we've GROUPED to fight?!?&quot;.<br>
<br>
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot...<br>
<br>
I usually leave the game/camp with my summons memmed so next time I log on I can summon all the stuff I'll be giving away in a group setting/or just to be friendly (us blind folk love coldstones). This used to work great and gave me more mana in a group setting since I recovered that mana loss while looking for a group or hunting spot. Now with the new linkdeath=loss of all summoned stuff it's not so great, but still works most of the time. Most of the time now I only do food/water/band aids/stones since I know I'll need them anyway.<br>
<br>
And in final closing notes...<br>
<br>
1. In well balanced groups what exact tactics you use both ways work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
2. You're all totally correct. Sometimes know it all punk kids trying to tell you how to play when they have no clue what else you're doing (I rarely summon anything for wizzies) need to be put in their place <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
3. I spent entirely too long talking about something that really boils down to playing styles <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Another reason it might be annoying for someone to say that is because you got in a set pattern and your group is in a pattern and suddendly someone wants you to change tatics. <br>

<br>
In a normal group (1-2 tanks, me and whoever else decides to show) I will DS the puller, DS the next person who gets hit the most (takes a few pulls to realize who this is) send in my fire pet, tell the tanks to NOT taunt. and then blast it once with SoS when I think its enough to kill the mob.  This takes me a total of 1 bubble.  The tanks lose about a bubble of health and my pet is usually at 60-70%<br>
<br>
I have found this to be the best way to do things OSK (I am 45th atm)  <br>
<br>
I have never had a complaint and we constant pull. I can even usually leave off the DS for the next pull cause it will last through it on occasion.  <br>
<br>
So if a wizzie tries to tell me my job I know what I will say...  &quot;Hey wizzie why dont you use that stupendous DS you got called O'keils and I will blast more.&quot;<br>

Not trying to make anyone mad, just trying to say something to demonstrate that I'm definately aware of what Ommundan is talking about...<br>
<br>
I like to think of it this way - Druids are the utility class of the game.  They can Heal, snare, nuke, DoT, occasionally even pull.  Basically, if your group is short something, and you get a druid, chances are they can do at least a half-assed job at it<br>
<br>
Much in the same way, Mages are the utility class of the casters - we can nuke, we can tank (not directly, of course), we can make the cleric more efficient (At the cost of us doing anything else productive), we can damage shield with the best of em... We can do just about anything but heal (and if we're being the tank, we can even do that, sort of).<br>
<br>
Here's a good example - I was in a solid group in the Hole last night, we didn't go far in, but here's what we had - <br>
2 paladins, a cleric, an enchanter, a shaman, and myself.  It's situations like this where mage flexibility really makes us the keystone of a group.  Most of the time, I played the &quot;mage&quot; - damage shielding, sending the pet in to do his thing, and malising so that the pet's stuns would actually do something productive.  (when things are even to you, this really helps the tanks take less damage - your cleric will thank you!)  There were times, however, when we'd get a bad pull right after the enc finished buffing people and go oom.  Then, it became my job to go into solo mode, and kill off something quickly, so the group could concentrate it's energy elsewhere.  Another time, we pulled a yellow mudthingie (wait, that's about everything in the hole...)  and I had to play the wizzie - coordinating my nuke with the paladins' stuns, and dumping basically everything I had in an attempt to take it down, so that the cleric would have mana to let the tanks take down the other 2 things that were waiting in the wings mezzed.  <br>
<br>
The point here isn't that people who tell you you need to do something different are wrong - often times, someone will suggest something different, like letting the shaman malise so that I can toss an extra nuke around... it's when people assume that I don't know what I'm doing, and order me, not ask me, to change it.  I mean, I'm level 53.  I didn't get there by being a moron (although there are some of those around...).  Unless you soloed your entire life or bought your character on ebay, by the time you're 50+ you should have an idea of what your role(s) are in a group.  I could understand someone ordering me to change what I was doing if I was doing stupid things and getting the group in trouble... but the fact is that in the group that I mentioned in the previous post, the reason I think the wizzie wanted me to nuke more was because most fights went like this:<br>
<br>
1) Puller yells &quot;incoming&quot;<br>
2) tanks do their thing<br>
3) Debuffs/DoT's go on<br>

These tactical decisions really matter in how efficient your group can be.<br>

Funny, many people I group with think this stuff is trivial and get all angry when I explain exactly how we should do stuff but oh well. I can always solo, how about you Mr. Wizzy? Can you solo?

Which brings me to that Face vs. Fist comment. That was great! I've actually let a wizzy get beat down to near death (my plan was to let him die so he would just go away, would have been better for the group) from over nuking. I had the mana and the pet wasn't the mobs focal point so I could have pulled it if but MR. nuke nuke nuke just couldnt get it through his head to alternate with me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Do not underestimate the power of Mod Rods, this is one of the most useful spells in game.<br>
<br>
Mod rods for a cleric are nice but not vital during a high speed combat, they are more for refueling after the fight. For an enchanter, mod rods are god's gift. Basically 1 mod rod = 2 mezzes and when you are fighting in a high intensity area like the Hole or the whole of disco through to 3 spawn in Sebilis even a good enchie will go oom eventually.<br>
<br>
I've saved an entire raid at least half a dozen times by leaping over to the enchie with a mod rod in time. The paladin bodyguard that no enchie should be without then heals away.<br>
<br>
I find that many wizzies are light on the nukes in Sebilis, they don't want to over-aggro. As a mage I just burn as hard as I want (mana-efficiency permitting). Most groups in Seb will have enough taunt to keep anything off you as a nuker and the frogs rarely jump target, they tend to stick on a tank and stay there. <p>Zaniel Stormseeker<br>Elementalist of the 54th Circle</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usigloxx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sigloxx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#333333>(3/12/01 7:17:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=46.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Face vs. Fist!!!</span><hr size=1>  I never had this happen to me (guess I met only good wizzies hehe).

It was rather funny). Like : <br>
Leader : 'mana?'<br>
Druid : 'FM'<br>
Cleric : '60'<br>
me : '40'<br>

Sheesh... I'll never understand why people put so much value in mod rods.  If a cleric is doing their job, and a tank is doing their job, clerics will rarely be in a position to need them.<br>
<br>
Yeah, after massive buffing (symbol, hero, etc.) giving a cleric rods helps us get started again.  And after a rez, same thing.  But during the fastest, hardest pulling I have been in so far in a regular exp group (OS - ilis jail, D2, chef, king) it's pretty rare that a cleric is asking for these.  When things go wrong, sure that's a case too, but that's not too often.  Are they helpful?  Sure, just not needed that often.  If we didn't have them it would just mean once in a while a tiny bit more down time for medding.  Big whoop.<br>
<br>
But back to the main point.  Post-55, most people who have made it that far (and aren't eBay'd) know how to play their class.  And most people know that most people know how to play their class, and rarely if ever make suggestions.  Except to say 'hey mage, want me to do DS?' in response to me being low on mana, or 'hey cleric, I'll pick up small heals for a bit' in response to a cleric being low on mana.<br>
<br>
If someone makes a suggestion, if they have played a mage before, I'll listen to learn.  Or if it's a general group tactic change, then I really want to listen so I can learn, especially if it's in an area where I haven't been before.  But if it's just ignorance, then it's silly and I just ignore it, perhaps saying 'thank you for the advice' or something else non-committal.<br>

I agree with Zaniel 100%. I have saved 18+ people no less than a dozen times with a well timed mod rod hand off to a chanter. Even the best chanters will go OOM in certain areas of the Hole/Sebilis/Chardok/Dragon Necro. I remember one time we were stuck just outside the main keep in the Hole down in the steep valley trying to hold it together while revenant after revenant poured down us. The only thing that kept us alive was the chanter, and the only thing that kept him going was mod rods. It was a rush, and a great feeling <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

As a 26 Mage now, I used to and still is grouping in HK with the others.  Usually in the guard room.  Believe it or not, I'm actually quite enjoy to be chase by the mob.  Why?  Because it means that we are able to deal out DMG more then the other classes.  <br>
<br>
How I did it?  First of course, have my pet out, buff it, fire shield it.  Charge the pet into melee, then cast the rain set of the spell, this will last three ticks, on the second hit I'll hit with the most powerful blade spell and finally round up with the most powerful bolt spell.  After this, unless you are grouping with someone higher level then you, otherwise I guarrantee the mob will be after your ass!<br>
