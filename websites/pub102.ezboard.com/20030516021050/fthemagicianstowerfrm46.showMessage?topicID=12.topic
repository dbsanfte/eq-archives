<br>
by far the most universally fretted over potential &quot;feature&quot; of  pop is...<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      1) pointless time sinks.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      &quot;oh i just got 60 i dont want to have to get 65 now!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      &quot;i dont want new pets, it took me so long to get my epic!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
ect<br>
<br>
even though this is an important topic, i dont think it at all should be what we spend the bulk of our pop-related discussion on.<br>
1.1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      all new content is not a time sink</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. this is a distinction alot of people fail to make. in its pure form, new content is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      good</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, new content is what keeps us playing. only when the new content is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      bad</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (unenjoyable and feels pointless) can it be called a time sink. assuming the new content is not presented as time sinks, it should be welcomed.<br>
1.2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      developers have clearly and publicly stated that the new expansion will try to avoid pointless timesinks.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
this means pop wont have luclin key quests, the 51-60 level progression system, marathon end game encounters, ect. why then <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      rehash</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a topic on our mb that the developers are already aware of and trying to avoid?<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
after time sinks, players are most concerned about...<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      2) player vs environmental imbalances</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      &quot;level 65 people will 1 group ntov!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
2.1)<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      new content will be created to challenge the players new found power</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. there was a time the ghoul lord in lguk was a multi group raid -- now he can be soloed. that didnt break the game, did it? <br>
<br>
everything is relative, remember that. i know people form emotional attatchments to their environments and tend to lose perspective, its only natural. but try to realize that you only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      think</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> vex thal is &quot;end game&quot;, because youre not aware of anything yet which will be more challenging. <br>
so you see, if people 1 group ntov in pop it <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      wont matter at all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, because undoubtedly there will be new end game content for these new powerful players. <br>
<br>
2.2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      you can only add so much power to players till you have to raise the level cap</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. levels arent like other forms of character advancement, like aaxp and gear aquisition. <br>
levels are just what the litteral word means:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      lev·el (lvl)<br>
n. <br>
Relative position or rank on a scale</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
in everquest, obtaining a new level is like a right of passage. only through a level can you have access to something you could NOT on a lower level (be it zones or spells, or abilities).<br>
<br>
levels are an unambiguous indicator of relative power in the game. (i.e. thats a 1-10 zone, thats a 60-65 zone). if they dont keep making new level caps, they might as well change the name of the game. <br>
so i ask those of you opposed to new level caps, if there arent new levels, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      where will the distinction be made between seasoned players and newer players</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> in an ever changing world? <br>
how will you differentiate between<br>
the level 60 with 200 aa and gear from pop... <br>
the level 60 with 100 aa and gear from luclin... <br>
the level 60 with 50 aa and various pieces of velious gear... and the level 60 with no aa who <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      just dinged</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? <br>
only through raised level caps and coresponding new environments can this distinction truely be made. raising level caps <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      has</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to be done, its the only way to keep the game balanced.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
so, now. if you read this far you are probably wondering what i think we should be discussing at this point.<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      3) we should be worrying about verant using the new expansion as a vehical for nerfing OUR CLASS!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--><br>
<br>
3.1) first you need to truely understand why verant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      needs</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to raise the level cap. quite simply, and i know alot of you are going to disagree, but level 60s <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      are not</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> balanced vs their environment. <br>
<br>
now, thats a broad statement with alot of grey areas. in some cases that statement is false, others true. <br>
a new level 60 with no aa and only kunark gear/spells <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>      is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> balanced fighting dark blues and raid mobs in kunark.<br>
a seasoned level 60 with 200 aa and full pop gear is NOT balanced fighting (soloing?) dark blues and raid mobs in kunark.<br>
<br>
its obvious verant is aware of and trying to rectify this problem. their most recent excersize in &quot;fixing&quot; it can be observed in the exp changes; basically they tried to make dark blues light blue and even cons dark blue. this of course was a complete failure since it was totally biased and unfair against TRUE L60s. they quickly fixed their &quot;fix&quot;.<br>
<br>
just days after the massive failure that was the exp code change, they introduce the plan to raise the level cap in pop. <br>
they realize this can only be fixed by rebalancing those uber level 60s through new levels and new environments.<br>
<br>
by raising the level cap, those dedicated level 60s with 200 aa and full pop gear will be level 65s with 200 aa and full pop gear. those trivial mobs they are soloing, will be light blue (like they SHOULD con). <br>
<br>
you might be thinking &quot;why does the level 60 necessarily become a 65? cant they just stay 60 and still enjoy the benefits of playing in an underpowered environment?&quot;<br>
simple. the benefits which will be obtained by increasing his level, by far will outweigh the benefits of staying 60. a 60 doesnt have the same skill caps, resist bonuses, or access to zones and mobs that a 65 does. all applicable intelligent players will opt to increase level.<br>
<br>
3.2) now you may be wondering &quot;ok, but still, why should i worry about my classes relative power in a post 60 game?&quot;<br>
<br>
why? <br>
raising the level cap is a rare opportunity for verant to patch up everything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   they view</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as &quot;wrong&quot;. it is usually chosen to be done in times of gross imbalance (i.e. when the game was young and melee classes were almost completely worthless, or now when level 60s are just trampling over everything in sight due to new found power from aa and equipment).<br>
<br>
when verant raises the level cap and adds corresponding content, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      they are in effect totally redesigning the game and classes, and their relative power to each other as they see fit</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
now i want you to chew on those words... &quot;as they see fit&quot;. we really DONT KNOW what they think needs to be done for the mage class.<br>
<br>
does verant think mages are overpowered?<br>
do they think we are underpowered?<br>
do they think we are balanced?<br>
<br>
like i said, we really <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      dont know</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what they think about us, and we really should be concerned about that. we can speculate though i suppose. i mean weve been given upgrades so that must mean they think (thought) we were underpowered to a degree... but how accurate is speculation? for all we know, they lament the upgrades they gave us and will nerf us in pop.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>      this is something we NEED to be talking about before its too late.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
better to talk about this now while the vehical for communication is still THERE, than later when pop is on the shelves. <br>
just imagine a new copy of pop complete with new mage nukes with a ratio of 3.5, while druids have nukes with ratios of 5 and wizards 6.<br>
or, new pets with a dps of 70 while rogues have dps of 230 and monks 200.<br>
<br>
better to express our concerns now, rather than go through the anguish of another rebalancing later.<br>

<br>
It is fairly evident that the only 60ish mages that will be left are the 100 - 200 that seem to post on this board id this expansion leaves us in the dust the way RoK did.<br>
<br>
Noonie, your frequent desperate posts here about mage DPS being so high and mages being the master class my convince you, a few others, and the VI/SoE folks that come here and read them.<br>
<br>
My findings are that the &quot;normal&quot; every day level 60 mage is not in the top 2%.  We do not have access to all the fancy regen equipment.  We cannot use Mod Rod 2 to keep our mana pool alive and we don't have maxed FT.  We don't all have Boots of Bladecaling.<br>
<br>
I will agree with you.. there are a happy few but the vast majority are unhappy and do not and never will have access to what the &quot;happy few&quot; do have access to.  <br>
<br>
You can argue that this is the situation all classes are in .. sure you can.. but most if not all other classes outside of int casters have a ton more gear to help them.  The difference between a modestly equipped Warrior and an uber warrior is far less then a modestly equipped Mage and an uber mage.<br>
<br>
All of the &quot;uber&quot; mages have all of the same equipment without the boots of bladecalling or the staff from cdok you don't have any mana free damage nukes, Wihout the rune casting items avaiable and regen items avaliable your ability to use Mod Rod 2 to regen mana is very limited.<br>
<br>
My point is very few mages are indeed amoung the best damage dealers or able to solo very well.<br>
<br>
The items you have recieved have blinded you to the actual provety of the class.<br>
<br>
Simple as that.<br>
<br>
I do honestly admire your efforts at making us look great even though they will sadly end up getting us nerfed.<br>
<br>

Any mage who can gather 14k can get the burnt wood staff. (It is exceedingly rare drop, but they do enter the marketplace, one wa son salw other day in bazaar for instance)<br>
Blazing Sceptre drops off Rhaag 2, not an uber mob. (Competition for him is much higher than his difficulty)<br>
Velketor is tough to a tier 3 guild, not tier 2 or 1. I've SEEN folk doing Velk raids and letting lucky mages in zone come grab boots cause they had no mages or their mages already had.<br>
Itrear Vius drops Iceshatter, tier 2 guilds can do him.<br>
<br>
FT, well PTOC earring ANYONE can do.  Boots from CT are sold, 7th and 8th shawl are questable an dont take that much guild effort to do 8th.<br>
And theres a lot of Tier 2 capable mobs who drop FT.<br>
<br>
Zlandikars heart is dropped EVERY zland kill, so its a sold item.<br>
<br>
If you are on a new server, or one with odd setup, you may, atlvl 60, have problems getting those things. Otherwise you will NOT.<br>
I dont know how you play the game Rthen on your server, but lvl 60s bloody well DO see gear like that drop and GET it.<br>
&quot;Who all lvl 60 magician&quot; on Karana goves too many to list most nights.<br>
<br>
AA skill Regen and Phantasmal amrour give regen by way, ANY mage can use rods for mana and regen it.<br>
<br>
A moderate warrior couldnt tank an ubermob cause they wouldnt have the HP, taunt items and AC to do so.<br>
<br>
Again: IF YOU HAVE THE SKILL, TIME AND PERSONABILITY YOU CAN  GET GEAT GEAR. Better you are at those 3 things, more chances you have.<br>
Non guilded mages can make a pile tradeskilling/farming and buy gear, and hunt for pickup and sign up raids.<br>
Most guidls worth their salt actively recruit mages and treat them well.<br>
Peopel LIKE folk who are fun to play with and dont whine their bloody heads off cause they havent got a pet that can DT. <br>

<br>
I dont feel I need more upgrades, I am having fun and I want people to know that I am happy with my class... Im not gonna go around saying I suck and my class is broken when I actually feel very powerful.<br>
<br>
Another thing, why do people think that verant are stupid? I think they are smart. Of course they know what the mod rod do, they are playing the game, and lots and lots of mages use that trick. Its not like they dont know about anything, and we should not tell em. Reason they mess up all the time is because there is so DAMN many things to take into consideration over the smallest change.

Level 56 with Regen3 and Phantom Armor = 14hp/tic. <br>
Level 56 unbuffed, no regen = 6hp/tic i believe.<br>
<br>
Phantom Armor is a level 52 store-bought spell that adds 5hp/tic regen. Takes 4 Cats Eyes as a reagent.<br>
<br>
Regen3 is a General Type AA ability that adds 3 hp/tic regen. It's fairly easy to get, you just need to dedicate time for the 3 AA points.<br>

As mobs scale over level 60 pet damage drastically decreases, especially as they hit the break point around level 62 when the pets stop casting on them.  This in effect takes away 30 to 50 percent of our damage and in some cases will take away the vast majority of any damage that we contribute to a raid (if we are say making rods or cohing while fighting).<br>
<br>
Now I see they have put 4 pets in which I hope are stronger than the epic (perhaps targetted with bane damage towards certain planes).  However this introduces it's own problems because these pets will likely be too powerful for anything pre pop so they will have to be restricted to use in PoP only and unless all PoP spells are restricted to use in PoP only that means that mages will be suffering a significant disadvantage compared to other classes when it comes to transfering PoP gained power into the older world.b <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90022>Xoran</a href>

<br>
Yes that's the point why we need new lvls.<br>
<br>
with all the new toys ancient spells etc the mage with all this stuff aa etc is very different against one without.<br>
<br>
A 'normal' magician con solo very nice without epic and gain his aa exp a bit slow but he can go on.<br>
<br>
an 'epic' mage now can kill faster than the normal mage only with one spell that's right but :<br>
<br>
when it come to an 'uber' mage (I hate this word) the game is totaly unbalanced now I agree.<br>
<br>
I will explain : a 'normal' lvl 60 group was doing some exp in FG beside the camp I do !<br>
In my camp was 9 shrooms and 4 lotus only buff without selfbuffs I had was kei.<br>
<br>
I kill all before respawn cause I need 3 points to finish natural durability this day (I get those 3 points in 8 hours this day)<br>
<br>
after a while the group beside me start pulling from the camp I solo (happens cause I don't kill all shrooms in the same time often I was FM an nuke them down for fun so sometimes they respawn faster) <br>
I asked in a friendly way to stop that and get a laugh : 'haha you cannot kill the whole camp and those 4 lotus we'r a full group and will pull what we can.'<br>
<br>
Ok np they had 4 shrooms in their camp left : I summon some armor for mz pet load both pet heals buffed it with ancient burnout put on buffs and send pet in the camp : all 4 shrooms for sure jump on my pet. I used a lvl 1 nuke to make sure to get exp from all 4 and start healing and rodding with soa.<br>
After the 4 shrooms were dead I go back to my camp and start pulling again and had 50 mana left.<br>
<br>
They never touched my camp this day again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have soloed as needed every level from first to well beyond sixtieth.  Fact is a level 50 mage can solo for experience naked except for a stack of malachite.  Mages are the least dependent on dropped items of any class in the game.  Magicians are the least mana bound of any caster as well, limited only by malachite.  Mage AA skills, while they may not look good on paper, have a functional synergy that amplifies their apparent power, and AA can be had by anyone willing to put in the hours.  I can loot my corpse, be fully selfed buffed, and at full mana before rez effects are gone, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (with only one FT1 item)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

Melee classes are far more dependent on gear than casters ever could be, by design.

Equipment matters <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>less</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to mages than any other class.<br>
<br>
But back to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Noonie</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s original point:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> raising the level cap is a rare opportunity for verant to patch up everything they view as &quot;wrong&quot;....when verant raises the level cap and adds corresponding content, they are in effect totally redesigning the game and classes, and their relative power to each other as they see fit.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is the heart of the matter.

At this point, I don't think that we have enough to go on to come to any conclusions about how PoP will affect the class overall.  We know that player levels are going up and that we're getting new pets, but we need a lot more information before we can tell if this will be a positive or a negative change for the class overall.  <br>
<br>
I agree with Noonie that it would be a great to discuss how the changes will affect us while the expansion is still being finalized, but we're not getting enough info on specifics to allow us to do this.  VI is deliberately keeping things secret to &quot;surprise&quot; us when the expansion is released, so I think we have no choice but to wait for the box to hit the shelves before we can really discuss how PoP affects us overall.<br>
<br>
I think that a lot of the anxiety about this expansion among magicians has to do with what happened with Kunark.  We tend to have bad associations with level cap increases.  About all that we can do at this point, however, is just wait to see what happens and hope that we don't get the shaft again.<br>

If they can achieve that, and scale our nukes close to druid nukes, I'll be happy.<br>
<br>
That being said, have to quote rthen now:<br>
<br>
***<br>
Noonie, your frequent desperate posts here about mage DPS being so high and mages being the master class my convince you, a few others, and the VI/SoE folks that come here and read them.<br>
***<br>
<br>
....<br>
what class do you play? between pets, nukes/rains and damage sheild, not many classes can keep up with a mage's damage in solo or xp group situation. Heck, a NAKED mage can sustain a very good DPS. Noonie didn't fake those parse and DPS calculation, it's the simple truth. A WELL PLAYED mage with a BRAIN and good social skill is a mean damage machine. Did you notice how Noonie was pretty much chain rodding while getting healed? Did you even pay attention to that? Mages are a mean damage class and you don't need uber gear to do so, the fact that you still haven't figured that one out is your problem, not the class's.<br>
<br>
***<br>
You can argue that this is the situation all classes are in .. sure you can.. but most if not all other classes outside of int casters have a ton more gear to help them. The difference between a modestly equipped Warrior and an uber warrior is far less then a modestly equipped Mage and an uber mage.<br>
***<br>
<br>
That is one absurd statement if I ever saw one. Balanz stated it more eloquently than I ever could: &quot;Melee classes are far more dependent on gear than casters ever could be, by design. &quot; The exact opposite of what you said Rthen is actualy the REAL thing. Read carefully, gonna type slow to make sure you understand. The difference between a modestly equipped mage and an uber mage is far less than a modestly equipped warrior and an uber warrior. Naked I'm at about 60-70% of my power. A modestly equiped mage is prolly around 80% of my power. A naked warrior is what, 5% of an uber war? A modestly equipped war is what? 30-40% at best?<br>

That's the real picture, ask anyone with a clue, they will agree. Tanks are way way way more dependent on armor than casters. It DID change a bit with luclin and now there's actualy items that improve a caster. Before FT/effects/focus items, equip basicly meant nothing at all (almost) to a caster. But it still makes a much bigger impact on tanks than on casters, and by far, very very far.<br>

All of the &quot;uber&quot; mages have all of the same equipment without the boots of bladecalling or the staff from cdok you don't have any mana free damage nukes, Wihout the rune casting items avaiable and regen items avaliable your ability to use Mod Rod 2 to regen mana is very limited.<br>
***<br>
<br>
Unless you are soloing, in no way do you need right-click nukes or rune items to be efficient (both of wich are easily attainable by normal, low end guilds btw. IV, velk, THO, rhag2 are NOT, by any means, &quot;uber&quot;, if fact main reason I don't have scepter, iceshatter or tho orb is those mob are too low for my guild to bother with =p). If you want to push your DPS and rodding abilities, group with &quot;ONE&quot; healer, just one, and you'll see that even with your curent gear, you can get very very close to the &quot;uber&quot; noonie DPS (/chuckle).<br>

My point is very few mages are indeed amoung the best damage dealers or able to solo very well.<br>

False, a NAKED, well played mage is still one of the best damage dealers in game. A NAKED, well played mage is still a very decent soloer. Gimme a handfull of malachite and i'll show ya.  <p><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</A>&nbsp<A href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&ltTDE&gt</A><BR>

<br>
Omega, a naked magician soloing is proof positive that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> gear makes almost no difference in the world to a magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Gear makes us more effective, but as our power lay in our spells (and a heck of a lot of power, at that, if I can just up and solo xps giving mobs with a fistfull of malachite), it's our spells that are infinately more important to us than our next BP upgrade, something Warriors can most certainly not match.<br>
<br>
As for Noonie, I wouldn't even know where to begin to debate that mess. I guess the simple point is, you feel that Verant is intending on nerfing the magician class by giving us higher powered nukes (but apparently not high enough), bigger and badder pets (AA and normal), the ability to store a fully geared pet while on the move/zoning/succoring/being CotH'd (and hell, if it lasts over logouts, the single most mana efficient spell ever in the game for damage output), amungst other things.. it just isn't enough?<br>
<br>
I guess I just don't get it. Back to that whole &quot;Too much whining, not enough real details&quot; to move me. <p><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886"><IMG SRC="http://www.ninjacorp.com/Rhasin_sig.jpg"></A></CENTER></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showPrevMessage?topicID=12.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showNextMessage?topicID=12.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=12.topic&index=19><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.threadControl?topicID=12.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=12.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46>Planes of Power</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
