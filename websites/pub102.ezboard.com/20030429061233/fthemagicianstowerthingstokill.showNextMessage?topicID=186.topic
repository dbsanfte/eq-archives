<br>
When I first started hunting them at level 31 I would bind in Oasis, take the raft to TD and then swim.  I did this basically because I didn't want to take the boat to BB then another to FV and back.  The problem I found was that when I was killed (didn't happen often, but it did happen) I would have a LONG swim back.  Binding in FV is much easier as you just gate back to FV to the bank (you WILL need to do this) and it's a quick boat ride back.  You can also find a port to most places you need to go rather quickly from FV.  <br>
<br>
I also used a couple of different pets while hunting there.  I am a big proponent of the earth pet because I have always liked the root aspect.  I started out using the earth pet and would pull one with malise, send pet, then nuke till it was dead.  Malise really helped root take effect.  At 31-33 I would have to med in between each pull, but I could still occupy 3 spawn points because of the slower spawn time.  I would usually take the one in the wrecked ship, the one on the igloo on the hill top next to the boat, and the one right on the shore.  Since they don't wander you are never in danger while medding.<br>
<br>
After I hit 34 I continued to use the earth pet and would kill one maybe two then med to full again.  Once I hit 35 I learned that the fire pet is MUCH better.  I could occupy 4 spawns without medding to full.  I would pull one with shock of flame then send in pet when it got to where pet was.  I used the low level spell because it wouldn't over-aggro the golra and when I sent in pet it would stick on pet.  Once pet was on it, I would sit and med and just monitor the pet health with /pet report health hotkeyed.  Once the golra got down to about 1/2  or a little lower I would throw a cinder bolt in there and the golra is usually dead or starts to walk away.  If it walks away, either let pet kill it or use another shock of flame or shock of spikes to finish it.  No need wasting mana on an unneeded power spell.  You can also throw a renew summon in there if you need.  It doesn't take up much mana and helps alot.  Once the first was dead I usually only used up a bubble of mana and my pet is anywhere from 65-75% of health.  Throw another renew summon in there if you wish then go to the next golra and repeat.  I can almost always take out 4 without having to sit and med for any length of time.  Once you get through your occupied spawns I always have enough time to med to full before starting over.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 36 you find some that don't give you much exp, but after hell level 36 will look as though it's flying by.  At 37 I would leave as there are too many that don't give exp.  Also be aware that when I started hunting there (finished level 36 last night) it was a reletivly unknown place.  Now it seems to be getting more crowded.<br>
<br>
Also, remember that your level 16, 24 DD spells are not useless anymore and can be very mana effecient for finishing off kills.  Phantom Chain will help your regen if you do get hit so keep it up.  Renew summon really helps keep your pet alive and in the case of a fire pet can be very mana efficient.  <br>
<br>
I hope I haven't rambled too much and that you kind of get the jist of what my strategy was.   <p>Ishap Darkfire

I am amazed how easy these guys are and uncamped.  Do NOT bind at the dock in Oasis, if you gate or get killed there is a GOOD chance a spectre or SG will be at the dock.  Instead, bind on the pillar in Oasis, I have never been attacked there.  Summon a waterstone and start swimming.  Make sure when you approach the Iceberg to invis yourself.  Find a spot and climb up.  Now find the spot that has a ruined boat with a golra in it and set up camp near there.  get your FIRE pet up, trust me.  Pull with Malise, send pet, nuke 2 times only.  They drop really fast against fire pets. I would spend maybe a bubble of mana per golra, med while pet healed, and moved on to the next spawn.  There are 7 golras on one side of the iceberg that you can rotate on.  From 29-33 you won't be able to kill them all and be FM when they start repopping.  I think I was killing 5 then medding and killing the same 5 again.  At 34-37 you are often times waiting at FM.  Spawn time is eight minutes I believe.  If you play your cards right you will never have to gate and will never die here.  Only tme I left was at 34 when I went to buy spells, and of course when I hit 37 when 80% of them were green.  This is a pretty boring spot but you can't beat the safety/Xp.  These guys are major wimps too, don't be afraid to step in and whack them yourself with whatever weapon you have.  Only thing that will mess this plan up is to log on and find a lvl 20 monk being PLed off of these guys. When you hit 37, go ahead and go to OT to solo or even better group till 39.  After that, go to Dreadlands and solo the yeti caves till 44, same strategy as Golras and there are also 7 spawns in the cave(s) with an occasional roamer.  Good thing is the XP is just as good as the golras and they aren't camped that much either.  Now if I could just find another spot with multiple static spawns....guess I'll have to go swimming in Lake of Ill Omen and pray Bloodgills aren't camped. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugalaran.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galaran</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(4/26/01 11:19:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=174.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Golra</span><hr size=1> You can do the Tundra Yeti up until about 45 to 46 or so.

The boat that goes from FV to Butchblock goes RIGHT by the iceberg, and you can swim there, after jumping off the boat, in about 15 seconds. This also helps if you happen to die, which is possible before your 34 spells. <p>Balthemal says: "Save me, Jboots, save me!"</p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showPrevMessage?topicID=174.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showNextMessage?topicID=174.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=174.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.threadControl?topicID=174.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=174.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=174.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill>The Hunt</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table>  <br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.238<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
