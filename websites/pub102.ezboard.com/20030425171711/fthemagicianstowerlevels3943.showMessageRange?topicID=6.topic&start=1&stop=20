Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> At 39, I'd reccomend going to a Yeti cave in Dreadlands.  I didn't find it till I was almost out of 40, but there's no reason why it's not doable at 39, with a good pet.  There are three caves - one with Tundra yetis, one with Glacier yetis, and one with a mix of both - make sure you're at the one with the Tundra yetis until 44 or unless you have a partner.  Even at 44, with just fire pet, Glaciers are a TOUGH fight.  I've only lost once against them in about 7 hours there, but I ended every fight very low on HPs.  Anyway, here's the lowdown on the Tundra Cave:<br>
<br>
At 39-40:  Set up camp at the first &quot;bend&quot; in the cave.  The cave consists of several hallways with turns all greater than 90 degrees.  The tricky part is finding a good spot and pulling to it.  This is made trickier by the fact that the Yetis and your pet will walk through the walls of the cave.  If the pet goes into a wall, immediately tell him to follow you, or, after the fight, you could lose him forever.  To pull, go into the cave, spot a yeti, then double back around the most recent bend.  From there, cast your favorite nuke or Malise if you like (I didn't really need it much).  Then run like hell back to the other end of the hallway from your pet.  Start nuking like heck.  When he finally gets on you, run toward your pet, keep running back and forth along the hallway until the pet strips it off.  &lt;insert favorite kill tactics here&gt;<br>
<br>
41-42:  Sit in the first bend outside the room at the end of the yeti tunnel.  Pull directly out of the room, but do NOT fight in the room.  You can pull singles with spells, but as soon as your pet gets into that room, they will all jump on him.  I'd fight in the &quot;second&quot; hallway out of the room (exit room, leave pet at first bend, use the hallway past that as your strip/nuke zone)<br>
<br>
43-44?<br>
If your int is above 175 or so, sit in the room.  You'll have to do a little bit of tanking here to conserve mana, but it IS possible to solo all 5 spawns.  Here's a little tip - some Yeti's will appear and wander out.  If something appears, unless you know another one will spawn soon, you can just let it be.  It may (especially in the &quot;front&quot; 3 spwans) wander out.  If it does, it will be back in 4 minutes or so, plenty of time to med up, and even off one of his bretheren.  I'm not sure what XP is like here, but I'd continue using the 39 earth pet, unless you're a lucky &amp;*@#%$&amp; and already have 44 earth.  At 44, you can move to one of the other caves, but be careful!!<br>
<br>
A WARNING:  Occasionally (happend thrice in 5 days for me), something else will spawn in the back room.  Don't attack it!! It is tougher than the yetis there.  Let me repeat, DO NOT ATTACK IT!!!!  It will naturally wander out to it's own area.  To prevent being jumped by these extras, and the Yetis when they spawn, I'd reccomend you sit to the right of the door, about 70 degrees around the room.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you... and if you fail, try again.  This place got me from 40 to 44 in 5 days. <p><a href="mailto:naginata@magecompendium.com">Naginata Kuroshio, Master of the Elements</a><BR>

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> Yeti are great.  I first read about this post when I was 38 and leveled there from 39-43.  Just make a right from the main ice cave past the teleport area, follow the wall until you hit the tundra yeti caves.  Exp is good with loot ranging from 4PP a drop to jewlery and flowers that sell for 1PP and 6 gold each.  Also a few research items.<br>
<br>
Not boring as other spawn camps either.  There always seems to be a wander the shows up when you low on mana, or a level 40 spider or wolffie wanders past.  Even with a 200 int and focus items there always seems to be a spawn ready when I would mana up.<br>
<br>
After I hit 44 I plan to visit Sol B to get the rest of my research items for the other three pets, then I will try the Glacier Yeti.<br>

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> I just made 40th here and wanted to add a few things.<br>
<br>
For starters.  What I used.  Focused 40 dmg hitting Fire pet with 2 Rune Swords.  Malise.  Blaze.  Renew Summoning.  Gate.  And make sure to always keep your buffs up as your going to get hit a few times even if your careful.  Nothing to worry about though.<br>
<br>
If you pull with spells you don't seem to aggro any extras.  The Yetis have a extremely small aggro range, so you should just make sure the way behind you is clear and then pull with Malise.  Now, just let your pet build up a few seconds of taunt and then chain nuke two Blazes into the yeti.  If they both hit for full or near full damage the yeti should turn to run.  Just make sure it doesn't run into any other Yetis and you'll be fine.<br>
<br>
BAMM.!!!  You just made some of the easiest experience your going to find at this level.  Now med up that bubble or two that you just used while your pet waits patiently for you to catch up.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Now just start spacing out the spawns a few minutes or more apart between your kills using the same tatics.<br>
<br>
Using these tatics I was able to take and control the room that is straight in.  Just make sure not to use more than 2 Nukes unless you must.  Otherwise you risk the possibility of a wanderer popping and not being able to take him.  If your nukes hit for quite a bit but it looks like your pet might die, just give him a heal and step in for a few hits.<br>
<br>
Easiest experience I've gotten since I did the Golras in Timorous Deep.  I went from a pixel into 39th to 40th in about 5 hours.  This was sharing the cave over with a druid though, so if you had both caves you could possibly go quicker. <p><a href=mailto:Zaknafinis@Hotmail.com>Zaknafinis Convoquer (Shining Alliance)</a><BR>Magician of the 40th level<BR>Prexus</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanamarinfernostorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanamar Infernostorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(9/25/00 3:07:15 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yetis.

Yetis, Yetis, Yetis</span><hr size=1> Just a update to my last post here.  <br>
<br>
I went back there tonight for a little bit and found that with a little care you can easily own the entire cave.  That is all 7 static spawns plus the 2 or 3 that wander.  I left soon after though as I was asked to join a guild group in Karnors and it was pretty boring controlling the entire place.<br>
<br>
If you want some nice easy exp while you read or something like that though, this is the place.  You'll make quite decent money (150pp+ in 5 hours) and have plenty of time between spawns to do other things.<br>
<br>
BTW, I had heard horror stories about 40th level.  I now know why they are told.  lol.  I killed 12 of the yetis just to see the same movement that 1 did at 39th.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a href=mailto:Zaknafinis@Hotmail.com>Zaknafinis Convoquer (Shining Alliance)</a><BR>Magician of the 40th level<BR>Prexus</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unanamarinfernostorm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nanamar Infernostorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(9/29/00 4:48:20 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yetis.

The highest level ones who hit for 78 damage are level 35 but once you get the hang of them they're doable solo with 40% mana left over even at 35.  I'd highly recommend this spot.  The first time I went to sell I had 40 of the Frosty Datura flowers and was shocked to see them go for 1 pp 6g each.  This is one of the easiest spots to level for a long time.  The lowest Yeti's are around 31 and highest 35.  Anyway I just thought I'd encourage some lower people to take advantage of this great hunting spot.  Its good long before 39.<br>

Just for clarification...<br>

Now part way through 41.  A couple of points:<br>
<br>
1. You do not necessarity have to pull right back into the tunnel.  Stand just inside the tunnel and cast.  As the yeti reaches the tunnel entrance send in the pet.  You can actually send the pet into the cave to attack the yeti but if the victim starts to wander a second may join in.<br>
2. Keep phantom chain up.<br>
3. Malise is a waste of mana since there is rarely a resist to blaze or shock-of-swords.<br>
4. If you can kill the yetis in the cave, you can kill the wanderer.  It may be a bit tougher but not by much (sometimes the statics are also tougher than usual).<br>
5. Since the megapatch there seem to be more wanderers.  My only death in the cave was when I was attacked by 2 wanderers as I was killing the single spawn static.<br>
6. If you only burn once, pet will get half the exp.  You need at least 2x blaze + 1x shock to get full mana.  It is your call whether you want to med more for the extra exp.<br>
7.  If you can get 2 mages together, this place rocks.  Slaughter everything inside then go outside for a couple of drolvargs/drachnids/giants/chickens/wandering yetis while you wait for the cave to repopulate.<br>
8. Don't throw away the flowers.  They are worth 1pp+ at vendors (I've found no other use for them).<br>
<br>
Good hunting. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubouya.showPublicProfile?language=EN>bouya</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(12/11/00 2:58:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://bouya.nexen.net/membres/tibouya.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Tundra yeti cave</span><hr size=1> I made 38 to 44 in the n°1 cave in dreadlands, some yetis are greens at 43, and more at 44.<br>

<br>
I thought I would relay my experiences in the Yeti caves.  First off, I spent most of my time in Cave #1 as denoted above.  There was only one time where that cave was camped and I moved to cave #9.  Cave #7 was off limits because the glacier yetis were too hard to kill.<br>
<br>
Cave 1<br>
<br>
There are a total of 7 static spawns with a single spawn at the crossroads and 3 spawns in the two rooms at the end of the caves.  The spawn time for the static spawns is 20 mins.  <br>
<br>
There is also a wandering spawn which will pop in either of two different spots: at the crossroads or at the mouth of one of the rooms.  Depending on which wanderer spawns, the mob path is a little different. One pop will wander into one room and the other pop will wander into the other.  Regardless, the wanderer will go past the crossroads and walk into the wall.  The spawn time for the wanderer is 16 mins.<br>
<br>
When I come to the caves initially, I would kill the wanderer and then start the stop watch.  I would then proceed to kill the crossroads mob, and then setup in the hallway near one of the rooms.  I would pull the center MOB with Malise and kill it.  I would then move to the mouth of the room.  Med up, sick pet on one of the corner mobs and then repeat for the other corner.  I never had a problem with aggroing another Yeti even when I was fighting next to them.  These guys are indeed related to the skulking brutes near Dalnir.<br>
<br>
There was two interesting things that happened.  First, for some reason, after a couple days, the wandering mobs stopped appearing.  Then last week's patch came and the wanderers came back.  Once again, a few days after the patch, the wanderes were gone again.  Maybe there is a bug where the mobs stop poping if they are not killed in a certain time. I dunno.  Second interesting thing was something that reminded me of the skulking brutes yet again.  One time during the 5 levels, a nasty drolvarg dropped through the ceiling to party with my pet.  I was lucky in that I was about to begin dancing with a yeti so I had time to tango.<br>
<br>
Cave 2<br>
<br>
I only spent one good excursion here.  There are four static spawns on a 20 min timer and two wandering spawns on a 16 min timer.  After I initially cleared the wandering MOBs (once again starting the stopwatch with the death of the first one), I setup at cave mouth and pull singly the four spawns inside the room.<br>
<br>
Overall, the yeti caves were excellent experience and a very quick way to 44 from 39.  I actually wish I came here earlier since levels 35-39 have been the toughest in my leveling.<br>

One thing I forgot to add:<br>
<br>
The mobs drop Essence of Winter which is needed for Barbarian smithing.  Barb smithers in my guild were pleasantly surprised by this since they originally thought the essence of winter only dropped off the ice giants in Everfrost.  Now, my guild is pretty young (I am only the second char over 40) so this might be well known.<br>

I started off in cave#1.  I mostly used the water pet, mostly because the fast regen cuts down time and having a healthy pet helps with the wanderers should they come.  You can pull singles, but only if you use a spell.  If you send in the pet, its possible to aggro the others.  I generally let my pet do about 50% damage before I started nuking.  I almost never was hit this way.  The level 39 pet will take a pretty good amount of damage, but as long as you don't overcook them you should be fine.<br>
<br>
I camped the Tundra Yetis in cave#1 from levels 41 to 45.  At 44 and 45, about 35% of them are green and the level 44 pet tears through them very efficiently.  At 46 I went to the Glacier Yeti cave.  They max hit for about 93 damage.  They can be pulled the same way the Tundra Yetis can, but there is a lot more down time associated with them.  At level 46 I get about 1/2 a blue bubble per kill.  When I get low mana in the Glacier Yeti cave, I usually go outside and have my pet pick on the low blue spawns that wander by while I med up.  <br>
<br>
While I was getting insane xp solo, It became really boring.  I usually partner up with a druid.  It lowers downtime and maintains my sanity.  <br>
