Beside the hitpoint factor, it was getting to the point where you were better off with a monk MT on uber boss (or groups) than warriors, monks mitigated at about the same level with ac soft cap and high AC all all items that monk can use, but they avoided much better, it really was on the line that would make warrior obsolete. If warriors are not the best tanks, they have no use. Monk are puller and damage dealers in EQ. With exception of a very few places, they are unchallenged in these categories so they still have their role. And monks can still tank, I see it everyday, just not as well or better than warrior now.<br>
<br>
As for this change, I really hope it will also affect knights, because they need it as well. Right now no knight in his right mind would use 1hs/sheild combo over 2hs, unless they are tanking, then they get the benefit of 1 more stat slot and lose the higher damage they would deal with a 2hs. This is not a very good benefit. =p <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&lt;TDE&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

Even Sony have said that it didn't do what they wanted it to do... yet done nothing to fix the mess they created.<br>
<br>
Monks avoid damage better, but compared to a similarly-equipped warrior they'll still die faster because they have less hit points (and hence CHeals are even less effective). They can't taunt, and they don't get defensive disciplines. As a main tank on an uber mob, they really sucked even before the nerf... as a secondary tank for normal XP groups they were able to do a very decent job. Now, unless you're a twink with a fungi and other uber gear, they're not.<br>
<br>
As for warriors being the best tanks, the fact is, they aren't, except for uber mobs where their defensive discipline or larger hit point pool is vital. The tank's job is to get aggro and keep it, Paladins and SKs are usually better at that than a warrior, and Monks suck at it, getting aggro when they don't want it, and losing aggro when they do want it. Quite why Sony chose to nerf monks rather than upgrade warriors so they were the best tanks is beyond me.<br>
<br>
Seriously, this change is a good idea if it makes Warriors into better tanks; but it's the kind of thing they should have been doing months ago rather than nerfing other classes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=woonx>woonx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 353<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 5:09:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shield blocking</span><hr size=1> They nerfed mitigation on monks because a &quot;leather&quot; class was mitigating as well as a &quot;plate&quot; class. That was nonsense, that was fixed. Monks still tank pretty decent, just not as good as before. <br>
<br>
As for the &quot;no guild in their right mind would ever use a monk as main tank in that situation if they had the choice of a warrior or knight&quot;, that wasn't true before the nerf. ANY guild would have been MUCH better ALWAYS making the monk take rampage, and, like I said, any guild would have been much better using a monk as MT if it wasn't for ONE factor, higher HP on warrior. Let me explain.<br>
<br>
The reason why monks were not used as MT is simply this. The max round of a given mob (for example AoW) would almost kill a monk in 1 round. So while the monk took less damage overall than the warrior, there was always the chance to see the monk drop in 1 round due to the random number generator burping the best melee round possible for the mob. Now with rampage you can pretty much ignore that factor because the mob won't hit rampage target nearly as often as the MT. So for rampage, before monk mitigation nerf, a monk was by far the best way to deal with rampage since they took less damage (thus requiring less healing) than any other class. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&lt;TDE&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
No, the idea of &quot;plate&quot; and &quot;leather&quot; classes is nonsense. AC is AC. Monks can't wear plate, they can wear leather, therefore their AC will always be lower than Warriors with similar gear for their class. What is nonsense is that a Warrior or Ranger wearing leather will mitigate much better than a Monk wearing exactly the same armor; why should identical armor protect one class better than another class?<br>

And how does reducing mitigation of damage affect this in the slightest? Any of those mobs probably has an ATK so high that there was no mitigation before and there's no mitigation now. What difference did it make there? Why did it make Warriors somehow less desirable?<br>
<br>
Monks have been turned into gimped Rogues for no reason that makes any sense, and even Sony have openly admitted that their nerf didn't do what it was meant to do. So I don't know why anyone's even arguing about it.<br>
<br>
As for being the best pullers and damage dealers, Monks are way down the list as damage dealers today and except in those cases where single pulls are absolutely essential, they're way down the list as pullers. For normal groups, at a minimum they're behind SKs, Necros, Chanters and often Druids or Rangers for pullers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=turzem>Turzem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 184<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 6:53:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/personal.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shield blocking</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No, the idea of &quot;plate&quot; and &quot;leather&quot; classes is nonsense.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

No it isn't. You have any idea how heavy plate armor can be?  Can you imagine Bruce Lee wearing a full suit of bronze? No.  While class restrictions are a little forced in eq, and often nonsensical, the general plate/chain/leather restrictions make perfect sense. <br>

Well one of the problems is that verant soft-capped AC. So, monks and warriors had the same effective ac. And, all/all 100+ hp items were common as hell, so now monks had almost the same hp. <br>

<br>
Because people learn how to use armor different, and it works differently for them. I would probably not do very well walking around in a heavy suit of chain armor, because the way I learned to fight (Judo) has nothing to do with it. It would get in the way. Sure, I would be afforded part of it's protection, because I have thick steel in between me and whatever, but it would also slow me down.<br>

The previous poster is wrong. A monk was, at one point, a better tank than a warrior in every single situation in the game, except AoW and possibly emp. I can't name a single other mob outside pop (that wasn't invented yet) that a monk couldn't tank perfectly fine.  <br>

HAH! I, a wet toilet paper wearing pansie, mitigated hits on emp in ssra when I accidentally ae'd mods and aggroed 5 seconds in the fight. No mob has ATK so high that the tank is hit by a string of max.  If you've ever seen or been in a cheal chain, you'd know that roughly 80% of the cheals are ducked, and the only time when they will land in succession is on a lucky string of hits.<br>

Class A takes 100 damage per second, has 8000hp, and deals 80 damage per secod.<br>

Depending on the situation, they are 2nd or 3rd on the scale. They still have firm jobs pulling, as nobody can pull like a monk, even with the new lull (though we aren't forced to use a monk to pull now) and can still tank in any conceivable exp group. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:perpetua;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=474148">Arch Mage -- Insidious Blood</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=arothtb>Aroth TB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 7:19:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  .</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Quote:<br>

I can see you don't play a monk.  Even on light blues monks will be taking 10-15% more damage per fight (unless you have AC way above your level). Go look at the parses on MB.<br>

Depending on the situation, they are 2nd or 3rd on the scale. They still have firm jobs pulling, as nobody can pull like a monk, even with the new lull (though we aren't forced to use a monk to pull now) and can still tank in any conceivable exp group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

Monks are now behind rogues, rangers (bow), wizzys, Beast (+pet) &amp; mages in DPS (and without the utility of some of them).  If a monk can get thier ATK above 1700 this soften things abit, but again 1700atk is not average monk.<br>
<br>
Monks are still good at indoor pulling (because of FD), but outdoors.... well generally you're just slowing your exp down with a monk pulling. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nirrudn@themagicianstower>Nirrudn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 222<br> <font color=#333333>(2/20/03 8:12:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> Hey!

The frequent monk complaint is that monk class specific armor SUCKED HARD (and it did) so monks were walking around with varying suits of all/all armor, except for AoW leggings.

10-15% more seems about right.  And who cares anyway?  In my groups, which are generally non-stop fighting, the cleric often melee's due to being full mana all the time.  You seem to be advocating (or at least pointing out) that monks are inferior tanks to warriors.<br>

Nope it hit those that had their AC well above the new soft caps the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>least</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  This was/is the high level uber monks with more AC than they knew what to do with (the ones that were causing the problems in the first place), and the lower level twinked monks with more AC (for their level) than they knew what to do with.<br>
<br>
The monks that were hit hardest were those that did NOT need to be hit at all. Average mid - high level monks with poor to just above average gear.<br>
<br>
It was a VERY badly implimented nerf.  There are at least 2-3 ways of achieving all the SAME goals without causing all the collateral damage to the class.<br>
<br>
Of course those methods require more work, so I think you can see why VI didn't bother with those options. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
No, VI thinks that monks should deal with damage and tank worse than warriors, pal's, sk's and indeed rangers and BL's.<br>
<br>
However what you've got to remember is that monks are PURE MELEE.  All the really have is their offence/defence ratio.  No spells, no bows, no pets, no real utility.<br>
Currently in situation where FD pulling is not vital that leaves monks as <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">'rogue-lites'</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.... and that is NOT a viable role. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So it is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>fine</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to nerf monks mitigation down to the point that warriors, rangers etc. tank better than them, but if you don't then give monks something back you're just breaking monks (much like kunark and rangers).<br>

<br>
You've obviously not being parsing much.<br>
Once monk gets the really highend equipment and reaches a certain very high level in pure atk their DPS does begin to become viable, but it takes a long time to get there and before that monks are very much subpar (in light of their suddenly aquired subpar defence status) - again this is hurting those who where the target of the nerf the least than those that weren't the most.<br>
<br>
PoP and it's mobs is as much about burst damage as sustained damage, and most of all it's about being able to deal damage with as little risk of taking any in return as possilbe.<br>
<br>
<br>
And lets not forget that nerfing monks did NOT fix warriors (who now still find themselves behind pal &amp; sk's) or fix the problems with the game engine that caused the problems with AC soft caps, mitigation and avoidance etc.  <br>
And certainly did not affect the class envy situation.<br>
<br>
About all it did was mirrior the affects of kunark on rangers (ironically in the very same patch that IMO finally fixed rangers), only this time for monks.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tainsumnr>Tain Sumnr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 299<br> <font color=#333333>(2/21/03 4:32:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Shield blocking</span><hr size=1> Aroth, you appear to be missing a major problem that is surrounding the whole monk &quot;Nerf&quot; issue.  It all boils down to ...it wasn't really ever a problem intrinsic to the monk class....  that class was decent until a point they were designed around was  removed.<br>
<br>
Its not that the design of monks changed over time, its that what they were designed around (for this issue) changed.  <br>
<br>
-Monks were given a weight limit to stop them from using the better armor, which was usually of the heavier variety. <br>
<br>
-Monks were restricted to leather, which is one of the worst armors out there.<br>
<br>
Combine those two points and you have a fairly decent way to let the gear that monks can reasonably use determine their defense, rather then making it totally a part of themselves..like warriors.  <br>
<br>
That was the whole defensive balancing crux for monks.  A combination of weight limit restrictions and class restrictions kept their defensive abilities in balance....<br>
<br>
Then what happened?  Velious came along and you got all/all gear that was far superior to what monks *should* have been able to get defensively.  It was all low weight, high hp/ac, all/all gear...<br>
<br>
So, while the punishments are still in place...restrictions and weight limits..they are made almost null and void because they are so easily bypassed.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now-The best way to &quot;fix&quot; the problem would have been to remove monk  as an option for alot of that gear...or raise the weight.  That way the gear falls back in line with the restrictions and the monk, as a class, remains as it always has been.  But, that would have been far too time consuming...and about every monk in the game would lose the ability to wear half their gear overnight...so the only viable solution was to nerf the monks ability to use that uber gear.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for your other arguments, about no one ever using a monk for tanking... monks were used over plate classes for rampage tanks more often then not.  Yes, perhaps some of the lower end raiding monks weren't outright tanking uber mobs, but they were taking the place of other tank classes in that capacity.  <br>
<br>
That and monks really aren't that hurting over this.  Most of them are doing more then fine these days.  They are just back to their old roles...pulling and damage.  And realistically, damage stacks, it doesn't matter if you are 5 or 10% worse then the &quot;best damage class&quot; , you are still a very viable option.  No guild can afford to have a straight up army of only rogue damage dealers.. Imagine the competition for the loot, everyone wanting the exact same gear.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It would be a nightmare.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So yeah, it is in a guild's best interest to diversify its damage dealers even if they aren't exactly top dog.  Because, realistically..there can be only one &quot;best&quot; and that doesn't negate what other classes can bring.  <br>
<br>

<br>
Then VI mentioned that bow damage was being looked at..... all of a sudden those <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>VERY SAME</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rangers were screaming that they'd quit the game IF bow damage was nerfed. How nerfs were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>BAD</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, how nerfs were <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NOT</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the way to progress the game.

<br>
<br>
Now you see that's just it.<br>
VI's sloppy itemisation (and limitations within the game itself lets not forget) created a situation where monks <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">with good enough gear</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> (which was NOT every monk, perhaps 5% of monks, probably LESS) could in some situations tank better than most anyone.<br>
<br>
So what did VI do to fix this?<br>
<br>
1. they nerfed the ass out of monk mitigation so that a monk gets much less mitigation AC from the same piece of leather armor that a warrior might wear.<br>
<br>
2. they changed the mob in PoP so that monks wouldn't have been the choice of tank anyway, without the HP or the ability to hold agro that is so important with the amount of damage they deal out.<br>
<br>
3. they reduced the AC on new monk PoP to that of druid AC.<br>
<br>
So you see monks have been effectively nerfed 3 time over for the same problem.  (admittedly they weren't all perhaps DIRECTED at monks, but they hit them never the less).<br>
<br>
<br>
There was no real issue in most of the game, besides class envy and jealousy, only at the highest of gear levels did it really become a problem.<br>
<br>
And don't forget <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>originally</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> monks had the highest innate defense, something that they lost when kunark came out and other classes caught up at 60.<br>

(both because of their defence and HP's and because they have no way to reliably keep agro - <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>WARRIORS</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are suffering from this vs. spellcasting melees and they HAVE taunt, so how is a monk being what 5th or 6th choice a viable option?)<br>
Can a monk deal damage?  Yes.<br>
But a rogue can deal more, leaving a monk as a rogue-lite unless FD pulling.  Rangers with  agro-less bow damage outstrip monks until the highest of gear levels (don't do too bad in melee and have utitilty), mages and pets out damage (again with utility), BL's have the damage (again with lots of utility), wizzy can churn out the fast damage needed in phenomal amounts.<br>
So people would take a monk for damage dealing as what?  4th or 5th choice.<br>
<br>
Can monks pull?  Yep.  But unless it's an indoor zone where FD is pretty much vital (and even there SK's can do a passable job), lull classes can do a much more efficent and quicker job.  Not to mention that the higher damage monks now take mean a LOT more stuns, and that a lot of monk defence does NOT work when the mob is behind you. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So how is being at best 3 or 4th best at anything a viable role?  (and don't forget <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>ALL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> pure melees, warriors, rogues AND monks are having problems with PoP, monk are just having the most - having the general pure melee problems combined with the mitigation nerf problems)<br>
<br>
<br>
If what you're stating was true rangers would have been <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>FINE</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> post kunark.<br>
<br>
Yet was that the case?<br>
<br>
Or did rangers suffer badly for a long time before VI finally realised their mistakes and eventually correct them, in stages until their last defence upgrade in the very same patch that nerf monks?<br>
<br>
<br>
How would mages react if every single pet you had suddenly started taking between 10-15% more damage on light blue mobs to 30-50% on high con mobs?<br>
<br>
Let me guess mages would just say &quot;Ah.... well VI's right we needed this, lets just get on with the game and make the best of it that we can. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=bloodlilly>Bloodlilly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333333>(2/21/03 2:45:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: .</span><hr size=1> /mourn horse <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=382542">Moonlilly</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
If EQ's combat engine allowed for such a thing, yes, this is what I would think would make the most sense. Monks should have gotten defensive bonuses for using low AC armor as well, to go well with their normally low AC class armor. The engine was too primitive when it was made (and still isn't very good) to allow for everything to be perfectly as it should be. So, SOE did what they could with what they had.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Monks are after all trained to fight in that lighter armor.<br>
Yet the armor itself gives no inherent bonus.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No armor gives any inherent bonus, just for being armor. I am not sure if they could alter how the melee engine works so that monks get more from using leather, and warriors get more from using plate. What was wrong was that AC was working in a way that was far too similar for all classes (monks benefiting from now very high ac armor), and that monks had the added bonus of very high avoidance. As far as I know, it was the mitigation portion of a monks defense that took the biggest hit. So, any mob that melee's high melee low bonus would tend to eat up a monk more than high bonus low melee.<br>

The problem was that high ac on monks was becoming increasingly common, and almost anyone could hit the softcap soon after hitting level 60. I personally don't know any 60+ monks (and I know 12) that don't have softcapped ac, and 6 of those don't belong to a guild near my own level.<br>

This wasn't a change to make them different. This was a change to take away something that was making them way too good. Monks were broken. They didn't need somethign to even them out, because they were already better than other classes in the first place. The same goes for our own rod nerf, mages were -TOO GOOD- while rods operated like that, we were mana factories capable of single handedly doubling the mana pools of the healers and nukers.

<br>
Rogues ARE suffering from this at high levels admittedly - AND this as much as things like very high atk is what is helping uber monk DPS 'catch up'.<br>

A take it 'a little less' is about 30-40% in your book then?<br>
I'd say that was a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>tad</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> more than a 'little' myself.<br>

And lets not forget that nerfing monks did NOT fix warriors (who now still find themselves behind pal &amp; sk's)<br>

In what way? Warriors still mitigate better, warriors still have disc defensive and evasive. Warriors still have extremely high hp. The only problem is warriors cna't instnatly grab aggro, and they shouldn't be able too anyway.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
In the sense that there is very little if any reason to take a warrior over a SK or a Pal.<br>
Because that intial agro can mean the difference in PoP between a live and dead group member.<br>
Warriors are in a similar unwanted and subpar situation to monks.  Frankly SK's and Pal's would have been the tank of choice (over monks and warriors) even without the mitigation nerf.<br>
<br>
But nerfing monk did not help or fix warriors at all <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  (and warriors need help - which I hope they'll get with the shield changes form this very thread). <br>

I think you're showing your elitest colours a bit there. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Except monks are still the highest damage class other than rogues. They can still tank well enough in any exp group. They can still tank any boss outside of pop. They can still pull perfectly fine. They are still getting into groups, and are needed in guilds.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Except they are not the 2nd highers DPS, more like 4th or 5th.<br>
They are 5th or 6th choice for most tanking duties.<br>
Outdoor pulling is in efficent with a monk compared to other classes.<br>
And monks are increasingly LFG (although this is not purely a monk or even pure melee problem, they just suffer the most). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2974<br> <font color=#333333>(2/22/03 7:13:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8828.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Shields, not monks</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>/shout TRAIN TO ZONE!
