Sounds more like a bad driver for your card.  You downloaded new drivers, and started poofing - deinstall those drivers and go back to the ones that shipped on CD for the card.  <br>
<br>
Also, grab reference drivers from the chipset maker, not the card manufacturer.  Tweaks the vendor made might make it run faster, but might make it trip while doing so.  Reference drivers are generally safer.<br>

<br>
Murg : As far as blaming the OS goes it seems that going back to 98 has &quot;fixed the problem&quot; .  My reasoning for this is the drivers that were origanally designed for the card were not for Windows XP therefore I cant roll back to an older version.  <br>
<br>
I also saw other problems arise when I had first installed XP dealing with the video card another reason I blamed it.  As far as having concrete technical references to back that up I dont have any.  If anyone else might have some technical insight as to why this might be the case please post it.  Sorry about the confusion.<br>
<br>
Durash : I totally agree with what you posted.  I would have gone back to the original drivers if I could have.  My card is very outdated and doesnt have drivers for XP on the original disc.  The drivers were off the Nvidia site.  I tried rolling back to the XP drivers that are default for Geforce 2mx but that didnt work either.  I will have to check the Hercules website and see if they have a default xp driver for XP.<br>
<br>
Meta : Ugh.  that is what I was kind of thinking too.  I was hoping that I could last with this card for a couple more months and then get a new one post Christmas.  If I do that the Geforce 5 will prolly be out and drop the price of the rest of the cards once again.  <br>
<br>
I might just want to redo the whole system at that point though.  Seeing as how my processor is about 4 times slower than the newest processors out there right now. <br>
<br>
Well I will let everyone know if rolling back to 98 helped for sure.   Thanks again guys for your help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hotsamoan>HotSamoan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(11/13/02 7:57:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7820.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Microsoft the root of all evil (VI close second)</span><hr size=1> oh good, looke like im not only one who doesnt know alot about computers....i have a question<br>

I've used GeForce 2, 3 and 4 now (Pro, Ti and Ti, so never the MX version) with great results on XP, NVidia's monolithic Detonator driver thing is *usually* pretty reliable compared to other vendors.  Just think about givin it another try, especially if you get new video (Radeon 9700, which is out now, sounds great BTW).  Most anyone involved in PC maintenance at the end user level is likely to tell ya that video is the most problematic part of the system, which makes sense since it's really where we push for the most performance.  Since gamers are really stressing the video the most, we are all warriors on the frontlines of technological innovation, hehe.<br>
<br>
HotS you're really opening a &quot;can of worms&quot;.  In PM are you lookin' at the &quot;Applications&quot; tab?  If you are, then you should definitely figure out what's runnin' on your box (if you're on the &quot;Processes&quot; tab, then don't even go there, this is a list of all the major threads running on the CPU, not individual user stuff).  You can start by looking in msconfig (start|run|msconfig) on the &quot;Startup&quot; tab, you may be surprised that there is lotsa stuff starting up on your system you didn't even know about.  This tool (msconfig) makes it easy to turn these off if you want to, just uncheck each one that you don't want to start when the box boots up.  Some you may recognize, others you won't be able to tell what they are without some detective work.  Many apps put startup &quot;stub&quot; programs in here, especially AV, media players, stuff like that.  There are things that can start up on your box and not show up here too, especially worms or viruses :-(  so you might wanna run an AV scan if you don't have one that's up-to-date too.  Fine print disclaimer-I'm not responsible for anything that happens as a result of turning off stuff in msconfig, it's not likely you're gonna really hurt anything, probably just keep some apps from runnning as expected, but just know you do it at your own risk.  (When I open up PM on my EQ box with nothing else running, there is only one app showing in the litst) Good luck dood. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravian>Ravian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#333333>(11/13/02 9:39:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7820.topic&index=27>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Glad you're playin' again</span><hr size=1> Oh yeah I forgot to mention that my PC is a stock Micron PC so it was configured for a specific setup.  Lame I know.   The only thing that is not stock is my Video card.   Not that it should cause a problem but you know.   I also have done numerous installs of xp and 98 esecially as of late <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I work for a large insurance company based out of Columbus.  We're on your side. <br>
<br>
I work on the PC solutions team.  So even a guy with little technical background (other than fiddling with a comp since 486 age and 1.5 years of a CIS program at OSU) can get at one of the nations largest insurance firms in the tech department.  Figure that one out.  <br>
<br>
I would have to agree with you bro XP is a far superior operating system to 98.  I have seen a decrease in fps and especially boot time when I restart the computer.  I would love to be able to use XP but until I get a new video card I am going to stay with what works if in fact 98 continues to work.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your in depth analysis.<br>
<br>
Hot:  As far as your problem.  I have a question to ask you.  Are you running XP or 98.  The reason I ask is because with 98 the PM is different and shows in the main window processes that XP places in the processes tab as programs.  You can do one of to things just cancel out all of the programs on the list that your not sure of and leave the important ones.  <br>
<br>
There is a list somewhere on the eq site that will tell you what all needs to be running in the text support section.  I cant link it cause I am at work and the word games is filtered on our firewall.  You can cancel out all but I think 3 programs (Explorer, I believe Rundll, and maybe Systray but figure it out for sure).  I wish I could check sorry.<br>
<br>
I would also definately do what murg said and disable auto start of all programs in the msconfig that are not needed.  There are multiple places where you can check system performance and how much of your resources you are using.  If your using 98 then right click my computer and hit properties it will tell you on the pop up box how much of your resources you are using.<br>
<br>
If your using XP just hit control alt del.  and it will tell you in the PM how much of your resources are tied up.  I heard somewher that 85% is good but I try to keep mine at 95% at least I also dont like to see anything but the programs I am using at that moment running.  <br>
<br>
Hope that helps sorry so long.
