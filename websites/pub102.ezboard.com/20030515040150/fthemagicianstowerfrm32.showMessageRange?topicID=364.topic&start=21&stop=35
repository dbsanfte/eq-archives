<br>
The cast times you omitted are important because there is one major difference between extending the fight and shortening the fight.<br>
<br>
Heals buy YOU time, which you can use to do something else(like nuke), while nukes only take away time from the mob.  Also, the more time your pet is in combat, the more damage he'll do.  Intuition has told me that the usual result for a specific encounter is more favorable using the pet heal, if the mob has a high DPS.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The higher the mob DPS, the less appealing pet heals are compared to nukes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->What this fails to take into consideration is that the higher a mob's dps, the less time you will have to nuke.  The fight becomes limited by how many hitpoints your pet has.  -if- you could keep your pet healed indefinitely and keep the fight stable, you will only lose if you run out of mana.<br>
<br>
Lets take an imaginary example.<br>
<br>
Pet Health 4000<br>
Pet DPS 60<br>
Mob DPS 100<br>
Mob HP 12000<br>
<br>
The mob will kill your pet in 40 seconds flat if you don't heal it.  You have enough time to squeeze in 6 full casts of sofb, and maybe, if you're really really good, one cast Char.  At 100% effectiveness(nuke bonus+resists), you'll do 9140 damage.  Not enough to kill the mob before it kills your pet.  (Also note that this is almost 230dps nuking, which I have found rather hard to achieve in actual combat.  100-130 is usually closer to maximum.)  The pet heal TEI is 580 every 12.5 seconds.  This is a raw 46dps healed.<br>
<br>
So now you have<br>
Pet Health:  4000<br>
Pet DPS 60<br>
Mob DPS 100 minus 46 healed per sec = 54 dps<br>
Mob Health: 12000<br>
<br>
This time, it will take the mob 74 seconds to kill the pet.  Pet damage goes up, but only to 4440, still not enough to win, indeed it seems less effective this way.  However, consider two possibilities.<br>
<br>
First, that with a faster heal, or a heal to chain in between, you could make the fight last even longer.  Consider the level 60 heal..  900 damage every 14.5 seconds, but you can add 580 in the meantime.  This comes out to 102 healed damage per second..  Given that, Mob DPS doesn't mean anything.  You can just make the fight last until your pet deals 9400 damage.  It becomes a question of your mana pool and how much mana you are spending on heals.  Mana is not necessarily an issue in a burn-down fight.<br>
<br>
If you don't have the 60 heal, you can, instead, chain nukes in between heals.<br>
<br>
Since we were very generous with the burn-down example, I'll assume that the mage can fit in exactly 1 SOFB during the recast of TEI.<br>
<br>
Pet Health:  4000<br>
Pet DPS 60<br>
Mob DPS 54<br>
Mob Health: 12000<br>
<br>
Fight lasts 75 seconds, during which time you have time for 5 SOFB.<br>
<br>
Pet damage over 75 seconds = 4500<br>
Nuke damage over 75 seconds = 5025<br>
<br>
Total damage = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  9525</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Total damage using straight burn-down = <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  9140</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
If the mob hitpoints had been in this range, the encounter may have been winnable with heal/nuke alternation but not straight nuking.  The second strategy is more mana dependant, and usually close to as mana intensive as burn-down.<br>
<br>
Note that I've done a little heal parsing, here: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showMessage?topicID=660.topic">In Combat pet regen test</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
I will try to parse a fight where I alternate nukes/heals to get some real numbers, rather than theoretical ones.<br>
<br>

The 60 pet heal has a fairly long recast thus you can fit about 1 cast of the rain in during the recast on the heal.  The advantage to the rain is that for the cast time it does more dmg than SoFB and while it is doing dmg you are casting the next heal. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90022>Xoran</a href>

<br>
Like they are designed they were never meant to heal our pet completly. Just a portion of its health, to keep it alive a bit longer for those situations where a fight is close. Using a pet heal then shifts the balance and helps you to try being able to win.<br>
<br>
Nukes were always more efficient. And they are by far more defining for the mage class. Pet heals are just a means of support to shift the balance a bit in a hard fight. With the mana effficiency they have they were not intended to heal your pet after a fight when it is nearly dead. You are better off to summon a new pet. Thats also a reason why we get relcaim pet spell (and that effect on many items) and later improved reclaim as an alt exp skill.<br>
<br>
We (mages) are different from beastlords, who are way better in helping their pets, in my opinion also a reason why they get a &quot;pet&quot; (its an animal, not summoned matter) that zones with them and stays with them when they log out and in. I see beastlords as a good class to be compared with mages. They are totally diffenrent but then so similar. We deal quick damage and better damage with our elementals. They deal slower damage, but have better utility for their animal companion. So, also from an RP viewpoint I dont see any probs with our heals being not as efficient as our nukes.<br>
<br>
They were never intended to be as efficient as our nukes. Look at the mage class and tell me we have much utility around pet that does NOT increase its fight power. We are based on fast damage, not suporting our pet in a long fight. We try to prevent long fights and have a bit more downtime as a result.<br>
<br>
IF PoP pets have significantly more HP than the old lvl 60- pets then I would see a heal spell at 65 reasonable. It should not heal more than 25-35% of a pet. IF the new PoP pets are more in the direction of better DMG migitation or faster/higher damage I dont see the need for a new heal.<br>
<br>
If mages ask for a CH type spell for pets thats like a cleric asking for a wizzie like nuke (lowered mana efficiency of course, but still around the same damage).<br>
<br>
VI never intended chaining pets maybe. But players again being smarter than the designers developed this strategy and it showed to be very mana efficient. Now asking those same designers to give us a pet heal that can compete with chain casting pets is kind of ridiculous. If we would get a CH type of spell that would mean we would have to get a significant recast delay (like a few mins) on normal pets also, like the epic. Then it would be reasonable to ask for a CH type spell.<br>
<br>
Think about it.<br>
<br>
I feel like the pet heals are right in line and dont need an upgrade. Though the recast time on mend companion is ridiculous, should be indeed around 72 mins and not 144.<br>

<br>
Pet x 50% heal (should)=1/2 zzzmana<br>
<br>
If pet is 300 mana then pet 50% heal should be 150 mana (or 200 to limit it a little).  Small Problem here though, 12-49 pets are all 200 mana, and 50% of lvl 12 is no ways near 50% of lvl 49's pets, also not all pets were created equal, but since they can code a 75% CH for druids/shammies, it shouldn't be too hard to code a 50% total health heal for pets.  It would also need a huge recast timer on it since it would be quite efficient, also wouldn't affect cleric/druid/shammie heals since they would still heal pets just as they would a melee.  I'd say a 4-5 minute refresh timer would be fairly adequate, I mean it would be 50% of pets health, and ya could always chain a new pet while waiting on refresh if need be.<br>
<br>
Course reading that back it sounds like alot, but fundamentally makes sence 300 mana for pet, shouldn't be 200 mana to heal 6% of pet.<br>
<br>
As it currently stands the hp healed/mana ratio makes the heals nearly pointless.  That doesn't stop me from using them though, I just find it more efficient (meaning 1-2 more kills yet it takes me 20% longer) to heal vs nuking, MOST of this is based solely on us being 12-16 casts away from fm at any given time.<br>
<br>
Then again I really don't want to ditch the epic just to cana pets.  If I wasn't epic, I probably wouldn't heal pet at all (since cana'ing wouldn't mean killing fluffy). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucalebe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calebe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 388<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/02 5:03:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Model for evaluating utility of mage pet heals</span><hr size=1> Pet heals as they stand now are not effiecent, and as shown by Gladius are not worth using. <br>
<br>
Mobs hit so fast and hard, a 580 point heal spell is severly lacking.<br>
<br>
As noted by many that say we chain cast we have no need for a new heal spell are not using the epic pet.<br>
<br>
The cries of reclaim your pet and make a new one, I ask you. How do I reclaim a pet (epic) than wait 20 seconds as a new one is cast without being smashed into pulp by the mob?<br>
<br>
If I cast a regular Greater Vocerate, that casts in 10 seonds, the same question. If I reclaim it (I have to be close to the mob), you can't click/cast reclaim as you make a pet, so how do you keep the mob off you as a new pet is made?<br>
<br>
I see one answer RUN way out, and try to cast, however that is very risky if a new mob gets aggro on you.<br>
<br>
So the only viable way, if you /pet get lost   just before the new pet is done casting. There is NO reclaiming of the previous pet. No mana returned from it, even with improved reclaim (UNLESS you can cast that and a pet at the same time? Can you? I don't have it. Am asking.) If you can't cast improved reclaim as a pet is being cast, it also yields you 0 mana. A Magician is just not equiped to handle a mob while a new pet is being cast as it will head to you at full speed if your pet is dead due to a reclaim.<br>
<br>
So you chain, lose pet as new one incoming, and are down the mana of the new pet (400) and weather you re-buff it or not (or use a lot of time and use no mana robe/legs). <br>
<br>
I wonder how mages say I reclaim and chain, HOW can you reclaim and chain when the mob is not rooted, and beating on you as you cst a 10 second spell? OK you have a ton of aaxp and cast it in 5 seconds. Not everyone has that option yet.<br>
<br>
An improved heal spell, will give you the option of chaining a pet or healing the existing one EFFICENTLY. <br>
<br>
It boggles the mind to wonder why so many are dead set against giving us a 2nd option to chaining pets.<br>
<br>
The old line of, because you haven't shown a need for it doesn't stand up. We have shown a need for it if you use the epic.<br>
<br>
20 second cast time. Armour or equipe pet with Yaks and pay for it to be buffed. Time Plat Equipement Invested in a pet. So we want the OPTION to heal it to keep it alive as viable an option as chaining an inferior pet.<br>
<br>
Inferior even if the same pet. As any pet with armour/muzzle/weapons/buffs are superior to any freshly made pet that is buffless. The new pet has more hit points, but will do less damage till buffed up to match the 1st pet engaged on the mob, and if the epic pet, nothing will come close to the inherent and fully active 50 point damage shield your pet has up, that any chain casting person will not have.<br>
<br>
To me it seems that those against it, are against it for one reason only. You chain cast and think that is the ONLY option as a magician we should ever have.<br>
<br>
I say I want option 2, a heal that makes it as viable as chaining a pet.<br>
<br>
A lot of you pro chaining keep also saying PROVED TO ME WHY you need a new heal. We have, and you IGNORE the reasons.<br>
<br>
Options.<br>
Time mana equipement armour buffs invested in a pet to make it as deadly as possible you DO NOT want to lose every battle. So to those of us that like to lavish on our pets to make them as deadly as possible, we want to HEAL THEM. We want that option. it is OUR play style, as chain casting is yours. The fact it isn't effective yet doesn't make it invalidated, it just shows why a lot of us want the heal improved.<br>
<br>
Also note WE don't have to prove a thing to people saying you haven't convinced me of your need for a better heal. We already know why we want it, just the same as you WANT the option to chain cast. It is OUR preferred play style.<br>
<br>
Heals are in the game for pets, now we are asking for them to be a very viable option, and ONCE AGAIN YES it is a valid reason for us. Your not convinced I really don't care, enough of us are convinced that , that play style should be an option.<br>

Yes.<br>
<br>
I went for the simpler model, well because it was simpler, and it factored out hit points on both sides of the equation, leaving me only with seconds and DPS.<br>
<br>
As an aside for later elaboration, it turned out that a strong measure of a mob or pet was:<br>
<br>
Power = HP * DPS<br>
<br>
Which had some interesting consequences.  But like I said, I factored out HP because it was simpler and clearer.  By factoring out hitpoints, as you point out, the model assumes that there is enough time to intervene.  I should have remembered from physics that when you factor something out like that, you need to look at it again later to see if the assumptions that you made in order to factor it out in fact hold.<br>
<br>
But I just re-worked the model, as you suggested, and, as you suggested, an important difference between nukes and heals is that heals can buy you the time to nuke, but nukes cannot buy you time to nuke or heal.<br>
<br>
For sustaining pets, the nuke/heal, nuke/heal alternation is most commonly seen.  In fact, chaining heals is rarely seen except againt low DPS (under 30 DPS) mobs like shrooms, or with archmages with the rare 60 heal against mobs where aggro must be avoided at all costs, such as Yeldema.<br>
<br>
I will think about this some more, and try to establish when the simpler model holds, and when it breaks down, and what that says.<br>
<br>
But it does suggest that heals are better than the first model says.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Itsastony:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Like they are designed they were never meant to heal our pet completly. Just a portion of its health, to keep it alive a bit longer for those situations where a fight is close. Using a pet heal then shifts the balance and helps you to try being able to win.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is how mages use those spells, and exactly how it seems to be.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Pet x costs zzzmana<br>
<br>
Pet x 50% heal (should)=1/2 zzzmana<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->That is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>way</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> too good a ratio.  It would give healers <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>all</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of the advantages of chaining pets, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>none</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of the disadvantages of chaining, and would be substantially better than chaining.  It would be over powering.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Calebe:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  Pet heals as they stand now are not effiecent, and as shown by Gladius are not worth using.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Please do not take my disagreements with your statements personally, they are never intended as such.  They are meant to clarify and well disagree.  I don't take it personally when you disagree with me.<br>
<br>
No, this is not what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Goladus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shows.  What he shows is that heals, unlike nukes, buy additional fighting time, which can then be used to heal or nuke.  Exactly how to evaluate this yet is not entirely clear, but it means that heals are not as bad as my simple model implies.  Even if they were as bad as my first model says, the fact remains that you cannot chain nuke in practice because you would get aggro.  Heals do not get aggro, and give time for the aggro from nukes to die down.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Goladus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> shows additionally that heals buy time to cast another spell.<br>
<br>
Not to argue with you further at the moment, but one thing you are mistaken about chaining that might change your evaluation of the merits of this technique.  One generally does not dismiss or reclaim the pet, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>then</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> begin casting the next one.  As you point out, that is impractical without root.  Instead, one begins casting the new pet as the old pet is dying, and then typing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet get lost</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> or press the GO AWAY button on the PET INFO window just before the new pet finishes casting, so that old pet disappears just a second or two before the new one appears.<br>
<br>
Also, please keep in mind that even though I remain unconvinced of the need for a better pet heal, I do realize that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>now</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> is the last time to ask for long time, and I have started another thread for that very purpose, so that those mages who want a better heal can make and compare proposals.  I both chain and sustain pets as appropriate, and I use the existing 52 pet heal.<br>
<br>
Strong as I may argue my positions and dissect the arguments of those I disagree with, I do not mistake my opinions for that of the mage community, nor do I long forget my duty as a moderator to facilitate the needs of the large mage community.<br>
<br>
The purpose of this thread is to develop some kind of rational context for evaluating heals.<br>

We need a new way of healing pets. If the new pets are going to be near or above the epic pet hps then we are in desperate need of a way of healing that pet. With VT gloves epic pet is around 5k hps increasing the need for a better heal. <br>
<br>
I think a better argument would be what type of heal do we need. 2k super heals are not needed IMO because they are overpowering for the class. One heal could buy you time for 2 or 3 more nukes. Right now TEI buys you time for 1 nuke at best, so you could make the argument that a 2k hp heal would buy time for 4 nukes. If we are using the new Black Steel Model that is 4k extra damage (no including focus)  for X amount of mana. Even if the heal cost 600m it would be worth it if it would buy me enough time to do 4k+ more damage to say a 12k hp mob. That is how a 2khp heal would make it overpowering. Soloing summoning mobs would have little to no risk which would be bad even tho it would be fun. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I am a big supporter of a heal over time. That would allow for a larger amount of healing but spead over a 24sec duration.  This would help very little against a mob that is doubling for 200 but it would allow for us to recover faster after a fight is over. Also the ratio on the heals we have need to be changed.  200m cost on TEI and 300m cost on TER would help a ton and would lessen the need for larger Direct Heals. You could chain cast those two heals for 500m and deliever a 1300hp healing punch. <br>
<br>
On a side note it was said by Absor on the beastlord board that there is a new line of summoned armor/equipment that will be entering the game for pets. Something tells me we are going to be able to custom pets more so then we can now. Also I honestly believe the new pets are going to be superior to Epic pet in their specialized fields...IE...Air will tank better but do less damage, Earth will have more hps and be better defensively, Fire/Water will deal considerally more damage then they do now. I am positive that the new spells are intended for mages to use. I don't believe they would add new pet spells if they intended them to be inferior to epic. Makes no sense so alot of the debate about being able to heal epic is going to fade. I think epic will still be a powerful tool but not what 90% of what highend mages use.<br>
<br>
If we will go back to using regular pets then reclaiming and resummoning a new pet will be that much easier. Also Absor said the new armor that is going into the game for pets was the sole reason why they made EoT and other pets able to equip armor in preparation for this new armor. Also depending on the affects on this new armor it could possibly make epic pet that much meaner and nastier.<br>
<br>
I really believe that with the look of our nukes and the current nice things they have done for our pets that the new pets are going to be very mean. A water pet that can double backstab for 300? One can dream /drool.<br>

The rate we can heal is pretty good with TEI alone, and TER almost <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> doubles</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that, as it defeats the recast.  Actually, while I disagree with the quote from Raz about the relative use of heals vs. nukes, I do think that another heal in the &quot;transons&quot; line would give fairly insignificant returns.  What I might like to see is a &quot;less-uber&quot; alternative to Transons Elemental Renewal that would fit in between TEI and TER.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I will think about this some more, and try to establish when the simpler model holds, and when it breaks down, and what that says.<br>
<br>
But it does suggest that heals are better than the first model says.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Just thinking briefly without going into numbers..<br>
<br>
The simple model is correct in its conclusion that nukes mean more against mobs with a higher damage output.  Since a nuke shortens the amount of time a mob has to deal damage, nukes will reduce more damage from more powerful mobs.  However, this effect is meaningless if the length of the fight is already determined by the health of the pet.  Anything up to the critical point where you &quot;close the gap&quot; is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>necessary</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to even win.<br>
<br>
If the gap is to be entirely closed by nukes, you can measure the nuke DPS you <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>need</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to achieve in order to win.  As a mobs hp -or- dps go up, the nuking DPS you need to kill the mob increases linearly.  (hp and dps is probably quadratic or something I don't have my pen/paper handy at the moment hehe).  Pet dps would be a mitigating factor..  As pet dps went up nuke dps would go down linearly.  Same with pet hitpoints.<br>
<br>
ok I guess I have time for a few quick numbers<br>
<br>
*estimates* from that log with the icewell sentinel (51+ mob, was summmoning my pet, immune or highly resistant to procs to ) are<br>
<br>
mob dps 54<br>
pet dps with ds 72<br>
pet health 3890 (from other tests)<br>
mob health 14000<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CODE START--><pre> 
(mob health) - (mob dps/pet health) * (pet dps)
-----------------------------------------------
                 (mob dps/pet health)
</pre><!--EZCODE CODE END--><br>
<br>
You'll find out what your nuke dps needs to be.<br>
<br>
For the Icewell Sentinel(estimate), I would need to nuke at 117 dps <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>to tie</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->... to kill him as he kills my pet.<br>
<br>
117dps is possible for a mage..<br>
<br>
But on that fight, not without drawing aggro.<br>
<br>
Also, if you increase the numbers just a tad.. say, a mob with 60dps and 20k hitpoints, you'd need 228 dps, which is probably getting really close to the current hard cap on single target spell damage output.<br>
<br>
For a 32k mob that deals 70ish dps you'll need to nuke for about 500, if your pet can keep up 72.  It actually might be more beneficial to think of this in terms of &quot;extra damage,&quot; not just nuke damage.  A mage <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>might</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> be able to deal 250 dps, which leaves 250 for others.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you can heal 35 dps against that 32k, 72 dps mob, you'll only need about 220 extra dps.  If you can also add some nukes at 40 dps, the difference is now only 180, which can probably be filled easily by any two other casters.  <br>
<br>
This method will break down when the dps averages mean less than cast times.  For increasingly short fights, the nuke dps and heal dps will be exremely spikey.<br>
<br>
closing thoughts..<br>
<br>
Giving a mage more ability to deal damage increases his worth in most situations...  Giving a mage better heals only matters when his pet is taking damage.  In the isolated solo example, it may make more sense to increase nuking power than healing power.  However, that seems less favorable as you think about other areas of the game where a magician might start stepping on other class toes(like wizards).<br>
<br>
Increasing pet heals too much would, imo, be really unfair to warriors.  Mages could become better at holding mobs at bay than warriors, (funny melee range rule excepted).<br>
<br>
However, balancing the power of both could increase the power of the mage overall <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>without</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> going too far in one direction, changing the class definition and porbably crossing other class boundaries. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucalebe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Calebe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 391<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/02 1:56:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Model for evaluating utility of mage pet heals</span><hr size=1> I always find it amusing when a magician says we may cross &quot;Class Boundaries&quot;.<br>

So many of the magician abilities (Pouch of Quillolous a level 57 spell an effect on a monk item) GIVEN at no mana to other classes, and we say Oh we have a heal spell, but if it actually becomes useful, and healing is as viable an option as nuking we are sterpping on Shaman/Cleric/Druid/ toes?<br>
<br>
Clerics with their new hammer steps on ours big time as they have the very best summoned weapon in the game.<br>
<br>
I doubt a cleric would care very much nor  a warrior if a mage decided instead of nuking they healed there pet instead. <br>
<br>
As a class our abilities have been farmed out to so many so often I am tired of being denied something because it steps on others, when we weren't only stepped on, but steam rollered over.<br>

<br>
As for class boundaries, well I agree that class boundaries are becoming less distinct, and I for one do not like it at all.  What is the point of being any one particular class, if all classes have effectively the same abilities?<br>
<br>
How can we argue that one proposed solution is more appropriate for mages than another proposal except in the context of class boundaries?<br>
<br>
Class envy, the argument <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Class A has X, therefore we should have X&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is a viscious cycle, one that sadly we find ourselves in.  Each time class envy is accepted and acted upon, the class boundaries weaken further.  The weaker class boundaries are, the less compelling arguments based on class capabilities are, and the more compelling class envy becomes.<br>
<br>
For example, suppose mages get a pet heal comparable or even better to the best beastlord pet heal.  Beastlords are now in a stronger position to ask for increased HP for their warders.  If strong heals were previously seen as compensating for low hitpoints, that argument is much less compelling if mages have strong heals.  If beastlords ask for and receive a major hitpoint increase, then some mages are going to start asking for beastlord pet buffs, the proc for example.  Since beastlord warders have become more similar to elementals, the class boundaries have been blurred, and it is harder to argue that mages are not entitled to beastlord procs.<br>
<br>
Carried to the extreme, if beastlord pets then become the functional equals of elementals, then in order to balance the classes, beastlords might well demand stronger nukes and then mages more ability to survive combat, until beastlords and mages are hardly distinguishable.<br>
<br>
Class boundaries are important, and yes, I will fight to preserve them.  Even if the trend is against them.<br>

<br>
Note that I did leave direct mana costs out...  When you consider heals especially, mana pool will become a concern.<br>
<br>
<br>
Calebe, <br>
<br>
when I talk about Class Boundaries, I am most concerned with preserving the differences in how each class feels to play, from the perspective of those who play them.  The worry that one class will be more powerful and more situationally useful than another is secondary.  The worry that others will complain is tertiary to not at all.<br>
<br>
I want to play a mage and feel like I'm playing a magician, not a wizard with a pet.  Likewise, I don't think other classes should start feeling like Magicians.  My one remaning concern about Dire Charm is that it makes playing an Enchanter feel more like playing a mage than before.<br>
<br>
A cleric summoning a single no drop hammer shouldn't make them feel like they are playing a mage.  Clerics have always been able to summon their own weapons and it is quite in character for the class's roleplay.  That clerics have had their melee capabilities upped does shift the feel of the class towards melee(like paladin), and I think VI needs to be careful not to push that boundary too far.  That the cleric summons is &quot;better&quot; than mage summons is subjective anyway, since it obviously fails to place any value on whether or not an item is tradeable.<br>
<br>
Having a strong pet heal doesn't directly cross warrior boundaries so much as it does Beastlords, but the worry is still there that a mage+pet will be a better tank than a warrior, that if a warrior really wanted to be a tank he should have played a mage.. which is a rather stupid situation in my opinion. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2320<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/02 5:20:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Model for evaluating utility of mage pet heals</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> we say Oh we have a heal spell, but if it actually becomes useful, and healing is as viable an option as nuking we are sterpping on <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The heals we already have are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> very</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> useful.

It is about the same as a nuke (same as 57 shock if i remember) with similar cast time, longer recast, and conjuration based.  Its going to use about the same mana.  The reason its so costly for the amount healed is several reasons I can think of.  The pet does a bit under a nuke of damage in that time the heal buys it, but it also holds the mob at bay and so on, so thats worth some more mana or less damage however you want to slice it, the utility is there.  Its also faster than a new pet, and it preserves the buffs/items on the pet, so again you need to pay more of a premium.<br>
<br>
I did some experimenmting, and indeed it seems to me that nuking the mobs is more effective than healing in a one on one fight.  So hats off to this thread!! its improved my soloing a little =).  I also decided to examine when I use the heal the most, and determined its not when the pet is ultra low in a close fight (although I cast it then I do not find myself in that situation frequently).  The time I use it the most is when Im dealing with adds like 2 or 3 mobs at once.  THen healing the pet not only buys me time, and keeps me alive, but his ds damages all the mobs generating no agro for me, while nukes would do the opposite.  Again healing and nuking the one he is on is the best combination, and would be impossible with no heals.  I wonder if that situatino is common enough among all mages to warrent more examination with some numbers.  I find myself on two all the time (solo in caves and sorta tight places a lot where moving a tad one way or the other gets adds, of if two pop to fast or something).  Three is kinda rare, but two happens probably a few times an hour.  Just some thoughts.<br>

Also I have found myself to use my last little bit of mana to heal pet doh! leaving me with no mana for gate.  Died a couple of times doing that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 As far as chaining pets goes at lvl 34 its not eficient.  My pet does way to little damage for it to make sense.  It does however allow me to handle yellow and red mobs if I want to <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  which is just fun.<br>

I personally have always liked the analogy that Mage fights are like old western shootouts.  Bang Bang Bang someones dead or your running.  I love watching mobs die quickly also.  I would say that until I get my epic, pet heals will be used only when they are a last resort.   <p><img src=http://www.legionoffyre.net/disappearing%20flame.gif><a href=mailto:RavianVarior@hotmail.com><b>Ravian Varior</b></a><img src=http://www.legionoffyre.net/disappearing%20flame.gif><br><a href=http://www.legionoffyre.net><b>----{}Legion of Fyer{}---</b></a><br><b>---LVL 37 Erudite Mage---</b><br><a href=http://pub17.ezboard.com/bxegony >----------Xegony----------</a>
