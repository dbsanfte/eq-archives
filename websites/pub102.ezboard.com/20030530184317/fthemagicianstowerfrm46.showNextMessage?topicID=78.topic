<br>
Realizing that EQ involves a massive time investment, the question is, &quot;Are things so bad with Mages that you would trade your Mage for another class with equivalent gear?&quot;<br>
<br>
Please post your answer (yes or no), your level, what class you would change to, and a single sentence for every reason for or against.  <br>
<br>
Please post with as few words as possible so that many responses can be read in as short as time as possible.  (In hopes someone who can change things might read this.  Just about every complaint has been posted, and suggestions for improvement, so please don't beat any dead horses.)<br>
<br>
I think this is the best measure as to how bad the players who play Mages think things are. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uliffthemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liff the Mage</A> at: 10/10/02 12:10:19 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uliffthemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Liff the Mage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(10/10/02 12:13:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How bad is it?

Do Mages have issues? Sure our class does.  With the development of the change to rods and what not we have even more issues.  VI Seems to think that mages are powerful, that we are.,  BUT During most raids our power is fully cut in HALF by no pet.(yeah yeah some of you say, I'll bring Fluffy up no matter what the raid leader says, My raid you'd be removed from any group instantly and asked to leave)  Our pets need to be safer for the yardtrash crawls damit.  I want to be able to have Fluffy(who BTW I fought insanly hard to get being its an epic) standing next to me and dealin death and destruction to those who oppose My Brethren and myself!<br>
<br>
We do not need higher damage nukes, we have an unlimited dot that needs to be a useable spell everywhere.<br>

Although i hated mod rods the simple fact is that it made me wanted at raids.  A lot of hard to reach mobs and zones pets are still discouraged if not outright not allowed.  During the Velious and part of the Kunark age mages had no place at raids or big events.  I do remember logging in and doing a /w all mage 55 60 and seeing under 10 online during prime time.  Pretty sad.  Most high end guilds did places like sleepers, ToV, DN  at that time and mages simply had no place.  Our nukes didnt land (still dont on a lot), no mod rod at that time, and pets are a very BAD idea. CoH was not always required (usually they had one camped out mage alt to do this when needed).   How many mages out there actually got into sleepers tomb before the recent changes.  Am betting you will find very very few (we where not wanted nor welcome usually). <br>
Then along came Luclin and the mod 2.  Every guild seemed to want mages all of a sudden.  People dusted off the old magi chars they had abandoned and brought them back to life.  Pets are still not always welcome but are the odd time.  Mages are once more welcome and encouraged to attend the big events and high end mobs.<br>
<br>
I am hoping that they actually think about the changes they are making.  They have shown very little thought in the past where mages are conserned,and in some instances pretty much ignored us for years.  They stated in that nerf that mages are supposed to be damage dealers, well it would be nice if our spells actually hit and had reasonable ratios so we could dish out some damage.<br>
<br>
Simple fact is I would rather be wanted at high end events for a mod rod 2 and get the chance at some of the upper end gear then be told that I have no place.<br>
<br>
IF verant revamps the new zones and maybe changes how our spells land (would be nice to have our rain spells actually hit something at a raid) we may come out doing well and mages may have some role still.  But for some reason my faith in Verants ability to do this is not very high.  I have a nasty feeling that it will go back to those Velius days when mages had no role other then xp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 439<br> <font color=#333333>(10/11/02 4:10:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: maybe</span><hr size=1> I'm not sure if I would change classes.

As time goes on I will be able to make a decision of whether to keep playing mage or scrap him totally for the twink, or to leave EQ, but that's a decision I'm not gonna make yet.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see mages, beastlords and necros all combined into 1 class though. They're all so similar.

Some people are waiting to see what Verant will do to make up for the nerf.  I don't like raining on anyone's parade, but guess what? Mages will get a trinket here and there but that will be it.  They'll never give us anything which will make up for the loss of mod rod 2.  Not because then can't.  They just don't give a @#%$ about us.<br>

Things are looking more and more bleak in PoP..Necroes now have a nuke that will out DPS any mage nuke Besides the lvl 65 one...This nuke is currently set for necroes at 61...<br>
<br>
Thats and the new 42 Second super Damage/DPS dots is really great for necroes...However I am feeling very very Left out on the whole...<br>
<br>
Our nukes do need to be looked at...Like it our not pets are half the class...Mages are nukers and pet masters...<br>
<br>
Besides being half nukers PoP content will be Fast and furious...&quot;DoT&quot; Damage on a whole wont be that great unless its a fast acting dot...Pets are not fast acting dots...Investing your power in them might be your downfall.<br>
<br>
I really hope our nukes are slightly tweaked pre 60...And majorly tweaked post 60...*sigh* I despise class envy However I do not wish for the return Of Velious Mage bot-01. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showPrevMessage?topicID=76.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showNextMessage?topicID=76.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=76.topic&index=12><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.threadControl?topicID=76.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=76.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=76.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46>Planes of Power</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
