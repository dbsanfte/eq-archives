I feel this is not where our collective efforts should be vested.<br>
<br>
1) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant doesn't like it</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
The new expansion was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>purposely</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> designed so pop mobs were largely unsoloable by most classes. They <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>hate</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> soloing, and I don't blame them. It undermines the point of the game. This is a social game based on interdependency.<br>
<br>
If anything, rather than seeing more increases to soloing, you can expect changes like snare starting to break like root when being coupled with distance attacks (such as dots or nukes or archery). <br>
Changes will probably be made to charm as well.<br>
<br>
2) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Its not fair to some classes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
Why should soloing even exist? Why should a few classes be able to solo, when classes when classes like the 3 pure melees cant? We offer just as much to a group as any rogue or monk does. So do all &quot;solo classes&quot;. <br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Just let soloing die</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
Even though it does suck for me as a mage, I'm glad to see soloing dieing. Soloing has always been one of those &quot;things&quot; pointed to by other classes when we asked to be as useful as they were. Now that its no longer there, there is no reason why we shouldn't continue to be as useful of a group member as anyone else. No one can say its overpowered, since we are entirely dependant on a group as we are physically weak, like we as mages were designed to be. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
You might be thinking to yourself, &quot;Ok, you want soloing to die, yet we still are not as valuable to a group as that initial cleric/druid, shaman/enchanter/bard or war/pal/sk. They could give us hundreds of dps, and we still wouldn't be as sought after as they, since that is the nature of an offensive class.&quot;<br>
<br>
My answer? Its time to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>make offense more valuable to a group</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
Everyone knows mages rock for the trial of execution. I get tells literally every day to help with them. Why? Why do they suddenly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>need</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a mage, when the entire game this wasn't the case? Because unlike in the exping world, there are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>real consequences</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for not having the appropriate dps in the trial. Your party wont succeed if mobs do not die fast.<br>
<br>
As of right now, the only real motivation for anyone taking an offensive class in their group is the desire to make faster experience. We are not actually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>needed</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the success of the group.<br>
Despite the fact I am just as dependant on a group as any cleric, enchanter, or shaman, (the later two are actually less dependant, and even clerics can solo undead in pov) no one really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>needs</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> me, I'm just nice fluff to have around. How is that fair? <br>
<br>
Well, I say its <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not fair</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Its time to have offense work more directly like damage mitigation on exping mobs as was originally intended, to finally give offense that real needed group role. Its time for the trinity to officially die.<br>
<br>
I propose the following change. Enter mob infuriation. The properties of mob ability infuriation are outlined below.<br>
1) Basically, the longer a party is engaged with a mob, the more damage that mob will do.<br>
For example, if you put a 70% slow on a standard exp mob, after 10 seconds it would be a 60% slow, 15 seconds 50% slow, after 20 seconds 40%, so on so fourth. <br>
If the mob is unslowed, then it will be as if the mob is becoming more hasted as the seconds pass. Every interval of increased attack speed is marked to the player with the following message, or something similar:<br>
&quot;A moss snake becomes FURIOUS!&quot;<br>
<br>
2) The timer would be activated upon players being added to the mobs hate list, and it will not be reset by memory blur type spells (to avoid exploits). It will naturally reset itself after 15 minutes of non-engagement, by which the mob would be &quot;calmed down&quot;. This aspect of my change I particularly like, it gives a whole new value to wizards and fast damage in general. No longer can you just pull 4 mobs, and have a shaman drop a slow on them while they stand there idle. No longer can you pull 6 mobs, and have a good enchanter lock them down with no consequences. Fast damage now is important, a class who can speed up the pace of their damage to quickly kill infuriated mobs will be a highly valuable asset to a group, as much so as any mezzer or slower. Slow and mez type spells will still be valuable, however fast damage will be equally valuable.<br>
<br>
How long it would take for intervals between mob infuriation to occur, should of course be entirely dependant on the mob you are fighting. Basically VI needs to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>look</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at the mobs, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>think</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> about the levels that should be fighting them, and then decide how long it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> take to die, assuming 3 of those group spots are occupied by reasonably decent damage dealers of that level. <br>
You shouldn't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a mage or a rogue in all 3 of the slots, but you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>should</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have at least 1 or an equivalent, much like in the trial of execution. The other 2 spots should not be filled by a pally and a cleric just because they were &quot;there,&quot; and those spots &quot;don't mean much&quot;. They should be filled by classes who are primarily <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>offense</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Verant must keep this in mind when deciding how many seconds should pass till the next increment in attack speed. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here are a few reasons why this is not only a highly desired change, but a needed change:<br>
1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Flexible Damage vs Sustained Damage?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
Wizards are the masters of flexible, or fast damage. By this I mean they can control the pace of their damage the best. They can do hundreds of dps, or they can do a few dps. The balancing factor of this power, is their sustained damage is not as good as other offensive classes.<br>
<br>
Sounds good right? Well the problem is, throughout most of eq, there is only a need for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sustained damage</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in verants environments. Fast damage, although it sounds like a fun role, has <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>almost no value</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> outside of a handful of encounters and situations. So what you have is a class, with a role that verant has created virtually <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no environment</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for, with almost no other abilities to offer since they specialize in it so much. Of course this class is going to be undesired.<br>
<br>
By making offense work more like damage mitigation, the wizard now has real value to a group, and to environments, as much so as any supportive class.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Nukers, Meleers, Doters... whats the difference?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
As I said in #1, sustained damage is the only type of damage anyone really cares about, because verants environment only require sustained damage. Nukers such as wizards measure themselves to a ruler they never were meant to. Sustained damage was never meant to be where the exclusive value of a nuke lies. <br>
This change makes the difference in damage types more  prominent. The optimal group would have the following make up, or something similar: <br>
healer (cleric/druid), <br>
damage mitigation, spell type (enchanter/shaman/bard), <br>
damage mitigation, tank type (war/pal/sk), <br>
damage, support type (wizard/druid/mage), <br>
damage, hybrid/sustained type (rogue/monk/ranger/necro/beastlord)<br>
damage, hybrid/sustained type (rogue/mage/monk/ranger/necro/beastlord)<br>
<br>
Notice every class is included, every class has a defined role. Thats how it should be. May the trinity RIP.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Damage mitigation vs Healing?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
Thott is a very vocal critic of the power of damage mitigation relative to healing. I agree with him to an extent, if you can almost completely circumvent the damage a mob is doing, what value does the healer have other than in rare emergency situations? If slow were to become less powerful relative to its environment as per my suggested changes, healing would again retain its intended value.<br>
<br>
This doesn't mean classes like enchanters and shaman are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>less valuable</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, not at all, if anything they would be more desirable since mobs do more damage. Slow still has a powerful effect, the difference between an unslowed and a slowed mob would still be relatively as considerable as it is now. However, healing would now have a more equal effect.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Where is the challenge, where is the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>fun</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
Find a camp. Pull endless stream of mobs to the camp with no risk of dying. Ding 65. BORING. The game needs to be made more challenging, the game needs to be made more fun. Right now, the optimal way to make experience is in very low risk grouping situations which has the player in a vegetative state single pulling mobs till they ding 65. While this new change wont solve all or even most of those inherent design flaws with the everquest grouping system, it will add a new level of challenge to it, which in turn will make grouping more fun. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Everyone wins</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with this change, healers, damage mitigation classes, and damage dealing classes alike.<br>

<br>
Personally, i do not see how this will help a mage as much as say a rogue ( high sustained DPS ).  The mage is restricted by mana while a rogue is not.  In a chain pulling situation ( most exp groups ), the fact that we can go oom would be a problem.  The group could be better served by a rogue, who would not run out of mana and would keep an equal or very nearly equal damage output.  I dont see this helping wizards at all.<br>
<br>
I think your execution analogy, while somewhat similar is innaccurate.  In the execution trial, you need only operate for 4 waves that last no more than 2 minutes each ( ~10 minutes, with the breaks and such ) and the boss, which you do not even need mana for.  Thus, while we truly shine there, in an exp group situation we would have to keep the same DPS over an hour long period ( probably more ).<br>
<br>
While i think your idea does definitely seem a step in the right direction, and i find it very interesting, i do not think it will accomplish what you wish for.  I do not, however, have any better idea and iot would certainly help a bit, just not nearly as much as it would help rogues, and maybe even monks.  This probably does not apply to those with FT 15 and whatever other forms of mana regen lots do not have access too. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sargonnis>Sargonnis</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(11/20/02 9:23:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   bleh</span><hr size=1> I cannot seem to edit my post, but wanted to also reply to the fun section.

I think it's a creative suggestion, but I also think it really cripples groups that are already less-than-optimal.  Consider this extremely common scenario: it's an off night in your guild, and there are 2 druids, 1 mage, a paladin, and a bard LFG.  Well, you have healers and a tank, bard slow/CC, and some dps, but this group will have a very obvious disadvantage against mobs that become gradually hasted over time (or un-slowed over time).  They don't have the dps to kill faster, and while they may have the healing to cover the increase in damage, their downtime will be much greater due to the druid's lesser heals.  Currently, at least with the bard's marginal slow and the druid's marginal CH, they can still manage to keep up a fair pace.  Not optimal, but fair.<br>
<br>
It also does very little or nothing to eliminate the cleric dependency.  If the mob's damage increases exponentially, so does the healing power required.  Slowers actually help mutt groups by knocking out at least one of the &quot;trinity&quot; (cleric), often times two (cleric &amp; warrior) because it makes it easier for lesser tank classes to handle the job.  You say you want the trinity to die, but by gradually hasting mobs or having slow wear off, what you're doing is locking down yet another slot or two for a nuker/dps class.  That's great if you're a nuker like we are, but it sucks to be the bards, paladins, and other lower-dps classes of the world, whose potential to get in a group just dropped to 2/6ths instead of one half.<br>
<br>
Like I said, it's creative, but I think you're overlooking some pretty major drawbacks (or, inconveniences).  I think you've also forgotten the natural tendancy for EQ players to seek out the most optimal group configuration for the situation.  If mob dps starts to increase exponentially over the duration of a fight, it will lead even more groups to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>require</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the right tools to handle the new challenge, which is still the &quot;holy trinity.&quot;  And those people who are LFG on experience night are still left LFG. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dark-bane.com/mageloframes/sambusframe.htm">Sambus Veneficus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Secondly, Verant has changed around the roles of a lot of classes so many times that people no longer what they created their class for.  Paladins are now masters of quick heals.  After 2 years, Magicians are back to where they originally were as masters of utility damage.  Clerics have gained considerable offensive power and can now solo.  Druids have gone from a utility class to a nuking class and now a primary healing class with their new CH.  Just dumb stuff like that.  People created Necros, Druids, Wizards, and Mages to solo when they want to.  Now Verant doesn't want them to.  <br>
<br>
What gives?<br>
<br>
Thirdly, EQ is just unbalanced.  Verant is sitting on their ass with revamping old, useless zones, because they know people will be forced to buy PoP just to expand any further.  Hey guys, what a concept!  <br>
<br>
I'm all for companies making profits.  That's what allows me to own my 5.0 Mustang, take my girlfriend out to dinner, and buy stuff when I need to.  I'm not for changing the original concept of a game, the one that drew so many followers to begin with, for purely money making reasons.  <br>
<br>
I mean, for crying out loud.  Look at companies such as Enron.  Can we say Nvidia with it?  Don't people realize, and this is a far out statement, that with all this corporate greed maybe, just maybe, another 'French Revolution' may be on its way around?  <br>

It will naturally reset itself after 15 minutes of non-engagement, by which the mob would be &quot;calmed down&quot;. This aspect of my change I particularly like, it gives a whole new value to wizards and fast damage in general. No longer can you just pull 4 mobs, and have a shaman drop a slow on them while they stand there idle. No longer can you pull 6 mobs, and have a good enchanter lock them down with no consequences. Fast damage now is important, a class who can speed up the pace of their damage to quickly kill infuriated mobs will be a highly valuable asset to a group, as much so as any mezzer or slower. Slow and mez type spells will still be valuable, however fast damage will be equally valuable.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This would work as long as the whole function of 'social' mobs and level aggro are removed to prevent unwanted adds. Otherwise there will be a lot of 'unfair' called when something adds, enrages while mezed and proceeds to plow through the group like a bulldozer due to having to deal with the first mob they INTENTIONALLY pulled.   I like the idea, but current game mechanics would make quite a few zones totally unplayable because of constant adds.<br>
I honestly can't think of an alternative to prevent this problem for 'honest' adds but it would most certainly prevent groups from hogging spawns by pulling multiples and parking them nearby.<br>
<br>
I also have an idea of my own. Larger groups.  Increase the single potential group size to 8 or 10. This would make for extra 'whatever we can find' slots and still allow for the 'optimal' group of 6 or less. Many times I've logged on and found nothing but full groups. had they been slightly larger then there would have been a potential for at least one or two open spaces. (Or fewer larger and all full groups. Depends on how you view it) <br>
<br>
<br>
The only real way to get people to stop soloing and start grouping is to give better group XPs than solo XPs. It's that simple. Increase the group bonuses and give an XP penalty for not being grouped and you'll see it happen a LOT faster. The only reason I solo anymore is to farm or because I can't find a group. If solo Xps were (and I really hate to use this term but it applies) nerfed, MANY more groups would form just out of necessity. OR.. in lieu of this method, change the way experience is awarded in groups. Keep the current group bonus, but award experience as if you yourself had killed the mob for each person.<br>
<br>
example:<br>
<br>
level 35 Druid kites a single level 30 mob in approximately 3-4 minutes. (unsure of the exact time, but this is what I've been told by Druids that I know) It dies, the Druid receives 1000 XPs<br>
<br>
Group consisting of:<br>
35 Warrior, 35 Cleric, 35 Magician, 35 Druid, 35 Necromancer and 35 Wizard (I don't know the exact bonus for a full group, but for my example it will be 30%)<br>
Kills level 30 mob in approximately 1 minute. It dies, the group receives a total of 7800 XPs (Each character receiving 1300 or 1000   30% group bonus)<br>
<br>
Now.. Who would want to solo anymore? The only reason I could think of is wanting all the loot for yourself or farming. (and who farms anything above light blues anyway?)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>1) Verant doesn't like it.<br>
The new expansion was purposely designed so pop mobs were largely unsoloable by most classes. They hate soloing, and I don't blame them. It undermines the point of the game. This is a social game based on interdependency.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
If this were actually true, then why is it possible to solo at all? Also, why did they remove the 50% xp penalty for pet classes if they didn't out damage their pet when soloing? This seems to me that they WANTED us to be able to solo more effectively. I can't believe that they DON'T want soloing to exist. I think it's more like they just favor grouping. The problem is the bone wasn't big enough. Before PoP and after the pet XP fix, I made better XPs soloing than I EVER did grouping but I don't play to watch the number above my name increment, I play to have fun with my friends and meet new people. I HATE soloing, but after being forced to either solo or sit LFG for hours at a time, I chose soloing and just talk to my friends between their groups pulling mobs in the hopes that something will open up.<br>

Asking them to nerf it more is silly.  They can adjust the mob to how they feel the encounter deserves.<br>
<br>
1st spot: Warrior, Paladin, SK....Hybrids tank fine in exp group situations and are a pleasure to group with.  The warrior doesn't have a monopoly even though the mobs hit so hard. If you have one good tank might not be much more efficient to fill another spot with that tank.<br>
<br>
2nd spot: Shaman, Bard, Beastlord (they do just fine, see their upgrade), Enchanter.  If you have one slower, probably not as efficient to add another.<br>
<br>
3rd spot: Cleric Druid (shaman tend to fall behind ON HEALS (not mitigation) but it is possible but not as efficient)  Druids heal just fine now and are sought after<br>
<br>
4th 5th 6th slot: Beastlord(listed twice), Magician, Monk, Necro, Rogue, Wizard.   You have 6 classes that fit 3 spots.  It is most efficient to have damage in these spots.<br>
<br>
I am wondering why classes that focus on damage are whining.  Of couse the other classes are more needed but if one of their jobs is filled they have little chance to get in that group where damage dealers have 3 slots to choose from.  It evens out!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If magicians keep complaining after all the good that has been done to the class (one of the highest DPS and utility spells on top of it.   ie outdamaging a rogue as much as it is happening when they have no utility) they are going to in turn ask to be nerfed.<br>
<br>
Maybe we should just sit back and enjoy what we got.  The grass is always greener though!<br>

without reading all of the above posts...<br>
<br>
<br>
I LIKE solo work.    I used to play allot..  and solo worked while off time in a raiding guild.<br>
<br>
I PICKED the mage class almost 4 years ago BECAUSE it fits me.<br>
<br>
I deal with allot of people everyday at work, and it is NICE for some people to get away from that and able to SOLO.<br>
<br>
<br>
I do not think solo work is dead for mages.  I'm just above avg gear. with only 1 ft.  and boots   and 32 aa.  i find i can solo in pop ,,  mana intensive.  <br>
<br>
i'm 61.. i'll stay 61 or 62 to keep my old options avail while i slowly find new spells and work up some aa pts.<br>
<br>
I don't think it is dead,, is it the easiest route,, no, but for a good mage, it is still viable... time will tell.<br>

If you're trying to get people to group, I think the easiest way would be give xp rewards to groups based on the distinct types of classes in it.  A group already has a tank, healers, and slower?  Give them a big boost in xps for getting a couple of casters in there and give people plenty of places to camp.  Put orc camps, drachnid webs, etc. all over the place.<br>

If we could cast it on others, we'd be the best hasters in the game really. 80% haste and 40ATK? Who needs dragon haste items anymore, just get a magician!<br>
<br>
I do think the Phantom armor line should be castable on others, except for possibly Transons, but just put a 10hp/tick alternate spell (and keep transons just 4 per tick, but decrease mana cost to like 100) in it's place, or something like that.  <br>
<br>
Regardless, Magician damage, while very high, is hard to see. It will automatically bias people -against- us, because all they see is the lower conning pet whiffing more than they are, and they don't realize how much damage DS's do.  I personally think that verant should just show spell damage as along with melee. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:perpetua;font-size:x-small;"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=421973">Turzem Setanta</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->--<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower">Arch Mage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khalendor>Khalendor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 156<br> <font color=#333333>(11/21/02 7:27:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=410.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Increased utility a good idea?</span><hr size=1> Increasing experience sharing is the way to go.

I would tend to disagree, they created certain classes to with soloing in mind (ie the Necromancer).  Now they may have intended solo'ing in PoP to be limited to just the first few outer tier zones but I doubt they wanted to completely remove it as an option.

You do understand your looking at nerfing slowing and CC'ing classes so that you can enhance &quot;burst&quot; damage dealing classes?

I would greatly disagree with you about that.  While wizards may not be the greatest in groups they are among the strongest raiding classes (espcially in PoP) where their ability to turn out burst damage is a huge assest.  To ofset their weakness in groups they are among the finest of soloing classes.<br>
<br>
I understand that your trying to increase your (and other damage dealing casters) to groups but in the end I feel your suggestions would only make matters worse.  Looks to me like your just trying to juggle around the classes which make up the &quot;holy trinity&quot; and not really solving the problem.<br>
<br>
Too be honest, I am having less of an issue finding xp groups now in PoP then ever before and I am one of those rare Necromancers that hates soloing.  PoP, once again, redefined the Necromancer class and this time I actually like the new role.<br>

as a 63 mage i have no problems keeping a sustained dps on par with a rogue. even if its true most mages cant, mages would be valuable for their ability to deal fast damage as outlined in my post.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
I think your execution analogy, while somewhat similar is innaccurate. In the execution trial, you need only operate for 4 waves that last no more than 2 minutes each ( ~10 minutes, with the breaks and such ) and the boss, which you do not even need mana for. Thus, while we truly shine there, in an exp group situation we would have to keep the same DPS over an hour long period ( probably more ).<br>

see this is what i mean, youre trained to believe only sustained damage is valuable. max damage is NOT where the value of a nuke was meant to exclusively lie. fast damage was designed to have value in mitigating damage.<br>
if burst damage actually had a role in the exping world, like it does in the trial of execution, mages and other casters would be much, much more useful.<br>

Well, like i said. Its not my intent on having a group not being able to function unless they have a wizard/rogue/mag or anything. But they SHOULD have a reasonable group set up, damage wise, just as you would expect a group to have reasonable healing and damage mitigation. <br>
<br>
No one goes to pov without a tank, or a druid/cleric to heal, or a shaman/enchanter/bard, well then why shouldnt they go without at least a non-archery ranger calibur damage?<br>
<br>
Often times ive been in groups with two or three tanks, just because &quot;they were there&quot;. The group functioned just fine. That means offense has a more diminished role than it should, as an offensive class you should be really concerned about that. Its why we cant get groups easily.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Consider this extremely common scenario: it's an off night in your guild, and there are 2 druids, 1 mage, a paladin, and a bard LFG. Well, you have healers and a tank, bard slow/CC, and some dps, but this group will have a very obvious disadvantage against mobs that become gradually hasted over time (or un-slowed over time). They don't have the dps to kill faster, and while they may have the healing to cover the increase in damage, their downtime will be much greater due to the druid's lesser heals. Currently, at least with the bard's marginal slow and the druid's marginal CH, they can still manage to keep up a fair pace. Not optimal, but fair.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Yes i am aware that lack of dps will currently cause your group to already function inefficiently. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>But</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> not in the way that lack of healing, or lack of damage mitigation will. Thats a problem. You have classes like mages and rogues centered around <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> role, yet that role isnt as desirable as others? <br>
<br>
As for you other concern, well damage dealers are abundant. If at 1 am you cant find enough damage dealers in your guild, there are nearly always going to be some lfg. Damage dealers are the most common type of class. <br>

<br>
You SHOULD want a cleric healer over a druid. A druid SHOULD NOT be the more desirable, or equally desirable choice, as they do not specilize in healing as much as a cleric. I dont see the logic behind how you feel its fair that groups not desire a cleric more than a druid for healing, other than from a purely selfish perspective.<br>
Now dont get me wrong, a druid should be able to function reasonably well as a healer, and they currently do. Clerics should just be noticably better.<br>
The changes i suggest do help this happen. If mobs are doing more damage, they will be doing more damage even after slow, damage that must be healed.<br>
<br>
also, keep in mind, druids will be more valuable for damage mitigation due to their abilities to deal fast damage. so any value they lost as a healer they would make up as a nuker. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is real balance, all your major abilities being useful as much as you specilize in them.<br>

The fact slowing can totally trivialize several roles (nevermind classes) proves its way to powerful relative to its <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>environment</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (key word). <br>
The solution is to simply increase mob damage, as i suggest. This retains the importance of all classes in question (the healer, tank, and slower)<br>

First of all, the literal meaning of holy trinity is inacurate, i think thats what your stuck on. I dont think anyone believes they absolutely need an enchanter, warrior, or cleric. They of course desire them above other classes who perform similiar roles, and they should since they specilize in them so much. But no one actually needs them.<br>

you dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a warrior tank, but you do need a tank (pal sk too).<br>
you dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> an enchanter to mitigate damage, but you do need damage mitigation (shaman, or bard too. and  depending on the camp in question a druid, necro, or wizard may be a suitable replacement asd well)<br>
you dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a cleric healer, but you do need a healer (druid, or even sometimes a shaman).<br>
<br>
the term holy trinity, in the sense that you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>need</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> three vital roles filled and nothing else matters is true, and will always be true. <br>
<br>
I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>like</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the fact that you need those 3 roles filled, i dont want that changed. I would like to make the other 3 roles equally important.<br>

Anyway I have to say I totally disagree with your ideas. I think things are just fine right now. I think you are down playing the power of burst dps. I have said many times that in a experience group with a wizard kills are faster then with a rogue. With all the new mana regen spells that classes have, in a group setting a wizard easily replaces a rogue, same goes for mages. Soloing isn't hated by Verant, and they have never said that. Please post the link to back up that statement. Verant hated the fact that people could gain experience better soloing then grouping so they put in things to change that and it has hurt some soloing classes.<br>

However the experience reward in PoP is so great that it offsets really the ability to solo. There is much more to do in EQ then experience and when not able to get a group people should quest or work on trade skills. Those features are in the game for a reason. I solo just fine in UP right now and once i get more aa I will be back to gaining experience like I did before. I think the solo issue is a concern but being overplayed. <br>
<br>
All classes play a role in grouping, and burst dps is even more important do to mobs low hps. I don't have much of a problem getting a group so I really don't understand why the need to nerf slow ect...I happen to like soloing and it kills the time when I just don't want to group. I solo just fine in UP with just the level 61 spells. Grab a kei, buff up the 61 air pet and go to work. People need to be more inventive.  Also you have to understand that PoP isnt the only place to gain experience now. With the increased levels places like HoT become farming territory for a 6 man group. Same with jugs in sebillis and shrooms. The caves in UP are hella experience even now and are trivial do to the new burst dps of casters. Please look at the entire picture. There is more to EQ then PoP.<br>
