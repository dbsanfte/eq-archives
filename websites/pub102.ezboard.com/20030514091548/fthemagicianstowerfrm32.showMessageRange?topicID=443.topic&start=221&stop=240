All that tells me is what i already thought, that charm has been broken since day 1 of eq. Your logic is flawed, just because something has always been a certain way doesnt mean that something is right. <br>
<br>
Enchanters specilize in mitigating damage, that means more so than any other class an enchanter is best suited to reducing the rate at which damage is inflicted. <br>
A class which easily weilds the most potent weaponry to reduce dps of enemies should not also be dealing the most dps -- end of story, there is no arguing this most basic truth about the game. In case you didnt notice, everquest is a massive <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>multiplayer</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> online game. That means groups of players are supposed work together to achieve common goals; players are supposed to work <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>together</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to defeat environmental challenges for progress. <br>
If one class (enchanters) can minimize enemy dps the best, and also deal it the best, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>this class is not dependant on anyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> since practically everything they need to succeed they have access to personally. This class is then a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>god class</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, and all other classes are just a burden on them.<br>
<br>
If you cannot see for this reason that it is beyond flawed that the best damage mitigator also is the best damage dealer, i cant help you out, sorry. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That is why I created one, not to become a buff bot! It's dipchit comments like this that annoy me more than the cry's for nerfing! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
*rubs temples*<br>
1) I do not believe for a second you created your enchanter for the sole purpose of charming, or dealing damage.<br>
<br>
2) Even if you did, you are by far the minority of enchanters. Thats like a mage saying they created their character to summon food. Charming never was and never will be the main focus of the class.<br>
<br>
3) Your logic is again, flawed. Just because some of us believe enchanters shouldnt be dealing damage well doesnt mean we want to relegate you into a position of a buff bot. Its like if i said something wasnt black, you go and tell me im trying to say its white when it in fact <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>could</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be red, blue, green, purple, or any number of shades. Its not our intent to make anyone unhappy and there is no reason for you to accuse us of wishing this, other than of course as a tactical distraction.<br>
 <br>
4)It has always been collectively understood the enchanters main role was in crowd control, or more specificly in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>minimizing the rate at which foes deal damage</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Enchanters do this the best, there is no arguing this fact. Want to argue it? OK fun! Lets take a little quiz shall we?<br>
<br>
You are a cleric. Youre in a group camping pov. Your group consists of yourself, a mage, a rogue, a sk, and a wizard. Every time your group battles a monster, you spend alot of mana repairing the damage your party is taking from enemies. Mobs are doing so much dps, that if you get a few adds, your group could wipe out since you just cant heal fast enough or long enough!<br>
<br>
Dont worry though, you have one spot left for another class. Obviously, your group needs someone to minimize the rate enemies deal damage. What class do you prefer to get?<br>
Since i know this is a tough quiz, well at least its tough if you are pretending that enchanters are only good at buffing besides charming, here is a hint: The class also does the most damage!<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>People may believe they have a case for asking for a nerf but please do NOT tell me that I am not supposed to be a damage dealer, when I know that I will continue to be (in most situations) a better damage dealer than any other class in EQ, nerf or no nerf! <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
COOL BEANS! Can i be like you?<br>
I'm going to start a cleric i think. Im not going to be like most clerics though... im going to ignore all those dozens and dozens of powerful spells like &quot;divine light&quot; and &quot;complete heal&quot; and &quot;heal over times&quot;. Instead, im going to flip right back to the last page in my book and get out my hammer spell and GO TO TOWN! <br>
<br>
When people try to tell me my classes job is to repair hp, and they wonder why im not healing, im going to tell them to GET LOST AND STOP STEREOTYPING ME! I made my cleric to TANK! I mean its totally obvious clerics are supposed to be melees. Clerics have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>always</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> been a plate class, and just recently we were given hammers AND bash -- if that doesnt say clerics were supposed to heal the best AND tank the best i dont know what does. No amount of &quot;common sense&quot; is going to change my mind.<br>
<br>
Fight the power, my friend! Your enchanter can be anything it wants to be! <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 1/11/03 10:37:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fizzlekin>Fizzlekin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(1/11/03 10:56:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=223>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> If everyone could just grow up, we wouldn't have these silly threads polluting our boards.

Did this change to enchanters at all hurt mages?  No, it didn't.  It made them no less desirable and no more so.  It had no adverse effects on your class, and yet, you find reasons to complain.<br>

I wish people would stop whining because there might be a chance that their class isn't the best.<br>

<br>
It is true that no class should be all around amazing.  Yet, you cannot make a judgement call on what a class is supposed to do.  Things like that change so much, and idiocy like that is exactly what was used against mages after our roles changed to rod whores.  It is amazing how quickly you forget what has happened to our class in the past.<br>
<br>
Enchanters never meant to use charm for good, consistent dps?  Who is to say that stun, root, haste, ac buffs, etc were not meant as aids to charm?  You make that call now because its convient for you, though it is not really for you to say.  As for no one making enchanters to charm..I know when I started playing that I played an enchanter alongside my mage a bit solely for charm..and I know others that have too. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, as has been stated, enchanters have been charming since the dawn of time.  It is rather sad that some of you are just now catching on to this.  Though, it shouldn't be too big a surpise... people are generally too ignorant to see something before someone a bit more observant points it out to them.  Nice job only seeing it after a few years, you are right on cue!  <br>
<br>
Some of you are so vindictive, childish and short sighted its amazing.  Yes, perhaps there is a problem with charm, perhaps, but the way some of you sound is wholely sad.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   &quot;If enchanters can have an ability they always have, I want slow, kei, etc..!!!!&quot;  Come on, lets be serious here.  This is a statement reserved for people 6 and under, so unless you fit that bill...lets not use it again.<br>
<br>
Now, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the charm line itself.  If any problem exists, it is the way mobs scale up and the power they got in pop.  Handicapping charm so it cannot be used is no more acceptable then mages not being able to use pets.  The only viable solution I can see that would keep some of you .........people... happy and not totally ruin it would be to make it so charmed mobs have a max hit cap..something along the lines of &quot;Wake the Dead&quot; except not quite as gimpy.  I believe that has been suggested before, and it is the only remotely decent thing offered up as something resembling a real idea.  <br>
<br>
Finally, its quite sickening how some of you throw around the word balance only when its convient and never when it is going to hurt you.  This campaign to keep enchanters balanced within roles and skills should be equally leveled against our own class if you truly care about balance.  Though our charm and mez are ,perhaps, not overpowering, someone who cares so much about balance within roles and skills would also have to demand the removal of these two from our line up.  I remember when we first saw them.. &quot;Oh, I don't think we should get them, but its nice so I want it.&quot;  Yes, some of you have conceded that if charm is nerfed you could accept ours being nerfed too, but with the fervor that you are showing against enchanters, you should be willing to accept nothing less then the total removal of the spells.  <br>
<br>
Oh, and lets not forget mages asking for slow now..and christ someone even mentioned 75%.  Welcome to the wonderful world of hypocrisy.  &quot;Hi, enchanters cannot be the best at mitigating and doing damage, but hell I sure want to be!&quot;  Bleh, whatever.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skidogg>SkiDogg</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(1/11/03 11:41:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=226>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And where the heck did you read that?

<br>
If charmers can reliably sustain three times the damage of non-charming damage dealers in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with ordinary risk and support costs, then charmers will be chosen as damage dealers to the exclusion of non-charming damage dealers, and in particular melees.<br>
<br>
My interests are not served by such a broken, lopsided game.  Even if <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">I</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> get <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Call of the Archmage</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and that lets me do 300-700 DPS, the game is broken.<br>
<br>
It is far more than just mages, although as damage dealers we are especially concerned.<br>
<br>
While <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Noonie</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s attitude is pushing the acceptable limits, her argument is sound.  If the best damage mitigation class is also the best damage dealing class, and damage mitigation and damage dealing are the only two basic functions required for a group, then enchanters are a god class.<br>
<br>
I have seen nothing from any enchanter that begins to counter this argument.<br>

Everyone has their own opinion, and that is perfectly fine.  Some people are happy playing their class day in and day out, not trying to police the rest of EQ.  Others feel the need to spout off at every opportunity and try to get other classes nerfed.<br>
<br>
You know, the charm issue may be unbalancing.  It may upset the balance that classes have now, but in the end it isnt your problem.  Verant has handeled most situations fairly well, trying to balance 13 unique classes is no small task.  People whining because they dont think it is fair doesnt help anything, you think Verant doesnt know whats happening?  Complaining and degrading other peoples class has an adverse effect on the community.  It turns into a constant game of tug-a-war with one class degrading the other one some extremely petty issues.<br>

<br>
If you are hurt because another class gets picked over you, id think you need to find a new game.<br>
<br>
My characters used to get passed up because of certain things all the time.  Id play my necro and get denied groupage because they needed a tank, or how about my druid getting passed up because they needed a &quot;real&quot; nuker like a wizard.<br>
<br>
This is a game, people take certain classes because thats what they want and or need.  If you believe that your class should be invited to a group over any other class all the time,  you are wrong.   Even if the other class gets invited because you lack one spell or skill that it has.<br>
<br>
Quoting someone off of a board, in one isolated instance, proves absolutely nothing.<br>
<br>
In the end it sucks, it isnt ever fun to have someone else picked over you for a group.  Its like the poor kid who was last to be picked for the team.  Thats the way life is, there always has to be someone picked last or not included.  Its not the same persone every time, especially in EQ.  It all depends on curcumstances.  You just have to suck it up and move on, if you let something like that get you down you'll have a hard time dealing with LIFE!<br>

No no, you misunderstand what i meant. Im not upset that i wasnt chosen. If they had picked a wizard, a rogue, or even a monk instead of me, i wouldnt be happy of course but i wouldnt have thought anything was unfair/unbalanced. Those are all damage dealing classes.<br>
<br>
I am upset when people start to get lfg enchanters with cod before they do mages and other damage dealers. Enchanters are not and should not be a better choice for damage dealing than a mage, ever. When they are, its obvious there is no reason to play a damage dealer and no reason not to play an enchanter. End of discussion.<br>

Again, this goes back to my point i was trying to make. A necro isnt going to get chosen over a warrior or sk for a tank, nor should he be. A necro isnt going to get chosen over a wizard or druid for a nuker, because those classes are supposed to do that better.<br>
<br>
However, if someone chooses a mage over a necro for say, dotting, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>there is a problem</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Do you see my point? Mages are supposed to be one of, if not the most damaging class in the game yet a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>non offensive</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> class like an enchanter can do multiple times the damage of a mage. No one who knows what they are doing would ever pick a mage over a knowledgable enchanter for damage, and no one <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>does</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
This makes my game play unenjoyable. This <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>is</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> my problem. <br>

Somethings wrong when you &quot;want or need&quot; an enchanter before any other class for every role except healer.<br>

Im sorry actually none of the dps classes should be picked over by an enchanter in that role. Its wrong plain and simple. Even if enchanters didnt have charm they would still be one of the most sought after group classes in the game.<br>
<br>
They have the best mana regen buffs for other, the best crowd control spells, the best haste spells, and are the second best slowers in the game. You add in CoD pets they are the best damage dealing class in the game.<br>
<br>
How as a Magician am I going to compete with that. I already have to compete with rogues, monks, rangers and wizards for the dps group slots and all have their ups and downs and they cant compete with what an enchanter brings to the table above and beyond dps with the exception of maybe a monk for their pulling skills.<br>
<br>
You enchanters thinking that we are just envious your wrong, I think a lot of Magicians are down right pissed off about it. Magicians have nothing going for us besides dps, we have no needed group buffs, we have no form of damage mitigation, we have no form of crowd control, hell we even had our ability to transfer mana nerfed to near uselessness. On top of all that before when we were unhappy about our situation people would say then go solo but guess what PoP has pretty much made us SoL in that department as well. <br>
<br>
Before you all start trying to defend something like CoD take a close look at the class your defending it against and maybe you could understand why magicians are unhappy. <br>
<br>
When one class is incredibly good at multiple roles that is overpowering. Jeez you are a class that groups seek out without CoD quite often dont you see that, while other classes that have no choice but to be lfg have to sit for at times is hours before they get invited to a group and here you all are being one of the best grouping classes in the game also becoming one of the best soloing classes in the game. <br>

Talk about flawed logic! You would be laughed at and rightly so. The difference here is that clerics are not tanks, were never meant to be and are unlikey ever to be.

Nothing wrong at all with healthy discussions/arguments just so long as people stick to the facts. Problem is the facts get twisted, exagerated and then half truths get added then just plain lies.

In the real eq world ie. average gear and hp, CoD is (IMHO)reasonably well balanced, since I got it I am having a LOT of fun, but am dying lots also. Yes I have tried some BoT named solo, score so far stands at BoT 5 me 0. What we have done is taken down some with a full group as support where the group would have had no hope of obtaining the drops without CoD, leaving them for more &quot;uber&quot; players than us. If you call that game breaking then so be it, but I am finding it refreshing.<br>

Just my opinion though, and we all know what opinions are like.<br>

Actually, its really not arguable if you look at the spell lists. Enchanters are simply much better than shaman at mitigating damage, even in a non multi-pull situation.<br>
<br>
Enchanters have:<br>
-single target fixed duration stuns (mez)<br>
-ae fixed duration stuns (mez)<br>
-single target stuns<br>
-pbae stuns<br>
-rune shields<br>
-root<br>
-fear<br>
-blind<br>
-slow a negligable % less efficient than a shaman<br>
<br>
Shaman have:<br>
-slow negligable % better than enchanters<br>
-root<br>
-blind<br>
<br>
Even though shaman slow is a little better, an enchanter can make up for that difference through stuns (to mitigate damage imediately), and mez spells (to mitigate more damage over time -- tell me that youve ever been in a group without at least <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>one</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> add?)<br>
<br>
Enchanters are clearly the class you <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>want</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to be in your group if mobs are doing alot of damage. Shaman are definately second best, but an enchanter is alot better. <br>
<br>
Besides, even if you were right, and even if shaman were a little better at mitigating damage -- whats your point? Shaman dps is pretty horrible. In long duration fights, if they expend <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>all</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mana <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>and</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> time resources on dealing damage, they might be able to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>compete</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with some more offensive oriented classes. <br>
But surely you can see the difference between 120 dps from a shaman chronically cannibilizing, spending all his time to dealing damage, and an enchanter who can with ease routinely outdamage <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>several</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rogues, while still being free to do other things (cc, buffs, ect)? Even if shaman were a small percentage better than enchanters at mitigating damage (though i disagree), the fact that enchanters have 10 times their damage dealing ability proves there is a serious balance problem. <br>
<br>
You know, when most people think of powerful classes, shaman is usually really high on the list. The fact enchanters make shaman look underpowered says alot dont you think?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Not quite true, I need heals (lots), I need rezzes (lots), to be able to fight anywhere I wish to have fun I need at least one other pet class, and preferably two (for summoning mobs) so all of a sudden I need a 4 or 5 man group.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I assume by pet class you mean charm class. The fact that you can so easily keep a mob as an ally that you now refer to other charmers and yourself as a &quot;pet class&quot; only proves what we have been saying, the &quot;risk&quot; associated with charm is highly over rated and the reward completely overwhelms it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>That is utter bullshit and you know it! I know we are never going to agree on this but Charm is an enchanters core ability, alongside damage mitigation, much like mages pets and nukes. Removing our charm would be akin to removing your nukes.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Ok, ill just take your word for it and believe that you made your enchanter primarily to charm and deal damage.<br>
<br>
See, damage mitigation, and damage dealing, are polar opposite abilities. Never should one class be able to do both as well as enchanter can, at the same time. Now if a class has to comit themselves to either or, but do neither really the best even with full comitment, thats not so bad (such as in the case of a bard, or a shaman). <br>
That is why your comparison to a mage is flawed. Nuking and summoned pets are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>harmonious</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> abilities - they both are damage dealing. That is why we are able to do both at the same time. <br>
Damage mitigation and damage dealing however is like the equivilant of giving a warrior the ability to instant cast ch himself. Its just ridiculously overpowered. <br>
<br>
Either enchanters must give up some of their abilities to mitigate damage or some of their abilities to deal damage. Keeping both as they are is just not a realistic possiblity if you care about game balance even a little bit. <br>
The reason i and many others lean towards keeping an enchanters abilities to mitigate damage is, because it seems that is closer to their intended niche in the game. Of an enchanters spells the overwhelming majority are supportive in nature, slows, stuns, debuffs, buffs, ect. <br>
<br>
It appears that potent damage dealing seems to be largely an untinended side effect of wreckless design of the charm line. More than likely, charm was supposed to be situational, and that it was never intended for enchanters to keep mobs as pets.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Wrong! Crowd control is one of our main roles, besides charm in many zones is often one of the only form's of crowd control! ie, unmezzable/unrootable mobs.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is what i feel the real purpose of charm is -- to add a little temporary damage to your party, and to cc mobs who cant be cced through traditional means. Like, when fighting giant mobs or if your party isnt assisting, or if you could really use some extra quick dps, that sort of thing. Thats why its an enchanters ability, since it is more than likely intended to be a tool to reduce dps primarily, while offering <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>temporary</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dps for your party.<br>
<br>
Lets be honest, if it really was intended to be a big dps tool why was it given to enchanters? Why not primarily to mages, wizard, necromancers, or druids, all classes who are signifigantly less oriented in support?<br>
<br>
The fact you also recognize charm as a crowd control tool offers proof this was the main, or at least a major intent of the spell line.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
Talk about flawed logic! You would be laughed at and rightly so. The difference here is that clerics are not tanks, were never meant to be and are unlikey ever to be. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
As obvious as it is to you that a cleric is created to heal and not tank, it is equally as obvious to everyone else that an enchanter was created to mitigate damage and not be a damage dealer.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
On the other hand enchanters are THE best damage dealers in the game and one of the best damage mitigators. EQ gives us the tools to do both. NB. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Again, like i said in my first post, just because something is a certain way <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>doesnt</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mean it was intended, and/or it doesnt mean its right. <br>
<br>
A few decades ago in some places in this country, blacks werent allowed to use the same rest rooms as white people. If you went into these areas and asked white people if it was right, they would probably shrug their sholders and say &quot;yes&quot; and/or &quot;thats the way its always been&quot;. In hindsight, we can clearly see this was not right, and not fair.<br>
<br>
You say charm is intended as a tool to do hundreds of dps from for an enchanter, fairly permenantly, and you also &quot;believe&quot; verant intended this. Well then, either the designer of the spell was severely retarded to implement something so unbalancing, or charm was/is poorly designed. <br>
Given sony/vis track record im going to say the latter (although retardation would explain alot :P)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I am not stating that this is right or fair but it is the reason I play an enchanter.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
So after all this rambling, i find your real intentions. You dont care if its fair, you dont care about balance, nor are you really comenting on this. <br>
You just enjoy being able to do the only two functions which are needed in eq, pretty much the best. You resent people trying to &quot;nerf&quot; your god class. Grats on being honest, but your arguements credibility just pretty much took a nose dive (if it ever had any in the first place). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A
