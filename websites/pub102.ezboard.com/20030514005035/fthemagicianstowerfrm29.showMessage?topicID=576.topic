<br>
Good to see you're moving up!<br>
<br>
Firepets are pretty maniacal if you get the right ones...I got a 52 fire in KC yesterday that was chainstunning on everything. I was using it to mez mobs it did it so much.<br>
<br>
I've been watching you since you were level 57, and I was level 14...Sitting on my little arse in Oasis of Marr. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=qaedainmagikot>Qaedain Magikot</A> at: 7/16/02 8:32:08 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=brayns>Brayns</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#333333>(7/16/02 8:37:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   To Stun or Not to Stun... (FirePet in FG)</span><hr size=1> Amusing, simply amusing.  So these Mushrooms have giants reach??<br>
<br>
&quot;A small mushroom hits you for 35 points of damage&quot;<br>
<br>
This was clue 1 that you forged this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;you have slain a small mushroom&quot;<br>
<br>
Theres clue 2 that you forged this.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;a small mushroom was hit by non melee dmg&quot; blah blah<br>
<br>
was clue 3.<br>
<br>
In the first example, if you were in targets melee reach, then you were in range to pick up your pets melee dmg. Yet you could have had melee turned off. So initially I ignored this.<br>
<br>
So I keep looking at your &quot;log&quot; You have slain a mushroom, you have gained xp.  This could have been overlooked since sometimes your rain spell dmg will come after the xp, but generally, it's after the you have slain and before the xp.  Again I overlooked this initially.<br>
<br>
I found it odd that you took melee damage inbetween wave 1 and wave 2 of your rain.  Not before and Not after.  This would suggest that you moved into melee range, inbetween wave 1 and 2, yet it was close enough to wave 2 that you should have still been in melee range during wave 2, thus taking dmg.<br>
<br>
I know, you want me to believe that the mushroom moved to you, to hit you and you had to run back out of melee range.  Ahh but if he had moved to you, then he should have been out of the rains range for wave 2.<br>
<br>
Then I notice the 150 dmg 150 dmg on both these waves, and thought hmmmmmmmm.  Wasn't the 150dmg rain a lvl 34 spell? Ok maybe 39.  Well yeah you could have gotten a low hitting wave, and you could have gotten 2 low hitting waves in a row for the exact same damage.  Then I see the MOST important thing.<br>
<br>
<br>
YOU NEVER CAST THE SPELL!!!!!!<br>
<br>
No where in there did it say, you begin to cast a spell, it says pet casting it says mob casting, it shows your spell dmg.<br>
<br>
Or do you want me to believe you have all melee off except for mob hitting you.  You have all casting on except for yours?  I don't remember seeing a button to turn my spell casting off (then again why would I turn mine off).  To top it off you want me to believe you are casting the lvl 39 rain with your 58 fire.  Could you not look up the spells before you forged this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=qaedainmagikot>Qaedain Magikot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 723<br> <font color=#333333>(7/16/02 8:41:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: To Stun or Not to Stun...

Sorry for acting with haste braddox is probably right, since the non melee was more than like a monk disc, as it wasn't our rain txt.  <br>
<br>
I appologise for jumping on the poster, and now I feel like a moron.  I saw non melee dmg with txt underneath and instantly thought rain dmg.  My sincerest and humblest appology, I would edit my first post here, but after erroneously jumping on the person, I feel I should leave it so you can all flame me (which is what I deserve).<br>
<br>
Qaedain Magikot, no if the monk was wielding a weap that proced a rain, the monk would have been hit by a wave.  Which is another reason I was sure it was fake.  The txt under the non melee damage does not match the rain txt, which shows my ignorance and haste in flamming.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=brayns>Brayns</A> at: 7/16/02 9:00:35 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uanauggi.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anauggi</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(7/16/02 9:07:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=576.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.avvisione.com/oni/oni2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ok sheeesh</span><hr size=1> Was from the monk's screen.
