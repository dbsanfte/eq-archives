  <br>
 The Hole:  It works great and allows us mages to solo the Ele warriors one at a time even though there are 7 of them at the entrance. (Bad place to solo though as res is all but impossible)<br>
<br>
 Trakanon teeth:  There are a few camps of Iksar and spectral Commanders/Keepers and others. These can be pulled Independently using Nullify Magic. I have done it so many times that I forgot that camp could actually kill me. My pet got too close one time and the camp rushed me, If I didn’t have Jboots I would have been dead. I just got Level 53 the other night Soloing these Specs commanders.<br>
<br>
 Sebilis:  At the Pyramid I convinced my group to let me try using Nullify (They were all friends) they said sure but they may not be able to save me, I said Im willing to risk it as long as you guys dont get mad at me.<br>
<br>
 I did it on a Shaman and it Pulled Both the Shaman and the Wizard. Unfortunately I did NOT con im sorry to say. (Stupid move I know)<br>
<br>
 So It didnt work in Sebilis on the Froks. I was going to try it on the Bugs but they were all dead then we pulled them one at a time so I never got the chance.<br>
<br>
Other Places I have used it successfully: <br>
<br>
  Dreadlands: <br>
  The spider nests, there is a HUGE one with tons of stuff in it blue to 51-52. I could easily pull them one at a time even when they were RIGHT next to each other (Read: Touching each other). <br>
<br>
  Burning Woods: <br>
    The giant fortress has several mobs in there. I have used it to pull a single out of the crowd, and tried it on one that was WAY in the back that had to run past the rest. It worked like a charm.<br>
<br>
<br>
 SolB: <br>
  I have pulled LDCs and Death Beatles using Nullify there and has given me the ability to solo there as well. I have not tried the Imps YET.. But I will Soon. If it worked it would be conceivabl that a 51+ Mage could SOLO all the way to the Efreeti! - Although I have my expectations LOW for this idea. <br>
<br>
 Karnors: <br>
 I have soloed near the jail using Nullify, there are a few mobs in the open area and I can split them with ease.<br>
<br>
<br>
 OOT: <br>
 Seafuries. I know they are not linked but they are close none the less. I have not tried on the Specs though unfortunately.<br>
<br>
 So basically this is a tool to consider, In many of these situation it would be best for me to try it also using Malice, but I have been so set on Nullify that I have not Risked it. I will need to try that some more.<br>

<br>
 Just please be careful, it works on all the ones I have listed and Almost in every situation i have tried. It should be noted that all mobs that it works on are blue to me. I have not tested it with yellow or reds (Not easy to find them anymore).<br>
<br>
 Please be careful, Get an SOW and /or SOW pots before you try it. Also stand at the Spells Maximum Distance. This way if it fails you have a nice head start.<br>
<br>
Also Please report your success and failures here with the Mob con if you can get it.<br>

Expanding on this, rather than add a new reply:  The named giant has little or nothing to do with it.

Well, Now I’m not so sure. I tried pulling the same Spectral Commander from the Iksar camp in Trakanon, using a DD spell. I was able to pull a single.<br>
<br>
<br>
 So Now I’m just confused. It must either be the Mage Level or may just be mobs linked that makes it happen. I’m not really sure at this point.<br>
<br>
  Anyway I will test more, but Just wanted to say that I am less certain of the reason. Perhaps we should just keep a running list of great camps that we can pull singles?<br>
<br>
 As far as the giant fort in BW, I’m not sure if the named has to do with it or not I’m sorry to say. I think I leads to the conclusions that it all has to do with mobs being linked or not. The current explanation I’m leaning towards. Anyway, I thought I was on to something, and wanted to share it with my Mage brethren but I could have just been wrong. I will have to continue the tests. Happy Hunting !<br>

Looking at your list there, I haven't fought all the mobs you tried, but just scanning over what i've seen in the past, there are some mobs we know assist, such as Giants for example, always assist, never not seen them assist when i've nuked pull or malised pull, Malosi should make no difference, its just an upgrade. So that is something else to keep in mind, another thing, If a mob is red, yellow, white, blue, black, whatever! short of low green at the higher levels, if the mob previously assisted it will assist now, the only time mobs stop assisting is whenever they are low enough green to you, which is uncertain just how low that is<br>
ie.  I pulled MG's and tumps at 25, hillocks were white tumps were red, when i pulled one to close to the other they assisted, at 34 i pulled Tumps and hillocks, both were blue, when i pulled a tump or hillock i'd aggro others if they were nearby, at 39 Tumps were blue and green, hillocks were green, If i pulled tumps, other tumps around assited usually, if i pulled a tump next to a hillock, or a hillock next to a hillock the hillock didn't assist, if pulled a hillock next to a tump, the tump would asist, when i was 44, tumps and hillocks were all green, if i pulled a tump or hillock nothing assisted...<br>
Now that story is not entirely certain i can't remember what levels i was before all of em were green or not, but the point is, until a mob is low green it will ALWAYS assist if it assisted previously, so if your fighting any mobs that are xp to you, and they do already ASSIST take out any assumption that your level has anything to do with how well this works, <br>

<br>
Not true.<br>
<br>
I can zone into Charsis and pull anyone of the 8 Golems, which are paired on each wing, with a single nuke.  All of the golems are blue to me.  A lower level member cannot.<br>
<br>
In Sebilis, I can pull a lot of singles that lower level members cannot and they are blue to me.

The assist radius of a mob shrinks as you grow in levels relative to it. The same is true of agro radius, as the mob gets greener and greener to you, you can get closer and closer to it without agroing it, until its finally so low green that it never agros (except for certain types of mobs which are always agressive).<br>
<br>
So in your example the golems are spaced widely enough that their assist radii don't overlap. Another person, lower leveled than you, may not be able to do the same thing.<br>
<br>
'Pulling' refers to putting oneself on the hate list of a mob so that it pursues. The problem is that mobs that are in assist radius of each other are constantly sharing their hate lists with each other (i.e. if you are on one mob's hate list it will share you with the other mob and you'll be on both hate lists). Nullify is an offensive spell (i.e. it generates hate). I don't know of any other case where a spell can generate hate that isn't sharable. In other words, hate is hate, and it shouldn't really matter what spell you used to put yourself on the hate list, once you're on it you'll get added to other mobs within assist radius.<br>
<br>
There are some caveats to the above. There are mobs which simply don't assist each other. Usually this is a case of 2 mobs of different races (i.e. the goblins in frontier mts. never assist the other types of mobs in that zone, but the burynai do). Also, there are some strange cases where pathing prevents mobs from assisting. A simplistic case is the gnolls in Highpass. If you're on the ledge you can fight gnolls and the gnolls below won't assist.<br>
<br>
I believe many of the examples of Nullify pulling single mobs are really a case of the level difference of the puller, or strange pathing issue which is preventing mobs from assisting. Level difference is a well known factor in pulling. Level 55 pullers can pull most of Karnors solo, Level 60 pullers can pull dars and jin solo in Sebelis.<br>
<br>
The Bard song Kellin's Lugubrious Lament is an interesting tool, it reduces the assist radius of a mob so that a Bard can Lament the mobs around a mob and then pull the mob. In an xp camp Bards who know how to use this tool make excellent pullers because they can break a room of up to 4 mobs with that song.<br>

They do help each other when I aggro one though.  It seems that the null pulling generates a smaller assist radius or something because when I use it to pull spiders etc that are next to each other it works too.  Maybe because half of them are green though, never know. <p><body text=50/100/10> <hr><b><IMG SRC= http://www.geocities.com/windkull/nanamarSig.jpg></b><br>

<br>
I tried this &quot;tactic&quot; out, hoping against hope that it works using the first in its line of spells, cancel magic.  I was at the infamous ramp in SK, pulling birdies who are rather social.  I was 22nd at the time, (still am, considering I managed to zone), there was a pretty rook and not so pretty avocet standing at the bottom of the ramp.  Considering they're about 2 bird distance from each other I figured I'd pull the rook, since nobody else but a druid or chanter is going to try it &lt;g&gt;.  Well, it didn't quite work out, the rook was a high blue and of course the avocet was decidedly red.  The aggro range may have been too high on the Avo for this &quot;technique&quot; to work.  Not sure if this info helps any of you gents out, but I felt that it needed to be shared.  Going to try some more &quot;xp gain&quot; testing.  No point in using it against greens, so low blue's to even's to yellows.  Apparently REDS will be pulled nomatter what hate-listing spell you use.  Considering the level of the mages that posted before me, would you gentlemen even FIND a group of yellow's to test this lvl/aggro theory out?<br>

Im pretty sure that applies as far back as 52...not sure if that scales down from there or not.  Sooo, in seb, you can single pull the mobs just so long as all the mobs in the cluster around the one you are pulling are 10 levels lower than you or more.  They can be ontop of eachother and this rule applies.<br>
<br>
As for nullify, its the second least aggro means of pulling.  Distance aggro pulling is the least aggroing, but is difficult to judge if you are going to add more than 1 due to your distance.  Dedbuffing the mob (tash/malo/slow) is the next lowest aggro on pull (mind you Im talking about aggro shared, not aggro generated on the mob).  Lastly damaging the mob is the highest aggro.<br>
<br>
Everything is aggro distance based.  If two mobs are on top of eachother, and you are 10+ levels higher, you can single pull.  If they are slightly apart, 9 levels higher and annual will probably work.  If you nuked when they were only slightly apart, you will probably get both.  The closer or lower that the level of the mob, the larger the shared aggro range is on that mob when aggroed.<br>
<br>
Kinda long winded, but thats how aggro works. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urazha.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Razha</A> at: 6/19/02 9:31:05 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uttamartificer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ttam Artificer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(6/26/02 12:55:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Pulling</span><hr size=1> Remember also.....your spell casting inherantly produces a certain amount of aggro ....i.e casting next to a mob will aggro the mob.....i know this is true with nukes but uncertain about null...will give it a shot tonight. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umariomax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MarioMax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(7/1/02 7:54:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=71.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   NOT with Underbulks!</span><hr size=1> 47 Mage trying to pull Underbulks in Echo Caverns.
