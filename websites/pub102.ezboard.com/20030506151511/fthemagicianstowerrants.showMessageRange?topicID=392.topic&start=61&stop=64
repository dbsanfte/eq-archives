<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>First off all i did was point out that complaining about something you are doing yourself is the same as going to mcdonalds everyday for lunch and saying 'god mcdonalds sucks, only an idiot would eat this food' and still going back the next day.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
haha please do quote where i <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>first</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> call <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>anyone</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a moron without being called cluessless or trolling first... <br>
<br>
2ndly ... you sir ... just .... nm.... i will leave the insults out.. <br>
an example of why your comparison is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>silly</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
i.e. if a teacher gets hire as teacher but given a janitarial job( and just so happens all teachers are given jenaitorial jobs now) you will tell the teacher... go get another job.. stop complaining to get your old job back.<br>
<br>
rather to complain or not is the said teacher's personal choice.. and you by <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>attacking</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> such is attacking said person's viewpoint.. which there can be no right or wrong... <br>
<br>
But ... if you want to indulge in a flame battle.... i am more than happy to give you a war. <br>
<br>
because your statement telling people to <br>
&quot;shut up you moron, stop complaining&quot; <br>
<br>
is equally as stupid as I telling you ,&quot;f off and mindyour own business you F**g*t&quot;... <br>
pardon me for putting it so bluntly .... just pointing out how inapporpriate it is to put such statement in an argument. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And as for being uninformative, this thread is about rthen and I added my 2 cents to show that by debating rthen's character you are only indulging his fantasies of persecution based on my knowlegde of him which is alot more informative then you blowing your little censorship whistle.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
yes you did add your 2cent and that being <br>
&quot;shut up you moron&quot; which if you have noticed already... is not a polite thing to say.... <br>
<br>
please refer to above for clarification if you still need 1. <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
hahaha with mods edit/deleting some poster's post and replace it with &quot;yeah i am stupid&quot; or anything with that sort... <br>
<br>
no offence but that is deserved to be flamed.. <br>
<br>
While the post itself was just disagreement on the popular belief at the time at <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>THIS</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> board. <br>
<br>
namely &quot;mage &gt; all&quot; ... <br>
<br>
there were even posters here before the mage pet xp fix. <br>
&quot;mage &gt; all in solo  !! you disagreeing you must be trolling!!&quot;<br>
<br>
and again.... if wezloc can put &quot;you are just clueless&quot; as a respond... i don't see why can't you toleralte other simliar level of respond in <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOUR</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> board... <br>
<br>
is it because he's on <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>YOUR</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> side agreeing with you? <br>
<br>
again.. if it is ... at least have a little banner that says <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>all posts against the general consesus in this board will be flagged as troll and ridicule of.... however the poster WILL NOT be ALLOW to reply as bad as he received. <br>
<br>
And mods here is allow to ban and label posts independent of the post content if the poster had any HISTORY or offenned the general poster in this board ... </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
a certain term comes to mind with this kind of ... rules though. <br>
<br>
<br>
and of course there are posters with such expertise to diagnose problems.. <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Natharius Bladestorm</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Rthen is paranoid and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>must have a mental disorder.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> I have read this persons posts on three different message boards: The Magicians Tower (here), Casters Realm, and the Saryrn Tavern (A server he used to play on).<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
would it be bad if i diagnose natharius too? <br>
<br>
is such comments allowed too? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Almost all of his posts are negative and sometimes delusional.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
delusional ... .... guess that is an <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>opinion</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.. ... <br>
but when it's an opinion against them back it would be wrong? <br>
e.g. &quot; natharius is a moron&quot; is an opinion .... <br>
<br>
is such opinion allowed? <br>
<br>
since posts that mock the poster going <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>against the current has NEVER been warned</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> .... <br>
<br>
double standard... you guys into gorge orwells 1984 much? <br>

Some facts..<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Almost all of his posts are negative and sometimes delusional.&quot;<br>
<br>
I have strong opinions that just don't happen to agree with the norm in regards to EQ and many classes in EQ.  I am not afraid to post them.<br>
<br>
 &quot;On the Saryrn Tavern, he used to constantly post that certain people on the Saryrn Server had it in for him due to some past incident that occurred while he was a guild leader or something to that effect.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many people did &quot;have it our for me&quot; for consistantly poining out that mages were more then mod rods (mod rod 1 at the time) and more then CoH.  They also did not like the fact that I stood up to the gang at the Tavern and pointed out how the way they ran the server was basiclly morally wrong.<br>
<br>
Paranoid?  I think not, I spent the better part of 2 years on that server getting trained and KSed.. and in general blacklisted for opinions stated on a message board.<br>
<br>
Eventually I gave up and moved to SH which has proven to be MUCH better.  <br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;I have seen more than a few loons on various EQ messageboards, and I must count Rthen as one of them. He is a strange, deluded person who constantly posts negative and paranoid thoughts on the various messageboards.&quot;<br>
<br>
I post critical things in regards to the mage class and nothing more.  Mages on SH are treated well it is not a &quot;Saryrn&quot;.<br>
<br>
I post critical things in regards to the mage class because it is currently the only issue I have with the game.  It is the only class I wish to play and I would like it fixed.  <br>
<br>
I'm not afraid to stand up to opression in game or out of game.<br>
I think it is silly what Saryrn's celebrities put me though for my stance on Mages and my opinions on Server leadership.  Quite amusing... <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Personally, I hope you don't ban him. It will only feed his paranoid delusions and cause him to spew forth more negative rubbish. <br>

Isengard&quot;<br>
<br>
Did you know that one of the founders of your guild made it his personal lifes work in EQ to insure my gaming experience was ruined (until he quit the game) because they felt I needed to pay 20k to cover somehting a former guild member of mine did?<br>
<br>
I found out later it was a setup to extort plat from people.  The guild member in question was rotated though various small guilds and then would do &quot;somehting&quot; to warrent extortion.<br>
<br>
I never paid the 20k and despite Isengauards efforts I am still playing the game.<br>
