<br>
December 4, 2002<br>
------------------------------<br>
Zones <br>
<br>
- Updated the sage quests in the Plane of Knowledge. <br>
- Addressed several bugs with the Rallos Zek encounter. <br>
- Vallon Zek's script should now work correctly. <br>
<br>
Spells <br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug with lull and harmony type spells that could cause zone-wide agro. <br>
- Reduced the fizzle rate on Beastlord spells to match that of all other hybrid classes. <br>
- Fixed a bug that was allowing some charmed NPCs to break mez. <br>
- Blinding spells will now affect characters on horseback. <br>
- Spells that automatically target your pet will now work (on your regular pet) when you have a Servant of Ro. <br>
- You should be able to heal and buff your regular pet when using Host of Elements or Wake the Dead. <br>
- Eldritch rune should now absorb more damage <br>
- The last patch changes to Mental Corruption made it too powerful for a level 52 spell. The damage has been toned down, and the mana recourse has been changed to scale from level 52 to 60 <br>
<br>
Music Player <br>
<br>
- Typing /mp3 with no arguments will now bring up the Music Player. <br>
- When saving play lists, the player will automatically remove any extension on the filename entered and replace it with .m3u. Since only files with the .m3u extension can be loaded as playlists by the Music Player, this should remove some &quot;can't load a list I just saved&quot; issues. <br>
<br>
Miscellaneous <br>
<br>
- If you are working to explore Planes of Power without progressing through the storyline, you may find that the alternate methods to enter some zones now goes a little bit faster. <br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team <br>
<br>
November 19, 2002 3:00 am <br>

<br>
- Affliction Efficiency should now work on Damage over Time spells of level 61 and greater. <br>

- Corrected the animation for Spirit of Eagle. <br>
- Increased the affect radius of Radiant Cure so that it will affect group members. <br>
- Changed the method of obtaining the Planes of Power 'imbue' spells. Speak with the fellow that gave them to you before for more information. <br>
- Fixed a bug where casting Levant while on a horse could cause crashes. <br>
- Fixed a problem that was preventing pet owners from controlling their regular pets if they had a Wake the Dead pet in use. <br>

- Fixed a bug with Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming Sword of Xuzl that prevented them from disappearing when they should. <br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
** User Interface ** <br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue in the interface with the size of the last columns in windows. <br>
- /w all guild will now display all of your guild members. <br>

<br>

<br>
** By Winged Messenger ** <br>
<br>
A lone messenger streaks across the rocky roads of the mighty Wakening Lands, an urgent message kept safely within his talons. Dire news he brings to his master, the Lord Yelinak; there is much turmoil in wake of the prismatic's release, and he must inform the ancient dragon of the weary times to come. As he rushes past the lumbering trees on all sides of him, he harks back to a more peaceful time. Certainly the brow of his mighty Lord showed less strain, less agitation, though not much. He had always thought that the prismatic's release would surely be more problematic than anything else he could imagine. He now knew that there was much more at stake than ever before, and that the Shrine would need to be on its guard. <br>
<br>
As he came to the entrance of the Shrine, he tensed for a moment, hoping that this dire news wouldn't end the life that he and his kin had known for so long. Yet he feared that nothing could stop that change, for the might of the Kin would be tested in the coming times, and there would surely be dangers he had yet to see. He made his way through the corridors up to his master's chambers. As he came closer, he noticed new members of the Kin he had never before seen. As large as his Lord, they spoke quietly amongst themselves and with Yelinak himself. He was unnerved by this startling addition to the Shrine, but felt that it was likely necessary. Perhaps his Lord had already heard the news and had already begun making plans. Either way, it was his duty to inform Yelinak of the recent events; the Giants would know no struggle like that which the Shrine would give them. <br>
<br>
He walked towards Lord Yelinak, majestic in his appearance yet with a certain calming aura about him. He cleared his throat and began, &quot;M'lord Yelinak, I bring news from the East...&quot; <br>
<br>
October 31, 2002 3:00 am<br>

<br>
