SOLO?</span><hr size=1> I've been reading many of the posts here to see if I should start a mage.  After a couple of days of browsing around, I finally started a mage.  I'm lvl 16 now and solo quite well.<br>
<br>
I'm currently in Oasis along the shore close to the Nro zone line pulling blues, even, yellow cons.  The only time I've had to zone is when the trains start coming.  I only use about 2-3 bubs of mana and pet is usually around 60-70% health by the end of the fight.  In about 3-5 minutes I'm pulling again or if I'm impatient I'll keep on pulling as long as my pet has enough health.<br>
<br>
You can solo very well, just give it some time and you will see.  It's more rewarding knowing you did it yourself without help or at least it is to me.<br>

Ive said it before. We are not the most powerful soloing class in the game. In fact we are the weakest soloers. But we are the best. Why. Because of ease and simplicity in which we solo. How do we solo. We cast are most powerful root dot spell over and over until the mob is nearly dead and then we nuke when it is safe to do so. That is how we kill the hard to destroy mobs. How we kill the easier mobs is even more simple. We cast and buff and arm are root DOT spell and nuke. The mob is dead so fast its head is still spinning.<br>
<br>
Droods, and Necros and wizards. Yes they are alot more powerful but there methods of destruction is less honest, more time consuming and down right boring. once u have been doing it for 40 plus lvls its enuff to drive you mad. Snare, root, kitting are powerul, but is difficult and tedious. U running around in circles until you AE nuke r DOT kills the mobs. Are u sit for days it seems until the rooted mob your trying to Kill finially dies.<br>
<br>
Mages are the best soloing class in the game.

SOLO?</span><hr size=1> Up until the upper levels (and even then this can be argued), mages can solo nearly anything in the game, even stuff that summons.  If you're having trouble soloing and conserving mana, just stock up on malachites and pull out your best earth pet.  This chain casting technique that people keep babbling about really does work and can save you a ton of mana.  If you're nuking the mobs into the ground you're not quite killing as efficiently as you're able to.  Most of the magician's damage lies in the pet, even moreso than other pet classes (excluding maybe Beastlords, but they don't count).  I'd suggest dabbling around with chaining pets because you'll end up using it down the line.  If you're curious exactly how the chain petting works I'm sure there's a thread somewhere on this board outlining how to do it most effectively, though every mage has their own unique method :-)<br>
<br>
And about quadding wizards... I originally made a mage thinking that I was making a wizard, and am delighted that I made that mistake as I love my little magician.  Not long ago I fixed my original error and made myself a gnome wizard.  I play him mostly when I can't find anything to do with my mage and to pass the time quadding random mobs.  Most quadding wizards get ahold of this staff they can quest in Temple of Solusek Ro (<!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=459">Staff of Temperate Flux</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->).  The staff itself has crappy stats and the effect is only a -6 fire/cold debuff.   The really good thing about the staff is that it is instant right click from inventory (i.e. you can use the effect while running full sprint).  The idea is to get yourself some sow (or do Jboots quest), load up an AE nuke (Circle of Force at 34 is their first true AE nuke, and the Al'kabor AE series of nukes is utterly useless), and then run around tagging mobs with your staff until you get 4 of them.  Run them around until they are almost in one neat stack (circling them helps get them in a stack quickly), then fire off your AE snare (Bonds of Force at 29 is your first one).  Now proceed to use your AE nuke until all 4 mobs are dead, reapplying snare about every 30-40 seconds or so.  <br>
<br>
Druids can use the same technique, though they usually pull with snare (theirs lasts a good deal longer than the wizards, which is only 45 seconds) and use the rain AE spells until they get a good single blast AE in the later levels.  <br>
<br>
The only thing about soloing wizards is that their success depends on their bar of mana.  Same with druids, though they have some of the best outdoor crowd control spells in the game.  As a magician you always have constant damage output available with your pet.  <br>
<br>
And let's not get started on the DPS (damage per second) output on the magician class versus other classes.  <br>
<br>
Before you decide to ditch your mage, try some different strategies.  Even partnering with another class works wonders (I personally like shaman or druid partners).  Two people sharing the mana load improves the mana conservation a LOT.  And though this is sorta &quot;cheating&quot;, you can donate for a dose of KEI from a friendly high level enchanter.  I can promise you probably won't need to med with KEI on until you hit the late 20's.   <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=222062">Booperbustle Tinkermeister</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

A good Magician can solo in damn near every zone and in almost any condition.  It takes the right pet for the right situation and the right amount of nuke and heal combo.  <br>
   Necros although great soloers when they can fear kite are crap with out it.  They can' fear kite in dungeons, or places like Rathe Mountains and unless they're careful they can't solo in DL.  I've taken Necro and Wiz friends to the Yeti Caves, the second I left them there un protected they call me back to help with CR.  If you watch a Necro pet stand and get hit for awhile its pathetic.  The poor little skelie doesn't stand a chance against a mob our pets will solo.<br>
    Wizards and Druids have the same deal.  They can only solo out doors and in ideal conditions.  I've seen Druids handle three or four HGs in Rathe Mountains at once but doing so costs a bar of mana.  <br>
     I could solo two HGs at 44 DoT both and heal pet(fire only).  When the one Giant starts to walk heal pet and SoS the walker.  The entire process takes half a bar of mana and since the Fire pet regens hp so quickly by the time you are done looting both HGs you're ready for another two.  So four mobs on one bar of mana just like a Druid.  Then ask the mededing Druid for a strength buff and SoW hehe.  <br>
     Okay I do have to admit that Druids have an easier time soloing a mobs at lower levels.  For instance at level 49 I can take out an IG easily but a Druid can kill one at level 45.  Worry not little Mage with the right pet so can you.  But you will waste a bar of mana and sacrifice the pet but hey whats the six minute spawn time for?  I won't go into it here but hint Earth pet is your friend when you have to nuke a lot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krankenthegnome>Kranken the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 397<br> <font color=#333333>(2/26/03 1:03:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=61.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We can solo.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Necros although great soloers when they can fear kite are crap with out it.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Most of the necros I know solo level 62+ mobs that hit for 550-650, absolutely non stop, without using fear. Heck, they frequently don't bother with a pet.<br>
