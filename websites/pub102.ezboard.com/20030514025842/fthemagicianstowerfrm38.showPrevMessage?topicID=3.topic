I am a High Elf on a team PvP server, and most of my leveling was done in Butcherblock.  Where now?  Crushbone?<br>
<br>
How about going to Freeport, getting a bind, and hunting from there?<br>
<br>
Or, just working Butcherblock, carefully, and hoping for Level 12 when bind comes along and the whole world opens up?<br>
<br>
(I must solo, and my playing time is unfortunately very limited.  This obviously means I am not a power-leveler, so fun is a priority.)<br>

<br>
If you want good exp at 9 go to West Commons and solo Young Kodiaks with Fire elemental and kill the occasional black bear you might find a HQ(HQbear pelts go for 40pp on Cazic-thule) although HQ pelts are not found on YK's the exp is around 1/4 bubble, also kill willow wisps in hopes of finding a greater lightstone, you can turn in somewhere in RO and get good exp that way.

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BANDITS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
According to<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=qey2hh1">www.eqmaps.com/zone.php3?tag=qey2hh1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
they range in level from 9-10.<br>
<br>
With a druid and harmony, the camps should be no problem.<br>
<br>
Two things to lookout for:<br>
<br>
1. Caster bandits. They cast as druids, have a damage shield and Ignite and Whirling wind the heck out of you. My wife's 19th lvl warrior has troubles taking on two of these.<br>
<br>
2. Brigands. They are lvl 15 and can take off two bubs of life off the wife's warrior.<br>
<br>
Check out this info sheet:<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.eqmaps.com/infosheet.php3?tag=qey2hh1">www.eqmaps.com/infosheet....ag=qey2hh1</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
You want to make you way to the &quot;Bandit Farm&quot;. There are two &quot;A Farmer&quot;s there that are really Bandits (you'll know by how they con). The female &quot;a farmer&quot;s almost always drop a bandit sash. (If you come here on Rodcet, I'll probably be there) If you have a large group, you can pull from the nearby mountain camp too.<br>
<br>
The sashes are the reason for being there. They are light weight and you turn them in in Qeynos. When you turn one in the guy gives you a bronze weapon that can sell from 1-2.5pp (maybe more if you make a human enchanter mule with a high charisma). I made 100pp with the wife's warrior the other night while playing her on the side for a couple hours. i even managed to get almost a bubble of exp from turning them in. Not to mention that between killing the bandits and turning in sashes, all of qeynos loves her <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I can't link to alakazam's web site from here at work, but I'll edit it in from home <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The guy's name is Chessgard something, and he is in the house of thunder in south Qeynos. Go to the far (south) dock and turn left. Pass fishes ale, then take a right, go through an arch in the wall and you're there.<br>
<br>
Black Burrow is also not too bad a place to go in a group (too many trains to make survival easy when you're solo), and I took my shaman from 8th to 9th on the giant snakes in there (it's really cool, you can stay on the wall slightly down off the main path in the room with like 5 snake spawns, and gnolls going to and from trains will not mess with you). After that I took her back out into everfrost and soloed yellow kitties and spiders and orcs (yellow to a 9th lvl). They give good exp up to like 12th when you can start on the weaker calfs with 2 or 3 people groups (watch out for mama's though). This was all with a shaman, so I know a Magi could handle it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Okay, this got rather long winded (no way! me? long winded?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
If I had it to do over, I would have tried to group with a druid at the bandits since there is sooo much plat to be made there.<br>
<br>
The gnoll fang/blackburrow stout quest is cool too (BOOZE!!!) but Black Burrow is so poorly pathed and trained so often since the mobs are so mixed in level it's hard to not run into stuff that agros on you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
Both places give good faction hits so Q-town will love you either way. Black Burrow adds faction with Surefall glade's druids (but not the wandering guards, go figure) so it's usefull for quests out of there. The bandits make all of the good guys in the Karanas like you.<br>

<br>
Two ways (one is theoreticaly)<br>
<br>
As an enchanter you use a combo of illusions and &quot;make people like me&quot; spells (Illu. Orge or Dark Elf, and Benevolence or Alliance).<br>
<br>
The trouble being to get the book to take to Oggok you have to be a good race (or spend days or real time working on faction) to get Erud's Tonic. The Kiolandi fish, you could kill Frostbite over and over until you get one. thye Honey Jum is only lore, so a halfling mule or a friend could do it (same for the Kiola nut). But! to turn all the crap in you have to go into an East freeport bar that is either full of neutral thieves (that might leave an ogre alone I'm not sure there) bards and sometimes warriors of the Steel Warrior faction and merchants. Most of them will beat the poop out of evils <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As an evil, raising all that faction would be sooo hard. As a good race, it's not that hard to raise Oggok faction killing frogs, but the bartender Clerg has his own special faction that you can only raise by doing the stein quest.<br>
<br>
That's why it's an only enchanters quest <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One good source of xp is the vengefuls (skeletons) the highest level one &quot;a vengeful soloist&quot; is like lvl 11 - 12 and was red at lvl 8, with fire pet i could kick his skinny butt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
i did take some beating myself though so did my pet.<br>
<br>
Polar bears are nice to, both the cubs and the larger one out on the thundra, if they drop that white pelt it can be given to Cindl(sp?) for faction and some cash + 1 armor piece.<br>
<br>
The cats are somewhat nasty, i would rate a blue cat harder than a blue polar bear, you also have plenty of giant wooly spiders and also lot's of spiderlings for silk that you can use for tailoring.<br>
<br>
The orcs here also drops some bracers, give two to Cindl for more faction(can anyone confirm that it is 2 you give?).<br>
<br>
Cindl can be found inside Halas go right from the entrance and she will be in a leather store, can't remember the name right now.<br>
<br>
Also on the topic of vengefuls you have three of them, composer, lycricist and soloist, they drop a scroll and you give them three to a female npc in a bar in Halas also to the right from the entrance, check the quest info at<br>

All in all i think this is a great zone, hunting the mamoth calf's is way cool, but getting hunted by a ice boned skeleton is no way near as fun <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't know if any of you have SoL installed yet, but if you take your mage to the Shadeweaver Thicket, there's oodles of experience to be had there.  My mage is level 9 and I took him there this morning.  In two and a half hours I made 3.5 full yellows of experience, made 20pp from selling two high quality rockhopper hides, and met some wonderful kittys that I plan on grouping with on a regular basis.<br>
<br>
This is a great zone to either group or solo in my opinion. I'm currently soloing the Skeletal Brigands, Lesser Shades, and a variety of Rockhoppers.  The rockhoppers drop the HQ hides used in a variety of quests the Vah Shir do so they are a great way to supplement your bank (avg price is 10pp per hide!).<br>
<br>
From Level 10 through Level 14 I believe you can hunt the Lodi Kai bandits/brigands as they con yellow/white to me at this level.<br>
<br>
I've tried my air, fire and water pet and the one that seems to be most effective at this point is the water pet.  I haven't tried the earth pet yet because some types of the rockhoppers do have a poison attack which does like 12 damage per round.<br>
<br>
And I just want to say, that I'm getting great comments on the way Verant changed the images of our pets!  Just for kicks, I parked my pet outside the bank there in Shadeweaver's, and then I ran around behind the bank.  People thought that my pet was an npc at first!  Well, until I did the /pet who leader command.. hee hee....<br>
<br>
But definitely give this place a look at.  Lots of nice things to hunt and great people to be met.<br>

This is imho one of the most concentrated newB areas in game.  This area has easy access to Kurns tower wich can take you thru 18th level.  The one bad thing is there are no guards to run to hehe.  You can bind at kaesora which is sor of out of the way.  Only other bad thing for you is that u cannot buy food but we can summon it so what does that matter hehe.  Also not many peeps there but monks warriors shammies and sk's as that is basically what classes iksar's are 8^).  The xp here is also great I can usually get as bub an hour hehe then kurns is nice at ent has a bonus to xp too think about 15%. <p>Roustar Ichiban
