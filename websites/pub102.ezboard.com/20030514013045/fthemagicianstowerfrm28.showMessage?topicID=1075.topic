<br>
I play on Kane Bayle and the economy there is kind of crazy. I checked this message board and someone recommended to a fellow magician a Bonecaster robe that goes for around 3000pp, on my server, the cheapest I've seen it for is 7000pp. <br>
<br>
This means that I either have to do a lot of farming to get the pp or try to get it my self, and I rather do the last option.<br>
<br>
Any advice would be a lot helpfull, more or less all the things i have now on me is quested or taken my self.<br>
<br>
Edit: Of course I didn't mean to get the bonecasters robe solo, but any item upgrade that are at all soloable at 50 is wanted as advice..<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

Lets see if I can come up with some ideas for inexpensive upgrades. As a minor warning, I'm not one to browse the bazaar daily, so my guesses on inexpensive could be wrong, but I don't think they will be.<br>
<br>
I warn you!  This post will be quite long so I hope you are in for a read.  I'm feeling chatty and helpful. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    There are just so many options and I know I won't hit all of them, but I think it will be worth your time to read the following.<br>
<br>
Boots: Golden Efreeti Boots or Coldain Skin boots (think thats the name). both would be very nice upgrades for you and last a while.  Shaded boots are another option.  I think thats the name.  They are +4 all stats and are no drop in Maiden's Eye.<br>
<br>
Pants: Netted Kelp is pretty nice, if I remember right. Siren's Grotto would probably be pretty good exp at your level in a group too.<br>
<br>
Belt: I'm a bit at a loss here. There aren't many nice ones that I know of that aren't quite expensive. The sash from Lower Guk would probably be one of the inexpensive ones and a minor upgrade for you. The belt from PoG or a Fetid Flesh Belt would both be nice, though a bit more expensive.<br>
<br>
Cloak: Yours is decent and a replacement would probably run you a good bit of money.<br>
<br>
Robe: This is what I used to wear before Apothic and I still think it looks great. Looks count you know.  A froggy robe from Sebilis would be a very nice upgrade and the area is pretty good experience around your level. A Tolapumj robe is even nicer, but isn't exactly cheap yet and to get it on your own would likely require a raid. A Netted Kelp tunic is another option. Good experience area and nice stats as long as you don't mind the leather look. All visible leather armor looks quite nice on many races, so this is a decent option for fashion aware mages.<br>
<br>
Shawl: I recommend you start the coldain shawl quests. You should be able to do the first two with just some time spent. The third takes a bit more time and some baking skill, but the later ones are worth it if you are dedicated. The fourth one is a bit of luck. The fifth requires a lot of times from Velketor's Lab. This would be a good place for you to get some exp while waiting for the drops. The items are no drop and groups will frequently OOC them if they know someone is looking for it. Should you follow through and get the 7th, it is hard to beat. The 8th is amazing and only the most ubers will have better. Just start on this quest and do it in bits and pieces. It isn't bad if you take it one step at a time. If you look at the entire quest at once, it is quite overwhelming.  Many call this the trade skill epic and I think that title is quite fitting.<br>
<br>
Ring: Check the bazaar. There are some inexpensive rings out there that are better stats. Even a player made +5 int ring would do you more good than the Goblin ring.  Another option is a shadel bandit ring.  They come from Fungus Grove.  Stats are something like 55 hit points and mana, with some saves.  They are lore.  Groups used to AE Fungus Grove all the time and would frequently OOC when a ring dropped, so someone could come pick it up so it didn't rot.  With the introduction of PoP and the new level caps, Fungus Grove has become a ghost town on my server.  Nobody AEs here anymore.  If you are lucky enough to find a group AEing in this zone, you have a good chance at this ring.  I think it sells for around 1k if you would rather buy it.<br>
<br>
Bracelet: I've found braclets to be a big weak point in our gear if you aren't somewhat uber. A good one for you would be a Supple Scale Armband (5 int, 30 mana, 10 sv fire. stats are about that). It is no drop and comes from the drolvarg warlord in Karnor's Castle. The area should be good experience for you and even if you can't get into a group, the groups that frequently camp it already have them and won't usually mind OOCing that one has dropped and you can loot it.  One other option and one I still wear is the dropped braclet from the plane of air.  This is an option if you are friends with a guild that zones this zone.  The bracelets for differenet classes frequently rot because they are somewhat common from my experiences.  For an idea on the stats, around 75 hp, 35 mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Sleeves: Netted Kelp and Loam Encrusted are both very nice. A no drop pair that is also quite nice are Transient sleeves from Maiden's Eye. This zone might be a bit high level for you, though I'm not certain on that since I very rarely frequent it. If nothing else you could OOC that you are looking for a pair and a nice group might let you know when a set drops. I hear you can also make decent experience in one zone away, Dawnshroud Peaks. So you could let the zone know you are looking for the Transient sleeves, then go experience in Dawnshroud if you can't find a group in Maiden's Eye.<br>
<br>
Gloves: There are several rather nice sets of gloves out there for mages. Imp Skin gloves are nice and you could farm a pair by yourself if that is your inclination. They drop in Sol A and you should have no trouble with this area as long as you take it slow while you learn the lay out. Netted Kelp gloves are rather nice and you could make decent exp while camping these. The advantage of this route is you would also have a chance at other Netted Kelp Armor and all of the visible items are pretty good for your level.  Coldain skin gloves are also rather nice, though I suspect you would have to buy these if you go this route.  One last option I can think of would be the sleeves of Velketor himself, the boss of Velk's Lab.  Guilds raid him all the time and if you are friends with a guild that raids him, see if you can tag along and loot the gloves if they drop.  The stats are about 5 intelligence and 50 mana.  Most mages in guilds capable of doing him will have much better gloves, so it is doubtful you would have to roll against anyone for them.  I have a pair sitting in my bank from the last time my guild killed him.<br>
<br>
Earring: The hoop of magi'kot is a good choice. Inexpensive since it is a frequent drop and nice intelligence. An eventual upgrade would be an Earring of the Solstice. This is a fairly expensive item to buy all the items for, but if you know some friends with 200+ trade skills, you could get some of the items simply by collecting what is needed to do the combines. I highly recommend getting this earring when you can afford it or have the time to collect the components since it requires rather uber items to beat it's stats and flowing thought.<br>
<br>
Helm: Good choice here. It is rather heavy, but your weight doesn't appear too bad. The only upgrade path I can think of would be the cowl from Lower Guk.<br>
<br>
Veil:  An Enshrouded Veil makes a nice option for mages.  It is a very common drop in Howling Stones (also known as Charasis).  This zone is great experience and a lot of fun.  It is found in the South wing, so take a 51+ rogue or plan on spending a lot of time collecting the keys to get to this ring.  Another advantage to going here and hoping for a drop is the Fingerbone Hoop (earring) also drops in the South wing and would be an upgrade to your hoop of magi'kot.  The keys are no rent, do don't underestimate by what I mean a long time.  This veil is fairly inexpensive now if you would rather just buy it.  Other options would be a mushroom veil (a bit more expensive and not as good overall in my opinion), a mask from Umbral Planes, or the executioner's veil that can be found for sale (comes from the trials in PoJ).  I have to recommend the Enshrouded Veil over the others due to cost and the effect.  The effect will save you mana on your summoning spells.<br>
<br>
Necklace:  I recommend you lose the summoned choker.  Maybe equip it while you are casting the phantom armor series if you are running low on cat's eye agates.  There are a few inexpensive options for this slot.  The first two are player made through jewelry craft.  One is 8 strenght and intelligence, the other is 65 hit points and mana.  A third option is to go to Maiden's Eye and see if you can get the mage only, no drop necklace.  I think its 10 int, 10 mana, 8 DR/PR.  It is quite nice and you would be there also for the chance at other no drop items from the zone.<br>
<br>
Ranged:  Good choice.  There are some other options, but they are more expensive for the most part.<br>
<br>
Primary and Secondary:  Decent choices.  A lot of casters overlook the stein even though it is dirt cheap and has good intelligence.  Some other options are a sorcerous bowl (comes from ToFS, nice stats and you could put the stein in your off hand) or the crystal from the Emp camp in Seb (5 int, 50 mana I think)<br>
<br>
Now for some options that I didn't mention above.  Apothic armor is nicer than most of what I mentioned above.  It drops in the plane of hate, so you would have to go on a raid to aquire some.  You didn't mention if you are in a guild and if you are, if they are capable of doing any of the planes.  I still see many mages wearing an Apothic robe because of the nice stats.  I also keep four pieces of Apothic armor in one of my bags of resist gear because the resists are pretty nice.  <br>
<br>
Another option would be to kill giants in the Kael arena for the silk drops.  You turn in a piece of silk and three specific gems to a coldain in Thurgadin in return for a piece of Arch Mage's armor (I think thats the name.  I don't have any pieces myself).  The stats range from slightly better to decently better than Apothic and depending on the levels of your friends, wouldn't take a raid to get.  The gems aren't that expensive to buy from others now.<br>
<br>
I noticed you are a gnome.  I love gnomes!  I mention your race becase there is an alternative to killing giants in Kael.  The plane of growth drops armor that is the same stats as the Thurgadin quest armor.  Growth is a bit harder than Fear or Hate, so I don't know if this will be an option for you.  The reason I mentioned your race in relation to this option is due to faction.  Fighting in Growth VERY quickly ruins some of your Kelethin and Felwithe factions.  With so many cities to visit now and the lack of higher level zones on Faydwer, this isn't as big a loss as it might sound.  The robe is very pretty and one I still wear today.<br>
<br>
I told you this would be a long read. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I do hope it helps though.  There are so many upgrade options and I've only mentioned some of them.  Check the bazaar frequently and you will likely find some good deals on items.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Good mage!  I see you are wearing your focus ring, braclet, and earring.  The mana reduction on the earring adds up over time and the damage on the bracelet is quite nice, so I don't see myself giving up either anytime soon.  The ring is decent.  It is useful if you need the reduction in casting time.  There are rings out there with much better stats, so eventually I see myself not wearing this one anymore. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=108671">Varia Darselai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Arch Convoker</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=variathemage>Varia the mage</A> at: 11/15/02 5:59:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=farmatyr1>farmatyr1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#333333>(11/16/02 4:04:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1075.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Newbie armor at 50..</span><hr size=1> Okay, didn't read all of the above post, but here are my thoughts:<br>
<br>
Ignore much of the standard equip advice you read, since prices are going to be very different on Kane Bayle. Your best bet is stuff you can farm yourself (or in a group).<br>
<br>
Get yourself to ME if you can get a group there. There is a no drop 10 int necklace and no drop 4 int boots. You could also get a group for GEBs together, which is a very good exp spot if you can hold it.<br>
<br>
Enshrouded veil is pretty much a must for magicians. It has good stats and a useful focus effect. I think it's fairly rare in Howling Stones, and it'll probably be a bit expensive on KB, but should be worth the price.<br>
<br>
You should be able to farm yourself a diamond wedding band solo. Bring a friend to help you get to the wedding party if you haven't been in TOFS before. I'm not sure if you can solo Cara Omica at 50 for a sorcerous bowl. I took her down with a level 52 bard solo, but it was a very hard fight and I had several adds which I had to deal with.<br>
<br>
I think golden bracer drops in Sol B, but no idea what off. It's an excellent item, 7int and extended range II.<br>
<br>
A good belt, which is probably already cheap even on KB is spider fur. No int or mana, but good AC and HP makes it worth losing 2-4int.<br>
<br>
Drachnid Thyxl from the dread widow in dreadlands is an excellent offhand. You'll need a tracker friend to get it probably. There is a cycle near the FV zone in DL that consists of abnormally low level mobs, and rares including a Wulfwere Lonewolf and the Dread Widow. She is either an SK or Necro, mid-high 40s, tons of HP. I killed her with a mid 50s ranger with bow kiting.<br>
<br>
I'd drop the newbie quest gloves for gem inlaid gauntlets. 8ac 3sta 3dex will serve you better than 1int 5mana in the long run.<br>
<br>
A very minor shoulder upgrade would be a meditative blanket from the Forager cycle in TT. You can also get some good items that should sell for insane money on a new server (like iksar BP and iksar mask). Bring a full group with a tracker and you can make good exp.<br>
<br>
Hate and Kael are also good ideas.<br>
