<br>
I just wanted to make this thread - I know a bunch of enchanters on Veeshan who happen to have TD3 and Command of Druzzil.<br>
<br>
The point is, most see this as a dream; they are using it as long as they can, milking it for what it's worth ( a bit like manaburn, but on a lower scale ), but they are fulling expecting the nerf bat to come down on them.<br>
<br>
I think that enchanters that say it's dangerous soloing in Hohonora with this charm are being unrealistic in the extreme... We all know with Rune of Zebuxxoruk and the aa rune, risk is close to 0. Even if perchance you die, you make up for lost experience in maybe four mobs.<br>
<br>
I am glad for my enchanter friends who happen to have this ability, and who have fun soloing or contributing huge DPS to groups/raids. I think that all the mages who get their panties in a bunch and call for nerf, should remember how we feel when we read about our 'grossly overpowered pets' on the monk boards.<br>
<br>
You don't need to call for it - it's going to happen. Not because the other classes cry, but simply because SoE, slow and somewhat dimwitted as they may seem, are far from oblivious. It took a manaburn crew to kill Wuoshi, and this single person did it.<br>
<br>
How long do you think it will last? Until now, I hope all the enchanters have fun with that ability. I must admit it rocks, and that I am looking forward to using my charm on the elemental planes/Bastion of Thunder, if I ever get it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kalahadbb>KalahadBB</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/02 8:05:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8057.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About Charm</span><hr size=1> Long as they leave the mage charm alone, do what they want to enchanters =(. <p>Arch Convoker Kalahad<br>

As i said several times before, the difference between monks calling mage pets overpowered, and me calling charm overpowered, is the fact that mage pets really are not overpowered but charm is. <br>
<br>
Any anger a mage feels over reading their pets being called overpowered, is out of knowing its not true. Well at least thats why i get angry when people call our new pets overpowered. Our pets are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>finally</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> where they should be, and people are saying thats unfair? <br>
<br>
If i felt mage pets were overpowered, i <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>would</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> aknowledge it. They arent. Monks are compairing themselves to the positive atributes of all of our pets - the mitigation of the air pet, and the damage of a backstabbing nuking water pet. What they fail to realize is you cant have both at once.<br>
<br>
Mage pets do as much damage as any other classes pet. Yes, i parsed many raid logs and find on average the beastlord pet will do more melee damage than the water pet, if the water pet cant backstab. This is just using their first level pet too, i assume their other 60+ pets will do even more damage. <br>
Im sure the warder also tanks better than the water pet too, or at least almost as well.<br>
<br>
The air pet doesnt out tank monks. Like i said before, a monk guildie decided to attack my pet when ld and it wasnt even a contest. The pet couldnt even hit him. <br>
Even if it were true that mage pets and pets in general could out tank monks, all that means is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>monks</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> are broken. It does not mean that pets are, since pets are in line with every other class.<br>
<br>
Whereas, enchanters <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> soloing hoh, they <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>are</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> doing multiple rogues, and multiple mages worth of damage for a nominal risk, while also having the best abilities to avoid and mitigate damage, as well as support other classes through buffs.<br>
<br>
Sorry, but being the best at damage avoidance, having some of the best supportive spells, as well as many times the best abilities in damage dealing is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>god class</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. God classes should not exist as they comprimise game integrity. Thats how i feel about this issue, and whenever the topic comes up i will say how i feel. :/<br>
<br>
The way i look at it, if you are an enchanter who charms, and feel bad about people saying what you are doing is overpowered, you are being dishonest with yourself, with me, or are just generally ignorant of what other classes are capable of so you dont realize how overpowered that is relative to others. <br>
<br>
I dont think charm should be removed from this game at all, its a cool ability, i just think it needs to be seriously rebalanced. So even if me saying that makes someone feel bad, sorry but i feel it is the truth. <br>
<br>
If i were a member of the enchanter community, i wouldnt take such a counter productive stance of denying the power of charm that most seem to favor. That is not effective, because eventually the truth will come out on a large scale denial will no longer be an effective tactic. <br>
Once that happens, verant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>will</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> rebalance it. So the question enchanters should be asking themselves is, do they want to be rebalanced like monks and avoidance was, or do they want to be rebalanced like mages and mod rod 2 was?<br>
<br>
The reason monks are broken now, is because they never really expressed as a comunity how they feel their class should be. They just sat back, enjoyed doing almost as much damage as rogues while tanking better than warriors, assuming nothing would happen. So, verant &quot;rebalanced&quot; them, without knowing the desires of the class. What verant did to the monk class, was basically remove the overpowered element, which in doing so made monks an incomplete class, without offering compensitory abilities to make them balanced. Thats because verant did not know where monks wanted to be as a class, since monks never admited there was a problem.<br>
<br>
Whereas,  mages had always expressed as a community what they feel their class should be. Mages wanted to be a damage dealing class with minor supportive and utility abilities. After verant removed the arguably overpowered mod rod 2, we were compensated with increased offense, as per our wishes.<br>
<br>
If i were an enchanter, i would start thinking of creative solutions to making charm a useful ability, without it being an overpowered ability, and vocalizing these opinions.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 12/4/02 12:39:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 314<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/02 12:38:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8057.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://myweb.ecomplanet.com/COLL8955/mystorage/fireelemental.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: About Charm</span><hr size=1> Frankly I am happy for the chanters <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> , Charm is really really usefull now.<br>
<br>
However I do agree with noonie 100% on the Issue of the misconception of our pets.<br>
<br>
Monks are rolling all our pets up into one super pet, Let me decribe the pet monks &quot;think we have&quot;<br>
<br>
Magme ellemental surrounded by steam!!<br>
<br>
Hit point 4500.<br>
DPS 85<br>
AC 1100<br>
Quad hits for 85 and back stabs for 32000. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
No joke, They really dont understand that the best tanking pet does not have the 4khp, The Pet with 85 DPS does not have any dmg midigation, And the pet with 4khp has around half the DPS of the best DPS pet.<br>
<br>
Please PLEASE understand, The pet's you think of are only in your imagination. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=dukeofthesky>Duke of the sky</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 132<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/02 1:13:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8057.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   .</span><hr size=1> I didn't say our pet was overpowered - I was just making a comparison, I know very well the pet monks credit us for doesn't exist ( hey, I wish it did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).<br>
<br>
What I am saying is that a lot of mages are screaming bloody murders because of enchanters with CoD and TD3. My friend admits that this is way overpowered; he's not going to shout it, he's not going to write posts about it, but he doesn't deny it when people do say it.<br>
<br>
Put it this way - change enchanter with mage, and charm with double bolt. Would you go around shouting for a nerf or bragging about it? No. Some of us did, and look what happened. I mean, it took them more than two years... Had there not been so many posts in a short period of time over here, we probably would still have them, because we had been silent.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am aware this is on a much larger scale than double bolts; enchanters who try to defend with 'there is danger' or ( my favorite ) 'It takes lots of aa points' are being hypocrits. We all know experience is easy to come by. Especially in PoP, where every damn group needs a slower, and where enchanters have never looked as good.<br>
<br>
Enchanter soloes Wuoshi - do you think that goes unnoticed? I mean, enchanters soloing in PoP goes unnoticed; they don't post pics of that, and they don't go around bragging about it. But, when you solo a dragon... Well, you know what's going to happen.<br>
<br>
What I'm saying is only - let them enjoy it. I mean, this isn't Manaburn where a bunch of greedy folks get together and basically put guilds that are starting to develop out of mobs to kill. It doesn't hurt anyone ( so far ). Is it a fair advantage? No. Neither were mod rods, double bolts, monks tanking the way they did or that cleric got their best spell at 39 ( and still do ).<br>
<br>
I'm just happy to see enchanters have fun. I wish they all were like my friend, that is, aware this is not going to be permanent; if they will be disappointed when it ends, then... Well, then they are fools, because no one can expect such a permanent advantage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ylaine76>Ylaine76</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1172<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/02 1:38:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8057.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> Here is how I see it, charm is fine in groups and fine in raids..

It's kind of like the roles have been reversed for us, but not for others.  It all boils down to the tools they're given, and mages just are not equipped to solo in PoP effectively.<br>
<br>
There's a cleric in my guild who solos in HoH.  Lull lets him pull singles, and root + horse lets him nuke.  It takes him a while to solo one, but he can do it.  Last night I was duoing with a necro guildmate in HoH, he had to log and I had 5% left to ding.  It really sucked to think &quot;am I going to have to wait for our next non-raid night just to get 1 blue?&quot;  Luckily a wizard guildmate helped me get the rest, but I felt pretty frustrated that I probably would not have been able to get that on my own, whereas in the past I would have had several options for soloing that last bit in Luclin.<br>
<br>
When your only defense is a pet with a finite amount of HP, there's very little you can do by yourself against yard trash that hits for 300+.  I wish no ill will or nerf towards enchanters, but to me it just rubs more salt in the open wound to hear things like this. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.dark-bane.com/mageloframes/sambusframe.htm">Sambus Veneficus</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I dont think its fair. And he doesnt play a whole lot too. He also didnt have anyone to roll against when a parchement droped.<br>
<br>
Charm in itself is fine, but with all the other tools chanters have it is overpowered (ability to single pull, hell they pull better than monks now,  1500pts rune, huge mana regen, CC etc ).<br>
<br>
Usually, i wouldnt really care about what other classes are able to do / not do. But in this case its different for 2 reasons: 1) Its now WAY harder to get a chanter in your group, 2) a single chanter is going to hold a full group camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=8057.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=8057.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8057.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.threadControl?topicID=8057.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8057.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=8057.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral>General</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
