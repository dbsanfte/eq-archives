My necro wife and I have now logged about 14 hours camping Kindle, and I can attest that this is a fine camp for a level 30 necro/mage combo. The only times we were ever killed or chased out were due to me biting off more than I can chew, or just forgetting the spawn timing.<br>
<br>
Why Kindle? Well his rare drop are the impskin gloves, AC 2 +5 INT +10 mana (or some amount of mana, anyway) These are very valuable and highly sought after. If you camp him at level 30 like me, you can hardly complain about the lengthy camp since you're getting decent experience and loot anyway.<br>
<br>
Sol A, on most servers, is similar to Permafrost in that it is generally devoid of players at a low enough level to get experience. The dungeon often serves as overflow parking for Sol B. Players will come here and whack rare spawns while waiting for a spot in the King Room or Bats/Bugs areas.<br>
<br>
Sol A isn't so isolated as Permafrost, so players tend to be a little more polite here. Communicate your intent with others. Occasionally announce something to the zone so that your turf is marked. (e.g. &quot;Wow, seventh freakin' ring in a row! Does he still drop the gloves?&quot;) In the course of our 14 hours, we came to know and frequently chat with the other long term campers in the dungeon. For instance, there was a level 60 magician camping the blazing elementals for the Power Of Fire, and he was only too happy to discuss Verant's idiocy or whatever else during his boring camp. He also let my wife and I loot platinum armbands, which was very nice of him.<br>
<br>
But I digress. Kindle is a rare spawn fire imp located very deep in Sol A. He himself spawns reasonably often, but his gloves don't seem to follow my little &quot;1 in 5&quot; rarity rule. Like I said, 7 rings, no gloves. Another fellow in the dungeon said he saw 16 rings drop before he saw the gloves.<br>
There is a room sometimes referred to as &quot;Kindle's room&quot; which is where you have the greatest chance of encountering him. He is a roaming spawn. If you see a roaming goblin go through this room, that's Kindle's placeholder. Kill it and maybe he'll show up next time.<br>
<br>
Here's how I got to this camp. If you are KOS to gnomes it won't work. Zone in from Lavastorm. Invis yourself. Be aware that casting goblins can see through invis here. Walk down the ramp, jump through the window, and when you reach the &quot;ledge room&quot; hang a left. Moving straight ahead will take you into gnome territory, where you can move visibly and safely. Make your way back to the gnome castle. (There's a merchant back here. Come back to him later when you're too loaded with fine steel and high quality ore to move) Move up along the EXG track until you're about to re-enter goblin territory. Reinvis, and take a left at the top of the stairs. Then take your first right, go down the stairs and through two doors. If you aggro any goblins, keep moving straight ahead and you'll zone into Sol B.<br>
<br>
Once you're past the two doors and no goblins are on you, bring up a pet. This is the point from where you'll stage your insertion into Kindle's area. The room ahead is the room where Singe or his PH spawn. Clear that room out, then take the door to the left. A hall leads to two more goblins. Clear them. Be aware that there's another zone to Sol B right here. This is where you'll run to if you get into trouble camping Kindle.<br>
<br>
Moving ahead brings you to a largish room with stairs going up to the efreeti area, and a tunnel underneath to Kindle's room. Kindle's roam path actually takes him through here, so you might see him here (I did.) Take the tunnel, clearing goblins as you go. There actually aren't too many here to deal with. I recommend having a necro along for mez pulling.<br>
<br>
Kindle's room is marked by a moving spear trap. Don't worry, it's harmless. Three goblins spawn here, plus Kindle or his PH. Clear the room and have a seat. The camp is yours.<br>
<br>
Goblins here drop a lot of Fine Steel Weaponry and Bricks of High Quality ore, as well as the occasional valuable gem, like Topaz or Jade. Also saw some Ivory which sold for 5pp. You'll make use of your Dim Pockets here. I would occasionally make invis runs to the gnome merchant to unload all my booty. <br>
<br>
The repop time for Sol A is right around 20 minutes. The nastiest mob you will encounter here is the inferno goblin wizard. These goblins' nukes hurt a lot. You will also enounter shamans of varying levels, but the weird thing is that I never once saw one of these shamans use a heal spell. So basically you never have to deal with healers. The shamans do SoW themselves (inside a dungeon, the cheaters) so if they run they're gone and you're zoning. All the goblins besides the shamans actually seem to be slow runners compared to other mobs in the game. Pulling and fighting are really a pleasant experience here.<br>
<br>
One observation I made is that Kindle seemed to have at least two spawn points. One was right inside the room with us. Sometimes, however, he would enter the room from the hallway to the north. This makes me wonder if sometimes he spawns in front of the goblin captain's room. There may have also been a third Kindle spawn point in the hall to the south, but he may have just left the room without aggroing on us.<br>
<br>
Kindle has a nasty fire shield you'll want to cancel, because it'll do in your pet in short order. He also has some fire based DD's which hurt a bit. Speaking of fire, keep in mind that almost everything in Sol A is highly resistant to fire, so you'll want to use your Shock of Spikes spell.<br>
<br>
That's about all I have to say on the subject for now. Oops, one other warning. I bound myself to Sol B just past the nearest zone to Kindle's room. That way if I gated or died, I wouldn't have to go far to retake the room. But Sol A has a habit of teleporting corpses to the LS zone, so you may find yourself in for a long trip if you need to get your corpse.<br>
<br>
Good luck! <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 30th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unefariusgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nefarius Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 119<br> <font color=#333333>(10/5/00 7:01:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Kindle Update</span><hr size=1> Last night my wife and I went back to Sol A to camp this little imp some more.

He spawned in the tunnel that leads towards the capt. room.<br>

Since Kindle is a roamer he can spawn <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> anywhere</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> along his roaming path. When I wrote this I was assuming that he had multiple spawn points, now I know the way it actually works. His roam path goes from the foyer in front of the goblin captain's room, all the way down to the entrance of the tunnel under the stairs.<br>
<br>
Another update, it's easier to run invis (or train) to the Sol B zone nearest the Kindle room and stage your insertion from there. This is far easier than the path I described in the original post. There is one roamer goblin that walks down to the zone line there, though, so be aware of his location. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 47th Trial<i><br>Member of Silmindo, Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uxumten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xumten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(2/7/01 1:18:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm43.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Kindle</span><hr size=1> Just wanted to thank ya Nefarious for taking the time for that info.
