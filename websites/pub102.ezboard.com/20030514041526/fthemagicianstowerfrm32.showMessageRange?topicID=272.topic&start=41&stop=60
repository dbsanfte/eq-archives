On malosini/malosi, difference between those spells are how much they debuff (malosi is 59 at start), the level of the spell, cast time, mana, recast time and duration. Notice those have nothing to do with resists. Your resist come slower cause you take longer to cast and recast, but you use less mana and get same ratio of resist as me with malosini. It IS frustrating to see it resisted that much. But it's also very powerful, pretty much second best debuff line in game imho. Also if you lower resist on malosi thinking it's not gonna affect those with malosini, yes it will, cause i would mem both and try malosi first, and that's wrong hehe. My opinion is this spell line is fine. You might differ and you're welcome express it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Guess lvl 54 spell don't do jack cept save bag space and cost money, told ya I didn't have a clue about it, never casted once, got transon's first. Zipping it on that one, you have my vote. ;P<br>
<br>
For proc'in weapon, we agree we should get it, but not on how much dmg, I only mentioned that as a player I thought 250 proc like you first suggested was too high. Talking for epic here but if he dual weild 250dd proc weapons, he's gonna be tearing up some serious ass. As for making pet only able to use 1 of those weapon, there's 2 solution. Making pets aware that something is lore and destroy when multiple lore item present (depending on how much they split pet from being npc (remember line is thin, pets ARE npc), this could be hard to code). Second solution is introduce a new status &quot;pet weapon&quot; and code the validation in. Takes a bit more CPU juice, but doable. But then why not make weapon 125 damage proc and let everything else as is? That's my point, 50-75 procs damage weapons would be very cool with me, especialy if they were lure saves procs. Maybe put ancient summon sword of own at 100 dmg, but going above that might be too strong (remember I'm hoping for lure type procs P).<br>
<br>
My original idea for the click sticks is to make them pure caster only, mage only is cool too though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I never read that post/thread you refer to, is it possible to dig it out? I did some search and didn't find anything. Then again didn't read every single thread that Balanz posted, too much stuff lol =)<br>
<br>
But anyway from my own experience you can get more outta bind wound than sitting if you time yourself with game ticks, maybe he forgot that, maybe my tests were wrong, will redo tests and log to have numbers, it's not that much, but it's faster.<br>
<br>
About the code comment, you forget that they also cut stuff to free ressources. They stopped pet doing their little patrol not cuz mage were asking for it, it didn't make people sea sick, but because it frees ressources for other usage. The code behind a game like this has to stay as simple as possible, cause every little flaw is cascaded by 1000s of users. Every single thing does count, cause once you start makin exception, then you make others, and soon there isn't just 1 more operation, there's 5 wich used by 1000 users mean 5000 instead of 1000. They have good servers, but ressources are not infinite, they can't watch every damn thing hehe. <br>
<br>
Bind wound is not class defining for mage, considered all my life i was summoning them for others (they bind better than me anyway), I gave them to people in group so they could heal while I med. I dòn't think it's worth more CPU time. If you want better bind wound, ask for skill increase, much better solution imho.<br>

On Debuffs...I just checked the spfdat and you are correct I don't see any different in resists of the spells listed. The only difference in malosi and malosini is that malosini lasts 1 min longer and takes 2 sec less to cast. So what is the advantage of casting it? They both debuff the same after level 50.<br>
<br>
On the proccing weapon i suggested they start at 50 and work up to 250. if Verant found that too powerful they could easily have the scale stop at 100 or 150 or 133 or whatever <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
They did recently change the fact that pets wont equip No Drop items so Im sure they could make them only equip one lore item or only 1 item flagged as pet only. <br>
<br>
I also wouldn't say that bind wounds is class defining for mages but out of all the casters we are usually the ones who have it maxxed and are the ones who summon bandages. So I think we should have an edge there in some form. I would also be quite happy if mages bind cap was raised to 200 where bandages start doing more per bandage <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Like you mentioned the resists on that spell line are pretty high. The advantage of malosini are mainly it's faster cast time and the fact that you can chain cast it. Getting malosi/malosini to stick on a mob is a really huge advantage in most situations. While it's frustrating at 51 to get high resist and long wait between recast, it's still a pretty nice spell when you go against something big that could be slowed. And at 58 we get an upgrade and then you chain cast it through resists until it stick, then usualy a few sec later a shaman tells the guild/raid/group Target slowed. Sometimes you get mobs that can only be hit with malo/mala, then you deal with that hehe. Repeating myself but I that spell line is fine as is . It is resisted a lot, but it's minimal aggro and -60 to all but desease helps a lot of people in said guild/raid/group. It's also very satisfying to get it in after 2-3 resists when there's a few mage casting it on &lt;insert random nicely tuned resist huge mob&gt;. The entire malo line rocks, resisted a lot but for a reason hehe.<br>
<br>
--<br>

--<br>
<br>
My only point here is it's simpler to split your 250 weapon in 1 125 normal summoned lore item that pet can dual weild than to code in new stuff. <br>
<br>
--<br>
out of all the casters we are usually the ones who have it maxxed and are the ones who summon bandages. So I think we should have an edge there in some form. <br>
--<br>
<br>
The way i see it, we HAVE an edge, we are usualy the ones with the skill maxed and we summon them. See my point? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

edit: just read over thread fast, I was saying bandage is faster hp regen then simply sitting, they are stating that bandaging/rodding is less efficient than sitting/medding, we are both right.<br>

<br>
EDIT: My Error the last part of that thread takes the mana regen into account also but does talk about how much you will bind per bandage and what amount of time it takes. They also in one of the threads talk about the hp regen for just sitting so if you combine that with phantom armor that should tell which is greater. <br>

Either make pet buffs be allowed on all pets, or make it so it only works on our pets. I'm sick of seeing those can only be cast on your pet lines. <br>
<br>
Make rage of zomm pet recast time shorter. Make the pet attack faster. For a pet that lasts the length of one mob his DPS sucks. Nice raid pet, just slow and cant use often.<br>

Also would it be possible to tone down the amount of agro a water pet generates at high lvl, maybe turn its spells off and lower the agro from bs?

1) Pet lvl/atk/dmg output<br>
IMHO Arch Mage ... Master of the Elements ... strongest Pet class *LOOOOOOOOOOL* should fit in theyr title ... i mean who wants a mage in a exp group in high lvls ? no one ... why ? he does no DMG ... our main dmg source was the PET ... you nerved our only real dmg source away (since my god damn shock of fiery swords even gets resisted from the lvl 7 fisher girl in freeport!!!) you thought magicians are overpower and nerved our pets .. what you didnt think of is .. that our pet is the only possible way to kill a mob ... with lvl 60 i have a hard time to solo some lvl 48+ mobs... in PVP i have NO chance against any melee (even if i use earth pet) since the roots/stuns or other spells from my pets are ALWAYS ressisted... we dont have anything like root/snare so we have to be able to relie on our pets. lets take OS .. i fight a froglok shaman lvl 45 ... i have to chainnuke like a madman to get him down before my 57 earth pet runs out of HPs ... its not even possible to try it with fire/air/water couse the pets will either die or the mob comes after you since you have to chainnuke and you AND your pet dies. anyway.. why are beastlord pets stronger then mage pets ?? beastlord can slow, heal, tank, and theyr pet is stronger then ours.. wow .. lets see .. i can .. mmm .. nuke ? well i think i have pretty decent AC for a mage with 856AC so i can at least tank some hits ... but still. so all in all i agree .. pets should be the casters lvl or neg1 or 2 lvls so they are useful for us ... im in a high end guild and i use my pet ZERO times .. if i cast a pet its dead in 2 seconds anyway so its a waste of mana. solo exp ? no chance... i 2box me and a 60 cleric and CH my pet every few seconds (earth pet) couse its HP drop so fast (even with aego on it) that its hardly worth to solo since i will use all my mana on 1 mob couse of either chaincasting nukes or pet heals.<br>
<br>
2)pet haste cap. well .. nothing to add here .. fix it please.<br>
<br>
3)spell resists<br>
please please please look into that ... i casted malosini on the fisher girl in freeport after she started to hit he.(couse i was so use to cast it, wonder it didnt get resisted) afterwards a shock of fiery blades ... and she resisted .. this cant be. i mean a lvl 7 mob resists my highest lvl 60 nuke... this doesnt make me feel powerful. i had resists on several other very low green mobs and to be honest it annoys me that a decayed skeleton can resist my nuke ... no matter how dead it is i should be able to flame its sorry a$$ with my lvl 60 spell ....*sigh*<br>
<br>
4)AA skills<br>
<br>
Elemental form should be PERMANENT as in i can zone with it and no duration. Camp or klick off will remove the effect of course. <br>
<br>
Pet hold <br>
well .. you say pet hold ... the pet doesnt attack .. you say pet attack it goes off ... you want to pull the net mob he hits you and you see &quot;Taunting Attacker, Master.&quot; can you make like a &quot;switch&quot; to togle /pet hold on/off so you dont have to /pet hold after each mob?<br>
<br>
Massgroupbuff<br>
woooo i always wanted to do a area DS wich lasts for 6mins 40seconds ... waste. increase our DS duration and/or DMG.(since druids get nearly equal DS pre kunark)<br>
<br>
Frenzied Burnout<br>
nothing to add liek all other mages sayd upgrade required.<br>
<br>
5) Summoning no rent items<br>
<br>
there was an idea with summon self only focus items ... maybe with aditional stats etc. that would be great even with the same stats .. since everytime i have to summon a focus item for one of our wizzies i have to give them mine couse its lore.<br>
<br>
6)Nukes<br>
<br>
we are the master of the elements .... i dont see that i can summon elementals okay .. but i cast only fire spells and magic based spells ... even druids get fire and cold spells.<br>
instead of our super useless dots (SoV) we should get cold based DDs and we should please have at least higher nukes then druids. they can heal ,cast regen ,buff ,cast very good group DS (32pts if i remember right) ,can snare, root, ad nuke better then we do.<br>
<br>
7)CoH<br>
<br>
this is far reached now. but just a sugestion. make CoHs possible over zones ? <br>
<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
realy important is the spell reistance and the pets imho couse that might effect ALL mages.<br>
and i realy dont like the idea of beastlords having the BEST pet in game ... i play my mage since 3+ years and the end game exping is no more fun for me since i have to spend either hours to get a group .. or 15 minutes between every kill. its very boring and im VERY glad that verrant is looking into mages. Thanks verrant for your reaction and i hope you take our suggestions serious.<br>

But here is my personal priority list:<br>
<br>
1.  Fix haste cap for pets.  Doesn't directly affect me at my level, but it's rather stupid to have higher-lvl spells that don't do much.  No reason to have a cap.<br>
<br>
2.  Make Frenzied Burnout better.  Again, not affecting me for a while, but since every other caster has a &quot;killer AA&quot; that they have, mages should too.  And by killer, i mean both in desire to have it, and will literally kill many non-boss mobs, and be of REAL help on raids.  The suggestion for this that I like most is making your pet hit for extreme damage, very fast, with a lot of health, for a duration governed by the amount of mana you have at casting, and drains ALL of it.  And pet explodes with a big bang at the end of it.  Manaburn for mages should be Frenzied Burnout.  Have it do comparable damage to manaburn.  And make sure the pet has enough health to survive the agro it will get with it's hits!<br>
<br>
3.  Make us the kings of damage shields.  We always were pre-50, but continue it by increasing our post-50 offerings.  Not by much, since we weren't much over before, but nonetheless, better.<br>
<br>
4.  Make us nuke better than Druids.  Yes it's class envy.  But they shouldn't even APPROACH mages or wizards.  We shouldn't approach wizards either, but having ANY non-ancient spell that is better than mages is ludicrus (sp?).<br>
<br>
5.  Resist rate on the malise line.  The whole reason of this line is to debuff so our nukes CAN hit, but if the debuff can't hit, then what's the point?<br>
<br>
6.  Look at pets in the 24-38 range.  They really lack compared to anything else in this twink-heavy world.  They start coming back into power 39-50.  The lower-level mages need to be seen as more useful to a group.<br>
<br>
7.  Look at pets 50+.  The damage output of them has been improved for the GVoc line (except air, fix that), but the Voc aren't significantly harder-hitting than the 49s.  Not to mention their large level difference with the mobs we are fighting.  This is a problem through a mage's whole career really.  The large level difference makes what would SEEM to be like a good damage-output pet (via max hit), but hardly ever hits for that, so therefore not-so-hot.  Pets shouldn't completely blow everything away, but they need looking at how to increase the amount that they hit.<br>
<br>
These are what concern me.  I probably missed a lot, but whatever I did I'm sure that others covered.  The AA needs serious looking at as well to see what's USEFUL, but others have covered that topic far better than I.<br>
<br>
/rant on<br>
The basic idea here is that mages need to be seen as bringing something NEEDED to a group.  Wizards and mages are sometimes seen as &quot;filler&quot; to an exp group.  My brother (a 49 chanter) has even commented to me in his Dreadland days, that to him, the best group is a Shadowknight (best agro-keeping tank), Ranger (sow, snare), Monk, Rogue (can ditch monk for two rogues), cleric, and enchanter (crack cleric, and mez power).  In that environment he's right.  High-dmg output, low downtime, adds handled.  A mage isn't a substitue for a monk or a rogue for damage output, and what we offer isn't as useful.  Somebody on this board said it before:  Mages should be the rogues of casters.  High-dmg output, few defensive skills, since VI doesn't seem to want to give us anything to defend ourselves with (gate doesn't count).  We need to be seen as useful somehow.<br>
/rant off<br>
<br>
Anyways, keep the changes coming.  For better or for worse, at least you're trying to help us out.<br>

<br>
I read all these Damage Per Second reports and it's disheartening.<br>
<br>
With such a lack in defense, wouldn't you expect an increase in offense?  In terms of killing power &amp; efficiency, a pure damage-dealing caster should offer more than any melee; the tradeoff being that you cannot survive much damage at all, and you need your melee friends to protect you.  Wizard should more than equal a Rogue.  Mage + pet should equal a Wizard.<br>
<br>
In making a group, why would you choose a guy who can die easily, and also doesn't do as much damage?<br>

I’ve seen a few changes, and I’m happy that we’re finally getting some notice – Rich, do you play a magician?  If you don’t, you actually give the impression that you’ve looked into this with some level of serious intent.  Thank you for that.<br>
<br>
Prior representatives have claimed “Yes, we have people here who play magicians,” but I am dead-set convinced that they have either been (a) Lying through their teeth, or (b) ignoring the mythical players they refer to.  <br>
<br>
With that said, here’s my thinking on stuff.<br>
<br>
Pet Haste.  Fix it.  Why are there spells for 65% haste if pet can’t get past 60%?  /boggle.  I don’t understand why there’s even a cap.  Please elaborate.<br>
<br>
Include the pets that were “left out” of the recent patch in the next one.  Air and MS lines, specifically.<br>
<br>
What ever happened to the idea of summoning procing weapons that was mentioned two years ago when our bugged Sword of Runes was fixed?  There was talk of introducing a line of fire, cold, magic, etc. based weapons.  They don’t have to be major procs, it would just be nice to see a set of them at 29th to match the SoR.  Nothing higher than the 38pts that SoR does, in fact I’d be happy seeing some 25s there.  I’m not sure what planet the 250pt suggestion came from, but that’s plain nuts.  VI has stated categorically they don’t want a sea of phantom weapons creeping around, and if a 250pt proccer started showing up in magician summons, you’d see about a hundred werewolf forms holding these in every zone you travelled.  86 that idea.<br>
<br>
Bravo on focus item summons.  Thank you.  <br>
<br>
Some other suggestions for summons:  Summon Boots of Travel (maybe equivalent to Run2, or Run3, one or two charges of effect) as a mid-50s.  Summon Bow of Whateveryouwanttocallit (minor usefulness, but would round out the collection).  Summon Lava Diamond (someone else mentioned this earlier, I like it).  I’ll think of others.<br>
<br>
TPP is enough mana regen for us.  That’s not our bag.  I wouldn’t mind seeing it upped to 6pts, that would seem to follow more closely with druid and cleric spells (what I’m saying here is I don’t understand the rationale behind ours being 3pts while theirs are 6pts – I’d be happier if someone tried to explain this to me).<br>
<br>
Quillmane.  Remove him and replace with a god-level mob indifferent to everyone.  Make him BIGNUTS tough, so it requires at least 30 lvl 57+ to get him.  I’m sick of watching Druid farmers bending magicians over a barrel.  It’s not as if this would change the quantity of cloaks in the game, it would simply let us feel less raped when we need one.<br>
<br>
I see no need for evocation bonuses on our class – those who wished to become evokers got what they wanted – there’s a decent spell for that, and they’ve got a damage machine pet to go with it.  They’ll never add up to wizards on nukes – and should never come close.  The pet causes more damage than the wizard ever will, for a fixed amount of mana.  300-500 mana and you’ve got a chunk of damage that might just last you all day long.  That should be enough.  I was a little irked that Druids get a larger nuke, but when it comes down to brass tacks, Gonad and my nukes can put Druids to shame on the DPS scale.  And I do mean shame.  As in “Stand over there, heal me when I need it, and watch what the BOSS can do.”<br>
<br>
I see no need to change existing Damage Shields, but would it be possible to get a message saying “So-and-so’s Cadeau of Flame has worn off”?  Probably not, but would be nice.<br>
<br>
Debuffs are fine.  Resist rates are fine.  I understand where you’re coming from, Imaginos9, but you’re going to have to trust us on this one, get a few more levels and grow your guild some.  Malosi is a pulling spell, not a raiding one.  Malosini is the chain-casting ROCK.  When your crowd goes to HoT, you’ll start using it for real – someone else lands Mala/Malo, someone tash’s, you chain-cast Malosini and as soon as you land it, not only will the shaman’s slow stick, but when the raid leader calls “NUKE”, that things hps will evaporate.  <br>
<br>
Forget bandages.  Bandages are for giving to monks, and *possibly* for use solo to recover to 50% WHILE you have TPP or another armor form ticking on you.  Bandages are a totally worthless discussion to be having relative to our class, guys.  <br>
<br>
I don’t think I’ve realistically used any of the Ward Summoned line of spells since I was leveling in LavaStorm three years ago.  Care to guess why that is?  Here’s why:  my regular nukes are as effective, generally faster casting, and when I run into a non-summoned critter, they work.  Why would I use a summoned-specific nuke when the regular one works almost exactly the same?  Even if this line was better ratio or faster, or whatever, there aren’t really a lot of opportunities to use it.  Youngling elementals, Shadowed Men, BW Wasps, and Rumblecrush’s buddies.  Are there spots I’m missing here?<br>
<br>
AA stuff:<br>
<br>
FB – change it.  Everyone is asking for something like an MB/LB and also I see requests for Dire Charm style ability.  I’ve *also* seen requests that we be given the choice of evoc v. conjuration.  I personally see no need for MB/LB style nukage on our class.  Rather, I see us working with the pet – and I would like to see the pet work as well as a DC mob.  Therefore, I suggest FB be a major buff, not a “ticking time-bomb of fury.”  <br>
<br>
1 - Make FB a permanent effect, keep the 144min timer on it.  Pet gets bumped to mob-style output (assuming he’s not already there), and stays there, much as if an enchanter had DC’d a mob.  Pet has no explosive property AT ALL.  <br>
<br>
If you insist on introducing an MB-style effect, here:<br>
<br>
2 – Add a new AA on par (difficulty in acquiring) with FB.  “Elemental Instability” – this makes the pet the bomb that current FB was supposed to.  Same 144min timer restriction.  Pet explodes upon reaching AE range with the mob.  When pet dies, it explodes for double his *current* hps as a PBAE, 30 seconds from putting the effect on him.  So if he’s been doing melee damage and getting output that way, and the mob has mashed him down to zero (or he takes a 1200pt AE on the way in), he explodes for less-than-optimal.  If the caster sent him in full and told him to /get lost, he’ll blow for full damage.  I’d like to see possible crits on this, but I can’t really imagine a realistic justification.  This effect should NOT be allowed to stack with ANY other spell or effect (i.e., no Aego prior to rushing in), and both FB and EI would be tied to same timer – so choose ONE to work with at any given moment.<br>
<br>
Elemental Forms...these have been discussed ad nauseam in other threads.  I don’t know what to say to this, other than for my own choice I’ll be picking either Water or Water unless/until something changes.  Doesn’t seem enough benefit to the others, and I haven’t really researched them heavily enough to make statements yet.<br>
<br>
Get rid of First Aid.  That’s about on par with Bristlebane’s Bundle, and I’m not spending a kajillion xps on it.  I can’t imagine a fantasy role-playing justification for this, either.  You could improve the Mend Companion line…that would be a nice replacement for this.<br>
<br>
Turn Summoned?  Please tell me, where would I use this effectively other than in Umbral Plains when we’re about to wipe because someone brought too many of Rumblecrush’s assistants?  Dump this, please, unless you’re planning on making a LOT more summoned mobs in the high-end game on which this effect would stick.<br>
<br>
Improved Reclaim Energy?  I’ve got half a dozen things that reclaim energy already.  Enough with this.  If you want to give us mana regen ability, get serious about it and stop with this bullcrap.  Every time I see an item with this on it, I keep thinking of that scene in Spinal Tap where the guy continues to insist “Mine goes to eleven.”  I want to shake someone’s head to see if I can hear the marbles clattering around in there.  What, exactly, is the point of all this fecal matter?<br>
<br>
Lose Mass Group Buff.  What use do we have for this?  As a magician, I would never spend time learning this, since it has no useful outcome.  Unless you’re going to let us throw Transon’s Protection on everyone in range.<br>
<br>
Elemental Pact…Okay, this is mildly cool.  I’m epic’d, so it means pretty much nothing to me, but for a lot of folks this will help.  Thank you.  Might be nice if this also affected the material requirement for Banishment (since Banishment also removes the xp and looting possibilities, I’d say it costs enough as is).<br>
<br>
Arch had a neat idea up there with his “Finale” pet idea.  Interesting.  Probably would be EXTREMELY rare to have six mages with that talent even online at the same time, but cool idea anyhow.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding some of the other posts I’ve read here…<br>
<br>
Uaellaen, was your point #1 a joke?  That’s got to be the worst accounting of a magician that I’ve ever heard.  If that’s really how you play, thank god you’re not on my server, magicians would have the worst rep around.  Everyone has a higher damage output than YOU, maybe, but you would be best advised to speak for yourself.  How lame can you be?  I solo regularly in Akheva Ruins, The Grey, Scarlet Desert, yadda yadda, and I don’t even 2box with a cleric.  What’s your malfunction?<br>
<br>
I see a few people saying they want to be NEEDED in a group.  What a load of horseshit.  I’m a DPS machine, and I’m not incredibly uber-equipped.  Even without epic, I unload a TON of damage.  As long as I manage agro properly, I’m fine.  People who know me, know that.  People who don’t know me, are pleasantly surprised when they watch me pick off adds and perform crowd control.  I regularly hear “Holy crap, look at that pet go!”  We as a class are already NEEDED in a group.  I’m guessing that most of the folks who don’t see this are either (1) crappy players, or (2) don’t know how to find people to group with.  Switching classes or uber-ifying magicians won’t help you.  Quit now or get over your lack of talent.<br>
<br>
You guys are so upset about warriors/rogues/monks having higher DPS…big freaking deal.  Warrior needs a cleric.  Rogue needs a taunter.  Monk is probably the closest thing to a soloer among those three, and that one is almost as fragile as I am.  We’ve got remote control tankage guys, make the best of it.  We can do things these classes simply cannot.  Stop your bitching about how so-and-so has better armor than me and can still do more damage.  Guess what?  He’s gonna take a lot more too, and he doesn’t have the option of gating away, or summoning a new 3k of hit points, when things go wrong.<br>
<br>
Try a pet group sometime, you guys.  That rivals AE any day of the week.  What a freaking load of whining.<br>

<br>
The whole 6-mages with a special aa summoning an uber pet of doom would indeed be very awesome, and wouldnt seem to unbalance the class because it would indeed be hard to find the 6 mages required to summon this beast. When I started the game I imagined our pets (because they were hardly referred to as pets in that intro manual) as being creatures of great power and magnificent form, not floating blobs of whatever element...<br>
<br>
And on form, someone mentioned that the epic should look like something more than a big air pet... I'd have to agree with this one. One day while thinking about the epic (I was a lowbie and had never seen the epic before) I imagined something with a skeletal system of earth (not a skeleton, more of a framework), veins of fire, skin and face of water, and a cloak of air... I know this would be heavy on everyone's comp but you could have the option of turning it off in the video card options...<br>
<br>
One other thing... since we are our pets and our pets are us, could they share our innate run speed, say if we had some form of run speed? countless times have I ran off in velks and had to wait because poor ol' Jobober cant keep up... would also help in other indoor dungeons where pets cant be expedience'd/velocitied... <p><table border=0 width=100%>

Uaellaen, was your point #1 a joke? That’s got to be the worst accounting of a magician that I’ve ever heard. If that’s really how you play, thank god you’re not on my server, magicians would have the worst rep around. Everyone has a higher damage output than YOU, maybe, but you would be best advised to speak for yourself. How lame can you be? I solo regularly in Akheva Ruins, The Grey, Scarlet Desert, yadda yadda, and I don’t even 2box with a cleric. What’s your malfunction?<br>

there isnt ... but try to solo in ME ... akheva is a pitty to solo ... and for the resists im talking about the old world ... somethign IS messed up there couse in the old world i get resists even from green mobs ... and no not everyone outdammages me ... and of course i 2 box couse no downtime for me. mages NOW do have a much better dmg output on higher lvl mobs since the patch.. and yes ..#1 was ment more sarcastic as you can read in line 1 with our &quot;master of the elements&quot;. probably you didnt understand it right since you only fight those pussys in akheva etc. but lvl 54+ mobs as in ME been RARLEY hit by my pet 50% been misses and the other 50% been for 26 .... etc. of course you cant understand my point when you only solo in that other zones where the mob lvl is lower then ME(depends on wher ein the grey you hunt).<br>

i assume you dont have the competition on druzzil as we have on nameless .. we have ALOT of uber guilds and so we have alot of UBER equiped melee wich outdmg you in seconds. nothing to do with your skill or anything you plain dont have the same DPS.<br>

Sorry most upper end wars havent needed clerics since NToV.... Alot have upwards of 5khp 1300ac and a fungi+aa skills that gives them 24 regen per tick....Thats a greater heal a minute and with 1300 ac all you need is a greater heal a minute...<br>
<br>
And monks are just insane :P an uuber monk will out solo a mage in his sleep its not even close not even with the pet upgrades<br>
<br>
Wars that are equiped like that (and monks) often would group better with a shammy....All the need is slow and regen to become killing machines..(altho they really dont need anyone at all)<br>
<br>
Do mages rock in normal groups? Hell yah.....Will we compare  in the current state of the game to an absolute high end meelee.....No....<br>
<br>
Until focus items scale we will not be as good as high end meelee's .Granted these meelees are the exception not the rule however as the months pass you will see more and more of them. As more guild reach the lvl of power to enter NToV or sraa or VT...<br>
<br>
If you dont belive me just look at the dps on a mage who's guild is still doing kunark bosses...Then look at the dps of a mage whos guild is doing Sraa....The change is almost nill now look at a monk doing kunark bosses.....Then look at a monk decked out in full NToV/VT/Acrylia.....his dps and defensive ability is just at least double or triple....<br>
<br>
Please I have only one thing to ask make focus items scale with difficulty like weapons :P...A VT focus items should be a ton better then a HoT focus items.<br>

Now that I can totally agree with - though I disagree that a warrior does not require a cleric.  They may have high regen, but they get utterly ripped by the mobs they're fighting at that stage.  Grouping with a Shaman is a wise move for them - but that applies to any of us.  Slow + Haste works just dandy, and at that point the heals needed really aren't of cleric level.<br>
<br>
And yes, I'm aware that monks can evade/dodge quite well - but it's not until they have massive resists that they can avoid the spellcasting that seems prevalent among just about every mob post-58.  His/her hps aren't all that much higher than mine, and since he/she doesn't have a pocket tank to throw at the mob, the monk had better be able to avoid damage...<br>
<br>
But all this hardly makes me a non-solo-capable character - and that rogue who just hit &quot;a&quot; better not whine when my pet dishes him out of his xps.  <br>
