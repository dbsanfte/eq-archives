Some of the vendors sell harder-to-find research components on a regular basis.  Supposedly, one can buy all the Ice of Velios one could ever want from a certain dwarven merchant in Dagnor's Caldron.  I've never seen this myself, but I do intend to check the next time I'm in the area-- I finally got my water pet, and won't need one for the next circle. <BR>  <BR> Second-- different guild merchants seem to have different pets, so far at least two per circle.  For example, for 29, it's fire and earth (I think)-- water I definitely had to research all the way from 20 (bought 'em from OOT). Still, this means one should keep an eye on what pets come at the next circle, particularly if it ISN'T the only pet you tend to use. <BR>  <BR> Third-- practice, practice, practice!  The higher the level, the harder the components are to come by, and the more one NEEDS to practice.  Just because you've no use for the HUNDREDS of words of tyranny you have doesn't mean you shouldn't practice level 20 spells until they triv-- you'll be glad you did come higher levels! <BR>  <BR> Fourth-- and along the same vein-- the Concordance Quest.  I'm looking for info on the triv levels for various spells.  Unfortunately, I'm already up to 64 in Research, so I won't be contributing the lower levels, but that makes it DARNED hard to know for what level research I should start collecting items (Journeyman?  Initiate?).

<br>
But even to such a soul, the prospect of going through all the motions of practicing in addition to doing the actual research can be daunting to say the least.<br>
<br>
At level 24 I found myself at the point where the issue could not be postponed any further. <br>
I got an overview of the materials needed and got the practice tome from the gypsy by trading away my beloved greater lightstone which I was fortunate to have by coincidence from before. <br>
I had the recipes from somewhere in these boards that claimed to be nearly 100% correct and not without expectation I made an attempt to make my very first azla practice rune. It failed. Obviously the very first recipe of the very first practice rune was false.<br>
I sat back and started to sweat.<br>
I was afraid I maybe had to run all the way back to the gypsies from my beloved Ak'Anon to get the recipe books, but I wasn't gonna give up that easy.<br>
So I did a /who using magician filter and started to tell the first few high level mages I could find to politely ask if they knew the recipes for the first few practice runes. <br>
After having talked to many a friendly mage ranging from 30 to some 40 levels, the conclusion could not be more unanimous.<br>
None of them knew anything about practice research because none of them had ever had any use for it.<br>
What they all had done was simply to pour the maximum number of practice points into the research skill at their guild trainers and started researching.<br>
Luckily I have always been extremely stingy with my practice points and had over 80 of them left myself.<br>
I saw a way to get out of the would be extremely time consuming and maybe even class discouraging process of research practice and went ahead and poured the max allowed points into my research skill. The very first research I attempted was everfount and I was successful at my first try.<br>
<br>
I don't think I will ever practice research except through the actual researching itself, and boy am I glad!<br>

I would love to practice but don't know the recipes.  I have been steadily pouring in points into research since 24th (used 10 pts to bring 1HB up a little, but thats it).  <br>
<br>
I failed my first 3 tries at the 29th lvl Earth pet but then succeeded twice in a row (twice because I'd bought two lvl 24 earth pet scrolls and made the first one. Decided I'd go for an extra :)). <br>
<br>
I should have about 15 more points to pour in when I'm 34th so hopefully I'll get my Fire Pet back soon after hitting that lvl.<br>

Then words are ridiculous, trying to buy Words of Incarceration are extremly expensive, I paid  500p for  5 words of incarceration and 2 words of bondage.  Its all a lot of money cuz regardless what they say only way you have money at high levels is you get lucky on the rare spawns.  Research is a money drainer, espically if you fail.  Hitting that combine button is scary when you got about 200p invested in the making of the spell. <br>

<br>
Use your training points on Research. What else do you have to use it on? Trade skills are just a way to sap money from your bank account, your casting skills will increase with usage, and your melee skills are pathetic all the time.<br>
<br>
The drawbacks of using points are that you only get 5 per level (but the cap on research rises at that rate too) and that it costs you money. But I once spent 100 plat at level 24 to pursue the practice research, and you don't get the guaranteed benefits of increasing your research skill.<br>
<br>
Use the guild trainer, what else have you got to spend it on? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mzee>Mzee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(7/17/00 3:27:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=10.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Research</span><hr size=1> Does anyone have any definative record of what spell components drop from what mobs? I keep getting information thats out of date. Get to a zone start killin stuff and an another mage goes by goin &quot;oh they dont drop words like they used to&quot;. I know that 'all&quot; mobs are supposed to drop for appropriate level, but does anyone have any proof of this? Basically Im asking for a spoiler, and I am not too proud to say it. If you get a word or component from a mob could you post it please? There's gotta be a zillion of us out there, Im feeling like theres a lot of greed and no luv. <br>

<br>
All your other skills can be easily improved with some simple practice sessions (casting over and over).  Research training requires hours of hunting or searching for the right components (especially at the higher training levels) to get a shot at improving your skill.<br>
<br>
It's easier and takes less time to just save your training points as you level up, and invest them later in life in your research skill.<br>
<br>
I've played all 4 INT-caster classes, and IMO the mage has the most difficult-to-obtain research components of any of them (barring a very few ultra-rare runes, pages, etc.).  Compounded with the need to re-research the LAST circle of spells to get a component to the NEW circle of spells!<br>

What is spell research?  I've read about how you combine ingrediants to create a new spell.  For example, i've read how you combine the lvl 12 water pet spell with some ingrediants to create the lvl 16 water pet spell.  Is this different from the one you buy from the merchants?  <br>
<br>
thanks<br>
