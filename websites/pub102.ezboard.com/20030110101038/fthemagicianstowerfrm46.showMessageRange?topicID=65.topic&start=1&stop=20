While I am not yet persuaded of the need for that, the fact remains that if there is no pet heal upgrade in PoP, then there will not be one for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Therefore, please make specific proposed PoP pet heals in this thread.<br>
<br>
Please try to explain why you think your proposal is appropriate.  Explain how it is intended to be used, and try to consider how it could be abused.  Please limit yourself to new 61+ PoP spells.<br>
<br>
To get the ball rolling, here are my ideas.  A PoP pet heal would have to be higher level, 65ish, as there is already a 60 pet heal.  If the purpose of the heal is to save your pet from death, then in order to be better at saving your pet than a nuke, it has be be a near-substitute for mend companion or complete heal, although not as good as either.  In order to keep it from being overpowering, it should have a high cost.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I would propose something like a complete pet heal with a star ruby as a component.  It would allow you to save your pet in emergencies at a cost, and would not obsolete Mend Companion.  Star rubies cost 60 pp each, and already used by mages for Banishment, which in a way is the opposite of pet complete heal.  I think pearl would be too cheap.<br>
<br>
I am sure there are plenty of other ideas quite different from this one.<br>

<br>
1.)  You can't upgrade every spell line with every expansion.  In effect they are giving themselves more to add to mages later.<br>
<br>
2.)  With the ability now to charm summoned creatures as well you will be able to heal them.  Theres certainly added power right there.  Yes I know Necros can to an extent, and so can druids now with their mini complete heal, but it would certainly be viewed as different for mages.<br>
<br>
<br>
If there is a new pet heal it will likely be mid 60's and do close to 2000 points of healing.  Pretty much everything else will be similar.  Actually if they carried on with current trends it would be around 1500 points of damage healed. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugruntou.showPublicProfile?language=EN>gruntou</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 10:19:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Pet heals</span><hr size=1> well since:<br>
-I consider my pet as a brother as a magician (I hate the idea to chain pet, and would do anything to keep my pet alive as long as possible)<br>
-we have a line of spells that give us a hp regen over time I consider my pet<br>
<br>
Then I would like to share my buffs with my pet at least<br>
<br>
since:<br>
-at low level the pet regen was good enough to heal them pretty fast after fights<br>
-at high level you have to wait OR spend plenty mana to heal them (if you compare with beastlord's heals that were meant to be hybrids shaman/monk, not hybrids cleric/monk/shaman) <br>
-Magicians that feel a lack somewhere about healing seem all gathering around the idea that they need to reduce downtime after a fight, because of low pet's regen / high pet hp.<br>
-Magicians aren't healers.<br>
<br>
I would really love seeing a line of regen buff for my pet, to help for downtime and would give another option for pet lovers (i.e that consider them as a part of them...sorry I am a good roleplayer *wink*)<br>
They gave a line of hp/mana regen for beastlords... here I only ask for hp regen Pet only, that would last for around 10 to 12 minutes (more, less, I don't care, but long enough to not look like a celestial healing/torpor)<br>
<br>
Why not an item that gives a focus effect? Because you shouldn't be able to share it with lower level magicians, or worse with other pet classes that could overpowersome of them.<br>
<br>
About the spell, I wouldn't mind if it wasn't BUYABLE, but a Quest spell.

<br>
Maybe not what you mean, but the way it works out.<br>
<br>
Now my idea of a 2500 or so point heal spell, at level 63-65 for 500 mana is about right. No component needed.<br>
<br>
It preserves your pet buffs, costs MORE than a new pet to cast. It will not complete heal a pet, but will keep it viable during a fight.<br>
<br>
As to why it is needed, because a pet is part of the magician class.<br>
<br>
yes we can chain them, or lavish attention on them in the way of buffs annd weapons that proc. So a heal that has true validity 2500 or so would keep that pet alive, and makes the time and investment worthwhile, or why bother at all on armour for pet, proccing weapons for pets, a muzzle on a pet, if it won't even last one battle. You outfit a pet with those items only if you plan to keep it around.<br>

<br>
Celesial Elemental Cleansing<br>
<br>
1600hp heal over 24secs<br>
400m<br>
Conjuration based.<br>
<br>
<br>
Let me explain that too. A 1600hp Heal over time has advantages and disadvantages over a direct heal. IMO Mage pets are very powerful and if you ever have to heal a pet during a 1 on 1 encounter with a mob then you are doing something wrong. Beastlords get heals because there pets need them. They do not tank nearly as well as mage pets. Mage pets have the advantage of tanking well while dishing out good damage. They do not have the option of chain casting so their pet dying is alot worse then a mage pet dying.  So a 2500hp heal will allow you to chain cast it with the 900hp heal making mobs like Yeldema and the like that much easier. <br>
<br>
If you play the mage correctly then do not fight something one on one that you and your pet can not take unless you intend to chain cast. I do not believe that VI should add heal spells in the game to allow the mage all types of play styles. A 2500hp heal will allow a mage to fight even harder mobs with only healing it. This could become a major problem when using the epic pet model.<br>
<br>
That aside the problem I have found is not healing during combat. If I am facing a mob one on one I never have to heal my epic pet. Over the course of 5 or 6 mobs his health drops low and it takes way to long for him to recover. A heal over time would help alot because we can heal the pet slowly during down time while having the advantage of medding during the time the pet is healing. If you are fighting something way to hard for you to tackle this heal will help but not overpower you during the encounter.<br>
<br>
2500hp heal I wouldn't turn down but it steps on BST toes and I don't want them stepping on ours so not going to step on theirs.  Those mages that do not have a epic have the option of summoning a new pet as oppose to healing them. I have to say that before i got my epic healing my fully armor pet was never a problem. I fought things that I could take down fast, easy and in bunchs. With epic healing is much more of a issue because it can not be chain cast. So giving us a 1600hp heal over time would help or they could just give us a quest that allowed us to convert Manifest Elements to a scroll. Then we could summon epic pet just like other pets and get the advantage of quick summoning and SCM3. I would take being able to chain cast epic over a 2500hp heal anyday =D.<br>

<br>
My point in earlier posts was that since we can summon the elements, banish the elements, charm the elements, mez the elements, etc, I think we should be much better at healing the elements than we currently are. This is coming from a pure RP perspective. <br>
<br>
Raz, your points about balance are fair, but personally I'd like to see it come down to player preference rather than the math shown in your orginal post. If a player wants to RP a callous nuker who likes to send pets to their doom, go ahead, if a player wants to RP a pet cleric and keep the pet alive as long as possible, that should be an equal option, not a less efficient one.<br>
<br>
I did really like Jaytee's suggestion about a % based healing spell, I think this would be the most useful way to implement a healing spell for both combat and post combat. <br>
<br>
Casting CH on a pet after a fight would be useless, as it would put such a dent in your mana bar that you'd have to wait before fighting again. Using a 40% heal would give the pet a nice boost (epic or normal), then you can briefly med, and pet can briefly regen before the next fight.<br>
<br>
Ideally you should be able to heal your pet to about 60% without having to drop your mana bar below 60%.  (leaving rods out of this discussion for now). Pet regen rate should be about equivalent to a mage with KEI.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd like to see both options implemented, perhaps the 40% heal at level 63, and the CH option at level 65.<br>
<br>
The 40% heal could be similar to the existing heal spells in both mana cost and cast time. (but can VI implement a % based heal other than CH?)<br>
<br>
The CH spell should take the same amount of time to cast as the level 60+ pets in PoP.<br>
<br>
One final suggestion would be to dramitically increase the drop rate on the current level 60 heal. Its really not an efficient spell, and not very deserving of its current low drop rate. The newer, more effective spells being debated here might warrant it however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utezron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>tezron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/02 8:24:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> arg</span><hr size=1> ok here's the deal. <br>
<br>
summon epic pet. 500m<br>
summon plate set 300m<br>
burnout 4/5 150m<br>
muzzle of mardu 100m<br>
total cost of pet 1050m<br>
total hp of pet ~= 4000. <br>
summon completely new pet with full bufs and gear hp/mana 3.8 (worst case ( add enshrouded veil scm3 gloves of dark summoing and this number is much higher)) ( double this number for chain casting since no plate or muzzle summoned)<br>
shock of feiry blades focused with summoned gear dmg/mana 3.725<br>
current lvl 60 pet heal 900 hp/400 mana = 2.25 <br>
what does this tell us. well that healing the pet is currently a waste of mana vs summoning a completely new pet and buffing it or just flat out nuking.<br>
lets just use 3.25 (close enough for now) as our unfocused dmg/mana for sofb. <br>
<br>
if we look at the current bst pet heal 1250hp/300 mana<br>
4.16 hp/m<br>
and for the sake of argument well assume bst need to heal thier pet more since they dont really have another means of dealing damage. (ignoring the 50% slow they have)<br>
so requesting that our current heals be moved more along the lines of 3.25 hp/mana seems a resonable suggestion. <br>
this would put the lvl 60 pet heal at 1300 hp. <br>
and lets add in a lvl 65 pet heal for around 2000 hp healed for 600 mana this is about a 50% heal for the  epic pet stick a 12 second casting time on it and i'd call that a balanced spell . <br>
<br>
<br>
what does this do for the mage class?<br>
well it makes playing cleric to the pet as viable an option as nuking. (depending on how hard the pet is getting slammed) it makes us situationally stronger against melee weak opponents. it cuts downtime as its a resonable ratio for healing the pet vs summoning a completely new pet. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Other suggestion: ( from left feild)<br>
summon fungi tunic (lvl 63): summons pet only version of fungi tunic. adds 15hp/tick to pet. great downtime reducer. disadvantage makes pets much stronger against lower lvl mobs. not that gvoc earth or the epic has a problem with low lvl mobs. marginal increase in power against blue foes ( this could be also implemented as making /pet sit down actually increase the regen of pets.)  <br>

<br>
Some of you asking whats the difference between a complete heal that costs more mana than totally buffing pet?<br>
<br>
You know how much more powerful the pet is when fully buffed.  Whens the only time you need a big heal?  When it's taking big damage.   When is it taking big damage?  When its fighting big mobs.   If you don't have to chain cast pets that adds a bunch to the overall power you are pumping out.<br>
<br>
Say pets are 3 times as strong roughly when fully buffed.  If you have have to chain cast 7 pets the first one is very effective and the others are trash.  (Even if you somehow chain casted the epic, it would pop without it's damage shield.)<br>
<br>
Keeping one pet also means you don't get summoned, which again is huge for bigger mobs.<br>
<br>
And then of course theres a little problem of an AA we have becoming much more useless.  That would be pet mend.<br>
<br>
Even taking the star ruby idea, it means that if you wanted to you could solo much higher mobs easier.  It would suck for XP but the exercise would likely be for the mobs loot anyway.<br>
<br>
Am I against the idea of more pet healing / support over chain casting pets?  No way.  I hate the idea of chain casting pets.  Conceptually sounds more of a necro way to do things.  (Sending disposible minions by the dozens.)<br>
<br>
But I'm tired of people downplaying how powerful heals are in comparision to chain casts.  Simply put, it would make a huge difference in what we could do.  And yeah sure I want it too.  But those guys at Verant aren't dumb.  So don't argue it on the merit that is supposed to be &quot;exactly the same as summoning and buffing a new pet.&quot;  Its not. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucyricusbloodbane.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1071<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/02 3:25:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: More pet heals..</span><hr size=1> I really like Wezloc´s idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=0000CC, strength=4)"><center><a style="font-family:Verdana; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none; font-size:14pt" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3300>Sage Cyricus Bloodbane</a></center></div>

<br>
I would propose an ~1500-1700hp direct heal for 400-450 mana at 63-65, with a possible Malachite reagent cost for RP reasons mainly.<br>
<br>
There is no reason at all for a Star Ruby cost.  None.  Why should healing our pet cost us the same as Disintegrate, Banishment of Shadows, and Banishment???  Those spells have an expensive reagent because they are immensely powerful speels able to destroy a mob instantly.  A pet heal is nowhere that powerful.  If CH has no reagent, and it is the most powerful heal spell in the game, then our far far less powerful heal should not either really.<br>
<br>
No need to suggest a crippling downside that would just invalidate the spell to the point of uselessness. Can you give ANY reason whatsoever that a Star Ruby reagent is needed??  Why not a Blue Diamond and make it even less likely to actually be used.  Typical mage self-flagellation that we always see; our own worst enemy.<br>
<br>
 Show me some proof, as you say, that this hypothetical spell needs a crippling downside please.<br>

So if you make it a star ruby they say SEE chain casting is better.<br>
<br>
Your right some of us are our worst enemies, and those with a certain point of view will make suggestions with enough NURF built in to make the spell almost never used.<br>
<br>
Malacite DOES make a RP sense, it allows us to summon the pet, it is the reason we can summon a pet (epic excluded). It is the MATERIAL from which pets are moved to this plane. It would make sense that it would also be the element you would channel through to increase your health of your pet.<br>
<br>
With elemental pack you wouldn't even consume one malacite, but just channel through the one you are require still to carry.<br>
<br>
While I always favor NO reagant, a Roll Playing reason can be made for malacite, not a Star Ruby as that has DESTRUCTIVE properties to channel through not healing. See banish summoned.<br>
<br>
Calebe<br>
<br>
Though for role playing sake lets avocate if a pet is up, and you chain one in under 5 minutes (dismissing the old one) it takes a Star Ruby, as your taxing the elemental planes supply of elementals. If over 5 minutes it goes back to a Malacite.<br>
<br>
Doesn't sit well with chain casters as it shouldn't as it would take that option away from them. THE SAME way it would take it away from people who wish to heal their pets, and they advocate a Star ruby to do so.<br>
<br>
Stop asking for X with Nurf Y in any request. It doesn't go over well with me and many others, as well as the fact that Verant can think of their own ways to do that all too well.

Star ruby cheal useless IMO. You suggest a star ruby to make sure it's used sparingly and for emergiencies i guess. I'm not gonna spare a spell slot for this spell, and if the situation comes up that I'd want to use it, it's not gonna be memmed and i'm not gonna be able to sit to mem it &gt;&lt; Star rubies are mad expensive btw.<br>
<br>
So really, I'd use it less than mend companion, which means I wouldn't need to use it because mend companion would be refreshed again... thus star ruby cheal becomes totally ridiculously situational as you only use it on a mob which requires more than one massive heal consecutively... and then you have to go farm stuff/abstain from buying l33t semicheap weapons in the bazaar to get back your cash.<br>

<br>
The reason I suggested my heal with a star ruby component, is that based on my preliminary model, the only heal that makes a real difference is something like a complete heal.  If it had no limitations, it would obsolete mend companion, which should be more useful anyway.  Choosing among our existing components, I reasoned that malachite is either too cheap, or would obselete Elemental Pact, pearl was too cheap, but star ruby is already used and is sufficiently expensive to limit its use.  I figure anyone who is putting Yakesha's on their pet surely won't balk at spending 60 pp to save their pet.<br>
<br>
Looks like my simple model is too simple, as it ignores hitpoints, and that medium quality heals, like the one suggested by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wezloc</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are useful.<br>
<br>
To my mind then, the question then becomes to make sure that a new heal serves a useful purpose without being better than chaining, which is a powerful techinique. As an earlier poster correctly points out, a heal that was too good would have all the advantages of chaining with none of the disadvantages, and in fact would be much better than chaining.  The new heal should also be less effective than nuking in closing the second gap, as mages are and should be better at nuking than healing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wezloc</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s proposal, while better than any existing heal, seems initially both moderate and significant.<br>
<br>
I also think that any heal short of a CH should require no component other than mana.<br>

I'll give you a reason.<br>
<br>
I like chain casting.<br>
<br>
I like it. I find it more suitable to my play style. I find it fun. I don't give a flying crap about the whole nuking vs chaining vs healing 'efficiency' or 'speed' debates/wars. I enjoy it, and it's obviously somewhat viable for exp if there's people defending it in the debates/wars, and that's good enough for me.<br>
<br>
If a pet heal were introduced which totally eliminated the need for chain casting (let's say, 200 mana pet cheal, for exaggerated example's sake) I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  could</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> still chain cast pets... But... it would be a lot less fun knowing that i'm gimping my kill rate, I probably wouldn't do it at all.<br>
<br>
Considering chain castable pets is one of the things which sets mages apart from other pet classes, and knowing that there are some mages that take great pride in chaining pets, it really wouldn't be fair to those mages to add a heal which completely destroys chain casting.<br>
<br>
But mages want better heals, so balanz does what balanz does, sums up the ideas found in other threads in a discussion post with a compromised suggestion which might make it more appealing to verant. Unfortunately, in particular this case, his compromise what totally worthless (hi, level 54 phantasmal armor anyone?)<br>
<br>
But anyway, there's your reason. A heal of that calibre needs a limitting factor... or else THE coolest optional fighting strat of our class is destroyed.<br>
<br>
And yeah, the pure power part of my brain obviously agrees that a 400 mana pet cheal is better than chain casting pets, but the whole of my heart would deeply mourn the loss of the chain casting strategy :\ <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A> at: 10/4/02 5:09:28 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalanzsonofanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2018<br> <font color=#333333>(10/4/02 5:14:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=65.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Please propose specific pop 61+ pet heals here</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Magician: Greater Transons Elemental Renewal<br>

Just compare it either of the 50+ pet heals.<br>

All of our existing pet heals have HP/mana ratios around 2.0 to 2.3.  This spells has a HP/mana ratio of 5.0, which I think is better than any heal spell I know of, except maybe BL pet heal.<br>
