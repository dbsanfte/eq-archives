As opposed to how its great if a bard is playing carpal tunnel syndrome candidate as described above, but in most groups this isn't necessary - haste and mana song will do? ;p<br>
<br>
Sorry, but I just couldn't resist. <br>
<br>
My final take on this is that any class can be an awe-inspiring and skillful addition to any group, or in most situations a &quot;press a and attack&quot;, &quot;play haste and mana song, press a and attack&quot;, &quot;stand up when the red line reaches the last two blobs and press CH&quot; attitude will suffice.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Nothing even remotely compares to how much effort it takes to play a bard at the peak of their power.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I disagree. <br>
<br>
As well as with this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>magicians and wizards are both pretty easy classes to play. A half assed magician or wizard is almost as good as a good magician or wizard.

<br>
What, and a bard is hard to play in groups? <br>
<br>
Really, a half assed bard will do in a group just as much as a half assed mage. All we really want is a few songs going, haste or whatever during battle, mana during downtime, or what have you. Sure, it's gonna be harder if you're covering mez/slow also, but if you're covering mez/slow/snare well, sux to be you.<br>
<br>
Cannipetting requires timing to be done well too. Cast 5 second pet, click instant reclaim item, cast other pet spell right away. If you click something at the wrong time, you're facing a few seconds while the spell gem pops back up, or stuff.<br>
<br>
And if you want 8 bags, you're gonna have to do item swapping... cept mages can't item swap while casting.<br>
<br>
During a fight, I have to chain nuke. Well, I want to anyway. If I get aggro off the melees and get summoned, good. If I get aggro repeatedly and train the mob away, I have just committed the highest sin of a caster. The remedy for this is not to control aggro (I can tank all I want since modern healers have infinite mana) but to stand on top of the mob. 'Course, the mob is moving from the melee push phenominon.<br>
<br>
No big deal usually. Cept when I wanna use a bolt. Then I have to do a lot of things. I have to predict where the mob is gonna be pushed, or else some melee will no doubt move in the way to block it, even on 2-second-scars-of-sigil. I've also gotta move my character left/right so I'm pointed straight at the mob, and be ready to duck if I know for sure if it's gonna be blocked.<br>
<br>
Oh, and while I'm doing all that, I have to manage my pet. This consists of zooming my 3rd person camera around while i'm casting spells, to keep an eye on him, me, the mob, and sometimes for possible adds. I'm always casting, so I have to be able to type /pe whatever (or move mouse and click something if you like ghey mice) quickly, and then spam it with shift+up. Pets can still break mez, so /pe back off is important... although I have pet hold, I usually go with the switch targets anyway, /pet back off that, /pet attack this, typed out really quick, that way my pet never stops dealing damage.<br>
<br>
So I'm nuking, seems straight forward right? Sorta. I could just nuke and not care, but that's not always fun for me. Sometimes I wanna just lazily nuke once a minute, and sometimes I wanna really play the game for all it's worth... juice some skill out of a skill-less game.<br>
<br>
I gotta choose which nuke to use, bolt, fire nuke, magic nuke, rain. I really don't have room for all those, (I could easily mem 2 nukes, 2 rains, and scars of sigil and still not be completely satisfied until I got another rain and scintillation in there) I'd have to switch them out. Switching spells is possibly harder for pet classes than any other. If you send your pet and sit right away... = instant aggro. You have to not send pet and hope the mob doesn't have lame KC style aggro, or send pet anyway and wait 15 seconds, then sit to mem.<br>
<br>
While I'm nuking, I'll nuke with SOFB, then click shrunken goblin skull earring and nuke again right away. This requires timing. Sure, I'm only pressing 2 things, but I get every DPS i'm worth.<br>
<br>
When that's all done, I need to get my mana back fast, so I finally get to cannipet. I have to reclaim my pet. I sacrifice all his buffs and armor. I cannipet as fast as I can. <br>
<br>
Cast Greater Conjuration:Earth<br>
Click Torch of Alna<br>
Cast Monster Summoning II<br>
Click Torth of Alna<br>
Go to step 1<br>
<br>
This is timing too. If your timing is off, you miss a brief instant, but brief instants add up. Duh, a few measly nanoseconds might not matter much... but then again it doesn't matter much if a bard's twisting is a second slow, either.<br>
<br>
Then you have to know when a pull is coming and to stop cannipetting. Cast greater voceration water(epic if you're feeling lucky about the mobs taking the long pathing around) cast burnout 4 on it quickly(burnout 3 pants if pathing bad), be ready to send it and start nuking.<br>
<br>
Course, that's if there's downtime between pulls. If there's downtime, I pounce on it and get canniing. Otherwise, I usually have to find good opportunities to cannipet.<br>
<br>
That's actually the hardest part though. Reclaiming a pet while the mob is alive means a drop in DPS both from lack of pet and lack of my nuking. I might usually wanna try to get 20 seconds in between on mob transition or at the beginning of a new mob while the tank gets aggro. Sometimes, I won't.<br>
<br>
One key is, which some don't realize, if I nuke down one mob and then cannipet clear through the next, I'm gonna massively stagger the spawns. I really don't want to do that in most areas. One of the hardest parts of playing hard as a mage is finding a place to cannipet without totally messing up the spawn frequency. However, sometimes you might want to!!!! By cannipetting clear through, say, the killage of spawn point b, I assure that that spawn is staggered. Then I can just wait to mob at spawn point a is dead on the next respawn, and I know I have time to cannipet again... and hey, my group won't notice. So basically, I have to keep spawns even so we don't get a lack of mobs or get overwhelmed... and if I do create that situation, I have to be ready for it on the next respawn.<br>
<br>
Yeah. And then, there's several spells I'll cast a lot<br>
<br>
MS2<br>
GC:E<br>
ceadeau of flame<br>
COTH<br>
GV:W<br>
Mala<br>
Malosini<br>
Mod rod<br>
<br>
as well as the following nukes:<br>
SOFB<br>
scars of sigil<br>
shock of whatever<br>
Rain 1 (we get tons of rains at the end of our careers, so our 3 rains change a lot as we level)<br>
Rain 2<br>
Rain 3<br>
<br>
And then of course the epic, which has 5 minute recast, so if you want that up, you have to keep it up always. Oh, and MMT if you have 8+ casters who actually use the craprods. Oh, and buffs, but those only need to be cast once every few hours, whereas the above spells all are cast more often.<br>
<br>
So swapping spells is sometimes much of a challenge, because of the aggro from sitting, ESPECIALLY with a pet on a mob.<br>
<br>
sooo<br>
<br>
nuke &amp; maintain mob positioning/line of sight to mob<br>
cannipet<br>
control pet<br>
manage spells<br>
don't screw up respawn<br>
<br>
And each of these 5 things could easily have a book written about them, though I tried to keep them as simple as I could while still giving you an idea of how they work.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying bards suck. In fact, most of the stuff I said about my playing is equally important for bards (chexing in 3PV for adds, etc) and I'm sure bards would juggle spells around too, if they weren't illiterate. (stab at the low med cap, not stab at people playing bards :p)<br>
<br>
What  I AM saying is, <br>
<br>
The skill required to play a bard is AT LEAST a little overstated.<br>
<br>
And the skill required to play other classes, especially mages, is AT LEAST a little underestimated.<br>
<br>
What it adds up to is AT LEAST a little  incorrect perception of class difficulty.<br>
<br>
Yeah, if you get 90% of mages, all they do is aggro control, but if you get me and a few select others, most of whom you'll probably find on this message board, you get a god. <p>Insert HTML babble here.</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krilenspiritlink>Krilen Spiritlink</A> at: 11/1/02 6:19:11 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=aamen>Aamen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 6:31:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=43>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Elementally, my dear Watson!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Hardest class to play in a group?

My friend let me play his 57 monk a few months ago.  I had never played a monk prior to that.  We grouped a bit and I pulled.  I messed up FD.  Second pull, I split the mobs with little difficulty.<br>
<br>
Does this make me a skilled puller? No.<br>
<br>
*Any* player who is reasonably observant of mob behavior and pathing (which is basically any veteran of EQ not toking up between pulls) could have done that pull.  Any pull after that is the same.<br>

<br>
Yeah, I'll second that.<br>
<br>
I have a level 51 monk. I quit there and left in in  PoH for a year or so, because of the epidemic.<br>
<br>
Pulling really isn't that hard, especially with taggers. FD was probably actually harder before the 35+ nerf, simply because tagging hadn't been invented yet.<br>
<br>
And because monks used to be a niche. A pre-kunark monk wouldn't have his honor ruined by having someone tag off of him. He'd sit there all day til he got it right, and walk back with one mob.<br>
<br>
'Course, kunark rolls along, iksars are monks, then velious and it's insane for a monk to use fists, and monks are no longer the class described above.<br>
<br>
I would have LOVED to see content designed to challenge monks, I would have loved to see monks be a pulling class. But unfortunately, VI said they'd never balance the class around FD pulling, or something.<br>
<br>
I'd play my monk if FD pulling was the awe-inspiring feat that it was for me back in old CT prekunark, watching Jondoe Mongoose (they all fit mongoose in their name somewhere) finally succeed in splitting 10+ caster lizards by himself.<br>
<br>
But frankly, it's not. There's like 10 or so rules to know, and then you know FD, and most FD pulling encounters are dead similar. Casters have more spells to memorize the effects of than that. <p>Insert HTML babble here.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=saethan>Saethan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 10:55:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Elementally, my dear Watson!</span><hr size=1> Just since I saw a lil argument on it, my bard is 10x harder to play well than any other class I've ever played.

I have to laugh at this........<br>
<br>
16-22 Pulling 10-16 mob kites (hounds) in EK, pffft easy.<br>
<br>
22-30 Pulling EVERY aviak out of the aviak tree in SK(which is quite a sight, erm so I have been told), pffft easy.<br>
<br>
30-40 cougars, wolves etc in IC, who cares about adds, pffft easy.<br>
<br>
40-50 can't find a place where I can PULL enough mobs (only able to find 8 or so socials at a time), pffft been easy though.<br>
<br>
Get an add that runs at the wrong speed, mez it and keep kiting the rest. selo (w/o drum), aoe (with brass), pffft easy.  In case of a lag spike, your going to take a little dmg, so twist in heals no biggie.  <br>
<br>
The one thing I learned (and I learned it while I was trying to make a huge train for a ss), is that you can time it so that all mobs (even if they are different speeds) can be placed in Aoe range at the same time while keeping them all out of melee range.  It's all timing and I find timing easy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jayteebushwacker>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Summoner Da'FoH</span><br>  Posts: 1184<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 3:26:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=397.topic&index=48>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Elementally, my dear Watson!</span><hr size=1> Why thank you for the compliment sir =) <p><hr>

Amen to that. I died more since I dinged 61 then I did between levels 55-60. Almost always in my career I could start nuking on mobs when they were 80% and simply chain till either the mob was down or I was lom / oom. <br>
Now it's 2 2k bolts before the mob hits 60% and nobody is going to get the aggro away from me.<br>
<br>
Even worse when I get a resist. Resist = intant aggro = death. Man I wish my guild didn't have such crappy melee <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>

Playing a mage takes fewer keystrokes than being a bard.  Think about how much work I am doing for you before you consider reclaiming me.<br>

<br>
For some people it's a perception thing. They perceive that playing a Mage can be difficult, or they perceive that playing a mage is easy.<br>
<br>
I perceive that I can play any class with only an hour to research a little. Does that make every class easy to play? No, it just means I know way too much about this game. <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>

To me my Cleric is far harder to play than my Mage, simply due to the fact that the entire group is counting on my cleric to make sure nobody dies.  However, my Mage has to manage a heck of a lot of things at once (particularly you, Jobaber, little twirp) as well.  I prefer to play my characters as powerfully as possible, and make it so the xp flows fast and good.  Usually that means my mage will burn down a mob fast if we get an add (which amazes my groupmates <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) or sick Jobaber onto and add, get infront of a mob that's antagonizing the Enchanter, or do basically anything else to keep the group strong and healthy.<br>
<br>
I love group dynamics, but it is also nice to break away and solo (something I really can't do very well with my Cleric).  Finding new ways of working wonders with each class is what makes the class hard, but rewarding. <p>Valaglar : Cleric of 50 Blessings<br>
