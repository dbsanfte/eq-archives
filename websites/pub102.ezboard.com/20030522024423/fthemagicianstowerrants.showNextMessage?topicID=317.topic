OK So tell me again why I have to ditch my friends to get my Mage epic?<br>
<br>
After 28 raids (25 real ones plus 3 all night CRs) and more than 160 hours invested in trying to get just ONE piece of my mage epic, I know now what I have to do to increase my chances to the point where I probably will finish it; but for me that's not a valid option - I'd have to leave my small guild of friends behind and join a larger guild.<br>
<br>
1.) At first I didn't know what I was doing and just attended open raids, but I was happy because I got all my mage class armor - that took 7 raids.<br>
<br>
2.) A couple raids later we finally made it to the 2nd floor and I was amazed to see the zone outside of the port up room or gatehouse. It was fun.<br>
<br>
3.) I had a few bad expereinces around raid 10 with the mage Fire staff (not for epic). A Mini dropped the fire staff and the raid leader awarded it to the mage in his guild as a consolation prize for not seeing Magi P'Tasa and his staff - I guess it wasn't an open raid after all. Another raid I went on, a fire staff dropped and the raid leader (who was ignorant of our quest) got excited and had the leader of the KS group loot the staff for MQ for a mage in his guild who wasn't even there, but that item is no drop and it got burned - I guess that raid wasn't open either (contrary to posted info).<br>
<br>
4.) After 15 raids and still yet to have seen Magi P'Tasa I kept trying. By this time I was lvl 58 and could use Eye of Tallon (thank you for the aggro changes to that spell that were made!). I started sending the eye out on every raid over and over again looking around and got a map. I learned the layout of the first floor and some of the 2nd floor. This took a few raids because I sent eye during down times.<br>
<br>
5.) After a few more raids I decided to try camping at the zone and logging in to see if I could start tracking the zone. I lucked out a few times and didn't die, but eventually learned that the zone in isn't a safe spot becuase the Spite Golem WILL come if he's nearby and you are not invis.<br>
<br>
6.) A few more raids later I decided to camp out near the ramp on the way back down to the port in room and check the zone later. I found this to be in general a pretty safe place - I did die there once after leaving the computer logged in but usually it doesn't happen. I spent from Thursday night (the night before the day before I thought the Minis were due to spawn again) until Tuesday morning either camped in Hate or on a Hate raid. I took account of that zone at least every three hours for 4 and 1/2 days. I learned things about the zone most people don't know (like what a reasonable estimate of the Mini spawn time is - and I went back and measured this this same way accounting for each individual spawn spot for a couple more cycles - and the crazy antics of the mobs on patrol near the zone in) and know the zone layout better than quite a few monks. It was during one of these EXHAUSTING camping session that I learned about the 10 Mini spawn spots and how I saw more than one of the same Mini in the same cycle (which means by the way assuming that if two of the same Mini can't be up at the same time and if each mini can spawn at each of the 10 spots with equal probability that there is only a 65% chance Magi P'Tasa will show up that cycle if a raid or an uber guild takes down the Minis as they spawn - I know basic probability theory well enough to do that simple calculation). It was during one of these camping session that I finally saw Magi P'Tasa - because of how I was checking the zone I was able to catch him within a few hours of his spawning in the middle of the night. He didn't have the staff  The only time I saw him in all my time and he didn't have the staff.<br>
<br>
8.) By this time, I am recognizing and chatting with a quite few people I see on different Hate raid I go on. I remember who the leaders were, who were the enchanters, who the pullers and main assists were, and people I've been in groups with. I know at least 8 people now on each raid and not everyone makes it to every raid. Some of the people are the mages I might have to random the staff with later someday (this is the part that is most gut wrenching)<br>
<br>
7.) I happened to be able to log in today the day of the patch. I logged in S Ro and not to my surprise another mage I know is LFG on the wizard platform waiting for a Hate raid and watching for snipers - since the Minis should spawn later today there will inevitably be some. An hour later an enchanter I know pops in and after talking to her I found out that her guild and guild alliance is going up to do the zone. I asked her if I could join but there were already three mages from that guild going up to try to get the staff today. That's just from one guild alliance.<br>
<br>
8.) Last nights raid got steamrolled by an uber guild - They even had the audacity to say that they would sell a MQ of the earth staff if it dropped. This was the same guild that snipped three of the Hate raids I went on last month.<br>
<br>
That's just not right. The whole thing is #%@!ing usless!!!!<br>
<br>
This isn't fun anymore. It's work! You log in, you put your time in, hope for some recognition, and then go home tired.<br>
<br>
I know now what I have to do to get my last epic piece. I need to leave my small band of 5 or 6 friends who are usually on in my guild and join an uber guild that has the ability to instantly call forth a raid force as soon as Magi P'Tasa spawns faster than anyone else on the server and then go camp a &quot;safe spot&quot; for a couple weeks. I don't want to do that. WTF!!! The other option is to make a lot of cash to buy stones, dots, shrink potions, and try to line up MAs, Monks, Clerics, and enchanters and host my own raids for 3 or 4 days in a row. Besides that, the only thing to do is get lucky and hope he spawns while the raid is on.<br>
<br>
I can understand some items in the game are uber and there is the concept that there is prestige associated with that (OMG nice job by the way on the spoken links thing but after looking at some spoken links to some items from the Mob boss in Vex Thal I'm just depressed - here I am and I can't even get my epic). But there are a lot of epics out there now and I did put in over a year of work to this quest and am almost done - it comes down to now if I get the Earth staff I get my epic. It's not like an uber item from an uber mob that I can't do. I've seen 22 Minis go down so far (1 was Magi P'Tasa and he was being sniped as we ported in the same one without the staff I saw the day before - and what does that say for the how wanted the Magi P'Tasa is in Hate - guilds snipe that mob but not the others). I can assemble a raid force of 25+ good people to do the fight with enought advance notice (just not over and over and over again for the same thing with nothing to show for it). A lot of people have epics - I'm almost lvl 59 and think it would be nice to have - I have put in the time. <br>
<br>
This - our mage class quest - is totally FUBAR!!!! I'm quite turned off to all other quests and tradeskills and my goal is now to get lvl 60, get aa points, get /pet hold (screw the raid leader when he says I can't have a pet), and go for the record number of Hate raids. I know a few people over 60 so far and have heard of certain Hate raid leaders at 150. OMFG, I hope I get my staff by then.<br>
<br>
My whole focus is changed - I'm going to have done more Hate raids than anyone else has ever done and maybe I might get lucky and get the staff - either that or I'll be burned out and not play this game anymore. I just don't want to ditch my friends and join an &quot;uber&quot; guild. C'mon WTF!!<br>
<br>
I'm sorry but I just had to RANT!!!  So pissed off.<br>

Sounds like you need to take a hate or EQ break.<br>
<br>
I totally agree that the mage epic needs to be changed such that at LEAST the staff drops each time he's up.  I think that wouldn't be too much to ask would it?  I mean, after all, they just changed Ragefire...TWICE!!!!<br>
<br>
And to confirm, when I did see the mage staff drop, he was seen wielding it.  I wasn't allowed to random on it because there were mages on the raid further along than me.  I was bummed to say the least.<br>
