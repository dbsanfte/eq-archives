<br>
How about?<br>
anyone who thinks someone has the right to BUY better housing and clothes than someone else is immature and ain't seen enough misery and death to make them understand how damn wonderful decent housing and clothes are, and what they mean for people.<br>
<br>
Or?<br>
anyone who thinks someone has the right to BUY better hookers and booze than someone else is immature and ain't seen enough misery and death to make them understand how damn wonderful decent hookers and booze are, and what they mean for people.<br>
<br>
Education and health care are goods just like any other. Your attitude clearly reveals that your problem is really with the fact that some people are better than others, some people work harder, some people are luckier, and this will always lead to some people having better things than others. While you delude yourself thinking that you'll be supplying the best of everything to everyone, all you will really accomplish is to bring everyone down to the level of the poorest.<br>
<br>
The world can be unequally wealthy, or it can be equally poor. Being equally wealthy is not an option.<br>
<br>
It is the desire to be able to buy better things (better than they have now, and also better than what they see their neighbors have) that makes people go to work instead of sitting at home playing video games. Without the knowledge that you are better off working than sitting around doing nothing, no one will bother to do anything. The economy will collapse and will remain depressed until the government gives up idiotic outdated disproved economic theories and stops preventing people from doing what they want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magi Draconis</span><br>  Posts: 2079<br> <font color=#333333>(10/19/02 5:33:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: idiot socialists</span><hr size=1> So, your child/wife/mother/father/brother/sister/fiend or jsut plain anybody you care about is dying, they need a transplant.<br>
One rich person BUYS the rights to that heart or can afford the operation and you can't.<br>
is that fair?<br>
<br>
Moron rich kid brat gets to high expense school gets soemwhere in life PURELY because of the reputation of that school but he is a total idiot. Is that right?<br>
<br>
No my problem is not with folk who work hard, if someone works hard and gets more than me, why the hell should I worry? I aint lost anything, it's their right to do things their way, good luck to them. But I detest loathe and depsise people who think that money = God Almighty and that anything is right to gian money and that money is the be all and end all of humanity's reason to exist.<br>
I dotn give a rats whether its some person from a poor backgroudn selling heroin to his own neighbourhood, or a rich one firing all his factory workers so he can move his business to a 3rd world country so he can make higher profits when he does that PURELY to raise profits, not to save their business from ruin (9/10 theres no frekain reason to do it excpet to boost profits, higher work costs in Western nations perhaps but you get quality, and you support the local economy, your own nation AND the people how generally BUY your own products).<br>
<br>
You sound liek someone who's been brain washed by 100 years of Capitolism sop you DARE not think in anyway BUT that money is God. You know like how the Communists brainwashed THEIR natiosn for years, hm?<br>
Money is just a tool, it has NO RELEVANCE TO REALITY ANY MORE. You know governments sold off gold reserves because of this? You do know how many trilliosn of dollars are exchange dfor stocks of thinsg that doent even exist? (futures). Or that money trading chrionically destablizies the world economy at times and takes money OUT for nothing IN? They are making money buying and selling stuff that doesnt exist, ever thought of that?<br>
<br>
Socialism is the prinicple that people come FIRST.<br>
Capitlosim is the principle of spreading and creating wealth.<br>
<br>
problem with the former is generally beauracracy becomes an unwieldy nightmare, and the fact people have to take RESPONSIBILITY for society themselves (ie be good citizens).<br>
<br>
Problem with the latter is that money does NOT buy happiness or encourage morality (though we can debate on what those things are), and that too many at the top dont realize that it's a pyramid, while they deliberately engineer things to suck up as much wealth personally as possible and destroy the base of the pyramid to promote this, it means there is less of a *base* for the pyramid and thus less rich folk, and danger of it literally collapsing.<br>
Wealth accumulates from the BASE UP. It never works the other way (aka Idiot Reagan and Trickle Down).<br>
<br>
Capitloism is the means to an end: the betterment of people. problem is more an dmore control is being lost over the economic systems and thats leading to trouble. Most coporations dont give a fig about morality, only their stock price. They are nto accountable. They have engaged in pollution, warfare, gun running, espionage, murder etc when ti suits them.<br>
here's a point:<br>
Adloph Hitler caused the deaths of about 60 million people.<br>
Osama Bin Laden has cause dthe deaths of about 4,000.<br>
The tobacco companies actiosn may cause the deaths of over 250 million. Deliberate hiding of evidence of selling an addictive lethal product, and indeed, enhancing those dangers deliberately.<br>
So you see the Green Berets tearing up the executive board rooms of tobaco companies, hm? Do you see any of them on trial for genocide?<br>
<br>
human beings are not valued in money, you dont realize that, you're sooooooo out of luck.<br>

<br>
I have yet to see ANY form of government work the way it was intended. Human greed will always taint even the noblest intentions.<br>
<br>
Speaking of money... The dollar is merely a form of measurement. If anyone thinks to ask 'a dollar of what?' the correct response is CREDIT (or possibly DEBT, depending on how you look at it). Thank you Fed. :P  The sad thing is some of the highest rated currency in the world has NOTHING backing it.  ... now, how much more is money worth than people?<br>
<br>
Trickle down theory doesn't work. That much has been proven by Everquest. Just look at the high level caster spells. VI said they would 'trickle down' to the lower level people. The problem is greed reared it's ugly head again. Many high level spells have been first distributed to the casters in the uber guilds, then all other copies are either destroyed, sold to other uber guilds or sold to other players for asinine amounts of money. Admittedly this isn't the best example, but I believe it makes my point. Nearly every problem we face today can be traced back to a person or group's greed. <br>
<br>
There is nothing wrong with Capitalism if applied the way it was intended. The intention is to create and SPREAD wealth through trade and work. Not a thing wrong with that... until you add the damning factor that people are involved. There's where it starts to go horribly wrong. Some on the top decide that they want more, so begin to tighten their grip, choking the SPREADING part and hoarding the wealth creation part for themselves.<br>
<br>
There is also nothing wrong with Socialism... until you bring people into the equation. There are just far too many self-serving and just plain greedy (there it is again) people to allow this to flourish. <br>
<br>
Until we as a society (world-wide if necessary) can find an alternative to the necessity for money (for example: free, clean unlimited power) there will always be those that seek to hoard it and at the same time not allow it to fall into the hands of others.<br>
<br>
<br>
Being in EQ has actually shown me a large number of social aspects reflected from the real world that I probably wouldn't have ever seen. This game (or as I like to call it, experience) tends to amplify human nature and really show what they are like. It seems being online and protected by anonymity actually AMPLIFIES someone's personality.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The world can be unequally wealthy, or it can be equally poor. Being equally wealthy is not an option.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
This illustrates my point. Why does wealth matter that much? If you're willing to put in some work, you don't actually need ANY money at all. Admittedly, that would basically make you a farmer, but then again isn't it food we're REALLY all working for anyway? I don't know many people that could survive with no food at all. I know I could survive without my computer... for a while anyway. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Take a look around, is this a perfect world?  Something my mother has told me, your mother has told you, the mother of your ancestor told your ancestor, LIFE IS NOT FAIR.  Why do you bother to just look at the past 100 years, why not go back the past 4 to 5 millenia?  Human society has always based power on those who control the most of the valued commodity of the time.  Whether that be a bronze tool, their position in the church, the amount of gold they own, or the amount of land they own, it is the way human society functions.  It is part of human nature to desire to be better than another person, you can't deny it.  Capitalism is NOT a method of bettering everyone, it is a method of bettering those with the most skill, intelligence, and charisma.  Also, if I remember correctly from an economics class I had in high school, wouldn't a better form of government be Communism?  If I recall, Socialism is the precursor to Communism, in which there are still leaders to guarantee the adequate distribution of resources, while in Communism, the leaders have been eliminated. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/ufarmatyr1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>farmatyr1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 199<br> <font color=#333333>(10/22/02 11:08:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: idiot socialists</span><hr size=1> Umm..yeah, just like the leaders were eliminated in the USSR and China.<br>

Capitalism actually works in the real world. It does not lead to perfection, but it makes sure there'll be food in the store.<br>
<br>
Socialism does not work in the real world. It strives for a form of perfection, and that is its failing. People are not habitual altruists, and socialism can only work if people are willing to work to help others instead of themselves.<br>
<br>
Would it be better if people were not selfish @#%$? Sure, I'll grant that. Would it be better if we had some form of ultra cheap energy that caused no polution? You bet it would.

Do you like it? If so, God help you, quite literally, because THAT'S what Jesus, Buddha and a WHOLE load of people from every aspect of life, religious and agnostic, scientist and stonemason,  have been trying to wake everyone up to for a long time. Jesus was around now he'd pobably get put to death on the electric chair after being framed cause he'd threaten the economic realities, or assassinated as a &quot;commie&quot;. Yeech. (nevermind the religious implications, the Sermon on the Mount is one of the cornerstones of modern morality)<br>
*SOCIALISM* is the idea of  &quot;people come first, peopel are important&quot;, it's NOT freakin' communism, are you dense? Problem is that folk take it as a &quot;political absolute&quot; rather than a basis for starting things from. or get so wrapped up in the beaurcracy of it they over look the fact that its about HUMAN BEINGS, be they one, or a million, ALL have rights.<br>
<br>
Democracy is vital, for change, for concentual government, for comparitively less corruption.<br>
Socialism is vital to promote a country that cares about its people, because it's people are its greatest ASSET and how people feel in regards to each other determines the quality of life in society not it's MONEY.<br>
Captiolism provides wealth and accumulation of materials that make life better, and promotes change and innovation.<br>
THATS what generally makes a pretty effective government, would you disagree with that?<br>
<br>
Socialism is an IDEAL, so of course it don't work in this world because too many folk are pragmatic selfish bastrds. And folk just let that slide...*spits* If you see someone injured on the side of the street and don't even bother to phone for an ambulance, you're a swine. if your   boss orders cutbacks in safety that jeapordize lives, and you don't open your gob, your'e a swine.<br>
Why do I get anoyed? Hey sell heroin, kill your neighbours, who cares, make MONEY! If you get more brains, go corporate, who cares if you pollute the world and will probably kill half the population in the next 50 to 100 years, make MONEY!<br>

<br>
There will be always greedy and selfish people working only for themselves, while others go on strikes and sometimes die to gain everyone a better life, a better dialogue position with the representants of the capital.<br>
<br>
You know, its not because communism or Socialism was a failure and a dictatorship that it didnt, at the begining, try to answer some very real problems....<br>

In other words, its not because socialism turned into crap that capitalism is golden, sooooo far from it.<br>

<br>
 There are inherit flaws in both socialism and capitalism. In socialism you find that ~some~ people are just willing to do nothing, because they know that their basic needs will be met, so they are willing to let others work to support them. Let's call this : Laziness.<br>
<br>
 In capitalism ~some~ people (maybe ~most~) of the rich are willing to sell their own grandmother to make a 2 cent profit and they really don't care if their economic style means that MILLIONS live under bridges with no food or health care. Let's call this : Greed.<br>
<br>
 There SHOULD be some sort of balance met so that everyone's basic human needs are met, whilst at the same time, those that work hard, or take economic risks are rewarded for what they do....<br>
<br>
 As a footnote, I ~am~ embarrassed that I live in the richest country in the world and we FAIL to offer a minimuim health care program to those that are economically disenfranchised.<br>

On the health issue, resistant Tuberculosis epidemic shows what happens if your stupid enough to NOT have non-commerical health care as your primary health system.  Disease doesnt give a damn if your rich or poor, anyone ever studied history, cholera and plague epidemics of middle ages and the 1800s?<br>
Commercial health care doesnt have an interest in CURING DISEASE OR PREVENTING IT. becuse that chokes the cash flow. At the end of the day, the only goal is to make cash, not cure. Hippocratic Oath, anyone? Scandals of not accepting high cost patients, selling treatments at vastly inflated prices...<br>
  People should have the right to CHOSE their doctor, but *nobody* should *EVER* be able to *BUY* better health care than someone else, except when it's purely cosmetic surgery (which is usally a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>want</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, not a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>need</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->).<br>

The left wing defines morality as the government forcing me to pay for health, education, etc for others I don't even know. The right wing tends to accept that I can choose to do this for myself for those I feel are worthy.<br>
<br>
The &quot;Poor&quot; in America are better off than people in less capitalistic societies. (VCRs, cars, other things people would call luxuries in a less rich society) I fail to see the Great Enemy of Capitalism that you do.<br>
<br>
People die. That's life. Rich or poor, etc. <br>
Oh and life isn't fair. It isn't going to be. And no law can make it so either.<br>
<br>
That transplant you talk about -- how would you determine who gets it if not who can afford to pay for it themselves? Do you know about the public health program in canada and how many people come to the US to get help before they die because of the waiting periods, etc?<br>
<br>
You probably think me heartless because I DO accept that death is part of life. That everyone can't have everything they want or desire. Andthat even the rich have their problems. (BTW what do you define as rich? Someone able to afford a transplant? Do you have any idea how many transplants are paid for by the community -- NOT the government forced community , but voluntarily, people getting together to give to a cause. Churches taking up special offerings for those active in their bodies, etc. Forcing people to be part of (a material part of) their community for that added bit of insurance later on.<br>
<br>
It isn't a bad thing to expect people to take care of each other -- those they care for, etc. It makes sure money isn't wasted on those who don't have true needs. And helps those who donate to KNOW that their money is being spent wisely and to see the results for themselves.<br>

      i would love to see a day when poverty is at its lowest and most people have good living, not a socialistic society that wont allow you to better your self, I/E personal wealth, better homes, computers cars ect... think about what your supporting and look at the current examples for them, lets see, USSR their economy(or lack there of anyways) collapsed, because of  to tight and restrictive govt. controlls, same thing is happening to north korea vietnam and china. your options in life are as follows, live in capitalism and live a decent happy life, or live in communism/socialism and live a poor miserable life, i for one want a happy life with all the acceseries, there for i choose capitalism. <br>

Randul, you are clearly making the confusion between totalitarianism and socialism.<br>

Those people who took power in USSR and China were a very tight minority in the galaxy of socialism, they totally perverted an ideology, in order to turn it in a convenient tool for themselves.<br>

No more, no less.<br>

The heart of socialism is very simple actually, its all about mankind: man must be the center of everything, it has to be the subject of his own future, not an object in a theory where welth creation would be the main concern (aka capitalism).<br>
<br>
Very simply, what are we talking about here?<br>
<br>
Social Justice, same Education for everyone, minimal housing and clothing guaranteed.<br>
<br>
Guarantee that everyone in the country will have the same access to those very basic needs, for the same price and at a very high quality : Energy, transports, education, Health system, Communications, ...<br>
<br>
This is called public utilities.<br>
<br>
The principles are easy to grasp: the private sphere must interfere the least possible, if you decide to work for your people, fine, but you will be at their service, the particularity beeing that you cant make benefits from such activity, nor demand any form of profitability except the general well beeing.<br>
<br>
It means of course that the state must be very strong, but why wouldnt it be the case, since its the manifestation of the Nation will?<br>
<br>
&quot;i dont want to merely exist and pay ungodly amounts of taxes and/or give my money away to others, i want to better my existance, have a better house, a better car a bette computer not just exist&quot;<br>
<br>
You just want to show off, but sadly that's an estate bellow existence.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;in my opinion the U.S.A needs to completely stop giving money to other contrys and spend it on the poor and sick in its own country&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
USA give less than 0,25 % of their gross national product to help development in the world.<br>
Maybe you think its too much when it should be at least 0,7% as US promised with the rest of OECD countries.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, 30000 people die everyday in the world because they dont have access to clean water.<br>
You see, i doubt they would give a @#%$ for your better computer.<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;oh and by the way, aids medicines are so expensive becuase they are hard to make and update, the damn disease is always adapting and changing so they neeed to keep changing the med, its not like medicine for the common cold, that can be used for many years without change, it has to be constantly updated,and upgraded&quot;<br>
<br>
Was it a reason to sue countries who decided to simply steal medics recipes, because they wouldnt be allowed to produce their own at low cost?<br>
In the meantime, whole countries are dying from AIDS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thats what happens when the most powerfull nation in the world is leaded by the heirs of some greedy british merchants who believed that God was walking at their sides.<br>
<br>
USA are not a nation. its the biggest lobby in the world, supported by its very well informed and courageous citizens =)<br>
<br>
Well, i dont totally believe what i just said about US citizens, i went to see &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; yesterday night, and man does it give a fresh feeling, it seems people are starting to wake up =)<br>

This is a popular view, but political science research in the area of PAC contributions shows that 1) money does not influence vote choice, 2) money does not buy access to legislators.  Most of the research shows that whatever effects money does have on the legislative process is fairly indirect and not substantively large.  Of course the literature does not agree 100%.  And for the cynics among us I will point out that these are not studies funded by the interest groups, but academic studies presented in the leading journals in political science.  If anyone actually cares about this topic (yes I recognize that most people don't care) and wants the citations for these studies just let me know and I will add them in a later post.  <br>

<br>
<br>
Im a bit sceptic though, for exemple, wouldnt be M. Bush and his team a good case to study, for we know they are strongly linked with Oil production and military industry?<br>
<br>
<br>
I dont say they are corrupted in a sens they would have touched some dirt money; but dont they seem to be more the men of special interests than the men of all the Americans?<br>
<br>
<br>
In light of events in middle east (preparation for war on Irak, a country not related to Bin Laden, but a huge oil producer....), this subject matters alot for people, if we want to watch more closely the persons we will send to lead our countries in the future.<br>
