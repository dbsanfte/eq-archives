<br>
Personally, if I'm soloing low blues and want to keep my pet without reclaiming, I use 53 air pet.  He tanks much better than the others.  If I'm going to be reclaiming and chaining, I use either 51 earth or 50 MS2.  If I'm going to do a straight up fight against something big, I use either my biggest earth or biggest air pet.<br>
<br>
If I'm in a group or agro kiting, I use water.<br>
<br>
You have different pets for different reasons.  Saying that one particular pet is not good for soloing says more about your solo tactics than the pet.<br>
<br>
Except if you're dissing the fire pet.  That one sucks. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tangting01>TangTing01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(11/11/02 1:53:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  54 Water Pet</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the perspective Eloina.  I picked this thread to post my comments on for a purpose - because the  title is 54 water pet is useless *solo*.  I saw this thing in action solo and based on how the mage was using it, it was nothing special.  Whereas someone else ragged me out about how great it is when he's grouped (something that I acknowledged on another thread where I said the V/GV fire and water pets are more group oriented), you provided a legitimate example of how to use it solo (although I don't think I'm going to start aggro kiting). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tangting01>TangTing01</A> at: 11/11/02 2:00:12 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=marloon>Marloon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#333333>(11/11/02 3:32:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  -</span><hr size=1>  You are right. the water pet does need to be behind a mob to backstab.  When soloing the only times when teh pet is behind the mob is when it is running and if your smart about pulling.  When pulling there is a slim chance that yur pet will backstab the monster in that short time before the argo switches from you to your pet.  It is still nice to see your pet hit the monster for 162 right off the bat, plus whatever melee damage he does.<br>
<br>
 Now, about soloing. After trying all the pets over and over again , yes even that pathetic fire pet, I have come to the conclusion that even if your water pet isn't behind the monster backstabbing it's still the best solo pet for most situtations  The air pet is good cause of it's high dex and better ac, but it's average damage is less then the water pet.  Testing both pets against the same type of monsters you will find that after each battle the air pet has less hitpoints and that the battle it's has lasted longer then with the water pet.  Why you ask? Well the water pets average damage is higher, plus he casts a decent nuke a lot.  Plus that regen they get is awesome.<br>
<br>
 Ok, so if you are wondering which monsters I have tested teh pets against, here is a list, and all of which I have found the water pet to be better against overall.<br>
Seafuries<br>
Elementals in the Hole<br>
Everything in The Grey<br>
Reverants in SD<br>
Dryads<br>
Rockhoppers<br>
Fish in Kedge<br>
Giants in Kael<br>
Giants in GD<br>
<br>
I am sure there is more but I can't think of them right now.  Now against the Elementals in the hole and Dryads.  I did find that the water pet does the best job against these creatures but went with a diffrent pet in the end due to other  reasons.  I had to use the Earth pet for his root against the elementals cause they tend to run and I have to waste mana for a nuke at the end to stop them.  I used the air pet against the Dryads because I hope his stun with stop some of the more annoying things about them like the dots and the roots. <br>
<br>
 Are all the pets useful(maybe even the fire if we can ever figure it out someday)?  Yes.  Is the water pet useless at soloing? NO.  Should you just sit here and take my word or the word of these other people? Hell no. Get the pet yourself and try it out.<br>
<br>
And tang, yes you are correct about the fact that it would have to be the 54 water pet that you witnessed.  Now, think about the other things I said.  Just because you are correct that it's the 54 water pet doesn't mean you know what the hell was going on when you watched it. Maybe the pet was slowed, or not BOed, or fighting against a mob that really out leveled it, or just had one of those bad melee rounds that all pets have from time to time.  Did you sit there and watch the pet for more then 15 or 20 min?  Did you ask yourself why he is usuing the water pet if it's so patheticly bad?  My same statement still applies. Wait til you get it and til you use it before you cast judgement and try to tell other people about it.  And please try and not be bias.  If after you get hte pet and use it for a good amount of time, you still feel the same way, well more power to you.<br>

The differences appear to be how often the stun lands on the mob and whether or not air has less hit points than water (I believe it does).  Water does take them down faster when the pet starts to run, of course.<br>
<br>
Mobs tested on run a wide variety, from seafuries to katta guards.  Basically everything soloable from 53-57 (where I am now).  I use DS, BO3, and muzzle if I'm going to be keeping the pet.<br>
<br>
In the end, I tend to use 53 air because the stun really works well when I pull with malosini.  Seems like half the time, the mob is just standing around. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tangting01>TangTing01</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(11/12/02 2:12:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=26>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: -</span><hr size=1> Marloon,<br>
I watched it for about 2 minutes and the mobs were poachers (not even the named ones) - definitely not high level - can be taken pretty easily with lvl 49 pets.  Maybe he didn't have it BO'ed - would seem weird, but maybe the poachers are so easy he just figured why bother?  You make a good point, though - I really won't know about it until I use it.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=liffthemage>Liff the Mage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#333333>(11/15/02 12:57:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  TangTing is right</span><hr size=1> I have done the dryads in JPF for level 54 to almost 57.  The water pet sucks against them compared to earth or air.  I have spent Three Whole Levels here.  The best pet to use vs the dryads is Air (with the focus ring, 2 weapons, and the muzzel).  I think the focus ring really does add to the effectiveness of the air pet at least, but that is a different thread. <br>
<br>
So from 3 entire levels battleing the dryads (I have lots of patience), I can say for sure, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the order of pet rankings, vs this mob ONLY, is air&gt;earth&gt;water.  I have never used the fire.<br>
<br>
So get your shorts in a bunch if you want, but the original posting question has been answered  (past tense).  Water pet isn't normally the best solo pet, but it is normally the best group pet.<br>
<br>
Please make sure you read 'normally' in that last sentance twice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 144<br> <font color=#333333>(11/15/02 8:06:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=743.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: TangTing is right</span><hr size=1> Absolutely agree, Liff.

 For those of you with more then half a brain, just try each pet and use what you like.  I personally have found the water pet NORMALLY useful as a great soloing pet.  Again, as I said, I do use air against dryads for their spells.  I just find that I have to equip the air for him to even last, unlike water, but those spells suck and air does a better job a stopping them.<br>
<br>
You think earth is still a good soloing pet? If your chaining then I agree with you. If you chaining against dryads, well you need help.  <br>

Marloon, for those with half a brain, Liff is spelt with 2 f's, not 'lift'.  So I know you wern't talking to me.  Also for those with the other half of a brain, my last post was not a 'flame', just my opinion, and we all know what opinions are like.<br>
<br>
But this is actually a flame, so Marloon, PLEASE stop playing long enough to go to Hawaii to get 'laid' (the flower necklace thing is a 'lay') because you obviously haven't been 'laid' in a long time.<br>
<br>
For every one else, I started this post because I had heard a lot of good things about the 54 water pet, but I never saw any big deal with it, mostly due to my play style.  I like to solo, and prefer to chain cast pets.  For that style, water pet does not excell over other pets, most people agree.  I started this post with a title that might make people a little interested to read what was in the thread, and I have gotten lots of posts, with lots of opinions, and for all the posts showing others play style, and thier opinions, I thank you all.  Even Marloon, thank you also for your posts.  I am sorry you have soft skin and the 'lack of flowers around your neck' problem though.  =(<br>
<br>
I think all agree that in groups, the water pet is normally the best choice.<br>
<br>
I think all agree that normally the fire pet (post level 50) is useless.<br>
<br>
But this thread is about soloing.  And I stand by the last sentance in my last post.  And I know not everyone agrees with me. <br>
<br>
I think that nothing more needs to be said in this thread, except for Marloon's upcoming post about how childish I am for making fun of his 'flower' problem and I would wager he is gonna say the reason I don't like the water pet is that I am stupid, and my tactics are stupid, and that he gets 'more than a toilet seat', and then he is gonna say that I am stupid again, and on and on and on.   Whatever.<br>
