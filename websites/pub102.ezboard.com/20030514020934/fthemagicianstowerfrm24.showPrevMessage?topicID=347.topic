The higher the mobs that you fight, relative to level 51, the more AA xp that you get.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for pure efficiency, then waiting until level 60 is probably the best route.  At level 60, you'll be able to solo mobs that are just a few levels under 51 without breaking a sweat.<br>
<br>
If you have PoP, then AA experience is fast in tier 1 and tier 2 planes level and difficulty of the mobs.  However, at least on my server you need to be high 50's to reasonably get a group in PoP planes, so make sure you factor that into the equation.<br>
<br>
AA can and will help you level, though.  I think that getting run3 early on is a darned smart thing to do.  I also have seen a number of mages with SCM3 and SCF3 at 57 or so, and they were noticeably more effective than I was (I had no AA until 57).  It just took them longer to earn those AA points at 55 then it takes me to earn them at 60.  Is it enough to matter?  I'm not sure... they killed mobs noticeably faster than I did, and that translates to faster leveling.<br>
<br>
A guildie necromancer sat in Everfrost, killing Ice Giants over and over again at 55 until he earned SCM3, SCF3, and Natural Durability 3.  During that time, I leveled to 59.  I'm 60th now, and he's roaring through levels... it's an open question in my mind whether or not he'll reach 60 before I reach 24 AA points.<br>
<br>
So, to answer your question... I think it makes sense to get run3 as soon as possible.  I think that when you start to gain AA is dependent on where you hunt, and how you hunt... if you're a classic soloing mage and intend to continue that, then 60th level may make sense for you.  If you want the help of AA as you level up, then gaining AA after 55 may be your path. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 848<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 8:34:56 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: When should AA exp come into the game?</span><hr size=1> Well, if you are a classic soloing magician, there is no particular rush to get to 60.

That was more or less the approach I used, and I enjoyed a better quality of soloing along the way than if I had gone straight levelling. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=outofmana>OutOfMana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/03 12:37:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   When to AA</span><hr size=1> Bear in mind it is not all about efficiency.  There is also enjoyment of the game.  I solo a lot because of timezone issues (GMT player in a US based guild) so I'm in your position cash/equipment wise.  I also have a patchy play scedule.  Currently I'm running at 60% AAexp.  With that setting I can get 2 yellow bulbs of AAexp from one extended KEI in Katta.  This means I can see meaningful progress from almost any session.  I am measuring my progress by AAExp bubbles &amp; dings and not really looking at the main exp bar - level ding will be a nice bonus when it arrives.<br>
<br>
I do not suggest this playstyle is for everyone, but it suits me. It gives me the encouragement of visible progress (remember how disheatening it was to slog through hell levels before they were abolished, quite convinced that the exp bar was broken 'cause it never moved).  It incidentally gives me the chance to accumulate cash as an incidental to normal progress without the need to compete for cash-farming spots like RM. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skildpade>skildpade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/03 3:52:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   When to AA?

<br>
In my opinion, other than Run3, there is no AA ability that will add more to your character than your next level.  So, turn all exp to AA until you get Run 3 and then set it back to Normal exp at LEAST to 60.  (61 air pet will make it start to stop there)<br>
<br>
Since the number of places you can go to get AA exp drop off significantly when you advance much past 60,  you MAY want to stay 60 or 61 until you get SCF, SCM, MC or whatever else is important to you.<br>
<br>
Folks say that aa exp in the tier 2 &amp; 3 planes of power is just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>insane</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, but if you're a solo type, you'll not be soloing much there until you get higher anyway. <p>Belhaven<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

   I choose a different place to put my next 3 pts. I bought the metabolism skill so food lasts longer. I know this sounds strange and a waste but is works well for me. I buy a stack of food in the bazaar with good stat bonuses and it lasts me up to a week depending on play time. I don't have very good gear so the added stats are a easy improvement.

It has been said many times that you earn AAXP eternally as if the character is level 51.  However, I “overheard” a conversation between two players in the PoK yesterday that brought a question to mind.  A level 51 was asking a level 65 when he should start hunting for AAXP.  The level 65 replied that he would wait until level 60 so that mobs that would bring sweet experience for his level 51 “alter ego” would be cake to his level 60 real self.  This is common advice.  My question is this:  Why then not wait until level 61-plus?  If you are still going to be earning AAXP as if you are level 51, won’t the mobs that will bring great experience for that level be all the easier to kill at a true level 61?  Or even more so at a true level 65?  Is this advice not given simply because people want to have earned AAXP prior to hitting 61 or are non-PoP mobs not even giving AAXP after hitting 61 even though they would still be nice relative to a perceived level 51?  Do the AAXP rules of “experience as if level 51” change for levels 61-plus?<br>

Unless you can reliably get PoP groups it may be a good idea to hold at 60 until you have enough AAExp for the more important abilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duveen>duveen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#333333>(2/21/03 6:32:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Darn, darn, darn</span><hr size=1> I must have been misunderstanding how AAXP is applied.  I thought that “getting exp as if one was level 51” meant that the character “viewed” mobs as if he or she was level 51.  Thus, a level 54 mob would “be” red even to a level 65 character because that is how it would be viewed to his or her level 51 AAXP alter-ego  (as far as AAXP was concerned only, of course).  What I’m reading here is that the perceived (not actual) /con color of the mob is based on the actual level of the player, not as if the character is 51.  Thus, it only makes sense to hunt when and where mobs are at least dark blue as actually /conned.  This definitely changes how I was planning to level past 56.  Thanks! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 448<br> <font color=#333333>(2/22/03 2:22:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Darn, darn, darn</span><hr size=1> I've come to the conclusion that there are definite &quot;sweet spots&quot; for earning AAxp... i.e. mobs at particular levels that are trivially easy to kill quickly, and that will earn faster AA over time than higher level mobs later on...<br>
<br>
Dryads at 55, for example.  At 55, with an air pet and using sirocco, you can kill one of these every 30-40 seconds.  I used to do 11 in 6-7 minutes with KEI and a horse.  Sure, it takes 3-4 per 1% AAxp, but who cares?  Over time, you'll gain AA faster here solo than you will in FG.<br>
<br>
Katta guards at 58 is another sweet spot.  Every single katta guard is dark blue at this level, and you can kill one every minute, earning 4% AA every 5 guards or so, and stopping to rest at that point to pet canni back up.<br>
<br>
I know that AA xp goes really, really fast in the Planes.  But if you're not in a guild capable of getting flagged for the tier 2 planes, or if you like to solo, there are definite spots where it makes sense to gain AA rather than levels. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=skildpade>skildpade</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 197<br> <font color=#333333>(2/24/03 9:39:11 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=15>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Darn, darn, darn</span><hr size=1> One of the most mind numbing camps for a magician is Fungus Grove at lv 60. However, the exp is redicilous. About 1% AAXP every second kill of the mushrooms, one pet + two nukes and malosini for each kill (you are NOT chaining :<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> oogle:<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  and you are single pulling them to your earth pet which are imune to the nukes. Only big dangers are aggroing one of the lotuses (they can be killed) or getting hit by the shreeker curse, which is a proc from the mushrooms.<br>
<br>
Knowing this there is good reason to push to lv 60 and get the AA's you want there. There are however good camps at lv 51, like Neriak (or JP a little later), which gives very good exp too.<br>
<br>
The only AA you really should go out of your way to get is run 3, because it WILL save your life again and again. Everything beside that is iceing on the cake. They are very nice to have and I did myself get a lot of them before lv 60.<br>

At the cost of some well spent AAs you get FT3?  Sounds pretty good to me.  <br>
I've played my Mage to 56th going 100% into normal xp, seeing as how I had a horse which could out run adds I didn't need Run3.  Now, I'm passing my guildies in level and power.  So, it seems like now would be a good time to get those 51 and 55 AAs.  My plan of action is Run3 , Regen3 , MC3 (bringing his FT to 5) , SCM3 , SCF3 ... then leveling proly.<br>
I have a couple questions, 1: Is there any major flaws you see with this, 2: Do light blue mobs give good AAxp although little to none normal xp or should I AAxp on dark blues only?, 3: Or should I just say &quot;Screw it all.  I got horse and KEI.  Show me to 60th!&quot; ?<br>
Note:  Play style is majority solo with an ocassional Tier 1 group tossed in.<br>

Light blues will halve the xp you get from them, even though the xp is counted against 51st level, rather than your current level.<br>
<br>
It's generally agreed among mages that MC1 is a good buy, that MC2 is &quot;ok&quot; for the cost of AA, and that MC3 is overpriced for what you get.  I haven't put any AA into it, so I can't comment personally.<br>
<br>
If I had to do 50-60 over again, I would stop at 55 and do AA on dryads before they all turn light blue.  I would also stop at 58 and stock up on AA on the Katta guards before they start to turn light blue.<br>
<br>
Both mobs/camps give an outstanding amount of experience compared to the difficulty of the mob, and how quickly you can burn them down.  FG is ok... you can generally kill 3-4 shrooms in 10 minutes, and then petcanni back up.  If I push it, I can usually do an AA in 4-5 hours in FG.<br>
<br>
But, I could do substantially more than that at the two camps and levels listed above. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showPrevMessage?topicID=341.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showNextMessage?topicID=341.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=341.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.threadControl?topicID=341.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=341.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=341.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24>Levels 56-60</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
