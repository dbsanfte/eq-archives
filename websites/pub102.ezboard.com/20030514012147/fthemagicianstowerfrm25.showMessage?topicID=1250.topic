<br>
I’m down to just needing the Magi Hate staff to finish the epic.  Based on recent unreal experiences in Hate lately I can safely say that finishing the epic is unlikely. This post is to vent and to see if other mages agree with my assessment or if I am just unusually ornery.<br>
<br>
Below is a step by step appraisal of each component of the epic; what I did to obtain the piece and my comments about that part of the quest. Some of the pieces were ultimately multiquested but I have spent hours camping every piece so I can speak with authority.<br>
<br>
Torch of Elements – The difficulty in obtaining this piece seemed reasonable. You can usually pick this piece up on a typical Reaver run in CoM. The dude that drops this piece pops from a Black Reaver so you should be able to find guild support for this since there are probably 30 druids in your guild who need the quest part.<br>
<br>
Blazing Wand – Here is one of Verant’s more annoying ideas.  Let’s put one of the epic pieces on a 8 hour spawn with placeholders. The only way to effectively farm this epic piece is to haul a small group to Kedge every 8 hours until he spawns. Of course there might be another mage or two doing the same thing so then it’s a matter of luck whether or not you happen to be the one to get there when he pops. When I was camping this piece there was another mage doing the same thing. We both had trackers there when Undertow popped so I was going to try and go solo him before the other lower level mage could get a group together. He suggested we band together and then lotto which I won. (Lucky for me since the corrupt seahorse was up and no way I was gonna solo him or his bigger brother) …..Why is this a 8 hour spawn? Why not have Undertow be a rare spawn with placeholders on the same respawn as the rest of the zone? At least then you could convince people to go and hang in the temple for experience while you camp him.  In my experience it’s nearly impossible to get people to Kedge because of a general fear of the zone, let alone get a group there every 8 hours.<br>
<br>
Burning Embers – This camp is better then Undertow but it’s still annoying.  Here’s my main question. Why is the mage epic piece that drops from this mob insanely rare when the bard epic piece that drops is common?  What is it about this mob in the scheme of the bard epic that it getting the quest item requires one kill where mages need to spend untold hours camping this risky spot? Believe me, I’m not lobbying that the bard epic be harder. But in my opinion camping this spot is much easier for a Bard then a Mage.  First off no mage is going to be able to keep the camp solo so he is going to need a group with a tracker.  I would argue that it is much easier for a Bard with tracking to start and maintain a group in Burning Woods then it is for a mage to find a tracker willing to stay for the long haul. I camped this spot for a long time until I finally found a MQ for 5K.<br>
<br>
Word’s of Magikot – These parts seemed relatively reasonable. I bought some invis to undead potions and wandered down to the always camped Frenzied room and waited.  Soloed some Dark Terrors in Unrest and wandered out from the Hobbit zone in Kith solo until I found a Dread wolf for the other parts.  Only endured a couple Harm Touches from nearby mobs.<br>
<br>
Power of Water – This is a fairly challenging quest piece if a little boring for a 55+ mage.  Under 55 you might be able to pick one of these up on a exp run there if you can somehow find a group willing to go. I soloed sperm by the zone for a long time until I finally got bored and cleared out the Library area. The Power of Earth dropped off a sperm in a little building in a cave down by the Library.<br>
<br>
Power of Fire – What is it about hours and hours of mindless camping that Verant thinks is fun? This piece is really a solo piece. I understand it drops off Guardians in SOL B but who really camps those? Mostly it drops off the Lava Elemental in SOL A. It almost never drops off the Blazing Elementals. So here is your choice, blow your faction with gnomes and only camp the Lava elemental and hope you are just lucky, or camp the Blazing Elementals and hope you win the lottery. In either case you’re in for a long boring series of camps. Some optimists would say ‘Well, you can clear the north part of SOL A between spawns and make money.’ I did this. The rare stuff that drops in SOL A doesn’t really sell anymore so the best you can do is sell Ore and FS weapons. Also on more then one occasion I lost the Elemental camps because some mage arrived while I was wandering the zone. I finally got it off the Lava Elemental. I won’t be buying a Tinkerer’s Bag anytime soon though.<br>
<br>
Power of Earth – Easy. Killed Fairie Guards at the Fairy camp until it dropped.  I lost a bunch of Fairy faction but who cares?<br>
<br>
Power of Air – This is fairly risky solo. You can sometimes find groups camping the Mistmoore gates but you really need a 50+ puller who may or may not get exp.  I invised up to the path, cleared all the mobs to the music room and pulled Gypsies until it dropped.  I think I had to gate once or twice.<br>
<br>
Words of Mastery, Shovel of Ponz, Broom of Trilon – Endless, boring, mage killing in Najena.  I bet every mage reading this knows all about the cycle here…Trazdon’s room, mage by the gate, mages just past the gate, goblin mages, crystal room with two mages just past the goblin area, Rathyl’s room, Najena’s room.  While you’re here pick up the very rare broom and shovel. I actually gave away a shovel while doing the Words thinking I had it already only to have to come back here and camp it FOREVER after realizing I didn’t. BTW, trust me…the shovel that drops in Chardok, while named the exact same as the shovel that drops in Najena, does NOT work. Goodbye Ruby, Hill Giant Toe and Gargoyle Eye. <br>
<br>
Dirt of Underfoot – This guy is barely soloable at higher levels with chained earth pets. The recent changes to mage pets helped. Another really, really, rare drop off a 20 min spawn. Some mages kill this guy while camping the Nez/Phur spawn point nearby. I would think that would be hard since clearing the 90 second placeholders there is mandatory if you don’t want to wander the zone hoping to find the right placeholder. Me, I just sat there killing him and waiting 20 minutes for a respawn until he dropped it. If your KOS to wasps then this camp is harder.<br>
<br>
Staff of Elemental Mastery: Water – Can you say annoying?  I was actually very lucky. I think I only had to kill this dude nine times to get the staff. How many of you mages out there are looking at double digit kills?  Since this guy is fairly easy to kill you can expect to have lots of competition trying to get your guild there before four or five other guilds swoop down and kill him. You might be able to buy this MQ since your local uberguild probably kills him on principle if they see him up. Since the epic is supposed to be ‘hard’ (to Verant hard = annoying, stressful and unfun) I suppose this is a reasonable part of the quest.<br>
<br>
Rain of Karana – This fellow is soloable at higher levels by chaining earth pets. At lower levels bring a group with a cleric. If he isn’t up kill ‘a rogue lion’ and he will pop. I soloed him and found it to be relatively easy.<br>
<br>
Tears of Erollsi – I found this to be only really interesting parts of the epic. What I like about it is 1.) epic part always drops, 2.) five minute spawn, 3.) challenging to pull, 4.) you can get a group there by luring them with the thought of level 55+ spells off the Golems. 5.) never camped.  Why can’t the rest of the epic be like this?  After failing with the Mage epic I think Verant realized this is the way to go because if you look at the Beastlord epic it is almost completely this way; challenging mobs that aren’t ‘camped’.<br>
<br>
Elemental Binder – Easy. Lore and drops off the zone mobs in the Hole. Either get a group there, wait to loot one from a group that is camping the zone, or solo the zone until one drops.<br>
<br>
Pegasus Feather Cloak – Where do I start.  This has to be the most brainless quest item imaginable in a epic quest. It is the exact opposite of the interesting Tears of Erollsi quest item mentioned above 1.) rare drop, 2.) insanely rare spawn 3.) boring, unchallenging camp 4.) Good luck convincing your guild to mindlessly kill bull elephants and splitpaws for hours and hours, 5.) the horse is insta-killed by level 30 characters who can’t MQ the cloak for you until they hit level 46. Why is this epic item not lore? Why is this epic item no-drop? ….How about the cloak be mage-only, lore and not nodrop? This make sense to anybody else?  I could understand if this item was in the druid epic, they are perfectly suited to camping this part.  It makes zero sense to be in the mage epic.  Even if Verant is trying to promote grouping, every mage I know who camps this boxes a druid on a second account and basically solos it.  I bought the MQ for this part for 5K after considering paying 40K, 16K, or 9K and a powerlevel from 39 to 46 from various druids. Of course MQing this part is almost insane given the likelihood of getting screwed. I enjoyed a heavy amount of stress worrying the fellow MQing this would mess up the cloak turn-in accidently or purposely and I would lose my 50K Crown of Elemental Mastery and Elemental Binder. I recommend paying zero platinum until AFTER the MQ. One idea I heard was camping the Black Reavers in CoM and trade a Jade Reaver for a Cloak MQ.  Still, good luck getting a guild group together to camp Reavers and not have the 30 druids in your guild who need one not want to tag along.<br>
<br>
Crown of Elemental Mastery – This part is almost impossible for the average mage. This item harkens back to Verant’s love of powergamers. Getting to the seventh island of Air is very, very hard for your typical pickup Air raid.  It usually takes two days and the average raid is going to stop on island five and just farm Wingblades for the Warrior epic. Your server’s uberguild however is going to have a necro, cleric parked on island seven for guild mages.  Also, the crown is a rare drop! WTF?  Given the difficulty of getting to island seven you should be able to buy a Crown from a vendor for one copper right when you zone in. I joined a island seven raid after I bought my crown and saw only one drop after spending a whole night clearing Sphinxes and Drakes between CRs. Plan on buying the Crown. <br>
<br>
And finally…<br>
<br>
Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth – In my opinion this is BY FAR the hardest part of the quest.  This is my last piece and I really feel like I might as well be at the beginning. Why?  The Magi spawn points are on a 72 hour spawn +/- 12 hours.  On Bristlebane there are usually one or two hate raids a day since the armor mobs respawn every 8 hours. The raids are either: raids with a default, uberguild insta-raids, or pickup raids. While there are multiple Magi spawn points the odds of getting into a pickup raid, breaking the zone, the Magi being up, the raid actually getting to him, him having the Staff, winning the lotto over the other mages there is astronomical. Typically what happens is after spending 2 hours getting to hate and breaking the zone your tracker will tell you he is NOT up and you get to spend another 4 – 6 hours in Hate for no reason. Since being at the last piece I have been on nine Hate raids.  The Magi was up twice and both times with the staff.  In those two cases there were 5 mages lottoing. I lost both lottos, once to a mage who gated up five minutes before the pull. Weighted rolls? Unlikely. Pickup raids need incentive to get folks up there. Not a lot of mages are gonna show if there is weighted rolls or defaults. Start my own Hate raid with me as default? That would work only if the Magi is up with the staff….how many times can you drag your guild and friends to Hate? Once a month? Twice a month? The odds are still against you. Stress-wise, pickup Hate raids are nasty.  Of the other seven raids I went on where the Magi wasn’t up most of then ended in wipeouts, or crashed and burned before the groups even got made because not enough people or not enough of the right classes. It’s almost impossible to maintain sanity attending two or three pickup Hate raids a week.  It certainly isn’t ‘fun’ Once again the only people with a clear shot of getting the Magi are the uberguilds who can toss a tracker to Hate once a day and then mount a instant Hate raid complete with a good monk puller, level 60 MA, level 60 enchanter, Level 60 Cleric and support classes which all happen to be online.  Personally I made a mistake by not spending more time in Hate while I was working on other parts of the quest. Had I gone to Hate more often during my 50s I probably would have had a better chance of already having the Staff. On Bristlebane I’m targeting the uberguilds and mages with the staff who are far from quest completion by offering 30Kpp and a Velketor’s spellbook. I gotta cover all the bases no matter how unlikely.<br>
<br>
Also as an afterthought, one additional annoying part of the Mage epic is the NPC’s you hand items into.  Why are some of the NPCs for this part of the quest either super rare spawns, in insanely dangerous zones, or both?  It took forever to happen to be in Butcherblock when Walnan spawned. How often do level 58 mages find themselves in Butcherblock?  Finally I started camping Dapper until she decided to pop.  Jennus Lykobar wanders around the most unbelievably dangerous outdoor zone in Kunark…Skyfire.  The fellow MQing this part and myself  both died and had to endure a very nasty CR trying to hand this part in.  The stupid Dragon there will agro from almost anywhere in the zone if you are KOS.<br>
<br>
So in summary, I think the Mage Epic Quest really sucks. Almost nothing about it is ‘fun’ or ‘challenging’, mostly it is long periods of boredom and stress. It’s clear that Verant assumed making the whole quest MQable would offset the overall difficulty of the quest. Given the difficulty and rarity of the parts to obtain that idea is wrong or in cases where it might make sense it only benefits the powergamers. For me, I’m completely burned out on the quest and almost totally burned out on EQ. If by some chance I get the staff I can already tell I will not experience any feelings of achievement, only relief that it is over. <br>
<br>
I would argue that Verant is shooting themselves in the foot maintaining the difficulty of this quest. With the high level Luclin zones and the forthcoming Planes of Power an Epic pet is going to be almost mandatory. The competition for these epic parts is just going to get worse. If you’re going to design quests that only powergamers or uberguilds can effectively complete then why invent so many zones that would benefit from mages with epic pets?  Make them all like Vex Thal, Sleeper’s Tomb or Veeshan’s Peak.<br>
<br>
There probably was other posts just like this on the mage board. If so I apologize for retreading old ground, I didn’t scroll back to look since I felt the need to vent. I would love to hear the opinions of other Mages about the quest. If you agree/disagree let me know. If you are interested in flaming me personally or telling me how much easier the quest was for you I’m not interested. =)<br>

<br>
I have Crown, cloak, earth staff and water staff to go.  Another guild mage has crown, cloak and earth staff.<br>
<br>
I've worked on this quest quite a long time, but I get burnt out rather fast and have to take a break.  Going to PoH 5-6 times a month just gets tiresome.<br>
<br>
Trying to get people together for Kedge hardly ever works because he normally isn't up when you have the people available, or if he is up you can't find the people to go.<br>
<br>
I've killed Quillmane twice, 2 leggings.  Seen him killed several other times by other people who of course claimed it had only leggings, but who knows for sure?  Maybe they wanted that nice clicky levitate cloak for themselves?<br>
<br>
Haven't even bothered with PoA.  I know my guild won't put in a 2-day, 20+ hour raid to get to 7th isle.  I don't want to either!  I hope to buy one someday, or if it is my last piece I'll break down and lead a raid up there myself.<br>

PoA is a @%* but once you are thre you may get a croen without as much difficulty, since many raids ive seen aer there a day or two.  And yes, the purchase of this tradable item is not so hard to find as it is to afford.  Then, there is PoH.  I HATE this zone.  In 40+ raids I have gotten 2 pieces of apothic, and seen staff twice (once lost to that @_%* mage who ported up, we need to kill them).  That is total BS.  While not everyone can go do PoA every mage on BB can get to hate np, so frequently I see 51 or 49 mages up there going saying &quot;I need earth staff, Im starting my epic.&quot;  Im like wth I need earth staff and Im near the end; why get it as your first part.  Since Ive only seen it twice never mattered much . . .<br>
<br>

Unfortunately, I still have Phinny, Undertow, 7th Isle and Hate to go.  I figure at best it will be another year before I will conceivably come close to getting my epic.<br>
<br>
In the past month I have zoned into KK with my druid on numerous occassions and there is never anyone there.  Phinny was up EVERYTIME so I would assume that nobody had been there to kill him.  Trying to get anyone to that zone on my server is like pulling teeth with a rusty fork.  And this isn't even the hardest part.<br>
<br>
I feel your pain, just not as deeply yet. <p><img src=http://a5.cpimg.com/image/AD/05/10888365-0078-00E1011E-.jpg"border=0"<br>

I haven't gone to hate much myself, but that aspect of the quest just seems to suck severely. Even if he is up (Magi), he'll not be shortly as someone else camping the staff ports a ranger up there to find out if he's even alive.<br>
<br>
As for Quillmane.. that minx is a major pain in the rear. It may be worth it in the end, but frankly, the quest is total BS if these are the extreme lengths we have to go through just to complete it. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886">Rhasin Firestorm</A><BR>

I have never reached such lows, highs, feelings of remorse, relief, regret and exhilaration as I have with our epic.  I am down to the crown from PoA which did not seem so unreasonable compared to the earth staff until two months have passed and still not a glimmer of hope on getting said crown.  I have received more help than should ever be asked of others to get to where I am.  I have had my share of great fortune and luck i.e. hate staff and aggravation beyond belief with camping Najena for two weeks for three pieces of paper and thirteen Phin raids to get the water staff.  Najena and Phin I have gotten to know so well they have offered me jobs working in their respective lairs since only the diehard visit there regularly.  We all have horror stories to tell about Quillamane and the many other insanely rare mobs and the rare drops off them we need.  <br>
<br>
I will like Elwynd be as much relieved as excited to complete my epic.  I have helped many others with epics and the frustration with watching the relative ease with which some can be completed is disheartening but in the end only makes ours that much more precious.  The only positive in comparison to other epics is we don't have to camp Ragefire.  I have given up the hope of actually raiding the PoA for the crown I need and will just have to earn the cash and belittle the effort so far put into the epic and purchase it if I can even find a seller.   I don't see VI making any major changes on our epic as we are slowly being phased out as a class with the revamp to wizzies and beastlords being a popular alternative if someone wants a pet class.  We are the few, the proud, the Mages!  I think we kick ass, don't give up on your epic the reward will be worth the effort. <p>Availin <BR>

But, Phinny raids are very challenging now since agggro rules changed.  Hate, by far my favorite zone in the whole game, i simply love it.  Ubdertow, got him first kill so can't say anything.  Burning embers is VERY annoying and you have to ask a full group to stay there for hours on end, which most are unwilling to do.  All i need is my air crown and i'm not worried about getting it, just lvl and help other people when you can, get a better reputation rather then a better item.<br>

I did most of the rest with 1 or 2 other friends at level 55.  Below are the steps I need help on.<br>
<br>
Phinny requires at most 2 groups (55 - 60) but thats not a HUGE deal since others need him to.<br>
<br>
Rottgrime require groups but this is an in and out raid.  Not too bad.<br>
<br>
The Torch from CoM, I got it MQ'd but it's not hard to get people to do reavers.<br>
<br>
Feather Cloak, i have a friend that is going to MQ it.  This is a major pain too.  I camped that zone for well over 24 hours alone killing every thing.  The few times the hourse spawned a druid would kill it and annouce it.. pissed me off.  If you can get a ranger or 2 to help you though it might not be that bad... Maybe a few hours if you are lucky.<br>
<br>
Crown of Mastery, who ever came up with this idea is a shmuck.  At the very least crowns should be a common drop on island 7, maybe a rare drop on the first island.  That way a  mage not in a uber guild has a shot at least.  They could leave it as it is though and put ragefire on the final island.. peeps would be in Air every day.<br>
<br>
The Staff of Elemental Mastery:Earth shoud also drop in Hole.  It is an under used zone (just like Air).  It makes more sense there anyway... just stick down at the bottom with that wretched guy. <p><TABLE><TR><TD>

<br>
This is by FAR the most difficult and frustrating piece.<br>
<br>
The problems is people don't go up there for no reason.  <br>
<br>
IF they go up there, Magi isn't up.  <br>
<br>
IF Magi is up, he's in a difficult spot to reach with the number of people you have.<br>
<br>
IF you have enough people and can get to him and kill him, he doesn't have the staff.<br>
<br>
IF he does have the staff, you dont' win the roll.  <br>

I still feel for you, and all mages.  Our quest is niether easy or highly desired by guilds.   We need drops from mobs with days for spawn timers and even they they won't even the drop.<br>
<br>
However for me the last couple of weeks have been very rewarding and I got my epic last night.  The epic quest forced me to stretch, and work with a lot of people I wouldn't have ever worked with before.  It also required sacrifice and determination.  But I couldn't be more satisfied now.  I am not saying it is easy or that you are alone in your frustration.  But I am saying don't give up, keep at it.  One piece away is SO CLOSE.  YOu will have it.<br>
<br>
All else fails, level up a tracker or a rogue to 46 and get them parked up there and check a lot.  You would be surprised how easy it is to get people to go to hate just to hit Magi'Pasta when you know he is holding your final piece and is up.<br>

<br>
Since the Staff was last peice (6/20/02) I attempted to go to Hate 14 times. An attempt means at least 90 minutes of sitting in Nek waiting on groups.<br>
<br>
6/21 - Lost staff roll after taking all night to pull Magi to a mage who gated up 5 min before pull.<br>
<br>
6/23 - Magi not up<br>
<br>
6/26 - Raid never made it up, not enough key classes<br>
<br>
6/28 - No Magi <br>
<br>
6/29 - Lost roll on staff<br>
<br>
7/4 - Raid never made it up<br>
<br>
7/5 - Zone was jumped<br>
<br>
7/6 - No Magi<br>
<br>
7/8 - Raid crashed and burned after two wipes<br>
<br>
7/12 - No Magi<br>
<br>
7/14 - Staff Defaulted to me, cleared all minis but no Magi<br>
<br>
7/20 - Raid Jumped<br>
<br>
7/22 - No Magi<br>
<br>
7/26 - Staff Defaulted to me, cleared all minis but no Magi<br>
<br>
7/30 - After advertising extensively on my servers Marketplace Bulletin Board (I even put a post on the Stormhammer Bulletin Board considering the possibility of moving my character over there to do a MQ and then coming back) I found somebody to MQ the staff for 30K and a Velk's Spellbook.<br>
<br>
In the 14 times mentioned above the Magi was up twice. Two of the raids above were raids where the staff was defaulted to me and all the Mini spawn points had popped but no Magi. Lately I was leveling a ranger to 46 with the plan to stick him in Hate to track the zone before going up there again. He is level 45 now.<br>
<br>
I tested the pet briefly. The pet basically soloed Korasyl near Chardok. I can already tell the pet is gonna be awesome. Was it worth it? I don't know. Like I said above I don't feel elated, or any sense of accomplishment, just relieved it's over and annoyed at all the anxiety and time I wasted needlessly on a poorly designed quest.<br>

Yes, that's 212 trips...<br>
<br>

Bottom line on this quest, even though I am Epic'd, it's a royal PAIN IN THE TAILBONE!!!!<br>

For the Class Defining weapon to be so hard for Magician's and so easy for Monks, Druids and Rogues is a joke.  Granted the level of power is decided on the Magician side, it's still not within the bounds of anyone considered a casual gamer.<br>

My heart goes out to ALL Magicians wanting to complete their Epics, because I've been there, felt the frustrations and the agony of watching Magi P`Tassa holding a staff and seeing it go to someone that's a RL friend of the raid leader and just got ported in.  (While being asked to CoTH the said magician to the raid!)  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You raided Hate and had to CoH a mage in just to loot the staff?  I understand that loot rules are typically established at the beginning of a raid but for a non-attending mage to get a staff over an attending mage is just crazy.  Of course if the the non-attending mage had an alt at the raid since that is the class which was needed for the raid then I could see it. <p><img src=http://a5.cpimg.com/image/AD/05/10888365-0078-00E1011E-.jpg"border=0"<br>
