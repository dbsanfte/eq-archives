MAYBE Mages are at their best, but only post 60. It's not like PoP went back and revamped the old spells.<br>

SO!<br>

If you say Mages are at their best, perhaps. You are a higher-level Mage and I gotta' respect that. But it doesn't change the fact that it takes 60 levels to get there, and even then you could be wrong - it's not like the other classes are homeostatic; They're improving too!<br>

In regards to the original poster.  I would urge you to get lvl 44 before you make any serious decisions.  Check out the where to hunt boards.  With the advice on those boards you can get 44 in just a couple of weeks work no problem.  This will help you make a more educated decision.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=gallerus>Gallerus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 175<br> <font color=#333333>(11/22/02 6:36:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gallerus</span><hr size=1> &quot;As for enchanters soloing better than mages, maybe after they get DC. Before that your statement is a joke. &quot;<br>
<br>
lol - you can charm solo VERY efficiently before DC, trust me - its WAY better than mages - I have a 55 chanter that is a solo machine - tash/stun/mez/charm/damage mitigation spells/etc make chanters supa powerful.  Now that chanter pets stop attacking when mobs are mezed, chanters are even more powerful soloers than ever i'd imagine &amp; I havent even really played mine a lot since that change.  After DC they blow mages away so bad its ridiculous (not to mention the fact that chanters never have trouble getting groups - they really are a fun class to play cause you can group basically whenever you want + you can solo well too).<br>
<br>
Druids are more efficient for the same reason wizards are - quad kiting &gt; any form of mage soloing.  The aa point totals that wizards have speaks volumes about their soloability.  Man, my guild has 2 wizards who are both over like 300 aa points, both have lvl 60+ alts &amp; actual jobs &amp; stuff too <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   BTW, druids also have a form of DC, little more limited than chanters, but an incredible solo tool, better than any mages have available.<br>
<br>
Necros can fear kite + have far superiour mana regen + better selection of spells solo way better than mages.<br>
<br>
Bards also kill way faster than mages - they are one of the most powerful classes in the game by FAR.  swarm kiting &gt; any soloing a mage can do - they have no downtime, mages do cause if you are really soloing you have to wait for pet hps + mana which are limiting factors.<br>
<br>
Shaman like you said are really powerful - once they hit 60 &amp; get torpor they take a huge leap in power as well.<br>
<br>
imo, thats 6 classes that solo better than mages.  btw, in terms of credentials trying out classes, since you threw yours out here are mine - 62 mage/61 cleric/60 warrior/55 chanter/55 druid/52 shaman/51 monk <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cubicool>Cubicool</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#333333>(11/22/02 6:41:00 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Gallerus</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

do you know that mage are still good as in damage-wise at lvl 50 meaning out dmg even rogs ( because rogs have no double backstab and weapons have limits now)<br>
<br>
but <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>NEVER</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> waited more than 5 minutes? <br>

The dark spells that do large damage, they get lure based (FR -100) blood-line DOT spells, almost unresistable (MR -200) leech-line DOT spells, almost unresistable taps, lure-like splurt, poison DOTs, disease DOTs...  then they get fear, feign death, harmshield, root, mez (ST), gate, self evac (levant)...  Mana regen withg lich-line off spells.  With fear they can solo MOBs that summon.  It's hard to compare necro's ability to solo with other classes, that's what they were made for, they offer little in term of group buffs.<br>
<br>
Their damage may not be as quick as a mage, but their DOTs are efficient for doing big damage over time and they regen the mana quickly while using leech-line and taps to recharge health.  It's not an easy class to play, but a powerful one.  Admittedly I can do way more damage with a mage and epic, but I don't remember any time when I could solo anything yellow or red, which is trivial with a necro, can kill things up to 5 levels higher as long as they don't summon.<br>
<br>
This topic can't answer who is the best soloer.  There is no right answer it depends on situation.  The issue is whether the fight is outdoors or indoors (druids and necros are not very good indoors).  While a shaman may be good at taking down tough MOBs, a shaman can't clear a dungeon full of mid-level greens as a mage can (this is still soloing, just not for xp, maybe for items).  Druids and wizards can quad kite but if something is not snareable or resist snare they have a hard time; they also can't kite indoors (there are few spots where they can, but that's not the norm).<br>
<br>
The debate of who is the best soloer has to involve a defining of the situation, otherwise it becomes a class envy contest.<br>

If there were more spots to swarm, I would say bards solo better than mages.<br>
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately that isn't true.  Bard soloing is almost non-existant indoors, as is the druid and wizard variety.  Forget fear kiting as well.  <br>
<br>
The only problem a mage has soloing in a dungeon is keeping the size of the pulls reasonable.<br>
<br>
Just about every class has some really cool tools.  For the mage, it's about making stuff dead.  When you can pull a mob in, sick a pet on it, med for a minute and a half, then stand up and blow the beast to shreds, I don't see how you can say mages suck, either at soloing or grouping.<br>
<br>
Now, had you said they suck soloing post-60, I would have to agree.  But then, any class without good movement control spells sucks trying to solo post-60 as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=etadanikm>EtadanikM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#333333>(11/23/02 12:51:19 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Agree with everything Glasya said</span><hr size=1> PoP in general is not a very solo friendly place.  The all-revered necro fear-kiting tactics don't work there, nor are there any undead necros can charm in most zones for charm-soloing (enchanters, however, have a ball in PoP).  Yes, necros/druids/wizards/shamans can solo PoP, but I can tell you presently that soloing nets you less exp than a good group (unless you're a truly uber player grouping with newbies), even if you're soloing red-at-60 mobs because of resist issues and whatnot.  <br>
<br>
This is why many necros have been pushing for better grouping abilities, because necro soloing, while viable in PoP, isn't really an alternative to groups because progression in PoP is based on groups, not on soloing.<br>

Nothing adds agro like CoC (which unfortunately won't stack with splurt).<br>
<br>
As a mage I have to rely on a pocket cleric in PoP, most MOBs that hit around 200 need 1 CH to kill, up to 300 may take 2 CHs, things hitting harder than 300 is a lot for an epic to handle. Must debuff everything to make sure the pet can land the stun proc which reduces the MOB dps significantly.<br>
<br>
With PoP the mage's ability to solo has deteriorated, whereas other classes that have any kind of snare ability has remained the same.  The problem with mage pets is that their mitigation skills are poor (all except epic which is so far the best tank for planes).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, the epic can solo all of LGuk, even taking few frogs at a time with a 52 heal every so often.  Necro pet has a very hard time tanking by comparisson.<br>
<br>
One of the most devastating combo's in PoP so far is grouping of a necro and a mage, there is almost no downtime and things die very fast.<br>

<br>
Mages act like DPS is ALL that matters. And then they go on to say &quot;Blah, we're second in DPS, blah, in some conditions we, blah, if I can posistion my pet...&quot; - BIG DEAL. We're second by what - 5DPS? Some other marginal number? How close is the 3rd, and how many MORE abilities do they have besides DPS? What preconditions does that damage rely on?<br>
<br>
Besides, arguments like this can't be proven. I'm betting you're using 60+ spells to come up with that &quot;#2 in DPS&quot; statement.<br>
<br>
The old DPS argument, as if that's the only thing that matters! OKAY, perhaps in the Mages case - but if so, why are we second? If DPS IS all that matters, shouldn't we rule that area? If not, shouldn't we have SOME utility function that works (CoH, bleh!) AND is sought after? Give me any class and I'll give you 2 things they do good, probably more, in addition to doing an acceptable DPS. Give me the mage and I can give you ONE thing they TRY and do good. And oh! It takes 60 levels to get to &quot;second place.&quot; Dare I fathom the trip there?<br>
<br>
Lots of classes have awesome DPS, in addition to being useful. (And here's where you say &quot;Go play that class then!&quot; - which, I currently am.)<br>
<br>
Bottom Line: Is this class WORTH playing for 60 levels to MAYBE get 2nd place in DPS, with absolutely no other function.<br>
<br>
Before you continue to call me a gimp or whatever (I don't think I've insulted anyone a single time? No matter...) keep in mind that I'm not entirely stubborn and will listen to reasonable rebuttles. Then again, who wants to take the time to do that! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

As a damage class, it seems to me that, at the very least, DPS is most of what matters.  Personally, I tend to invite mages to my groups more for their DPS than, say, their pick locks skill, heals or tanking ability.  I've not found mages to be terribly effective at porting or evacing, either.  Personally I think they are just lazy.<br>
<br>
To be honest, most of the game is about three things: DPS, aggro management/crowd control and healing.  Mages are badass at the DPS thing.  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>and how many MORE abilities do they have besides DPS?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
Depends... are we talking about rangers, monks or rogues?  That rogue sneak thing is really useful... all those times that you need rogue CR these days.  Monks have FD/mend... in case a pull goes wrong (though CoH is just as effective of a solution).  Rangers have snare... which is nice.  Doesn't really make a huge difference these days... but no big.  They have some decent buffs.<br>
<br>
Versus... CoH (which, used properly, can spare a group quite a few unnecessary deaths and downtime)?  T-Rods (which provide some helpful emergency mana/additional mana regen)?  To be honest, 9 times out of 10, I'll take take CoH over Sneak/Pick locks.  And as often as not, I'll take a mage over a ranger/monk... depends on the ranger/monk and on the mage.<br>
<br>
What's more, they place <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>little to no strain</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on the other members of the group (being almost completely self-sufficient), further maximizing their contribution.  (Neither mages nor pets typically require heals or combat-related buffs.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If DPS IS all that matters, shouldn't we rule that area?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
I'm hoping, by quoting this, you see how silly it sounds.<br>
<br>
DPS is the primary goal of several classes.  This does not mean that each of those classes should &quot;rule that area.&quot;  What it means is that, all other things being equal, different ones will &quot;rule&quot; in different situations.  <br>
<br>
In <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>high DPS <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>right now</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> situations, wizards will beat out mages, but mages will have DPS to contribute for the next fight.  In <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>sustained</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> DPS situations, mages, rogues, rangers and monks will be in similar situations... depending on mob ACs, resists, buffs and equipment.  <br>
<br>
The great things about mages is that a good mage is an excellent damage dealer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>in almost every situation</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  <br>
