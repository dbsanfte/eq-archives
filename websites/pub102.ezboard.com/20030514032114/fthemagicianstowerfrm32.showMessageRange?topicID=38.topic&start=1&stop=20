WHEN MAGICIANS REBEL, JANUARY 29, 2002 <br>
Source: Developers Corner.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the mages in this game have waited long enough. And now the quotes from the Fan Faire are even more disturbing. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Explain your passion for hating mages?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
I can't explain it because we don't hate mages. I can't even imagine how you could think such things. There is no reason nor point to any one here 'hating' any class. We don't. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    First off - why are so many zones non-Call of the Hero compatible?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Because the use of Call of the Hero in those zones allows characters to skip content that we do not wish to be skipped. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Gordon is quoted as saying he wished they never made the spell. Well that makes us mages hopeful for anything doesn't it? You made it. Now use it.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Well, based on the fact that Magicians don't like it when we disable the use of the spell in a few zones, and the fact that allowing the spell to work in those zones invalidates the whole risk/reward concept in the zone, I can certainly understand how the existence of this spell could be seen as troublesome. <br>
<br>
However, we are not prepared to allow this one spell to prevent us from implementing interesting content. As I've said before, we'd rather disable one spell in a few zones than never explore content that that spell would invalidate. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    It's not like we do much else. We have basically 2 nukes - fire/magic (some places those are useless), pet pathing is no good almost everywhere (no one wants you to use them thanks to that.)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
Indeed, some NPCs are practically immune to either fire or magic. Very rarely, however, are both of those magic types highly resisted. And pet pathing isn't perfect, but it certainly isn't as bad as you make it sound. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    That leaves us two things. Mod rods and CoH. <br>
<br>
Mod Rods - well that's nice. Use my mana (which I can't use on nukes/pets anyway) for someone else. Effective yet boring. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Use your nukes and your pets. As I said, there are very few places where you can't use them. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    CoH - better. I can get members into the battle who could not log in earlier due to good reasons. Effective, perfect etc.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
<br>
This was the desired use of this spell, to let members of your raid join late. Sadly, that isn't the only use for the spell. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Secondly - You increase the drop rate on Magi P`Tasa in hate. Wonderful!! But now let's look at something else said. We don't want many mage epics floating around. But other classes you do? If they are epic make them somewhat equal. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Are you asking us to reduce the power of your epic? <br>
<br>
The mage epic is hard, that's true. But it is hard because it's an excellent epic. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  You told us to try things out before asking you about them. Well we have. We are upset, you are making mages a pointless class to play. And we have been asking - just give us a reason.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Mages are not a pointless class at all. <br>
<br>
We'll certainly review them when we look at all the caster issues in the near future. And I'm absolutely willing to hear about your concerns. I would like to urge you all, however, to try to avoid exaggeration. Focus on specifics and solutions. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Fixes for the current mage problems, please consider. <br>
<br>
First let me start off by saying this, when you increased the Melee of all of classes, rogue, monk, sk/pal, warriors, Bards you forgot the one class that relies on a pet as their main form of damage. Please seriously consider changing them (mage pets) to another table of damage. Not making them hit for more damage, but hitting more than 50% of the time. <br>
<br>
Next let me give a few suggestions for alternate class skills. The first I would like to address is Mass Group Buff.  This skill was given to a class that has 1 line of buffs in the entire game. In place of mass group buff: How about pet casting mastery? This would be a great opposite in place of spell casting fury mastery that wizards receive. Pet will spawn with 3/11/20 more % of hp, ac, str, dex, instead of the normal pet template? Maybe at level 3 the pet will have a chance to Crit like normal melee? <br>
<br>
Another Skill that needs to be looked into is Frenzied burnout.. Suggestions: Increase the buff duration to 32 minutes. The current buff duration is 36 seconds and a recast of 72 minutes, chances to flurry and rampage, and with no explosion of damage at the end as is described in the advanced skills explanation. In its current form this skill is not completely worthless, but if you'll compare what its supposed to do with other class effects like enchanter dire charm, and the necro undead charm it falls way way short. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Let me start by responding to you last point first. <br>
<br>
Frenzied Burnout is bugged. The explosion isn't working properly. We're trying to fix that. <br>
<br>
Admittedly, Mass Group Buff isn't as useful to Mages as others. I'm not sure we can do something like you described as Pet Casting Mastery. I'm not sure that we can add power to pets like that. Even the focus pets don't really work that way. But I'll pass it on. <br>
<br>
We didn’t really forget pets when we did the melee balancing. Pets have to be evaluated in conjunction with the caster and his spells. Evaluating pets will go hand in hand with the caster balancing that we're undertaking. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    I've been playing Everquest before Kunark came out at a time when you had to raid to camp the Sol B Efreeti. Recently I have been wondering what happened to class balance. As a Mage I am horrified by Dire Charm. I worked hard to get my epic and it's effect is outdone by some guy who exp farmed for less time than I camped Quillmane for. <br>
<br>
I could have sworn that it was a mage's ability to have the best pets and now a class with better mana regen, stuns and messes also has a higher damage output than me. I have seen enchanters charm mobs that hit for 120+ with far more hp than mine, who can buff their pets just as well as I do and slow mobs to boot. <br>
<br>
I'm not calling for a nerf of dire charm, but I think mages deserve to have the best pets. If enchanters are going to be able to charm mobs, we should be able to make pets which can outdo their damage. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I would love to have some specific examples of NPCs that can be charmed using Dire Charm that are as powerful as you claim. I need specifics in order to be able to research what you claim. <br>

-frogs in seb (donno what the best one here dire charmable is, someone fill me in, somewhere 100+ damage, and the caster ones also cast spells correct?)<br>
-what about those wolves in WW? no clue the level but they would be acceptable if they are charmable...<br>
-shrooms in FG charmable?<br>
-how bout maidens eye, anything there?<br>
<br>
<br>
many many MANY more of em, lets make a list guys, and someone send it in... he acts like we MAY find 1 once in a while that is that strong, lol<br>

better yet, anyone know a chanter with dire charm?  just say &quot;hey I wanna see what your best dire charm pet would do to my epic in a dual...&quot; have em get something doing 120+ dmg, with over 7k or so hps, and dual em... take screenshots, including what the dire charm pet was at for hps at the end of the duel...<br>

This point is OH SO CRITICAL. Yes, we have problems. Yes, we could stand to get some improvements here. Has anyone TRIED some of these places? Name a place where a pet HAS BEEN TRIED and has done poorly. Remember, places like ToV have pathing, too, and the MOBS use it. If the MOBS can follow to an appropriate spot, then the PETS can too, certainly. The only major issue to contend with is AoE aggro, damage taken from AoE spells, and the aggro radius of a level 41-45 creature in the Temple. None of those mobs fear, but how many can be taken down easier IF we magicians listened on incomming, heard the kind of dragon approaching, once it's in range and pinned, break out pet of appropriate resist, and sic on target. Reclaim if pet twitches badly, or if the mob gates. Aggro management is a pisspoor claim by melee because the mobs DO NOT attack the pet unless they have so far exceeded the PC's damage as to be 150% higher.<br>
<br>

No wonder you got answers like that.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally I think there are 3 main things that would improve mage class a lot.<br>
<br>
1. better pets.  maybe a pet buff (non dispellable) that raises the level, hitpoints, AC, and resists.  similar to BL pet buffs.  right now pets don't do enough damage vs higher level mobs and don't live long enough especially in AE fights.<br>
<br>
2. better nukes.  your gonna have to give wizards this also to shut them up but they could probably use it too, if you compare melee with ToV/Sleeper loot vs a similar caster...<br>
<br>
3. damage shields.  these should scale better.  33pt shield is OK vs a mob that hits for 140 and has 8000 hps but vs mobs that hit for 500's and have 100,000 hp?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Easy solution would be to make 60-70pt dmg shields for lvl 59-60 mages.  Even better but more work codewise would be shields that scale with how hard the hit was.  ie 150pt hit = 35 dmg, 400pt hit = 100dmg, 850pt hit = 200dmg (all about 25% dmg shield / hit ratio).  This would be great of course for uber mobs but also has the added benefit of not upsetting the balance vs blue mobs or in PVP.<br>
