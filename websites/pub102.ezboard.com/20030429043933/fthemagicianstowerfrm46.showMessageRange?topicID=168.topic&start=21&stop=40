Seems really fast.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
If I ever got 1 yellow in an hour, I would rip my hair out and either immediatly disband from one of the worst groups ever or think twice about my soloing abilities. 1 yellow is not good when even your regular pick up PoV group can get a full aa an hour. And yes that's 'pick up' and 'group' put together which yields that experience. Think of PoV as the new Velks or Dreadlands, but with actually good exp. And in Velk's I mean the groups tend to pick up the highest leveled people they can in their groups. So a level 65 mage will be picked up 95% of the time over a level 60 mage barring any huge problems. <br>
<br>
As for the Efreeti camp, is there any reason why you couldn't do it at level 65? Sure there won't be any exp but the loot is still there, not to mention you will be killing stuff faster. You can do 1 hour in PoV in a group + 1 hour doing Efreeti at 65 and still be way ahead exp wise then 2 hours doing Efreeti at 60.<br>
<br>
If it's a loot issue, you can farm a hell of a lot better at 65 then at 61, even without any new spells.<br>
<br>
I never understood the whole 'not leveling' thing. If it was the case why not just stay at level 12 to make sure that Blackburrow doesn't green out? Good thing AA exp is only allowed past 51 or else you would have level 12's trying to get aa's or trying to hold on to outdated exp spots.<br>
<br>
It's your choice not to level and I accept that, but don't try to pass it as if it is more advantageous or better exp<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . I think the level 65 mages are probably thanking you about not leveling so that they have less competition for group spots in PoP<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
Doing efreeti at 65 when it is trivial would be boring.<br>
<br>
Some people look at their levelling as an adventure.  They experience each part of the game and get as much fun out of it as possible before moving on.<br>
<br>
It's like using the warp zones in Super Mario Brothers for the old NES.  You can beat the game by only doing levels 1-1, 1-2, 4-1, 8-1, 8-2, and 8-3 (I may have missed one).  That's 6-7 levels of the game when there are 24 total.  You see barely 1/3 of the content in the game if you use the warp zones.<br>
<br>
I mean, I'd hate sitting through 5 levels in The Overthere, never actually getting to experience what it was like to <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">be</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a mid-thirties magician.  It's the same reason I never even considered applying to the highest-end guilds on the server.  I'd have missed so much content.  &quot;Vindicator pwned!!!!&quot; the first time it happens is probably about equally exciting  as killing any mob in ToV for the first time... unless you've levelled to the point where Vindicator is a trivial fight.  Suppose you were to jump from a late kunark guild to a high velious guild.. You'd probably never even face Vindicator, and if you did, it'd be /yawn, /attack, /loot.<br>
<br>
IMO getting pasted by a mob a few times before you actually kill it makes the victory a whole lot sweeter, and for the most part it doesn't really matter at all what mob it is, so long as the reason you lose isn't because you're making tons of mistakes(that always sucks).  <br>
<br>
I'm in this game to have fun, and there's a lot more fun to be had than just getting stuff for your character.  You can just play Statbuilder if that's what you're looking for. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=absolutemaster>Absolute Master</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#333333>(12/27/02 3:14:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=168.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://stuwww.kub.nl/~s338419/everquest/gohan.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PoP Levels, a double edged sword.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>It's like using the warp zones in Super Mario Brothers for the old NES.

<br>
No one said to powerlevel to 65. It's just that the exp is so good in PoP that you won't even notice you are leveling like crazy. Even just casually playing will net you 65 within 2-3 weeks if you don't go for aa. You can slowly progress if you want. But that's not what people are doing here. They are stopping completly from leveling.<br>
<br>
Not leveling would be more like getting to level 8-2 and never going further because you don't want to lose the chance of having to do the hardest jump in the game taken away from you. Sure you can stay there if you want, but you aren't progressing.<br>

Ok, I see ppl using PoP stones. It use to be journey across continent when I was newbie. Riding boats across, cyclops evading ship. fun stuff. Time when I was really happy when I won that bag thingy from orc named in High pass.<br>
Now... I'm almost lvl 65, with nothing, but EXP in PoP. All I see is PoP Zone, nothing but PoP. Maybe it's just too much exp bonus in PoP zones which made OTHER ZONES COMPLETELY USELESS. No one in Akheva... CT.. is empty as usal today. well there is one group sometimes. Velk is completely empty with light blue spiders.<br>
today, I can't even solo light blue mob. Light blue mob which hit for 300s... /sigh what's up with this? Why does it have to be like this? To sell many pop expansion as possible? Getting 1 parchment in group every 2 hours. I'm lucky if I get one parchment in one day full playing with soloing in PoV. And after I finished hunting, I turn my parchment, and get spell that I already have. <br>
<br>
No quests to do. Sitting in PoS wrecked ship thingy 24/7 just to get one blue today, if I could.<br>
<br>
I try to find something challenge in NEW PoP zone, but it's been weeks. I couldn't find anything fun to do, except hitting for 500+ YOUCANNOTKILLMEWITHOUTSLOW mob.<br>
<br>
Game is broke. but we still play.<br>
Luclin was loot whore<br>
now PoP is Exp whore<br>
<br>
what's to come in next expansion...?<br>
<br>
Tonight, camping early in Ocean of Tears gob island wondering, i almost got killed when I came here at lvl 25.<br>

I wonder what EQ is all about, but I can't even think of anything...<br>

I dinged into 61 again because I had collected every spell except 61 pet.  I have epic, so yes he would help but it's not a game breaker.<br>
<br>
Positives:<br>
-I love the nuke<br>
-The focus items sell well in the bazaar, being able to focus my 61+ spells is nice.<br>
-I love the new pet weapons and armor, they do make a difference.  They also sell well in the bazaar.<br>
-New shielding buffs are very nice, I finally clear 2000 HP with standard gear, and my FR, CR are way higher.<br>
-Tanks love my new Damage shield, 45 damage is a ton.<br>
<br>
Negatives:<br>
-TONS of lost hunting grounds.  Sebilis is largely light blue until you go deep in at 61.  Karnors, forget it.  Velks, gone. Maidens eye, tons of light blues.  Ankheva tons of light blues now.  Fungus grove? Yep, there too.  Efreeti camp in Sol B (one of my personal favorites) All light blue.  Kael tons more light blues, and not easy mobs I might add for their level.  This is all JUST at level 61...  one ding and I lost probably 40+ zones and more I'm still discovering.<br>
Basically, most of this game content was created around the fact that level 60 was the top, put some thought into that.  By leveling to 65 you gain FIVE player levels, but you lose TEN levels of mob exp.  Put some thought into that too.<br>
<br>
-PoP zones are already overcrowded, and it's going to get worse.  Nearly nothing else offers exp mobs or comparable exp per kill.  Verant fixed overcrowded zones by releasing expansions with tons of other zones to hunt in.  Now they are all crap to a level 65 player, so take a wild guess where those level 65 players are going to hang out.<br>
<br>
-Only level IV focus items work on 61+.  How many of you are decked out in IV focus items besides summoned ones?  I'm sorry you paid 50k or 50 raid points for that Frostweaver Dain's cloak, it's crap now.  Don't you feel good that a level 65 can still wear a flowing black sash and get hasted, but you can't wear that super UBER luclin drop and benefit from the focus effect at all?<br>
<br>
-If your going to level above 61, then you really want to get flagged or your hating life.  Get used to PoN, PoD, PoI, PoJ because it's about all you got until you get flagged after dinging 61.  I hope you enjoyed buying all those Everquest expansions with content most of you have never seen.  Because now its all crap.<br>
<br>
I'm totally unhappy being level 61 even though I have my spells.  I had WAY WAY more fun at level 60 and hunting anywhere I wanted. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

but its true that new players will have a drastically different experence then us older players.  but Verant isnt targetting that market with this expansion, you have to level 46 just to enter it.  im Happy verant realized there true market hasnt changed in years and new players come and go faster then the tide.<br>
PoP is for those people who saw everything velious had to offer, and then luclin and now need something new to keep us interested. its not for newbies<br>

This is true. For some reason SOE upgraded the droprate immensly. I am now getting at least 1 parchment from green-to-65 mobs in PoD solo (not castle or cave, just *zonetrash*) every time I visit there. I remember the first weeks where it was standard to get 1 to 3 parchments an evening with 3 full groups keeping castle yards clear.<br>
<br>
Now spectrals and runes is a different matter. As long as you're not HoH, BoT or such enabled the chances for a 63+ spell are very very low. And getting into those zones for a casual gamer is still pretty hard (especially when &quot;uberguilders&quot; refuse to join non-guild key raids and non-guildies aren't allowed to join their raids).<br>
Yes I know about the quests. Wasted weeks already working on them. <p>Arch Convoker Rhand Drago'Magica<br>

<br>
So, I have the blade of walnan, the belt of magi'kot, the shield of the arcane, and FBoT...  with the 61 pet, I now feel like 61 is useful.  I am 2.5 blues from 61 now, and will probably stay 61, til I get some 62 spells, again, to make it appealing.<br>

To the guy who wants to stay 60 because of the solo places being open:  grats to you!  Play this game your way.<br>

This is when I'm level 61 and casting lots of air pets and FoT.  Last night I got 40% of an AA in an hour and a half.  Not bad for level 61 mage soloing with barely any FT and no rune items.  I might be able to speed it up with some tactics too.<br>
<br>
My guild went to Plane of Fear last night.  A level 64 mage from another guild was with us.  She had SCM3, and SCF3 just like me.  Both of us were using FoT.  She was using 61 air pet and I was using epic.  Her nukes were slightly larger then mine (1920 vs 1980 unfocused), but my epic pet was higher DPS on the mobs we were fighting (61 air is about 65 DPS, Epic is around 95 DPS with proc damage added)  I was matching wit's with a level 64 mage with equal AA.  This has been the case pretty much every time for me.  The only mages I know that are dramatically more damaging are the ones with Flowing Thought 15, and HoE3.  I could someday have FT15 as a level 60/61 mage, so that not the end.  HoE3 I will not get unless I level.<br>
<br>
Now also consider, most of the mobs we were fighting were probably light blue to the other mage.  All dark blue to me.  Seems to me she has not gained much over me with her levels, and she has lost alot.  <br>
<br>
I have parsed my damage every time I'm with a level 64/65 mage and I compare myself.  Everytime I'm right on par with them.  I hang out with many mages on my server that know me, they choose me over other level 64, 65 mages because they know I know my class and play my toon well.  They have seen me match and surpass other mages.  I don't feel weak compared to other mages.  I feel equal and yet I can fight in old world when I choose for exp.  My decision has been everything I hoped it would be. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

<br>
What I mean is. Don't get to level 65 while maintaining Tier 1 status.<br>
<br>
Get to level 65 while getting flags for Tier 2 and 3 planes. You don't have to be in an Oober guild to do it.<br>
<br>
Just get together with some of the pickup raids that are killing PoS Mini's and get your talismans, the other Bastion of Thunder pieces can be snagged doing single pickup groups in this zone.<br>
<br>
We just killed Aerin'Dar a few days ago with 82 people from all sorts of guilds. All 82 of these people are now flagged for Halls of Honor. (Spectral Parchments drop in Bastion of Thunder and Halls of Honor btw.)<br>
<br>
You have to progress up the Tiers as you go, or the rewards for making these higher levels won't be self evident.<br>
<br>
With that said.. I *HATE* the fact that I can only get exp in PoP zones and would truly love to see some old world zones revamped.<br>
<br>
But get level 65. You will find yourself invited to MANY more Exp groups.. .even if you don't have your spells. It's just the perception of power.<br>
<br>
AA's come just as fast and easy at level 65 in Tier 2 and 3 zones as they do at level 61 in the Tier 1 and 2 zones.<br>
