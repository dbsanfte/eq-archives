<br>
When you do summon a pet make sure you set it to /notaunt or you will get summoned and maybe killed.<br>
<br>
Keep track of your pet.  If you're 46+ you should know how to do this...but I've seen some poor examples of pet control even at that level before (but rare).  dont let your pet chase things...not even if you're sure it'll be ok.<br>
<br>
if you're using cancel magic spells....USE THEM EARLY.  Make sure you're not annulling other people's debuffs.<br>
<br>
this really applies to all classes:  Use your Assist &lt;main assist&gt; button!  do not attack unless you have just hit your button and acquired a target.<br>
<br>
no fire spells on naggy.<br>
<br>
I may think of more later.<br>
<br>
oh yeah...on mass death situations give everyone a mod rod.<br>
<br>
(btw...this one is good for other situations.)  As soon as you die and appear at bind point...summon something.  That way if you get killed you'll have an item and will leave a corpse behind.  Do this for others as well.<br>

Don;t go to fear cuz it sucks (well IMO =).  Join a raid expecting to spend at least 8 hours in the raid (plane raids that is).  Apothic is rare as hell don;t be disappointed if you put in 10 hours of work and get nothing.  No pets in hate, pathing is horrible.  Don;t complain in the raid, ie complain about no male revs being pulled cuz that just pisses ppl off.  Let ppl know before you leave.  Nuke in melee range so tanks don;t have to run far.  hmmm, be cool, and have FUN! <br>
oh yeah the other guy said it, but ASSIST, very important.  Feed your cleric mod rods too,  they keep ya alive )<br>

<br>
Why?  Because on the off chance my pet does run off, I can know if he's engaged any monsters with his 'taunting attackers' message.  <br>
<br>
This hasn't happened in fear yet, but if it was to, I'd run away from the camp, warn everyone that my pet ran into something, /q and hope I'm not dead when I come back.<br>
<br>
It did happen in Hate once, and I had enough time to move away from the camp and log out.  I was lucky to have time, I expected to die.<br>
<br>
Of course, if a pet does run off, you need to kill it with an invis asap..  The insta-invis to animals of earthen boots is useful for this..  except if you do see a 'taunting attacker' message -- that means that when your pet dies, the mob(s) are coming for you next.  Read above for instructions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
ALWAYS log out and come back after a pet gets loose, even if nothing bad comes of it..  a mob might be wandering around spreading you around various hate lists for a while before they all rush to train you -- and the camp -- unexpectedly.<br>
<br>
You can't be lazy in fear or hate.  There will be lots of mez'd mobs, and you have to make sure if your pet is on the right one.  Don't be afraid to kill your pet so an enc can mez if you can't get it off a mob.<br>
<br>
Have kill switches for your pet hotkeyed.  Definitely /pet get lost, and you should have an invis item in case he's out of range.<br>
<br>
Like someone said above, always listen to your raid leaders.  Do not debate pet policies during a raid.  It's their call.  It's frustrating not to be able to use them, but that's life.<br>
<br>
A golden newbie rule for plane raids is, you cannot -- under any circumstance -- train the camp.  If you're on your way to the camp and attacked, stop and die.  You'll be rez'd.  You need to prepare for death.<br>
<br>
You'll get moments in raids where it looks like there's going to be a mass death.  The raid leader will call for clerics to camp.  In hate, only clerics go on the wall to camp.  Everyone else waits until they're gone before camping.  The idea is that you buy the clerics as much time to camp as possible, they need to rez everyone.  If no clerics camp during a mass death, life gets very hard..  I usually summon a pet for this, my earth pet can distract a mob a lot longer than I can..<br>
<br>
In Hate, __do not__ fight on the wall at the sw camp.  During downtime, you wait sit around 90% of the way up the wall.  The raid leader will have macros to tell everyone to come down and assist him when they have a mob ready.  Even if you're oom, come down to the floor to med, do not stay on the wall during combat.  You need to keep the mobs off the wall, and away from the cleric in the sw corner -- life's a bitch otherwise.<br>
<br>
During Naggy raids, use your fire pet against Naggy, it has the best resistances to fire. Against Vox, use water.  Your fire pet peobably won't be killed by naggy.  I haven't done trakanon yet, but he has poison attacks, so you'll want your water pet -- get yourself a gsd too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have only gone with friends who have their armor drop in Fear to only help them get it.  With Fear, you can lose your corpse and possibly forever (yes, including all your hard earned items).  <br>
<br>
Hate is where your armor drops (Apothic Armor).  Hate is pie compared to Fear because Hate has safe spots as where Fear does not.  Hate does have really annoying mobs, i.e.: Spite Golems (100% Magic Resistant, they are also shamans so they have sow on) and the other mob is Cleric of Innoruuk (Yes, he CHs himself, you got to stun/nuke him to hell at 1/4 life to prevent him to do so).  In addition, if a mob you're killing is near a Cleric of Innoruuk, that cleric will CH it, trust me, it has happened to me where we were killing a Spite Golem and people didn't listen and it was CHed 3 times before we had a train.<br>
<br>
On my server, Xegony, there aren't too mages coming up on Hate raids so usually at least 2 of them will get a piece if the zone is cleared.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps for Hate.<br>

<br>
We started with 24 people, and when we finished clearing, we had 12, so my role was as diversified as it can be.<br>
<br>
For most of the night, I was able to use my pet, so I had to be mindful of him.  We had only one shaman, so I was on malise duty -- which is easier in fear than it is in hate.  <br>
<br>
Malise duty consists of casting the highest level spell you have in the malise line you have.  Once a monster is malised, you have you announce it to the raid with an ooc social that spits out something like, &quot;===MALISEMENT===&quot;.  This is an easy job, but you have to learn which monsters you can malise easily, and which monsters to give up easily on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   You can also start malising mez'd monsters before combat is initiated on them.<br>
<br>
Along with all of this, I was also nuking for a good part of the night.  Later on, with our numbers low, I was put on modrod duty, making sure there were plenty of mod rods on the ground for clerics and encs to use.  Our main cleric has that blue kunark ruby bp clone that regens, so it worked out nicely.  I had a bard in my group with manasong 2, and an enc casting clarity 2 on me, so it worked out nicely.<br>
<br>
This doesn't sound like a lot of work, but you have to switch between two or three sets of hotkeys pretty quickly, and with the modrod duty, I was kept really busy.<br>
<br>
That was the most fun I've had in Hate.  I really enjoyed being part of a small group, and I enjoy being on malise duty..  It beats just medding and nuking throughout the night.<br>

<br>
Like they said above, expect to die, sometimes a lot.  It depends upon how good your raid leader is and how well the party works as a team, how many enchanters you have, and some luck.  As mages we have mostly taken over the Malosi role in raids but coordinate with any shamans, never hurts to have 2 people doing it.  Fire can be used on all the mobs here.  I also do not turn off taunt, any damage my pet can take is less for the tanks, I get summoned a lot but rarely get hurt.<br>
<br>
Hate.<br>
<br>
After the party gets set in their camp you can pet up.  Keep a close eye on your pet and be ready to have it bach off if it starts to run.  When fighting Spites, if your the only mage there, assist the spite, and do damage shields on the tanks.  You really need more than 1 person doing Malosi here as you will get resisted a lot.  After Malosi fire is good here also, if you are fighting near a wall you can go up the wall a little ways and use Lava Bolt.<br>

<br>
Hate: No true "safe" spots exist, some are just less travelled than others. In many ways Hate is much worse for mages because the pathing there makes the big pyramid pathing in Cazic look well done. <br>
<br>
Fear: I have done over 50 fear runs now, and we have never had anyone loose a corpse. The chances of losing your corpse in Hate and Fear both come down to the same thing, do you have friends willing to help with a CR?<br>
<br>
Many mages object to going to fear simply because class armour does not drop there, I know my guild would not take a mage to Hate that did not also participate in Fear though. Lets face reality, if not for wizards, no mage would ever see Hate, and wizard armour drops in Fear. <p>Kailere Drowsbane of Veeshan -Paladin of 53 summers<BR>

I  have gone afk for an hour waiting for people to log on to start, and did I die? No.  Want to know why? Because roamers don't pass by there and you can't aggro if you're high on the wall.<br>
<br>
Being I spend more time in Hate than you do would make my advice more reliable.  What I am saying that it is a safe spot unless someone aggros to it.  Oh, the safe spot I am talking about is right next to SWC.<br>

You added an additional bit of info though, the fact that it is very easy for someone else to aggro a mob that will then path through there. <br>

<br>
In Hate, generally people don't die getting to the west wall camp -- near the sw corner.  Fastest I've heard it cleared with Inno up is 4 hours, I was on a raid that cleared in in around 5 with inno up.  In the last two raids I've been on there, there's been one mass death, life is pretty easy.<br>
<br>
Most people do fear by getting a cleric or a monk with a rez stick camped -- or a necro now, heh -- camped in the north wall camp.  Everyone else basically makes a mad dash for the camp, getting as close to possible without camping.  Quite a few people die, but are rez'd as the raid goes on.  If you're not a vital class and you're killed by the gate, don't expect to be res'd fast.  Fear takes much longer to clear and is a much tougher break.  Cazic is tougher than Inno, and it's not unusual for him to agro the zone, meaning everyone has to camp.<br>
<br>
I really don't see how anyone can consider fear to be as easy as hate.  To me, there's no comparison. <p>Vylaek, <BR>

<br>
I know I can move this to the library, and I plan to after people get more of a chance to post any other usefull hints (not that the arguements aren't funny, just not very usefull).<br>
<br>
Question... would it be too hard to add to this after it's in the library?<br>
<br>
And how about the 23rd moving it to the library? gives everyone 2 weeks to add anything else.<br>
<br>
Also would anyone have a problem with me editing out arguments, and leaving only the &quot;facts&quot; (meaning experienced things only, not &quot;blah blah has no idea what they are sayin')?<br>
<br>
