<br>
You'll come upon a camp of three where there are never any wanderers, make this your base. You'll see many more spawns to the west of this site, just be careful of wandering adds. If you kill too many, go kill gnolls or poachers to fix faction with the town.<br>
<br>
Dryads are triggered spawns, so look for the small flames at the base of the trees. Move in range to trigger the mob, then sic your pet. <br>
<br>
Other notes:<br>
<br>
If you leave the mob alone, it will stand there and buff itself, so make sure to send the pet right away. If you're resists are okay, you should be fine with 54 water here, but if you find your pet getting slowed and dotted a lot, switch to 53 air to add some stuns to the mix.<br>
<br>
Loot is decent, especially the barkleather armor. The tunic sold for 111pp last night, its safe to say you can average about 100p per hour with decent xp in this camp.<br>
<br>
With kei, you can do quite a bit of damage, just send pet, wait for taunt, cast sirroco, then med.<br>
<br>
XP is so-so at 56 (about half or more were lt blue), but was still pretty good at 55. If I played 'hard' i'd get 5-8% per hour, if i'd take my time, it was more like 4-5%..... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
with a buffed air pet and kei, i can usually around 6 of the spawns before the 1st dryads spawns again (i always return to the first 3 to avoid wandering animals).  With careful mana usage and chaining a new air pet every once in a while, i would get 1% exp off 3 kills at 54<br>
<br>
at 55 it is indeed quite a bit less, but i still seem to get 1% exp from every 4 or 5 dryads or so.  If this is correct and the magician works at essentially peak effeciency the whole time, thats roughly 10% exp per hour, or 25% off the single cast of a KEI.  These numbers seem a bit too high but its still nice.<br>
<br>
also dryads drop the occasional barkleather armor, which can be sold to make some extra PP.  they are lore however, but i have often taken my first item to the outpost, sold it with my cha gear and run back w/o encountering any problems, and the armopr peices sell for around 70pp with 113 cha (for the few i sold at least)<br>
<br>

If you have a BWS or the Boots of Bladecalling and a horse, the gnolls are perfect. With extended KEI on, I got two yellows or thereabouts... at level 57! It was faster at 55-57. Since EVERYTHING is dark blue at 57 and casters and some warriors start going light blue at 58, if you want AAs and have the equipment I mentioned above, stop Exping at level 57.9 or whatever.<br>
<br>
The AAs should be fast, maybe 3/4 of one per KEI shot or maybe even one whole AA if you have two accounts. Without a horse and BWS/BoBC, it is kinda tougher but still a great solo spot.<br>

I am partnered with a cleric... that helps alot...<br>
I have a horse, and BWS.. no boots though..<br>
I stop in Great Divide and pickup some velium maces, and warhammers.. they are easy to get.. just one trip through the cave will get you about 10-15 of them.. the velium staffs are no good as pet weapons(2hb and pet wont weild)<br>
then gate to PoK... hit the qeynos book and run to JP.<br>
when in the zone.. get pet, a bag of plate, give him 2 velium weapons.. 2 baubles(theses have +hp on them) 2 rings.. not rings of flight but the other ones.. they also have +hp <br>
muzzle(if you have) a choker, a shard of the core, a coldstone, elemental defender and an elemental blanket.<br>
the defender and blanket help with resists...of course bo# and fire shield.. i used bo4.. <br>
<br>
run to the tunnel.. <br>
there are 3 to 5 in the first little room.. 3 are static.. 2 are roamers.. usally a durid is kiting the roamers.. so the tunnel is clear.. take a right and there maybe one in this next tunnel.<br>
next room has 3.. you can run past them.. just stay to the right..<br>
<br>
longer tunnel now.. till you see what looks like a big rock.. fall down through the floor.. summon your pet..he wont follow you down.. so summon him..<br>
there is a good trick to pulling down here that me and the cleric use.. dont pull to the tunnel takes too long..<br>
run up to where the mobs are.. and kill them there. there are no roamers here and they donthelp each other out..<br>
kill the curates and oracles first.. they cast heals.<br>
<br>
In about 4hours, i dinged one whole AA point and made 25% regular exp.. with AA set to 40%... This place is awsome.<br>
They drop poorly balanced weapons..(4pp at vendor) emeralds. and other stuff. all good stuff... also, teeth drop, you can turn them in to the guard that stands outside the bank in JP. hail him and say &quot;what bounty&quot; no exp but nice faction hit.. at least holly is only threatining to kill me..woo hoo.<br>

<br>
First off, a note on a second camp spot. Ice mentioned the camp where you fall through a trap in the floor. This place is a nice one to grind at but I prefer the other one, which I am about to mention.<br>
<br>
Enter the cave and have invis on. Make sure you can each caster as they might be able to see through the invis but no warriors can. Go straight ahead until you reach the first tiny little chamber with a few static spawns. From here you can go either right or continue going straight. Continue going straight.<br>
<br>
In the next room, just keep going straight. Be sure to con mobs before you run by. <br>
<br>
In the third room you will reach, take an immediate right and follow the tunnel.<br>
<br>
In the fourth tiny tiny room, make a left. This left passage has a few wandering mobs and it could be see-invis mobs so be careful.<br>
<br>
Once you are through this passage you will be in a huge open cavern. As you enter it, you will notice that there are two parts of the chamber. One straight ahead and one to the right. Go right.<br>
<br>
In this part of the chamber, there are 8 static spawn gnolls all around the walls and one gnoll in the middle on a little mini-mountain. You should see a torch on the wall near a duo or gnolls. That is a safe spot. There are no wanderers in this chamber so you are good to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some tips: if a gnoll is running, blast it quick. They run into a connected chamber with 3 or 4 gnolls and one roamer so it is bad news if they make it all the way there. Also, cast Annul Magic on the shaman mobs. I can't remember the names of them exactly but they are NOT defiler and maybe be gnoll oracles or something. Cast Annul Magic twice so you dispell their SOW or else they book it like crazy into other gnolls for help.<br>
<br>
That is all I have for this camp. Good luck. <p>-Saynac</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=luun>Luun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(1/11/03 4:35:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=337.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   thank you</span><hr size=1> Thank you for all of the advice.
