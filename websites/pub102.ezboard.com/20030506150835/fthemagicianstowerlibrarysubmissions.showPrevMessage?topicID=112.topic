<br>
Another spot is IGs at Permafrost, you can get exp there if you're low-mid 50s (I think, I haven't camped them so I don't know what level they are)<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I prefer to farm unused low level dungeons where FS drops, like SolA.  It's especially nice when there's a vendor in the zone to sell all the FS to.<br>
<br>
I don't know of any good cash spots in Kunark or Luclin though.  Velious has Crystal Caverns, which can be an OK farm spot if you have some way to use the dwarves as vendors.  I haven't farmed there for cash, but I have for crystal silks.<br>
<br>
I've been doing Droga recently for the Chardok quests, and I can tell ya, it's a pretty crappy place for farming cash.  At least I've had a lot lower cashflow there than otherwhere.<br>
<br>
Luclin I just haven't explored the lower level zones as much yet, been busy getting AXP in the upper level ones. <p><a href="http://fu-profiles.vestergren.nu/view_player.php?uid=118">Danariel Draconian</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucaeadyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>caeadyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(1/19/02 5:50:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Where to get lots of Platinum as a mage</span><hr size=1> It's not an uber way to get cash but this method isn't bad either  (I can get hundreds of pp this way an hour or two).<br>
<br>
In OOT there is an island with a spawn of 4 spectres on a 5 minute timer.  Be sure you can pull singles.  At lvl 55 I could pull a single but if I didn't bring the spec to the edge of the island my pet pet jumped in and aggroed all the other specs which wasn't good.<br>
<br>
Specs can drop anything from 0 to 5pp each and either one of three types of scythes.  The best one sells for 12pp.<br>
<br>
While medding or waiting for respawn, there are skellies and gargoyles.  Skellies are phs for gargoyles.  I've seen gargoyles drop 2 eyes at a time once but sometimes none.  Those sell for about 8pp.<br>
<br>
Won't get any exp but it's something different while taking a break from questing or the usual exp grind.<br>

<br>
That said If you find yourself in need of some pp around lev 54, I highly recomend Cobalt Scar for the best exp/pp combo around...<br>
<br>
You can sell the gems (be sure and print a list of them all, some you will want for Vellious armour) you don't need, you can sell the pelts, and you can get nice exp all at once...I LOVE that zone  :-) I was averaging 1000pp in gems/loot/pelts every day there ....<br>
<br>
The only downside to CS is that it is a popular place for quad kiters, and the spawns can be too few if you play during peak times...However, I found that the tower is usually a good place  even during peak times...Just make some lev rings...Park your pet on the land, malosi the wyvernns (prb. get hit once) and run out the window to your waiting pet, and have fun :-)<br>
<br>
If the Wyvernns, and Drakes are all gone, chances are the Haunted Seachests are free....make some waterstones, and enjoy! They have a lot of HP's, but I've never had trouble with them, and at lev 53-54 I was able to fight them underwater, and by the time I was FM again, another would pop. Nice timing on them, even if it is a bit slower than fighting Wyvernns/Drakes<br>
<br>
The quad kiters also hate the drakes, and thier annoying AoE, which hits for 500dmg, and the dispelling they do, so they are usually available (I've made several Druid friends by killing Drakes while they take the Wyvernns) ...but if you send your pet, and stay out of AoE range they are not that hard at all...Just takes a bit of practice to get the distance down. I can't tell you how many free ports I've gotten from thankfull quad kiting druids/wizards who fear the Drakes which is a nice bonus :-)<br>
<br>
If you haven't mastered baking, you can use the meat from them to make some yummy (and has stats!) food...down at the Othmir camp there is an oven, and a brew tank! (Hell, I even like the happy little tune they play when you are on the beach!)<br>
<br>
btw, I wouldn't bother with the Sirens unless you have a bit of help, and you are doing the 7 shawls quest, and the Bulthars have waaayyyyy too many HP's for the effort...<br>

Recommended for those around 20-30.  I am lvl 30 and I go to the moon and go to the Netherbian Lair.  I always tank there, and pull to my pet by the pillar.  The swarm leader carries the netherbian Chitin which sells from 300-500pp.  You can only have one.  And in about 3 hours playing time I usually can average about 50-60pp that is w/out selling the loot.  Just be careful because you can possibly pull a lot of Drones and warriors in one pull, and the Fungoids and Trogs sometimes wander around and they will aggro on anyone.  The plus side is that there are plenty of guards there that will kill the mobs if you are in trouble, and the zones are easy to find<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I hope this helps out some of us who are not quite up to 50<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I know that with getting spells and such I am always broke, so when I am broke I go there<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I also still can get some experiance from the Leader he sometimes cons black or black to me<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But ez kill<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
This can also be a good xp zone for ppl &lt;30, as I believe the last patch boosted XP for dungeons and characters &lt;30. <br>
<br>
I made close to 100pp in 2 hours there one evening with a group of 20-somethings, with everyone splitting loot. I wouldn't feel comfortable soloing here until 30 though, due to the potential for aggro trains.....<br>
<br>
As you get towards 30, you can still make decent plat by killing the guards in the zone. Right now there is no faction penalty for doing so. I got much better xp and pp per hour by killing guards than in mseru, which is supposed to be the better xp zone (I think this may be due to the patch).<br>
<br>
Netherbian Lair is a nice crossing ground for very high level characters, and many will stop and give buffs for people pulling by the main column in center of zone.<br>

I know people have already mentioned this in regards to the idol, but if you start at the entrance, work your way down to chief, and back up to zone out (not just stay in one camp), not only will you collect a ton of FS weapons and assorted gems (11-20pp), but you will also have a chance at the occasional idol or shroud of nature.  These gobbies arent that hard to kill and also drop about 2-4pp.  If you let your pet do all the tanking and just keep him healed, you will never run out of mana and can tear through the zone.  On average, I make about 1k in an a two hour session.

- You don't get encumbered<br>
- You have a basic speed capable of outrunning a Hill Giant, no matter how 'encumbered' you may be<br>
- Lvl 50+ pets can handle HGs easily, water is my favourite<br>
<br>
Put this all together and you are looking at over 500pp per hour in Rathe, provided that it's not too crowded.   No down time, just an occaisional nuke or pet heal, easy money.<br>
<br>
Horses are seriously under-appreciated.  8kp is no small sum to pay but farming HGs like this could quickly repay your investment.<br>
<br>
Failing that, Seafury Island can't be beaten for steady experience and plat for the low 50s mage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubandorr18.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bandorr18</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(8/7/02 6:44:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=85.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://dynamic.gamespy.com/~cazic/cazic/ubb/uploads/mog3.gif  WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Farming Hill Giants on Horseback</span><hr size=1> You don't get encumbered on a horse? <p>/em Cast gate and waits.!<BR>

Just farm tribals for acrylia, then sell your pieces for 50PP and blocks for 100PP (sure to sell them quickly). <br>
You can solo this place since lvl 41 and make good exp (I went to 46 without moving), getting like 1K/day. <br>

You won't get exp BUT you can constantly kill mob after mob after mob , possibly healing your pet after 20 or so kills (I use MS2 here a lot).<br>
<br>
Thye drop a pittance in actual plat , maybe the odd 2-4pp BUT the loot , once you start to build up loot in your bags , we are talking 40-285pp per item<br>

After an afternoon in there I've come back and sold in POK and ended up with 2k in plat.<br>
<br>
I often end up there after checking all the usual plat hunting zones (EF , RM , CS etc)<br>

Unless they improved the drop rates here, I didn't find this as good as sola for farming cash.
