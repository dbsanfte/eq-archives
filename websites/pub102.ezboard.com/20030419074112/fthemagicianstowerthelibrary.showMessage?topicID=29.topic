I am really surprised that I have not died even ONCE!  YAY!<br>
<br>
I went up in Kelethin last night but didn't stay too long because it made me really nervous how you can not see the down ramps until you are right on them (yikes).  I really didn't want to fall and figured it is close to home anyway, so I can go back at any time pretty much.  Last night (or rather 4 am, LOL) I went ahead and camped in Felwithe.<br>
<br>
This morning I got up and headed to the Butcher Block Mountains.  I was looking for my large sewing kit.  But as soon as went up to the first dwarf merchant that I saw, a dang green blood thing attacked me.  I (and my pet) killed it.  THEN, of course I went up the wrong path and got WAY lost, but I found a nice dwarf that pointed me towards Kaladim.<br>
<br>
Kaladim was a blast...but it took me a while to figure out how to run at the doors to get in those short entrances.  I shopped and still found NO large sewing kit...sigh.  I did however go to the dwarf bank and get some more Malechite out.   Well, then I got lost in there (go figure, I am always lost, LOL).  I must have zoned to north Kaladim, south Kaladim, north, south, north, south twenty times.  Dang, all of their little tunnels look SO similar.  FINALLY I found the mountains again and took a right (after getting my pet out, and summoning more food and drink).  I was SO happy to get back in the Mountains.  I don't know HOW I got so lost in there, but talk about running around in circles.<br>
<br>
As SOON as I left Kaladim, I see this neon (willowwisp colored) beast!  Of course the damn thing attacked me (it was an aqua goblin...which actually, i have seen their parts at vendors but assumed these were a thing that lived in the water, guess NOT).  I BARELY killed it and looted it.  I though for sure that it was going to kill me.  Glad I killed it though because I sold it's stuff for a new color of robe later on (see below).<br>
<br>
When I finally got to the port...I had a bit of trouble.  After wondering around (with more goblins and vicious dog things lurking ALL over..but luckily not attacking me) I could not find WHERE to get a ticket.  A friend told me on IM that I didn't need one.  So, I get on a boat (a flat wooden one) and my friend on IM says &quot;no, don't go there, it takes you to a lvl 30+ area, you want the BIG boat with sails.&quot;  Of course...RIGHT when that message came through my boat took off.  But it stopped, next to TWO other flat boats, so I decided that if I got on one of those that I may go back.  Well, maybe it would have taken me back, but instead I jumped in the water on accident (so did my pet, LOL)!  I made it to shore but had no idea where I was (but hey, my swimming is up to 7 now and I didn't drown so I was happy).  Luckily, I was just BEHIND the same port, and I saw the BIG boat this time but missed it.  After forever another boat came and I headed to Freeport.<br>
<br>
I LOVE Freeport.  I can at least fit in the doorways there AND not have to worry about falling off like in Kelethin.  ~g~<br>
<br>
FINALLY, I found my large sewing kit AND a got a Violet robe (that doesn't do a thing but at least I can be purple now when I feel like it and also not have to risk loosing my Robe of the Oracle that my friend gave me if I am going somewhere where I may be killed).  I also sold a large bag and got a bacpack instead.  I think I will get another backpack tomorrow, just so that I can keep my extra clothes (fashion clothes) in the bank in there.  I KNOW that I am going to need at LEAST 8 spots for different looks.  <br>
<br>
Heehee...I am having a BLAST!  So far the journey has been good (no deaths and a I am finding a TON of new places).  I have seen some different creatures too (skunks, scarabs, snakes, goblins and dwarf skeletons).  I am camped right now (in the Freeport Arcane arts area).  Tomorrow (or however long it takes) I plan to go to Qeynos...and maybe after that to that frozen looking region at the top of that continent.  I am trying REALLY hard not to kill anything unless it attacks me too.  I REALLY don't want to hit lvl 10 until AFTER I gate back home.  I am on about lvl 9.3 now.<br>
<br>
Thanks all, for recommending this journey.  It is AWESOME.  And if anyone is in the freeport area, give me a tell tomorrow if you want. <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/03 12:14:07 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elfnom>Elfnom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 12:02:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I wouldn't make that trip yet.....</span><hr size=1>   It's a tough journey on foot to Queynos.

  If you're set on going there, be sure and cross the forest zone during the game day time.  At night its suicide at your level.  I don't recall the name of the forest zone.  It's the one just after West Commons.  Or try and find someone to escort you at least past High Hold pass. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 12:05:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaPhoto2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I wouldn't make that trip yet.....</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>If you're set on going there, be sure and cross the forest zone during the game day time<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Is there a way to tell when it will be day?  It seems to turn from light to dark a lot when I am on.  Is is set in any specific time zone (as compared to RL time)?<br>
<br>
Er...maybe I have just been really lucky so far.

  During EQ night, there are many undead in Kithicor.  If you take the paths, I'm betting you can't get through.  During the day, the undead are replaced by living creatures.  Your invis does not work against the undead.  At night you will be seen.  Invis might get you through there during the day.  Wait till about 10:00 AM game time though.  Sometimes the undead hang on a while after the sun comes up. <br>
<br>
  Next zone after Kith is High Hold Keep.  The paths there are very confusing.  If you get through Kith alive, be sure and stay invis in HHK.  There may not be any mobs that see invis in HHK, or there may be people there killing all the mobs.  After HHK, the zones are mostly large outdoor zones and if you stay invis, you should be safe. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 862<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 1:15:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=7>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/photo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yep, Kithicor is the zone name</span><hr size=1> Glad its working out for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Eastern Antonica (freeport and surrounds) is an excellent hunting area for the young traveller, I always recommend people relocate there as it is quite logically and clearly laid out. There is a distinct progression as you move through zones in the area.<br>
<br>
If you travel form the West gate you will enter East Commons. THe monsters here are largely in your range, however you will probably need to group in a few levels to continue hunting here and tackle orc camps and the like Watch out for Griffins (big flying lions with eagle wings and head), they are pretty much your only real worry here and will eat you quickly.<br>
<br>
The next zone West is (unremarkably) West Commons, which is similar to East except it has higher level monsters and you have to dodge Hill and Nightfall Giants as well as Griffins. Watch out for Kizdean Gix (sp?) to the West of the Toll Booth, he is a bastard and will probably attack you on sight. EC and WC are on the way to Qeynos (a rather small leg of the journey).<br>
<br>
The other way via the South Gate (in Eastern Freeport, where the docks are) will take you to North Ro, which is similar to EC but desert. There is less very low level mobs here and some good Dervish Cutthroat hunting. Nro (as its known) would be an ideal hunting ground fo ryou at the moment. Note that the guards will attack everything (and hence protect you from) everything but the Cutthroats, so if you get in trouble with them its time to zone. Sand Giants spawn here, but very very rarely and towards the South of the zone generally.<br>
<br>
South of Nro lies the Oasis of Marr, once one of the busiest areas in the game, and decent hunting until you are nearly 20.<br>
<br>
Good luck on your adventure ...  <p><center>

The second time I figured if I made the trip with a pet, the pet would at least give me a chance to gate if I got attacked.  Everything seemed to be going fine, when suddenly a Dread Wolf and some kind of undead cleric or necro double teamed me.  My pet was nowhere to be found - it happened so quick I don't know if they killed him or he realized what the better part of valor was.

This site will point out the safer ways of travelling, the dangers of the zones you plan to go through, has very pretty and quite acurate maps. Of course, if your just exploring you may not want to spoil all that :P. Also remember that IF you die, which WILL happen someday im sure, you will return to your bind point. (to find out your bind point type /char) So as you keep moving further into the continent look for Soulbinders in major cities, and see what they have to say (hint: if you say &quot;bind my soul&quot; they will bind you there). At level 12 you will gain the spell &quot;bind affinity&quot; and you can forgoe the nuiscance of only binding where soulbinders are located. or you can always ask a higher level casting class to bind you.  <p>&quot;God told me to sell my house, my car, quit my job and go to vegas. So i did. God told me to go to a specific roulette table and bet on 17. So I did. It turned out to be a ... 21. God said &quot;Damn&quot;<br>

Oh well, worst that can happen is I die, right?!  <br>
<br>
I think that I am actually stuck in Freeport for today, I loaded on Shadows of Lucin and Scars of Velious and they are patching now (probably for hours if if my EQ Classic and Ruins of Kunark took over three hours...and THAT was just ONE disc, as compared to FOUR that I just loaded).<br>
<br>
I see that Erudin is not too far once I DO get to Qeynos, so I may go there next...and maybe up to the arctic looking region at the top of Antonica (?).<br>
<br>
I do have a question though...in my little book that came with my box set it says this (talking about my starting city per class, I am High Elf)...the following is an exact quote from the book<br>
<br>
******************************<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>High Elf:  </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->Though they have physical <br>
traits in common with woodland<br>
Elves, High Elves are far more<br>
developed in the ways of the mind.<br>

Racial Tensions:     Iskar, Ogers, Trolls</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
******************************  <br>
<br>
Okay...so CONCERNING &quot;racial tensions&quot;...does this mean that I should AVOID the cities of the Iskar, Trolls and Ogers?  I am NOT on a PvP server.  However, does this mean that if I DO go into one of their cities that I will attacked by a guard and/or not welcome in general (as in merchants not selling to me/buyng from me, etc.)?  Or is it okay to go there?  Granted, I know that Erudin (or Riverall on my way to Qeynos) are not one of my racial tension races cities...but I am really enjoying traveling and may go farther (if possible) before I get to lvl 10.  I would like to see as much as I can before I get to that lvl.  I am also dying to go to the MOON!  LOL, I just found out two days ago that we have a moon that we can travel too.  However, I am a bit scared of going THAT far.  Jeez, I may not be able to get back down...and that would SUCK! <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/12/03 8:02:47 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zyphyr>Zyphyr</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 787<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 7:53:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Well...I took your advice and started off to Qeynos!</span><hr size=1> You guessed right on what they mean by racial tensions : go there and they will smack you down.

Yes, avoid them.<br>
<br>
While players will think indifferent of you (usually), guards and other NPCs do not. They'll likely kill you on sight just for being a high elf.<br>
<br>
Basically you fit in the category of &quot;good&quot; race: Barbarians, High Elves, Wood Elves, Erudites (most), Humans (most), Gnomes (most), Dwarfs, Halflings, Vah Shir (to some extent).<br>
<br>
&quot;Evil&quot; races include:<br>
Dark Elves, Iksar, Ogres, Trolls<br>
Basically Good vs Evil. If you are a good race, you avoid evil NPCs like the plague. And if you're an evil race, you go out of your way to torment good races.<br>
<br>
The long answer:<br>
<br>
There's more to the game than just race: Faction. Initial faction is a combination of your race, class, and deity. Faction is further adjusted by killing monsters and completing quests.<br>
<br>
Races are outlined above. However your class can generally be defined as good, neutral, and evil.<br>
Good: Paladins, Clerics (depending on deity), Druid, Rangers<br>
Evil: Necromancers, Shadow Knights, Clerics (depending on deity), Rouges (usually)<br>
Neutral: everything else<br>
<br>
Furthermore, your deity influences things significantly and often in unseen ways. A human cleric that worships Mithaniel Marr will be treated differently than one that worships Bertoxxulous, for example.<br>
<br>
Faction works both ways (usually). It's possible, for example, for a high elf cleric to be welcomed with open arms to the dark elf necro guild. It's also possible for a Shadowknight to be killed on sight at his own guild.<br>
<br>
Faction mainly plays a role in quests. Some NPCs will refuse to talk to you unless your faction standing is high enough.<br>
<br>
You can easily check your faction standing with any NPC by conning them. It's a definite progression from worst to best.<br>
KOS faction:<br>
Scowls<br>
Threatening<br>
<br>
Non-KOS:<br>
Dubious<br>
Apprehensive<br>
Indifferent<br>
Amiable<br>
Kindly<br>
Warmly<br>
Ally<br>
<br>
The even better answer: Once you hit 50s, stop worrying about faction unless its for a quest, and consider everything a potential loot monster <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=buppy>Buppy</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/03 8:37:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Yep, Kithicor is the zone name</span><hr size=1> As a high elf, you will be KoS (Killed on Sight) by Iksars, Trolls, Ogres, and Dark Elves. (Though there are some exceptions.)<br>
<br>
Halflings in Rivervale and Humans in Qeynos will welcome you alright, and somewhat less so the Humans in Highhold (some may kill you), the Barbarians in Halas, and the Erudites in Erudin. The evil Erudites in Paineel will not like you however.<br>
<br>
As a general rule, keep yourself invisible while traveling, and always con everything. The trip from Freeport to Qeynos is really not that dangerous, as long as you cross Kithicor in the daytime. The only real place to worry is making the dash from the ramp to the bridge in East Karana, and just remember to be careful running down the ramp. If you're invis, you'll most likely be ok. There are some giants and a few cyclopes in the zone that will see through invis so watch out for those. Some of the gnolls may also see invis, or maybe just the undead reavers, I forget. I've made the run as low as level 5 with no invis and no sow, so if you know what to watch out for, you'll probably be ok.<br>
<br>
Once you get to North Karana, just make a left and follow the river. There's one bandit camp on the river between the two bridges, and can be difficult to see until you're in the middle of it. Keep invis up, go, and watch what's in front of you. Nothing wanders to the river so unless someone pulls something there, the bandits are the only worry. The bandits do not see invis.<br>
<br>
Shortly after you pass the stone bridge you will get to West Karana. Keep following the river and you will be safe for the most part. Very rarely, there will be a hill giant near the NK zone, so keep your eyes open. Also, some bandits will wander near the river. They usually travel in pairs so they can be tough to handle. Eventually, (after what seems like running forever, WK is a very big zone) you will see a camp of Barbarians. Easiestway to go here is pass the Barb camp until you hit the mountain wall, the follow that until you hit see the path. Follow the path left and you will come to Qeynos Hills. Be careful on the path, there's a Werewolf that spawns near the QHills zone at about 8pm game time IIRC. There's not much you need to worry about in QHills, most of it is below your level. There is a level 10 necro who wanders around near the path, and he can be a pain. Forget his name at the moment. Just con any humans you see with skeleton pets ro stay invis. Follow the path out from WK until it intersects with the main path. Take the path left and you will come to Qeynos.<br>
<br>
All in all, it's an exciting trip, and can really give you an idea of just how immense Norrath is. Of course, after you've run it a time or two, you'll definitely be ordering PoP to avoid ever doing it again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Buppyy O'Boom</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

<br>
Nowadays, 50+ is the norm not the &quot;uber&quot;, every newbie zone on Norrath has probably like 3 people in it total, and all 3 are really just alt bots of lvl 65 people fully twinked out in gear that gives 800+ HP and mana to a lvl 1...........<br>

Ive played since a month or so after release and how times have changed.<br>
<br>
Here is my advice. Dont let anyone tell you how to do anything the easy way. Just use the crappy inaccurate cloth map that came with your software and explore!<br>
<br>
Dont go to eqatlas.com, dont go to the bazaar and buy equipment that drops in the the plane of hate for cheap. Dont read up on stratagies for your class (well until you get into your 20's or so).<br>
<br>
Explore the wonder that is EQ when you are new to it. Learn for yourself where you can go and what you can do. Sounds like your off to a good start and you have the spirit of a true explorer. To many people come into the game now with so much foreknowledge of the game that it couldnt possible hold any wonder. Keep doing what your doing.<br>
<br>
They have given you what you need to know, Bind at every city on your way and invisable is your friend.<br>
<br>
BUT most of all, keep coming here and posting of your adventures friend. You bring a little bit of joy to all us oldtimers who wish we could be newbies again. And for that I and we all thank you. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://pic4.picturetrail.com/VOL57/700486/1172495/15664115.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
I left Freeport and somehow ended up in the desert.  THEN I zoned to some Oasis place...THERE an Orc Priest attacked and killed me and *poof* I was back at Felwithe! Pfft<br>
<br>
Well, Now I am in Lesser Faydark and the Steamfront Mountains.  I killed some giant spiders AND a Fae drake.  But am I supposed to KILL Fae Drakes?  I killed about 50 Pixies and learned today NOT to kill those or Unicorns (I have not killed a Unicorn, just saw one for the first time and they are HUGE)...OY!  I am so confused.  After I get to the Gnome City, I am heading off to Qeynos again (and AVOIDING the damn desert).  BAH! I can't believe that I ended up back HOME!   <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showMessageRange?topicID=29.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showMessageRange?topicID=29.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showMessageRange?topicID=29.topic&start=61&stop=63>4</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showPrevMessage?topicID=29.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showNextMessage?topicID=29.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=29.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.threadControl?topicID=29.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=29.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> -
