Magicians are supposed to be one of the better soloing classes. Yet we cannot solo something until it is about 5-10 levels under us throughout the 30's,40's and 50's. Even when we can solo a mob, we have to deal more than half the dmg or else our pet will take 50% of the xp. With all this, magicians should at least be able to charm, or root/snare. All we need are a few more abilities to balance out our class. Such as stronger pets, or the ability to snare, or better nukes. This would really help the magician's class. I'm not saying all of them should be added to the game, I'm just saying that 1 of the above would be enough. I hope you'd all agree with me on this.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I understand that Verant works hard to keep us all happy, and I don't want to criticize them on how the magician class is unbalanced. But I felt I had to do something about all this. (Example: we can't even solo giants till 44. What's up with that? 10 levels higher than they are) But if someone at Verant is reading this, please, please, please consider it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rhasinfirestorm>Rhasin Firestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 727<br> <font color=#333333>(5/22/02 11:05:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Some major changes need to be made...</span><hr size=1> Sebor,<br>
<br>
Soloing power really really really depends on what you are fighting more than how strong you are. I don't know if there are any classes other than Necromancers and perhaps Shadowknights that solo giants well at 44. <br>
<br>
Not only that, but soloing strength and tactics differ from class to class. Necro's fearkite in most wide open places. Magicians can solo harder things by chain casting pets. Bards can solo red cons by charming, or by outright kiting with chants or other AoE/DD songs.<br>
<br>
Besides that, not every class has to solo well to be an extremely potent force in the world. Enchanters, for example, are quite powerfull with their spellset, and contribute.. a ton of damage to any situation through their abilities. However, they don't solo well in many situations (rather, not as well as a Necromancer does, per sae). <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886">Rhasin Firestorm</A><BR>

Chucking the exp penalty out altogether would help that, since I've still (at 40th lvl) gotten msgs saying that my pet is taking exp from the grp, so the grp doesn't want you.<br>
<br>
There are many issues to mage class balance, and soloing ability should be one of the criteria we should be balanced against other soloing classes with, but it shouldn't be the difinitive one.<br>

Alan said that Magicians <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> were/are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> one of the top soloing classes <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> at lower levels</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.

Well pre-kunark and even after kunark magicians were very good soloers. Now we are middle of the pack, but I have found some very good spots to solo that have helped to get me to lvl 59.  I can not solo everywhere but who can, and really there are so few good solo areas for &quot;solo classes&quot; to do any more that the solo part of the game is really fading.  It is a shame that people solo in places like Velks because it is better experience and easier then alot of the new outdoor zones. Velks is over run with solo places and it really sucks. Most of the monks on my server that have epics have sol b camped non-stop. Most monks cannot solo in ME or Fungus grove so they are forced to solo in old word dungeons.<br>
<br>
Making pets better will help soloing somewhat BUT if they don't remove the experience penalty and leave the heal spells as is then we going to be no better off solo then we are now. I really don't want my pet doing so much damage &quot;solo&quot; that it outdamages me on kills. On the same note I do want pets upgraded.  The experience penalty is a big problem and really needs to be looked at. <br>

<br>
&quot;There are some classes that are quite good at soloing, however.  Both the magician and necromancer classes get pet spells which allow them to summon an elemental or skeleton respectively. ... Other classes can solo to some extent, but these four are the champs.&quot;<br>
<br>
I left out the sections about the druid and shaman.  This block clearly shows, even after Velious, VI either wanted, or realized Mages are one of the top soloers.  But unfortunately they haven't kept it that way, or it was only really PERCIEVED anyways, and not as true as they thought.<br>
<br>
So that's where VI said that Mages were one of the top soloers Rhion.<br>

Mages want snare/root so they can solo like Wizards/Druids.  They want better pet heals.  They want more powerful nukes.  They want pet XP penalty removed.  Do the people that make these request think about the overall picture?<br>
<br>
Take away the pet XP penalty and what do you have?  A magician that sicks his pet on something, doesnt even nuke, at most casts 1 heal or just chain summons his pet.  Whats the risk or the cost in that?  A stack of Malachites.... damn, thats so tough on the Magician class.  If people didn't exploit AFK camping, then perhaps Verant would do something about the pet XP penalty.  But as long as Magicians will exploit the AFK camping ability, Verant sees no reason to remove the penalty, and let those ppl get so much reward for the lack of risk involved.<br>
<br>
Give mages snare/root and we become even more powerful, and again you take away the risk and up the reward.  I agree that having a mob kill your pet and having Gate as the only true escape is tough, but how much do you people want handed to you on a silver platter?  Try to think outside the box for a second... if Verant gave these things to the Magician class it would be unbalanced... and then other classes would complain, those other classes would get upgrades or Magicians would get nerfs.  This class is never going to be happy no matter what Verant does if you expect to have everything handed to you.<br>
<br>
Yes, I play a magician.  Yes, i find it frustrating at times.  But the game is no fun nor exciting if everything is so easy.  Bloodgills at lvl 45-51 were a joke... 1% risk for the reward of gaining 1 level in a matter of 8-9 hours played (average playtime per day).  So, after 50, Magicians aren't the soloers that they were pre-50.  There has to be a point where the balance takes place... sadly, Verant doesn't know how to spread that over 60 levels, and instead just drops it at level 50, and causes outrage from the players.  I thought 1-50 was relatively easy.  Now 51-60 is tougher, but I can accept that since it would be a waste of my time to have 60 straigh levels of easy experience and little risk.  Some things need work -- Epic quest timesinks, pet damage at the last 5 levels, pet damage mitigation and ATK levels so that we can use our offensive tools on high end mobs.  Giving us snare or root, or taking away the XP penalty so that lazy individuals can exploit it are not things I want Verant to be focusing on for the Magician class. <p><p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7621>Chakkolio<a/><BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uchakkolio.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Chakkolio</A> at: 5/23/02 7:05:27 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimaginos9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Imaginos9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 455<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 7:58:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Some major changes need to be made...</span><hr size=1> Wez, <br>
<br>
I totally agree. I started playing eq a bit before kunark and had a great time even after kunark came out and I found myself a bit weaker then prekunark.<br>
<br>
The pet penalty needs to be gone. The comment Alan made about mages was I belive during the first round of class balance talks and recently the same kind of statement in the second round.<br>
<br>
I still don't see how we are top soloers when we suffer this exp penalty yet no other class does for using thier prime abilities...except the poor beastlords.<br>
<br>
Wizards dont suffer a 50% hit when they snare more then one mob at a time, nor do druids.  You don't see that Monk getting a 50% hit when he uses bind wounds and FD to solo.  I don't see that Ranger getting a -50% exp adjustment when he snares and shoots that bow <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  etc....<br>
<br>
The fact that it also detracts from mages getting groups and forcing many to solo is another huge point. The penalty should be removed.<br>

do wizards get penalize by quading? <br>
do druids get penalize by using snare? <br>
do shaman get penalize by using a JBB?<br>
or if a cleric cast heal too many times he makes the xp receive from mob less? <br>

actually I hear it all the time .. but please name some spots that it can be done esp. after the newly pet agro fix ... <br>
<br>
and if you are afraid to get those spots &quot;ruin&quot; for us mages... <br>
please feel free to do so .. and i think most mages would agree with me that we rather have those remove along with the xp penalty. <br>
<br>
The only spot i see with relative safe is the brownie camp in LF ... but there are still roamers of brownie in the zone and it's not 100% safe... also .. epic can still die to soloing 1 of those brownies after buff gone. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Give mages snare/root and we become even more powerful, and again you take away the risk and up the reward.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
ok u keep bringing up RvsR ... tell me what reward we get for having the pet xp panlty?do we get faster xp? <br>
nope .. just any melee with kunark/velious bp can still outsolo me with the exception of rog may be. <br>
<br>
how about shaman solo with JBB and slow ... with sow they are almost 100% safe in any out door zone and they will get more xp than mages even with the pet xp penalty remove in say like a half hour time frame. <br>
What's the RvsR in that.. ?<br>
<br>
Oh .. and the idea of giving mage the spell snare/root I agree it overpowering.. <br>
<br>
but how about summon a 1 charge lore root/snare item that only last for 10-20 seconds... do u think that it will help us solo? I really doubt that it will make a huge of difference in our soloing power. <br>
<br>
and again ... if it's the exploit of parking a pet to get xp over night...<br>
1st of all... the spots are almost all not 100% safe. <br>
2nd of all there are may be 5(again i only know that the brownie camp being remotely one of them) in total of 200 zones in game?<br>
3rd.  may be only like 10 mages out of ALL the population does it... (others rather not risk dead and have missed rez time.. ) .. hardly a big influence in game. <br>
<br>
if you are solely base it on pet park exploit to say mages pet xp penalty is indeed &quot;balance&quot; in the terms of RvR<br>
<br>
should druids/chanter charms be nerf too? <br>
since there is an exploit that you can use it in WW to solo a dragon. <br>
<br>
But since you fail to mention any of those and didn't even give reason for why it's overpowering for mage to have xp penalty remove .. i feel that you <br>
1) either don't know the game too well <br>
or 2) just picking bones with mages.. <br>
<br>
SO which one are u? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> if Verant gave these things to the Magician class it would be unbalanced<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
again i fail to see why pet xp penalty removed is imbalance... <br>
and if you are just referring to the mage wanting the actual spell of snare/root ... I totally agree that's overpowering ..<br>
<br>
but while a summoned root/snare item that only last for 10-20 seconds is not overpower. <br>
<br>
Oh and on the thoughts that giving &quot;class spells&quot; to other class would upset them ALOT.. <br>
what do u think mages feel when summon throwing knife was  given to rogs? shrunken to monks?<br>
or bandages on a dagger? <br>

<br>
These mobs are designed to scale to full groups of approximately equal level.  Were it the case that any one class could consistently solo these mobs, it would eliminate the need for other classes except for (1) convenience and (2) certain types of non-conventional encounters.  Scaling the other classes up to match would be even more disasterous.<br>

If you want to solo evens your entire life, I encourage you to purchase a first person shooter... or Dark Age of Camelot.<br>

<br>
The point was not &quot;how many gorangas can a mage pet kill&quot;.  Not at all.  The point is &quot;How much experience can a mage get with his basic tools in a given time, vs. another class&quot;.<br>
<br>
Have you ever watched a skilled necro root and dot a stack of mobs?  I've watched a 60 necro &quot;quad&quot; 4 mobs at once in ME.  What did he do?  He rooted 4 gorangas, snared them, and liched while he dotted the hell out of them.  After they all dropped I asked him what his mana was, he replied (I @#%$ you not) &quot;svnty dude&quot;.  70% mana.  He killed 4 mobs, he's ready to go, and he got full experience.<br>
<br>
I play a monk, if you didn't figure that out.  Unbuffed I can usually take out a goranga follower or lookout, forget the harder ones, in straight up melee.  This leaves me with pretty low life, and I need to burn a stack of bandaids to fill up.  I do get full experience for my kills though.  A mage can surely kill them faster than me, but I doubt twice as fast..which is what he would have to do to keep up with experience over time.<br>
<br>
I'm a pretty good puller, if I do say so myself, and I still get the occasional add when I yank gorangas.  Feign and stand, clear aggro, try again.  A magician doesn't have this luxury, he gets to zone out and start over, new pet new buffs all that jazz.  It's cumbersom and risky and slow.<br>
<br>
<br>
ooooon the other hand, let's say we both decided to take out one of the goranga hunters.  My method: Melee it to about 60% and run around like a damn fool regenning life, waiting for mend, and jousting it.  Mage's method: Heal the pet 2-3 times and drop a couple rains on it.  In my humble monkly opinion, that is a very valuable soloing skill: The ability to take out something much more difficult than another supposedly better soloing class is able.<br>
<br>
Your pets are getting tougher, that's a step in the right direction.  If you would wait and let it pan out, it just might end up such that you can kill mobs twice as fast as the rest of us again, and then your penalty is once again justified....in addition to being able to take out significantly more difficult mobs all by yourself...<br>

Fewd for thought.<br>

... u never seen how easy it is for shaman/necro/druid (with epic or not) to solo any of the the non summon mob that give mage a headache even with epic? <br>
... i.e. even with epic ... i found the named snakes in Grey a bit tough .. while a druid/necro/shaman can kill 2 without breaking too much a sweat.. (it's uber evil for what a necro can do to undeads.. = P )<br>
<br>
sooo we can't kill the harder ones too .... just for the ones we are able to kill we do kill them faster tho. <br>
<br>
even with the pet penalty .. i still don't think we can solo as well as the &quot;top&quot; solo classes.... <br>

a druid with epic early at 50 can kill a lvl 47ish mob ... while if a mage get a epic at 52ish .. have mroe trouble of killing that mob i bet. <br>

<br>
I simply thought that the implicit suggestion in<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Magicians are supposed to be one of the better soloing classes. Yet we cannot solo something until it is about 5-10 levels under us throughout the 30's,40's and 50's.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> was that mages should be able to solo mobs from 0-5 levels under them throughout the 30's, 40's and 50's.<br>
<br>
As I said, I think that's absurd.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
I will throw this out there:<br>
<br>
Of the caster classes, pet classes (including DC enchanters) have the unique ability of being able to solo mobs that summon.  It's a case of lose some here, gain some there.  Pet classes can tear through greens, and can defeat very high /cons with some skill.  Druids and Wizards can quadkite, Shamans and Necros can root-dot lower blues.<br>
<br>
But I doubt that a cleric-wizard team can do the plate cycle in Kael's Iceshard house, whereas  Magician-(DC) Enchanter, (DC) Enchanter-Cleric and Magician-Cleric teams can.<br>
-----<br>
<br>
While I still think some changes need to be made to the ultra-high end mage game, I think that people really need to start playing more to their strengths than to their weaknesses.<br>

<br>
um.. not entirely true.. <br>
I have try numerous times try to solo the deep craven lotus in FG ... <br>
<br>
and everytime i &quot;try&quot; to chain my pet .... at the instant i use &quot;/pet get lost&quot; and the faction of second before my new pet comes out ... it summons my butt... <br>
<br>
and spell's interrupted because of that... <br>
<br>
i tried it like like 4-5 times before giving up .... <br>
everytime it happenned being my spell interruppted. <br>
However, i can stilll get gate out thanks to chanelling focus. <br>
<br>
anyhow... may be it's because the lotus is perma rooted..<br>
may it could work better with a movable mob... which i didn't try... <br>
<br>
but just saying .. killing a summoning mob is a much dependent on luck if the mob will summon u right after ur pet get lost or not. <br>
(since you will be his primary agro target at that point)<br>

<br>
there of course are things that mage can od that others cannot... <br>
and there are even more what a mage cannot do and toehr classes can. <br>
<br>
e.g. a mage cannot solo lodzi.... <br>
a mage cannot solo gore.. <br>
5 mages cannot kill gore with 100 aa each .. <br>
<br>
so if you are to point out what mages can and others can't do .... if you compare the list &quot;what others can and mages can't&quot; .. i think the <br>
&quot;what others can and mage can't list&quot; would be a lot longer.. <br>
<br>
and in general .. alot of the other classes can get xp faster(much faster) than mages is bad... <br>
and how many people taking mages into groups is even worse... <br>
<br>
oh and back to your example where mage/cleric can do some spawns where a rog/rog cannot .... <br>
so..? i bet u can't slow with that combo like shaman/monk too.... must realize that duos doesn't represent how &quot;good&quot; 1 class is .. but the &quot;compatibility&quot;(?) of the 2 class.. <br>
<br>
i.e. clerics and chanter are nice and important class right? <br>
but they don't work well in duos....<br>

What should matter is the outcome, which is, for instance, how many exp-giving mobs can a class PRACTICALLY solo per hour. Theoretical arguments a-la &quot;the pet is like an extra party member, so if it does most of the work, it should take a share of the exp&quot; have no place when discussing exp penalties.<br>
<br>
The pet is not a party member, it's an ability integral to our class. Part of our offense and defense is built into the pet. That's why we don't have defense in the form of root, and that's why our nuke offense is weaker than a wizard's and even a druid's.<br>
<br>
The absurdity of the &quot;pet as party member&quot; argument can be seen even more clearly as follows. Instead of &quot;duoing&quot; with his pet, let the magician truly &quot;solo&quot; an exp-giving mob, without his pet. Let's take guesses on who will win, shall we!! It's clear that the pet cannot be seen as a party member, but as an integral part of the powers of the magician. Shamen and necros can solo without their pets, but magicians simply can't.<br>
<br>
Back to the point of how many mobs we can solo per hour vs other soloing classes.<br>
<br>
If we don't nuke, the fight lasts longer, we definitely get hit with the exp penalty, and the pet gets hurt. If we heal it to pull again quickly, we use a lot of mana, which leads to downtime. If we don't heal it and wait for the pet to regen, we have downtime. If we nuke to preserve pet health, we shorten the fight, but use up mana, which leads to downtime. The more we nuke, the bigger our chance of avoiding the exp penalty, but the longer the downtime that follows.<br>
<br>
WITH OR WITHOUT the exp penalty, there is no way of getting around the fact that a solo magician can apply his mana bar or his time investment to only one mob at a time (unlike wizards, druids, shamen), and there is no way of getting around the fact that our kills cause serious downtime (unlike necros, shamen, monks, rangers)<br>
<br>
Are magicians really twice as effective, when measured in 100% exp giving kills per hour, than wizards, druids, shamen, necros, monks and rangers? There's no way that this can be true.<br>
<br>
Hybrids used to have an exp penalty to compensate for their supposed &quot;advantage&quot; over pure casters or pure melees. That penalty is now gone. Like some hybrids, magicians can nuke, tank and melee, but unlike them, we can't snare, root, stun, FD or heal. <br>
<br>
The exp penalty for magicians should go too. <p><CENTER>
