<br>
FYI...this is NOT a &quot;men&quot; rant...in fact the majority of my friends in RL ARE men...I have always hung out with men, just get along with them better than most women.  <br>
<br>
But are there like a LOT of sexist assholes running around in the EQ world or something?  This is NOT a Rhetorical question, this IS my question!   And BTW, ALL men HERE and in game that I have met (with the exception of TWO) are TOTALLY cool...I am NOT complaining about EQ men in general.  <br>
<br>
I can't find the thread now, but in a topic where someone posted about research to me, a poster, EcIspe (sp?) posted something to the effect...that in HIS (and I am almost positive that s/he/it WOULD be a man to say something both so stupid AND so SEXIST at the SAME TIME) opinion I would not be AS welcome here if I were a teenage male as opposed to a woman, and that THIS (me, I suppose) was too good to be true.<br>
<br>
Now WTClusterF is up with that kinda attitude?  <br>
<br>
I actually emailed him (since the thread was closed and I could not RESPOND there) and AKSED him if he was just amazed that a WOMAN (of ALL creatures) had the ability to connect to the internet and TYPE or something...If he thought that I was just SO special to be one out of BILLIONS of women in the world to be able to buy a video game, TYPE, write in English to a board filled with people of similar interest of a hobby of mine, maybe?<br>
<br>
Now maybe I am being a little OVERSENSITIVE here?   DUE to my past, I COULD be and this is why...<br>
<br>
1.   I am very well educated (I have a doctorate in Divinity, a Master's in Art History and two undergraduate degrees...double major in Art History in Psychology).  I don't really USE my education, per say...because I am stuck in the wilderness (due to my husbands job, who works for his father's corporation...so we have a limited number of places to live) and have no Art Museum to work at, etc.  Now, I DO write a lot for religious freedom and tolerance FROM here, but that is about it.  I PRACTICE as a clinical herbalist (just part time) and that I am CERTIFIED in (but requires no degree in Nutrition, due to the fact that I already HAD a B.A.).<br>
<br>
2.  Yet EVEN at the age of 30 AND at the level of education that I have (and YES, I am aware that this could very well have to do with my casual attitude AND always keeping the perfect manicure, being blond, really being absent minded a lot of times, whatever) I DO (and always HAVE) get treated like a bimbo. <br>
<br>
I go to a dinner party and people start discussing say...Aesthetics.  I get this pat on the back and somebody telling me...&quot;Oh, BTW...this is a branch of philosophy that deals with the theory of beauty&quot;  Well, NO @#%$?! (eyeroll).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I am rambling and I KNOW, I am VERY well aware of the fact that MOST men are PHYSICALLY stronger than women.  I don't care if some man wants to help me carry a 50 lb.  box of clay (literally, like for sculpture)  hey, a man doing it for me, me and another woman....whatever gets it to the car...I would help them too if they had more packages than they could carry at once, etc.   I don't care if a MAN (as opposed to a woman) wants to help me AND I don't care if it is a MAN or a WOMAN is in need of MY help. <br>
<br>
I don't CARE what age they are EITHER (an immature teenager, a child, an elderly person).  If they need help and *I* can help, have the time to, etc.  I will.  I am not just talking about about EQ and message boards either (but INCLUDING them).<br>
<br>
Yet some of the attitude I see around EQ is that MEN can deal with it themselves but if a woman shows up, watch out, she is CLUELESS and must be given direction.  Now, yes I AM clueless in EQ.  I am clueless in GAMES.  Hell, I am clueless in a LOT of stuff by far that has nothing to DO with games (I can't even change a tire), EQ, online stuff, etc.  I ALSO appreciate all of the advice and DIRECTION that people here have given me, if I did not WANT it, I would not be asking questions on a message board...and I don't care if the questions I ask are answered by a man OR a woman.  I don't care if it is a man OR a woman that I get into a disussion with.  But apparently to SOME people around  it makes ALL the difference in the world.<br>
<br>
But if it IS just because I am a woman that people are being helpfull and if I were a MAN would be treated DIFFERENTLY, then someone PLEASE explain to me WHY that IS in the EQ world...because I just do NOT get it!   <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><font face="garamond" size=3><b><b>What is a cynic?

You know what...you are right!  I have to remember that GAMES probably mean a LOT of kids (or teenagers).  I will just  let the immature crap roll off my back....I am not used to being around immature people, but I can certainly underdstand that it exists in teenagers and why and ignore it rather than let it annoy me. <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><font face="garamond" size=3><b><b>What is a cynic?

ROTFLMAO!  Can I declare this as quote of the day?<br>
<br>
*edit*<br>
<br>
Actually, I KNOW (or assume rather) that there WOULD be a lot of kids/teens playing games (it IS a GAME afterall) but I did read (and I don't know how true it is) that the average age of EQ players was around 27.  That combined with the fairly intilligent writing of most people (HERE at least) just kind of made this equivocal dumbassedness bother me.<br>

Thats life, welcome to reality.<br>
<br>
As for your edumacation (spelled inccorectlly for effect) it means perciselly jack and @#%$. You don't have a serious education, art history? thats not a &quot;real&quot; education unless your going into the NBA. And while education for educations sake  is valid to me for the sake of personal fulfillment, using it as justification for your arrogance is laughable to those of us that actually have a real education.<br>
<br>
Women are treated differently in EQ and in RL, its just the way it is I could go into a long diatribe about contributing genetic and social factors but not really much point. If you want to be a stand up broad (just KIDDING) then thats cool, personally I admire people that stand on there own feet in the face of assured adversity. <br>
<br>
It should also be noted that the rather idealized avatars tend to put images of rather attractive women into the heads of men, who lets face it, rarely see the light of day or see the smiling face of an attractive woman. Men tend to treat attractive women very well and ugly women very poorly /shrug, I can't comment to your RL relations but in game your dealing from a position of near ultimate strength. In the end theres no point in getting upset over it cause that just makes you look like a bitch regardless of how fair that assesment is.<br>
<br>
I got a funny story to tell actually might put the situation in prospective.<br>
<br>
When I was in college (being the oft ultra-nice guy I was) I was leaving the library one day and saw a women of moderate to good physical appeal she was carrying a huge stack of books so I stood for a good 10 seconds at the door holding it open till she got there, at which point, in what I can only assume was a PMS driven rant, began to breate me for holding the door as a male blah blah blah, the whole exchange was really quite odd, so as she started to pass threw the door I tripped her, her books went everywhere, and when she turned to look at me with her look of death I said &quot;what? its what I would have done to a guy that just yelled at me for holding a door open&quot;.<br>
<br>
Dean of my school saw me about that, he didn't see the humour /shrug everyone else did.<br>

I think you missed my point.  I was using my education as an example of HOW it bothers me when people try to explain philosophy to me in baby talk at dinner parties when I obviously AM educated ENOUGH to understand the concept yet I am a woman (so you know, we must be clueless), nothing more....no arrogance, just fact of why I MAY be oversensitive to the situation...which I DO admit MAY be the case.  Sorry, if you find Art History insignifigant too.  To ME our cultural world history, progression and human expression is VERY important...and a HUGE key to understanding the civilied world, JMO.<br>

Same can be said for women to, well sort of :&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Education represnts knowledge, knowledge can HELP lead to wisdom, but it aint no guarantee!<br>
<br>
Problem I always had, and still do to a lesser extent, is that when you meet a nice, fun intelligent woman you are friendly with, desire, physical/romantic or both can appear, and generally the brain goes out the window. That can be a nuisance, as you get older there's less of that but it can get in the way of a lot of relationships.<br>
<br>
Yeah I've known idiot women too, some one gets lippy for me for holding a door open I let em know they are snooty gits, and that common courtesy has bugger all to do with sexism but consideration for others, which they aint got, probably cause they have been too busy licking their nuts/nipples all day :&gt;<br>
Only role I hoenstly dotn liek women doing is frotn line soldiering, call me a reactionary chavanist if ya like :&gt; But I dont liek anyone doing grunt work, least of all a female who can carry life. Not that they can't, just I don't liek it. As for women being officers (boardroom or combat), administrators, technical staff, military police etc, why not? <br>
<br>
Society is very silly, it's uttelry idiotic that women dont get the same pay as men, and the fact is they don't. Soem jobs men and women *ar beter suited to than the other sex*, so the ultra feminissts can shove that in thir pipe and smoke it :&gt; <br>
WOmen are great at multi-tasking, long term light work and personal relationships, this makes owmen ideal administrators, wether that's business executive or politician.<br>
Men are great at single focused tasks, we may have unusal skills or deficiencies, and short, hard physical labour is what our frames are suited for. The later is of less use nowadays, the former is best used when dedication to task is vital, such as research.<br>
<br>
These are BIOLOGICALLY hardwired into us but are *general rules*, they do now mean that either sex is incapble or second rate at what the other is biologically adapted for, but rather that there is less chance of them having those qualities.<br>
For too long women were relegated to be &quot;breeding virgins&quot; and men &quot;stupid sheep for slaughter&quot; *sigh*<br>
WOemn rightly have anger about what was done to them, but..MEN SHOULD BE ANGRY TOO! men were exploited, taught and indoctrinated to be stupid, drunken, violent, unthinking, easily manipulated boors. I'm not joking. The past few hundred years, while slavery and the end of feudalism changed much, at the same time, the power hungry, regardless of regime, by religion, politics, economics advertising made men have an attitude of unthinking obedience, unflintching in the face of pain, of hardship..of being slaves...<br>
<br>
I still see the damn remnants of that here. Scots always did have a reputation as being &quot;hard sods&quot; but it was exploited cleverly so we became ideal slaves in the shipyards, coalmines and corpses for the machine gunners. Meanwhile the women folk had to put up with dreadful abuse and being deprived of personal ambition and goals. One person earlier posted about how their father worked four jobs..hello! excuse me! That's called BEING A SLAVE AND BEING ABUSED! <br>
<br>

ITA agree that men are better suited for some tasks and women for others.  I am not angry at *men* (or anyone else for that matter) for being paid less, etc.  yes, it is annoying but I don't really GAFF about money, so...ya know.  Not an issue for *me* personally.  God knows I could NEVER be a firefighter (not that I would to be anyway) because I simply do NOT have the physical strength to carry a 250 lb.  person down three flights of stairs, etc.  I don't have a problem with THAT either.  Who cares?  Well, I guess some do, but I don't.<br>
<br>
The ONLY thing that I have a problem with is people seeing *woman* and not *me.*  People that I TALK to and comunicate with for DAYS over a similar interests and still a random *woman* NOTHING MORE.  Sigh...such is life, I guess.   <br>

that's one of the nice things about online, the anonimity, or persona you represent, is less affected by stereo typing.<br>
I know several folk I play EQ with are men, but have female avatars, so I treat their online persona   more as a female, in regards to /hugs and roleplaying, but that's the persona i'm interacting with, not the person. It takes ages to get to know a person, and if the persona they have online wishes to be treated or regarded in a specific way they can ask but usually dotn need to because their persona explains their wishes for interactions, if you see what I mean.<br>
<br>
you can't help but act to women and men in differeing ways because we ARE different, in general. problem comes when it's predjudicial or stupid. I was brought up to be kind and curteous to people, especially women and older folk. I hold doors open for anyone, but if it's a cute lady, I reserve the right to have a msichievous twinkle in my eye! :&gt;<br>

I would tend to agree with this.  I don't know much about men grasping GAMES as opposed to women...but I DO know that men TEND to be better at technical stuff (like programming VCR's etc).  Maybe genetic, maybe because of growing up DOING that kind of stuff MORE than women, who knows?<br>

  I always found it SO odd that women can WELD better than men.  I though it was SO weird in art school that men working on metal sculpture had SUCH a hard time and women could just DO it....yet most WELDERS are men...hmmm.   LOL, it finally hit me one day that we have smaller fingers and that MUST be why can manipulate welding details so well.  <br>
<br>
In any case, I have led WAY too serious of a life...and games are a REFRESHING change of pace.  ROTF...I don't know if EQ was one to START OUT with...but it was the only one that I read about and though sounded like it would be AMAZING fun.  It is too.

Yea, if they are posted, someone please post the link.  I want to see how rare a WOMAN is, LOL!  Is EQ mainly men, or something?  Not that I care....I adore men (EXCEPT for SEXISTS or RACISTS) ;-) but it would be interesting to see who all plays...by age and gender. <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><font face="garamond" size=3><b><b>What is a cynic?

Like, if you look at men and women in  crowded streets, notice hwo they react to folk around them, women often bump into folk because they are not so spacially aware.<br>
<br>
i *think* women have steadier hands though, not sure on that though. may have picked that  info up wrong and can't honestly remember the details.<br>
<br>
hey I never knew that about welding and women! Well never met any female welders is why :&gt; used to do welding years ago (got flashed too much and gave it up, UV sensitive eyes now, pfft)<br>
Call me weird but I always liked the patterns the metal made on a really broad weld, the ripples, you know?<br>
<br>
Hm what type of welding, MIG or old fashioned arc? Never used MIG sure looked nice to work with though, tried TIG, ugh, that's hellish!<br>
