Now I wonder, is Najena fun? or Upper Guk? And finally CT?<br>
<br>
Karanas I heard a lot of, but got bored the one time I travelled through it, it was just so big and boring and running and running and running and..you get the picture. Guess I am wrong about that though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Would appreciate a comment on Najena at least.<br>

You're a little low for CT still.  You might be able to make it in the courtyard.  Best to wait until you're 25.  The alligators in CT drop the focus items too, but you won't be able to take them unless you're in a group around 30.<br>
<br>
UpperGuk would be good if you don't mind killing frogs (and who does?) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's a great dungeon! There's never anybody there, which is either a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your point of view.<br>
<br>
Like any dungeon, you need to &quot;learn the ropes&quot; though. At 20 you could probably solo tentacle terrors and ogre guards, I think those will both still give you experience.<br>
<br>
If you have a group or partner, try the goblin 3 camp, the black widows, or Bonecracker. Gain a few levels, then try your hand at the guard captain, or the witches. Rathyl and Najena are both tough, because they're guarded by magicians and, well, magicians kick ass. Drelzna isn't nearly so bad, though she has a nasty harm touch.<br>
<br>
By the way, if you're back in the spider/goblin area, and you see the widowmistress, stay far away. Her aggro radius is HUGE and she is very high level (like 40, I think.)<br>
<br>
Upper Guk can be tough. You generally will want a snarer of some sort. There's rarely anybody there, either. Plus, Guk is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> huge</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> dungeon and it's very easy to get lost there.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule is probably a little too high level for you, but you might have some luck near the zone or courtyard. I wouldn't go there until the high 20s.<br>
<br>
You could try where <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> spent my low 20s, but you'll need a partner or group: Permafrost. Was it fun? Yes. Was the loot good? Yes. Was it difficult? Very. Nobody goes here either.<br>
<br>
You could try Befallen, but it's also very difficult and the loot really sucks. For this reason, nobody goes there either.<br>
<br>
At your level, you have a veritable smorgasbord of dungeons you can visit. But, you probably noticed that I said &quot;nobody goes&quot; to these five dungeons. Where do they go? South Karana aviaks, Lake Rathetear aviaks, Unrest, and Mistmoore. Mistmoore yard trash is good stuff, but the trains are deadly and constant. Unrest is also good stuff, but the trains here are also deadly and constant. You'll need a group in both dungeons. Aviaks you can solo, but they are popular and always camped. <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 36th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unefariusgnome.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nefarius Gnome</A> at: 11/15/00 2:02:52 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=waldenawildfyre>Waldena Wildfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(11/18/00 12:14:17 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Re:</span><hr size=1> At 20 i went to Cazic.  Was always a CY group when i went there and thats some great xp with good puller/healer.  If ya got a really good CY group you could try to go inside maze and pull to a place there.  a few good places in there to pull to.  You can stay in a group thatpulls from maze till like after 25 (27 max ithink) but xp might be better in Gator pits.  once ya get 30 Fourcourners group is great till 34.  Never did TR much so not sure the levels or xp for that.  Top of 4corners is also good.  I did 30 inless then 1day in FC (four corners) with a good puller (non-stop usually leaves b4 guy ya killing is dead..need good group though).  Ya can do 20-24 in CY in a week or less depending on how much you play.<br>
<br>
if your looking for xp..then Cazic it is<br>
<br>
BTW: I was doing CY when server was still not that old (tribunal) think i started begining at november last year maybe (server came up august 17th last year).  Friend who made a twink said he went there at 20 and there wasnt a CY group any of the time he was there...so dont know..might depend on server age.<br>
<br>
PS: Cazic is also a fun zone to play in, never really got bored like some xp places do to ya <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=waldenawildfyre>Waldena Wildfyre</A> at: 12/4/00 6:40:49 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Kalamos</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(12/5/00 10:09:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Najena &amp; upper Guk &amp; Cazic Thule</span><hr size=1> I'd say you're a bit low for Cazic IMHO.  Sure you can fight in the courtya4rd but if a train comes through to the zone your already low HPs wont carry you very far as you're getting smacked for max damage.  I'd say Cazic is better for 25-35.  I would suggest getting one of the Aviak Guard spawns in Lake Rathe.  Great exp and they drop the occasional bronze weapon.  Stay there to 22 then head to Lake of Ill Omen in Kunark.  That place is a lot of fun for Mages for both grouping and solo.  Tons of stuff to fight, loot is decent and the exp will rack up fast.  Bring your lvl 24 spells with you cause you will level quickly.  I stayed there until around lvl 26 then I hit Cazic.  Another choice when you get to the mid to high 20's would be Dalnir .. that dungeon is awesome.<br>

at 20 go to SK(south karana) and get in the treant groups, the treants will POWER LVL up to 30-31, whatever you want to stay too, then go to HPK(High Pass Keep) and hunt there to 34-35(in the very bottom room, think its the warrior or raider room or something like that) Next, go to either lower guk, or sol b, this is the slowest exp out of the total lvling you will do,do this till 39, then(must have torch of alna to do this) go to WC(druid ring) or EC(the pillar with the druids) and kill the druids there, you can solo them, send pet(FIRE) heal till 1 is almost dead, then nuke that one till it dies, then just heal pet and let it solo the other to brake the spawn, your pet must be the 2nd or toughest pet you can solo on that lvl, I think they hit for 38 or 40, stay here till 41 and head to the ridge in the Overthere, YOU WILL GAIN LVLS LIKE ANYTHING ITS SO EASY TO SOLO, but watch out for the guards that roam there. Stay there till 44, get pets, head over to Rathe Mountains(should have JBoots for this part) if you dont have JBoots dont woory, solo the troll guards there, kill the SK(shadow knight)(male) first, if you kill the woman shaman first when she starts to run, she runs over towards the SK and he will help out!, if you got the JBoots, its HG hunting time, just pull with malise let the fire pet do  a bit and nuke till dead, its wicked exp and loot, now at 47 GOTO DL(dreadlands) and solo everthing except Ravishings,widows, mountains gaint steeps, and that white dragon(lol)(JK) on 49 you can kill everything in DL EXCEPT THE DRAGON!!! she hits for 750 and summons(dont attempt to solo untill Verant puts the lvl limit to lvl 75 and you are 75 heh) thats my guide from 20-49!!! laterz! <p>-=Azzadan Elementalist=-

HHK is good from low to high 20s, but after ya hit 29 or 30 cazic is faster.  Did 30 in cazic in one day (not 24hours, took about 8hours or less).  THen i would stay in cazic till 34, its faster then HHK.  at 34 i would not go to lguk or solb.  XP there is slow and it sometimes takes hours to get into a group.  Kedge Keep is alot faster from 34-39 and it is barely ever campped.  I have never personally hunted druids, but because there is only a certain # of them, after they are dead you will probably be at full mana a while before they repop.  Because of this i would recommend going to overthere right at 39 because there will be monsters ready to be killed whenever you are ready (which is almost non stop with a firepet). <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showPrevMessage?topicID=101.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showNextMessage?topicID=101.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=101.topic&index=7><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.threadControl?topicID=101.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=101.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=101.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill>The Hunt</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM DEFAULT AD SCRIPT -->
