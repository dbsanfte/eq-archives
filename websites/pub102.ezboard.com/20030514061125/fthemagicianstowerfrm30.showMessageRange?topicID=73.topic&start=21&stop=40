I can't seriously imagine a 55  level mage who is at 177 in hp/ac gear.<br>
<br>
You see the issue with the group buff being a joke is simple, not everyone at a raid needs or would even find a DS useful, at 9 aaxp points you think thats reasonable or balanced?<br>
<br>
I know all about tailoring thank you, 227 in it. I seriously doubt any serious tailor can't get there int up to 255 already.<br>
<br>
That whole section on mana that you wrote is so incredibly convoluted I can't even really comment other then to say the following:<br>
<br>
1) I said nothing about our mana regen ability compared to the enchanters. Enchanters rarely use mana in a directly offensive way which is why that ability is not &quot;nessecarilly&quot; to powerful. Having said that comparing an instant 3.5k mana gain(yes 3.5k, most enchanters who get this skill will have AT LEAST this amount) to 1440 mana gained with serious penalties is a little daft.<br>
<br>
Lets look at it this way,<br>
Enchanter pays 5 aaxp pts, to gain the ability to recover up to 3.5k mana instantly every 144 minutes.<br>
<br>
Mages pay 18 aaxp pts, to be able to become kos to everything gain 4 mana/tick for up to 36 mins for a grand total gain of 1440 mana, this ability is only usable once every 72 minutes and fades if you zone, die, or are charmed. This ability is also one of 4 on the same timer so while you use this one, you cannot use the other 3 for a potential cost 18 aaxp points for an ability that you can use on average(counting that you use all four abilities equally and use it as soon as it pops EVERY time) 1/8th of the time.<br>
<br>
Do note however that I never said there was anything wrong with the enchanter ability and I fully realize that they for the most part already have as much mana as there going to use. In fact many enchanters consider this ability useless, and many others say that its only useful after rez.<br>
<br>
What I did compare(because you compared them previously) was the wizard familiar(level 60 version) which provides 4 mana per tick for a setup cost of 600 mana, the associated ability of improved familer(9aaxp points) which renders it immune to ALL spells to the above power.<br>
<br>
Goladus do you play a wizard? do you have any idea what your talking about? as per usual you talk about things you obviously have no idea about. Wizards pretty much blow right up to 59, if you haven't played one don't comment.<br>
<br>
I have yet to see you bring up in a half assed valid argument Gol, not a single piece of valid information in a single one of your posts, truly amazing.<br>
<br>
As for my statement about ama's post, it was perfectly justified considering the rather aggressive pointless rant that she posted. Go and read that and tell me where she was being anything but aggressive condescending and rude.<br>
<br>
As for your statements about the fact that you would take these forms if they had NO ASSOCIATED ADVANTAGES AT ALL, and that you would use all these forms doesn't make you rethink your position nothing will.<br>
<br>
I would also appreciate it if you would tell me when exactly you would use all these forms. I am just interested in what situations you might find them useful.<br>
<br>
One last thing, I would appreciate if you would at least tell me what level you are so I can know if your just arguing because your ignorant or your beligurent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zeem>Zeem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 9:19:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Goladus....</span><hr size=1> You totaly missing the point, I love playing a mage, I wouldn't spend over 160 played days if I didn't.<br>
<br>
But it doesn't matter if I love my mage or not, the truth is that our Class skills are very weak and the person that designed them didn't think what they really do.<br>
<br>
Yes, I could be like some of you and /hug Verant and tell them that they did a good job. <br>
<br>
There is also an other issue about dmg shields and mass buff, if your guild know what they are doing very few need dmg shield since they shouldn't be hitted in the first place, if a monk/rogue/ranger gain so much agro that he is getting hit he probaly dies anyway, if he lucky he don't screwup the whole raid and get others killed.<br>
If you guild need fireresist, wouldn't you expect people worked a bit and got Fireresist gear? If you plan on kill a mob that have a bad AE, I really hope that your raidleader made sure that fireresist gear not optional. Noone have any excuses to try and go to a raid against a AE mob with bad resist gear. <br>
Dmg shield help, the fire resist can be usefull, but spending 9point to be able to dmg shield maybe 20 people once every 72mins is a waste. It is not a bad skill, but its usefullness is very limited (not compared to a cleric that can Aego 40 people for 4 peridots, and that last for 2 hours).<br>
<br>
If you don't know why some classes don't want dmg shield you better learn to pay attention better. <br>
<br>
I would also have loved the elemental forms if they was nonkos, lasted 72 mins and they didn't share the same refresh timer. Is that really to much to ask for? I don't think so. <br>
As it is now they are way to expensive for what they give.<br>
<br>
Most of our skills seems good at first look, but then you look closer to them what they really do, you soon notice that that they do very little really.<br>
<br>
There is no class skill that I really look forward to, something that would feel you working toward a goal.<br>
There is no mage skill that give that WOW feeling,  like them a Wizard try his mana burn for the first time or a Druid/Necro/Enchanter charm their first mob, or then a Pally do his first 5k critical hit.<br>
<br>
Is it to much to ask for a skill that would atleast make say a little WOW.<br>
<br>
Maybe you don't care about your mage, but I for one have played to many hours and love my mage way to much to just accept all the junk they throw us. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ublah3.showPublicProfile?language=EN>blah3</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 6:42:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Goladus....</span><hr size=1> To the person who said that mage pets SHOULD be hard to control: you are an idiot.  Pets should not have brains of their own, they should be totally 100 percent under our control at all times.  Verant made our pets victims of pathing and this is the reason we are never allowed to use pets on raids.  When i first started playing a mage I was very dissapointed in the fact that my pet just kind roamed freely around and paced back and forth all the time.  I always thought right from the get go that your pet should be pretty much joined at the hip and if it wanders there should be a /pet get the @#%$ over here command. Then verant goes and gives us a spell to fix it with (summon companion) this should not cost mana imo, its not my fault verant made shitty pathing and they have the nerve to force me to use my own frigging mana to compensate for it.  As far as /pet hold is concerned this is one thing that should have ALWAYS been there.  Again the pathing thing and agro; my pet shouldnt fight unless i want it to period.  I summoned it, I am its master, he should be a mindless dirtball who stands there and gets hit all the time unless i tell him to fight.  And again becasue of verants shitty progamming design for pets I have to spend weeks of my time earning the stupid skill.  Basically they gave them the same programming codes as npc's but they shouldnt be characters at all, they are an extension of me, the mage that summoned them.  Just my opinion, i know it will never change but am I the only one that thinks this? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucullynlc.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cullyn LC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 7:00:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Goladus....</span><hr size=1> Why worry about mana regen? Sure its good for soloing. But so are the new mod rods.. Get a zlan's heart and with new phantom armor. I personally put one skill into regen (was going to max it) but then decided to put 2 points into first aid. So I can bind to 70 percent and regen at 20hp/tick. Just summon a new mod rod and use it and regen back up and so on until fm.<br>
<br>
In a raid situation or during call duty I never run out of mana. I have personally gone from 0 mana to fm in under 2 min using new mod rods with a cleric healing me. Specifics 400 mana to summon. 900hp-&gt;675 mana gets you a net of 275 mana per rod.<br>

<br>
   But, I am disappointed that we get class skills that are: only useful in 1 zone( turn summoned), affect 2 spells( mass group buff), illusions that have a refresh that is twice as long as the effect,  and a skill that is useless for an epic mage( elemental pact). I could also add quick summoning to this list since it doesn't make much of a difference to an epic mage, but I'll just point out that it was listed in the manual as doing something other than what has been reported as doing. <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> You see the issue with the group buff being a joke is simple, not everyone at a raid needs or would even find a DS useful, at 9 aaxp points you think thats reasonable or balanced?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->No, I think for magicians the cost is a bit steep.  However, I think the alternative would be nothing at all.<br>
<br>
Originally, I didn't think magicians were even slated to get this ability.  I distinctly recall being disappointed that we did not have the option to get mass group buff, given that we did have two group buff spells.  It looks like sometime between my initial reading of the ability list and their actual implenentation someone else noticed as well and just flagged this ability for magicians as well.  I think you're under the impression that we lost out on a good ability to get this.. and maybe that's true but I doubt it.  I think it's either we get mass group buff or we get nothing..  <br>
<br>
No, I'm not /hugging verant and such, I disagree with them all the time, and I really like your ideas for Alternate Advancement abilities in the general forum.  Those ideas seem well thought out, useful, and fun for the most part.  What pisses me off is this selfishness and envy present in this thread.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Enchanter pays 5 aaxp pts, to gain the ability to recover up to 3.5k mana instantly every 144 minutes.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Ahh, so I had screwed something up, I thought gather mana was every 72 minutes.  So this ability you are so worked up about is even worse than I thought it was.  In that case the regen from gather mana is more like 2-2.5 mana per tick if you can gather your full mana pool exactly every 144 minutes.  This makes the regen component about equal to enchanters.  <br>
<br>
I mean.. if there really is a problem with the relative AA costs then address it, no need to cry like a baby that enchanters or wizards have a better toy than we do, which is all you have done so far in this thread.  I mean, seriously you are WAY overstating the negatives of this ability... I can't take your complaints seriously and neither will Verant if you don't take two seconds to realize that maybe the limitations on the elemantal forms aren't as bad as you're making them out to be.  <br>
<br>
Now, for familiars?<br>
<br>
Wizards get +4 mana per tick indefinitely for 650 mana.  They can't really use this in AE battles.. when the familiar is killed they'll lose lots of mana(from what I've been told ~half).  This is their level 60 familiar.  Wizards need to spend ability points to make this useful in AE damage situations(which are more common than one might think).  <br>
<br>
Mages get +3 mana per tick, +5 hp per tick, and 24 AC for 2.5 hours at a cost of 325 mana.  This is a level 58 spell.  We need zero AA abilities to make this spell useful for AE fights.  So..  lets see...  Zero AA points vs. like, 9 or something right?  Personally, I gladly trade the extra +1 mana on the familiar for +5 hp.  Maybe you don't, I don't care I consider these two spells fairly balanced with the wizard alt ability and absolutely no abilities from the mage.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm not perfectly happy with mage alt abilities the way they are, but complaining about every little thing and exaggerating the negatives isn't going to help anything.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=milaru>Milaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/02 8:01:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: pet hold dissapointing</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Goladus do you play a wizard? do you have any idea what your talking about? as per usual you talk about things you obviously have no idea about.

Sorry, Wizards Own.  Plain and Simple <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Yea our damage out isn't on par with melee and the rest of the game.  But hell, we are probably one of the best soloing classes in the game.  We can do so much that we set our mind too. <br>
<br>
And I hate comparing classes.  But plain and simple...  So what if Wizards get +3 mana regen from Epic and +4 from their familiar.  Thats great! Wizards need it.  A Mage does not need it as well as a wizard in the normal everyday situation.  Wizards are PURE mana based.  Magicians have a pet to rely on to do their damage.  Magicians don't need as much regen.  Plus they can stash a mod rod 2 for later if they really need it.  <br>
<br>
Mage's have their problems I'm sure just as wizards do.  But don't need to compare the different regen abilities of the class, it's pointless and futile.  <br>
<br>
I've played Everquest for 3 years now.  I know alot about every single class in the game.   Well...maybe except bard songs, they are just a pain.  The whole balance issue between Melee and Casters is items.  And the best way to rebalance the game is for Verant to develop items that enhance the casters the way they did the melee. <br>

Goladus is quite the frequenter of Graffe's and while he isn't a wizard he plainly has a much better grasp on the class than certain others on this board.<br>

You only invalidate your arguements by making such an unknowledgable statement.  Tell the thousands of orphaned Othmir pups how much we blow.  Talk with Venril Sathir, his wife, or Trakanon about the havoc we wreck on there minions AoE style.  Oh sure, we let you guys join in the fun sometimes, but we both know who's doing the real damage in that setting.  I have a friendly term for the mage in my AoE groups; The Gimp.  Someone has to loot while the real nukers med <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I have the utmost respect for the power of mages, and I'm sure that there are some issues with your AA abilities.  Frankly I have some issues with Wizards in some settings, but it's ignorance like this that makes life so much worse for us Wizards.  Make your arguements if you like but keep your asinine opinions to yourself if you want anyone to listen.<br>

<br>
I must come to the aid of my senior guildcousin <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, who has a distinct perspective, and whose advice I value.<br>
<br>
I assume that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet hold</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, as it toggles off <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Attack Mode</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, causes the pet to resume its regular movement mode <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (follow, guard, or sit)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Is this true?  And what is the difference between <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet back off</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet as you were</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?  Seems to me that one ought to combine <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet hold</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> /pet back off</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> into a single hotkey, any reason not to?<br>
<br>
Yes, we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>awesome</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  The more closely I analyze it, the fewer real problems there seem to be.  The <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>utility</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> of rods is simply astounding, even the old style ones.  In 59 levels, I have <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>never</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> felt impotent, useless, or under-powered as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and have <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>always</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> greatly enjoyed being a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  To the extent I have been concerned, mostly it has been <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;over the horizon,&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, at some higher level.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Razamatazz, how much do EZBoard Code Abuse lessons cost?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->First, check out <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.ezboard.com/help/help_howto_useezcodes.html">How to use EZCodes - Tutorial</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.  I find it is best to compose long messages using a text editor like NOTEPAD.  Second, develop a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>style</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  For example, I use <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> italics</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mostly for terms and proper nouns, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> bold</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for headings, and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>underscore</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> for emphasis and tone.  Make extensive use of quote and links.<br>
<br>
I do find the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> class skills <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>weak</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  If <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gets <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mass Group Buff</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then I can certainly make better use of those 9 skill points.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Componentless Summoning</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is something of a misnomer, as you still are required to have at least one malachite on your person.  It frees up maybe 4-5 bag slots.  Perhaps if there were a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>second</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> level of it that was truly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> componentless</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so I could summon <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> whilst naked, I would be excited.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> In fact judging from your post you know very little....are you talking without actually having a clue?

While I do not always agree with <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Aamilae</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, I have learned much from her.  If anything, by resorting to insults and disparagement, it suggests a lack of either intellectual capacity or honesty.  All the arguments you made could have presented without rancor.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I've started to get frusterated with the negitivity that appears on this board so often.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is often a matter of presentation and attitude.

<br>
This is perhaps unfortunately true, and more so with the new <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Rod of Transvergence</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I did some analysis of the utility of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Modulating Rods</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> damage per mana</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> ratio of handing a rod to a nearly <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> OOM</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> cleric supporting a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Main Tank</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in a large raid in a long fight against a single opponent is mid boggling.<br>
<br>
Some <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> find this frustrating.  I do not.  I <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>love</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> my guild, and in turn am <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>loved</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> by them.  I do whatever is needed, and, with patience, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> loots</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fall like the blessed tears of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Karana</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
That being said, one of the main sources of enjoyment for being a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is dealing damage, and in large part from one's pet.  Reasonable people still disagree as to the damage potential of pets.  A definitive analysis has yet to be produced.<br>

<br>
<br>
Um. No. Take your foot out of your mouth.<br>
<br>
As others, I don't really care for discussion about Wizard/Mage balance issues. Both classes are fun and have their places. <br>
<br>
Wizards only suck if you don't know how to play them. About the only thing I'd ask is for people to stop seeing my 53 wizard as a port-bitch. My job isn't to get you to Sebilis, you stupid tank, it's to burn things. Quickly, decisively. My job is to make fights go smoothly. Root at pull so it can be debuffed (Malisement is my friend....), and nuke at the appropriate time so that the mob quickly goes through the frenzy stage to the run stage. I'm also there to snare when a druid or ranger is not present. Lastly, I'm there to evacuate my party in the worst-case scenario.<br>
<br>
Magicians only suck if you don't know how to play them, too. About all I'd ask is for people to stop seeing my 22 Magician as a vending machine. My job as a Magician is to add melee damage with my pet (when not in dungeons with terrible pathing), and to help fights go more smoothly with the occasional nuke/rain when there isn't a wizard, while debuffing and DS'ing. The summoned weapons/armour/other goodies are just perks, they're not my job. (Mod rods might make me change my mind, but I'm 22 levels away from them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sick of people trying to compare the classes. Our jobs in party are so different that we can't be compared. Wizards don't buff. We don't debuff. We nuke. We are insurance. Magicians aren't there to nuke. If you were a nuking class, you'd have a *much* better damage to mana ratio than you do, and faster cast times. Magicians are a damage over time class.<br>
<br>
I like playing both, depending on my mood at the time. And incidentally, I created the wizard when my magician was level 12. I like the magician, but the wizard is part of my soul. Clearly, it does not suck. <p><center><a href="http://orderofantondwer.cjb.net" target=_new>

<br>
BTW I have a level 47 wizard, was my second character wand was 47 before kunark, I said wizards have recieved massive improvements /shrug I haven't played them in two years. What I will say is that soloing with my 3rd character a cleric was easier for the most part then soloing with my wizard.<br>
<br>
Wizards end game in my opinion don't suck, and they solo find post 50(this might be earlier now) but I still wouldn't choose wizards for a group and there damage still is nowhere near what a warrior/monk/rogue's is in a decent group thanks. That is the opinion of a man who hasn't played his wizard in 2 years, I am going to assume that wizards have both sides of the fence covered in this argument and won't argue it further as I don't feel I am equiped for it.<br>
<br>
What makes me laugh the most in all of this is that I clearly said I had no problems with the enchanter and wizard mana regen abilities, I think both are reasonable and balanced. I didn't even say that our mana regen was a problem, Gol completely manufactured that out of nowhere, very impressive. In fact the only ability of any other class I have a problem with is the dire charms, which I would estimate 80% of mages have a real problem with when they know the full facts.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank Aurianna, Gol please read her post and keep in mind that this is how 80% of mages feel, they feel that we are a damage class, always have been and they really don't want things to change.<br>
<br>
I on the other had want to be more useful, I want SOMETHING, ANYTHING. I want to be able to say I am 1 of a top five in soloing/grouping/raiding. I want a place in the game at my level, thats all. I want what I have when I play my enchanter to buff whore at a raid/be god in a group/solo VERY well, I want to what I have with my shaman be necessary on 75% of raids/Amazing groupers/Damn near the best soloer in the game I want what I have when I play my monk pretty much no raid can go on without a few of me and even if theres more then a few I do so much damage that they love me anyways/I very well respected place in a group/probably tied with shamans for best xp soloers in the game if not best overall soloers(please note I am in reality not even asking for this much really, actually a great deal less).<br>
<br>
Once again though I would like to know the level of Gol, because I really don't belive that he is a mage 55+. And also please state for the record that you are actually reading my posts and not skiming them.<br>
