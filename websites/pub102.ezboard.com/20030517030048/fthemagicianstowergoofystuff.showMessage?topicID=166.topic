<br>
Innoruuk00 tells Cazic_Thule00 &quot;Hehe Aye... Only SMT and above now though... Maybe after I get enough of them killed by Baker_Glena they might look at the cookie quest and sent it to Ester the Tester.&quot; <br>
<br>
Cazic_Thule00 tells Innoruuk00 &quot;Have you ever tried adjusting your faction?&quot; <br>

<br>
Innoruuk begins to cast a spell (Gate) <br>
You have entered the Plane of Hate <br>
<br>
Innoruuk types /who <br>
There are no players in Everquest <br>
<br>
Innoruuk says out of character, &quot;Hey guys... While they are in WC getting all their little people together to come up here and take all the new duds I gave you guys for christmas, I need to say something&quot; <br>
<br>
A_Haunted_Chest00 says out of Character, &quot;/em Listening...&quot; <br>

Innoruuk says out of character, &quot;Good... I need to ask a favor. All you guys need to chill out on halfings and druids... I need the faction, and it is probably going to take a while to get to Kindly with Baker Glena.&quot; <br>
<br>
Maestro says out of character, &quot;Well if you wouldn't keep knocking her out of place and having the SMT staff die to her every 5 seconds maybe that would help you noob&quot; <br>
<br>
A_Dracholich says out of character, &quot;Hehe&quot; <br>
<br>
Innoruuk says out of character, &quot;Yeah I know... Well now I have to fix it. Under no circumstances can you attack Halflings or druids.&quot; <br>

Wood_Elf_Druid01 /petition: &quot;Hello. Ithink it is very poor that you guys are running a GM event in Hate. Didn't think that was possible but you wiped out our raid. Thanks&quot; <br>
<br>
Taldayan tells wood_elf_druid00: &quot;Hello this is Guide Taldayan. Unfortunately, this is not a GM event or a bug... Innoruuk is working on his faction with Baker Glena for the cookies he wants&quot; <br>
<br>
Wood_elf_druid00 tells Taldayan, &quot;You guys have some pretty crappy excuses...&quot; <br>
<br>
Taldayan tells Wood_Elf_Druid00, &quot;No really it is the truth. I wish you well on your CR.&quot; <br>
<br>
Your Faction with BakerGlena has gotten better! <br>
Your Faction with Treants has gotten better! <br>
Your Faction with Disgruntledplayersthatdieonraidsbydumbmonkspullingtrains could not possibly get any worse! <br>
<br>
Innoruuk says out of character, &quot;Good job guys. Ineed to go check out this faction.&quot; <br>

Innoruuk begins to cast a spell (Cookiesordeath) <br>
