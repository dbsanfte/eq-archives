<br>
EQ has always provided 'more than one way to skin a cat'. That seems to have gone away with PoP.<br>
<br>
I don't believe that encouraging conformity is the way to go here. We're starting to see a significant number of people complain about the status quo, and I for one, think this is a good thing...... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

One thing I LOVE about PoP is the number of encoutners available for three groups or less.  I despise 50+ character raids.   Take the number down to 12 or 18 and tactics become much more important.  Throw in multiple boss mobs with differing attack styles and the play becomes fluid, dynamic and downright addictive. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=khalendor>Khalendor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 188<br> <font color=#333333>(12/30/02 9:55:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: PoP and guilds</span><hr size=1> I too have been experiencing PoP/EQ boredom since I hit level 62.  There are just not enough things to do now at this level without a huge timesink.  Since the exp in PoV and PoS is so much better than other zones, it is even more boring to go to old world zones.  Playing in 2 zones has gotten old quickly.  My guild raids very often but it is mostly taking down boss mobs that are up (pre-PoP zones).<br>
<br>
I used to play a few hours every night and for the past month I find myself playing a few hours a week at most.

I actually enjoy meeting new people and as a wanderer on the Tribunal this is exactly what I get to do.<br>
<br>
Sometimes you meet jerks who get their name written on my special lucky notepad of morons, and sometimes I get to find new people to add ot my /friends list. <br>
<br>
If I choose to not be guilded for whatever reason I like, why should the game become stale and dead to me based on that decision? Why should this one choice lock me down to 2 zones for all realistic intents and purposes?<br>
<br>
I may still squirm my way into BoT. A good friend saw my venting here and has offered to help me out next time they are doing a run for key pieces.<br>
<br>
But why should it take a pity leg-up for me to be able to do so? A game that for 3 years has entertained and in fact flourished based on the sheer size of the world and its opportunities should not suddenly be compressed into a few measly zones just because I take the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>option</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> - and its my option damnit! Guilding is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>not</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mandatory! - just as I rise to the pinnacle of my power? <p><center>

It was a rather well known fact before PoP went live that this expansion was mainly aimed at the end game raiding type of players.  SoE themselves even admitted that while the game would contain content for the casual player it was focused around the concept of raiding the planes.<br>
<br>
There are players upon Tunare that have managed to make it into CoD, HoH and Tactics without killing any of the flagged mobs.  It may not be easy but then it should be just as difficult and challenging as actually killing the required mobs.<br>

<br>
Actually, what was said was that it would be a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>high-level expansion</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Some content it was stated would require raids, however at E3 and during many previews they very much talked up the ability to add challenging 6-person content to the game with the new scripted events system.<br>
<br>
This had people like myself very interested in PoP. I was genuinely looking forward to the expansion as something of a renaissance of the 6 person adventuring group.<br>
<br>
What did I get in exchange? The Justice trials are all I have seen of this much-touted ability to create discreet 6-person content. I miss dungeon crawling bitterly, WHERE THE HELL ARE THE DUNGEONS?!?!<br>
<br>
And now, finally <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>why in the world should advancing my character damage my enjoyment of the game</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. Sure, make 75% of the expansion unreachable, it wouldn't have phased me one iota, I haven't seen half the rest of the world anyway.<br>
<br>
But in PoP, advancement is a trap if you don't raid. Even if I god forbid manage to get into BoT and HoH, I have 4 zones to adventure in. There's no way I am getting into Tier Four planes with anything but the best guilds on the server. While there are blue areas elsewhere, the phenomenal nature of the experience rewards in there PoP zones makes them unpalatable.<br>
<br>
Nice trade! At level 60 I had a much wider variety of places to adventure. CT was while a great exp spot, not so far above the rest of the blue areas in the game that they became worthless. I could still solo quite happily in many areas of the game.<br>
<br>
I log in these days to see friends and kill time. Not sure how long I will keep that up. <p><center>

<br>
I myself like to spend time with a couple of guildies in non-pop zones. Trashing through seb, killing nameds in UP, trying solo kills you've never thought possible etc.<br>
If you want exp, go to PoV, farm for a couple of hours and you have more aa's then some months ago in a week of Frenzy / Juggs. Then when you get bored with out, go out and do fun stuff again.<br>
<br>
I am trying to do the quest for the HoH key. It requires killing Agony Mephits in PoN. I've only done goblins thereso far, but trying to find the entrance to the mephit cave and running into 2 named goblins that kept summoning people was more fun then the 2 nights before when I'd done about 8 aa.<br>
<br>
Go out and have fun, do things that seem hard (solo Phinny or a Dragon) or just plain fun. Do quests, get a tradeskill up.<br>
<br>
Now that I don't worry about exp anymore my life has only improved a lot with PoP. If I think I need some more AA's I go to PoV and spend a couple of days there. That's no more fun then soloing FG, doing UD/Frenzy in velks or farm lame stuff in Seb which was the general way to spend your time before pop. <br>
Want exp? get some at the designated exp zones, want fun? ignore exp altogether and have FUN.<br>

I used to be able to do this and still get exp. That's what sticks in my craw - getting level 65 and PoP effectively nerfed my ability to do exactly that and still get some sort of experience reward.<br>

<br>
Sorry Hog, misunderstood this as meaning you wanted to be guilded, but not an &quot;uber&quot; guild =).<br>
<br>
Anyway, Hog is dead on.  I may not care as much because i am happy where i am in a guild with great friends and great players, but he is right nonetheless.  VI portrayed PoP as a high-level, primarily 6 man group expansion.  They said there will be &quot;plenty of content&quot; for a single group, but a lot of raid content as well.  Ok, Tier 1 + Tier 2 + some Tier 3 = single group.  But to get into tier three almost requires a guild, as Hog pointed out.  I can sympathize with him, even though i am not going through the same trouble. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 823<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 5:59:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=31>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/photo.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Ok, Tier 1 + Tier 2 + some Tier 3 = single group.

<br>
Not to mention that the lower tier zones are all of the LOIO / DL format. No dungeons to speak of, very few tricky breaks and no indoor zones. <br>
<br>
I miss the challenge and fun of adventuring in dungeons, every other expansion has had some dungeon content although it has certainly tapered away. The challenge of well designed content has been replaced by outdoor zones with monsters that just hit hard - graba slower, fill out a group and grind.<br>
<br>
The more I think about it the less I like PoP.

I dislike EQ's continuing emphasis on content designed solely for Uber-guilds.  I assumed EQ was mainly for groups/soloing when I first started playing.  I had fun doing raids for a while, but at this point doing endless timesink style raiding/exp grinding is very little fun, and I think EQ has gone too far in the wrong direction for too long.  <br>
<br>
Exp grinding in PoN/PoD/PoI is exactly as much fun as pulling mobs to the north wall of Karnor's castle in Dreadlands.  I can't believe game designer's really think that that is fun gameplay for more than a few hours.  PoP seems like the worst expansion so far, to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=variathemage>Varia the mage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 126<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 3:34:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Curse of Planes of Power</span><hr size=1> I so miss dungeons.

The other thing that concerns me is i haven't heard of any zone revamps in a while. The last rumor I had heard was regarding the Plane of Mischief, but it has been a while. Unless they plan to add a new entrance point to the zone, I doubt it would do much to change the current concerns about the game from casual players......<br>

<br>
basically everyone is saying that EQ was designed to have options.  you should be able to advance in a guild, or in a group, or with friends on weekends, or solo...whatever you feel like doing.  the problem people are having is that PoP is simply not designed like that, instead it is a guild-centered expansion where most of the content (nearly all of the much-vaunted &quot;dynamic content&quot;) requires mutiple groups...and as we know, if you need 3+ groups to do something that means you usually need a guild type orginization, wether or not you actually make it an official guild.<br>
<br>
here's the thing though...noone is forcing you to level.  PoP wasn't specifically designed to screw over the casual player, it was designed to give a new path to the top-end guilds that had already been there and done that all through Luclin.  certainly some of the content is appropriate for the casual player, but as you progress through PoP it becomes totally raid/guild centered.  in fact i think verant and sony went out of their way to open the planes to people who aren't in raid guilds, why else would those quests be there?  they could have, very easily, made the flag only accessable to those who kill the mobs, but they didn't, because they understood that the casual player needed a chance to get there too.  and yes, i understand how time consuming those quests are.<br>
<br>
i suppose i just have to question anyone who can honestly ask why, if they play 1 hour a week, and someone else plays 35 hours a week, why that person should be farther along in the game.  noone is forcing people to proceed into PoP or to dash to level 65.  the policy seems fairly direct to me...the more time you put in the more results you will get.  however, the amount of time is your choice, knowing that you sacrifice the results by spending less time working toward them.<br>
<br>
the notes about how insanely simple XP grinding is in pop seems to fall into this explanation when you consider one simple fact.  to most raid-guild 30+ hour a week players xp grinding is BORING, incredibly boring, most would go as far as to call it &quot;work&quot; as opposed to the &quot;fun&quot; of raids.  easy and fast ways to get xp are a simple, efficient way to get these people to 65 and topped off on AA's that will kick them into the 3rd and 4th tier planes.  basically if you can stand the 40 hours a week of mind-numbing chain pulls in valor then you are obviously one of these hardcore raid people, so you need to get done and back to raiding as fast as possible, and that means faster xp.  it's a bone they threw to the raid guilds who suddenly had their &quot;uber&quot; players 5 levels too low and 30 points behind in AA's.<br>
<br>
the thing is, to the casual player...this all means nothing at all, zippo.  if anything it is a benefit, there are now places that, if you so desired, you could get to 65 and many AA's much faster than ever before.  if you do not want to be the 24/7 raid type (which seems to be the general consensus of people here) then you basically trade a real life (40 hour a week raid guilds ARE those people's lives) for not having the phattest lewt or access to the most uber zones.<br>
<br>
the argument that people will quit EQ in any real numbers because they can't advance in PoP has no grounding at all.  how many guilds didn't get into VP in kunark era?  how many killed AOW in velious' times?  Vex Thal?  there have always been areas that the &quot;casual player&quot; has been restricted from.  and well, bluntly, sony isn't bankrupt yet...so i have to assume that not that many quit over it.  in fact, it would seem logical to me that the exact opposite is true.  people would quit in masses WITHOUT this high-end content accessable to only a few.  if every person could log in for an hour a week and get access to a new plane then all of pop would have been done by the big guilds already and they'd have nothing to look foward to.<br>
<br>

I think you are in a very small minority in thinking you can be 65th level and still be effective in EQ as a totally independent player.  The game requires a lot of teamwork to be successful.  Guilds are the most efficient tools available for mustering competent raid forces to accomplish high end objectives.  A guild is a friends list with its own chat channel.<br>
<br>
You can still be ronin-like and be a member of a guild.  Just find the right guild.  I'm usually out on my own but answer the call when my guild needs me.  I'm the sort of person that values his independence but was still able to find a guild I felt comfortable with.<br>

You can stubbornly try to bend EQ to your will, but prepare for a lot of frustration.<br>

<br>
Oh come on now.  With the exception of PoP the vast majority of content in EQ is for non raiding players.  This is the first expansion that is aimed directly towards the highest end of EQ players.<br>
<br>
Core game: PoF, PoS, PoH<br>
Kurnak: VP<br>
Velious: ST, ToV, PoM, PoG<br>
Luclin: Ssra, VT<br>
PoP: Pretty much everything past tier II<br>
<br>
There is a ton of non &quot;uber-guid&quot; content in EQ.  The real issue is that most zones outside of PoP are crap XPs once you level up in PoP.  Perhaps that needs to be fixed to help spread out the player base more and to give those non raiding players some of there old haunts back.<br>
<br>
I do have to agree thou, I loved Dungeons.  I wish there were more of them in PoP (so far I have only seen CoD, Tactics and BoT is Dungeon type settings).  It takes a more skilled group to crawl thru a dungeon IMO.<br>

<br>
I don't ghive a @#%$ about PoP being full of uber content for you Raid types. Seriously, enjoy yourselves and score phat lewts and whatnot. I have never begrudged the uber their uberness.<br>
<br>
My beef is the way advancing to level 65 screws over your gameplay, and the total and utter lack of interesting content for the single-group junky. If you can't see why its so very wrong for a new game expansion to add levels to the list of things that only the Uber should aspire to then eh, enjoy yourself I guess.<br>
