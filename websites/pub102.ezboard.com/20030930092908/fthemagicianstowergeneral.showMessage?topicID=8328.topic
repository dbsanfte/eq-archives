You'd be then lacking some of the back story and rich history of Middle-Earth that really helps bring the film to life. So, if you are interested, here's a &quot;quick&quot; primer.<br>
<br>
Note that all of it is drawn from memory having read the series multiple times as well as taking a look at some of the histories like the Silmarillion etc. That said its not guaranteed to be 100% accurate - if you see something that is not right be sure to let me know <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Finally, this contains <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>no spoilers about the films</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. While I will reference characters from it, nothing of the main story will be given away. You can freely read this without worrying about ruining the virgin experience of the films.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of Morgoth and Sauron</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Morgoth is one of the Valar. The Valar are a sort of demi-god bunch who helped build the world from Song (actually this may not be 100% correct, but eh is close enough, the Valar may be the servants of the creators). Unfortunately Morgoth's Song was dissonant because he's a bit of a nasty horrible, and hence the world when created was infected with evil.<br>
<br>
Morgoth ran amok for a long time. Eventually, a very very (like thousands of years) long time ago he was beaten back by the combined forces of middle-Earth in a huge fight, after which all the Valar and most of the Elder races (elves etc) buggered off over the Sea to Valinor, the eternal home etc. <br>
<br>
His agent and right hand man Sauron however remained in the world.<br>
<br>
Since then Sauron has been a pain, causing strife and generally representing the forces of evil in the world. The Balrog was a creature of Morgoth that somehow survived under Moria for a very long time.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Sauron is still around. He became the nastiest little bastard on the face of Middle-Earth and created the Orcs by twisting and manipulating the elves (same thing that Inny did to the Elves in Norrath to make his Dark Elves).<br>
<br>
More of Sauron in the section about the Rings of Power, pretty much all of the sections since he has been pivotal in all of the major events of the world following the fall of Morgoth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Note that Tolkien deliberately mispells the plural form of elfs and dwarfs. In the original edition of LOTR this was &quot;corrected&quot; by editors. A lot of supposed grammar and spelling mistakes were corrected and have had to be undone in a long drawn out process from the original manuscripts. The latest editions that have been extensively worked by his son Christopher and are pretty damn close to the original intent.<br>
<br>
Oh yeh, elves. Children of the Valar, they are the firstborn and cherished. They are basically immortal unless killed, Elrond for instance was present in the original war against Sauron way back in the day. Without spoiling things, if you watch the intro carefully in the Fellowship you'll see what I mean <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
There are two basic families of elves at the end of the Third Age (the time of the movies). High Elves live in Rivendell, and Wood Elves live in Mirkwood and Lothlorien. Their magic while potent is very subtle and usually enables them to do things like camoflage, stealth, healing and restoration, as well as physical feats like being able to run across the top of snow without sinking in etc.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Lembas</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the staple diet of the travelling elf is very nourishing and can keep a person on their feet for a long time, although if it is used as the traveller's core food for a very long time it can leave the eater feeling a little bit stretched and desiring other foods. Tastes magnificent <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The Elves in Middle-Earth at the end of the Third Age are a remnant of a remnant of the race. Most have passed over the Sea to the blessed fields of Valinor. The passing of Third Age marks the end of the time of the Elder races.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the Dwarves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Either Tolkien was not forthcoming about their origin or I don't recall. I vaguelly remember something about one of the Valar, having seen the creation of the Elves, wanting a race of their own people and went underground for Dwarves. Unlike the Elves, Dwarves do not generally go over the Sea to Valinor, and are not immortal although rather long lived.<br>
<br>
The Dwarves of old had a massive underground kingdom in the Mountains of Mist where Moria now stands, from memory called Khazad-Dum. There they mined for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mithril</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, a wondrous metal used for everything from jewelry to the finest and most precious armour known, light and incredibly strong.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately they dug too deep and uncovered some nasties from the time of Morgoth and that sort of ended Khazad-Dum. They have another city at the Lonely Mountain way over the Mountains of Mist and past the Mirkwood that was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, and reclaimed in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Hobbit</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> by Balin, Thorin and a bunch of dwarves, Gandalf and most notably the hobbit Bilbo Baggins. <br>
<br>
It was on this journey that Bilbo found the One Ring. More on that later.<br>
<br>
Dwarves are hardy fighters, strong and true tending to use axes and the like. They have little love for Men, and less for Elves.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of Numenor and Men</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Numenor was a land to the East, a large island (? pretty sure) kingdom between Middle-Earth and Valinor. The greatest of Men lived there and created wonders. This was the highest time in the history of Men. Unfortunately they listened to the advice of Sauron who was at that time not revealed as an agent of Morgoth and everything went to hell.<br>
<br>
With the betrayal over the forging of the Rings of Power (see below) Numenor was destroyed and the refugees landed in Middle-Earth. The race of Men flourished for a time, creating the kingdom of Gondor to the west of where Mordor now stands. Always have the Men of Gondor been the first and heaviest hit by Sauron, they can be best considered as like to Borderland folk (Shienar etc) for those who have read the Wheel of Time.<br>
<br>
Anyway Men diminshed. Once able to live for many centuries, the blood of Numenor thinned and became mixed with that of lesser men until the people of the West lived only as long as real people do. Over this time the kingdom of Rohan, the horse Lords, was born to the East of Gondor. Ergoth to the North near the Shire and where Bree now stands was a part of Gondor, but most of that was destroyed in one or other of the wars against Sauron.<br>
<br>
There does however remain a hint of the old blood of Numenor, in the people of the Dunedin (sp?) who are the Rangers of the North. They protect what remains of Ergoth from monsters and orcs and the like, and Aragorn is of them (their leader I think).<br>
<br>
But I jump ahead. The most recent war against Sauron (not including the one told in the books) saw the One Ring cut from the hand of Sauron by Isildur, the king of Gondor. It was his undoing and hence came to be known by Men as Isildur's Bane - he was killed by orcs when the Ring betrayed him and was lost in a River .. forget the name, maybe it was the Anduin. The Ring has a mind of its own, and wants to get back to Sauron - no doubt it saw being the possession of a strong Numenorean king to be a bit of a dead end.<br>
<br>
Anyway that pretty much smashed the people of Gondor. They had no King and instead a line of Stewards was created to rule the cities. Kings are important to people in Middle-Earth, without one the race kind of dwindled quite a bit. An heir to the throne was hidden away with the Dunedin for some reason I could never quite understand and the line eventually came to Ranger Aragorn. I'm pretty sure its no secret that he is the heir to the throne of Gondor.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the Rings of Power</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Three Rings for the Elven Kings<br>
Under the sky<br>
Seven for the Dwarf Lords<br>
In their Halls of Stone<br>
Nine for the mortal Men<br>
Doomed to die<br>
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne<br>
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie<br>
One Ring to rule them all<br>
One Ring to find them<br>
One Ring to bring them all<br>
And in the darkness bind them<br>
In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Cool huh? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Anyway, the elves - probably with the help of the dwarves, I don't recall - made their Three Rings. Sauron had nothing to do with the making of them, although he recognised their power immediately. The Elven Rings provide endurance, wisdom and strength, their magic subtle in the way of Elves.<br>
<br>
The Three have never been touched by Sauron and remain in the world. Its a bit of a spoiler to say who has them so I won't <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The Dwarves forged their Seven, Rings of power that from memory granted riches and in some manner helped with Dwarf-things like mining and finding mithril and probably drinking and singing etc. OK that last bit is a lame joke but you get the idea <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The Seven are lost, consumed by dragons, lost in the belly of Khazad-Dum, or held by Sauron.<br>
<br>
Men jumped on the bandwagon and forged Nine Rings of Power. Unfortunately Sauron had a hand in it - remember he was a trusted advisor in Numenor then -  and used his influence to learn the making of Rings.<br>
<br>
In Mordor at Mount Doom Sauron forged the One Ring. The One is the most powerful, and most of Sauron's power went into its creation. Without it he is wraith-like, with little ability to influence the world directly, even though he holds the Nine. Oh yeh he did that, took the Nine and used them to warp their holders, Lords and Kings of Numenor all, into the Ringwraiths, the Black Riders.<br>
<br>
The One Ring is the big boy. It binds the others, most of all the Nine and least of all the Three, but their fates are bound up with it. Should the One be destroyed, all that was created by the Seven Nine and Three will fade and fall, and the power of the others will dwindle and die.<br>
<br>
That will do for now, if you have any questions let me know, yeh I'm a LOTR gimp but eh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center>

<br>
The Valar is the title for all those created by the Illúvitar.<br>
<br>
The gods that were created by the Illúvitar include:<br>
The wizards* (The istari): Sauruman the White, Gandalf the Grey, Radagast the Brown, Pallando the Blue, and Alatar the Blue.<br>
<br>
The first three Istari governed Middle Earth, the last two were bound to Valinor and only briefly stepped foot upon the Western shores of Middle Earth...Near the Realm of Arnor, actually.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the Illúvitar created the Maiar:<br>
<br>
The Maiar are the shapeless governing bodies. They can be interpreted as the forces of nature, and other things that influence all the races of Earth. Such includes Morgoth and Sauruman.<br>
<br>
Be informed that Maiar have no names until they stray from their destined path...And such have they.<br>
<br>
And thirdly, the Eledhwen, the Elves:<br>
Immortal by age, not by force. Cherished, et. al.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Evil arises:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Morgoth, actually called himself Melkor until the Elves gave him such a title. He was also responsible for bringing Sauron with him. They were both good at one time.<br>
<br>
Morgoth stayed as the invisible hand of evil. Sauron himself took a form, many forms.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>The Ages:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The First Age</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can be marked as the Age of Creation. When the Illúvitar had created the races of Middle Earth. However this Age was brought to a climax as an Allegiance of Men and Elves marched across where the Dead Marshes now stand along the western borders of Mordor, along the Ephel Dúath. Sauron took the form of a wolf, a Warg, as they're called...And unleashed a great army of Orcs and Trolls unto the Men of Gondor and Rohan. The Warg was slain, however as Sauron has no real shape...You cannot kill him, just the form he carries. Only the undoing of the ring can bring about his death.<br>
In this period, Morgoth had taken on the powers of creation. In mimicry of Elves, the Orcs were devised. That is why they hold the tipped ears of Elven-kind. However all the traits of Elves are lessened in Orcs...But they are nevertheless keen-sensed.<br>
In mimicry of the Ents, the Trolls were created. Two forms. Trolls, and then the Olog-Hai. The Olog-Hai are day-marching Trolls, and they were bred specifically for assaulting southern Mirkwood and controlling the Black Gates. The other Trolls were more inquisitive, but altogether nasty folk that took to caves as powers of the night. Also, the Balrogs were created. These nasty creatures were devised in the image of the Istari, and were the strongest of all beings. The ending of the First Age saw many Balrogs created...And many were slain by the three Istari until one lay left, buried and hidden by Morgoth in Moria. Down the Endless Stair at an unreachable peak of the mighty Caradhras...And into the depths of the world where no being would touch until the Third age, as the Dwarves delved deeper in search of Mithril. The end of the First Age is marked by Sauron's first death.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>The Second Age</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> can be marked as the Age of Unrest. It finds its continuation in the errant ways of Morgoth and Sauron. It is marked by the Valinorian Exodus, wherein many millions of Elves left for the Undying Lands.<br>
But upon the plains of Dagorlad, to the north of Mordor along the borders of the Ered Lithui mountains at the Black Gates (Morannon)...The remaining Elves and Men strove to quash another Evil rising. Clad as a would a human be, Sauron in plate-armor of black strode forth from the Black Gates to meet the Allied Forces. As Elendil strode forth to slay Sauron with Narsil, so was he dismissed by a mighty swing of the mace. As Man and Elf alike fell prey to the mighty swings of the Warmace of Barad-Dûr, Isildur rushed to his fallen father. The cloven Sword was hefted by Isildur, now king by way of force...With a mighty swing, the Shards of Narsil castrated the One from Sauron's body. As the ring is the Essence of Sauron's being, Sauron returned to his Celestial form. So ended the Second age and began the Third...Which you're all seeing now in the wonderful movies.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the Eledhwen, Immortal Children of the Illúvitar:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Gondolin<br>
Mirkwood<br>
Lothlórien<br>
Rivendell<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gondolin</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was in the North, roughly where Mount Gundabad now lies. Falling in the very beginnings of the second by an assault of Balrogs. Not much is known about Gondolin, save their king was Turgon...And to mark his passing, Glamdring was forged. Glamdring was lost in the ruins of Gondolin...And out of the ruins of Gondolin Mount Gundabad was formed. A mighty kingdom of rocked was tumbled and covered with millenia of sands and dusts to form these mountains. It was within this mountain that Bert the Troll was hiding with Glamdring. Very precious this sword, but Bert found it shiny and entertaining...Sparkling. He found it to be easy on the ears, although the metal stung his hands. However Gandalf found the sword in this Troll cave in many of his wanderings...And he bequeathed it to Elrond, rightful owner, and heir to Gondolin.<br>
<br>
Not much is to be said of the rest of the Elves, for their history is rather peaceful, and altogether uninteresting for those not so inclined.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the men</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Gondor:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The mightiest and most prominent race of men. In the first age, they steadfastly held the land of Mordor as territory of their own. Forging Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon) on the western edge of Ephel Dúath. Barad-Dur is also their creation, at least in part. Added on to and held by a prince of Gondor to govern. Their reach extend aaaaall the way to the fallen realm of Arnor (Ergoth as Elves call it.) But such being so far away, the Dúnedain thus separated from Gondor and willfully, and legally created a kingdom of their own...It is from this kingdom that Elendil, Isildur, Arathorn, and now Aragorn find their lineage. Isildur was the last true king of Gondor...All those that came after him were stewards of Gondor (Think Boromir then Faramir). The true kings are the ones that have descended from the Arnor line....To Aragorn. He is rightful king of both the fallen realm of Arnor, and of Gondor. Gondor is pissed over that one.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Westernesse:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Very little is said of the men of Westernesse. So little in fact, I know nothing about it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Angmar:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The evil men. Hailing from the areas of Forochel. These men were deceived by the will of Sauron, and slowly their kingdom was brought to evil. These are the men that slowly spread into the Wild Men, and more commonly the dark-skinned men with black eyes and hair that became servants of the Dark Lord.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Rohan:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Proud people. Finding their lineage in the Men of Gondor as well. Their capitol is Edoras, held in the books by Theoden at the castle of Meduseld.  To the west, their boundary is the Emyn Muil. To the north it is spliced between Fangorn and Lothlórien. To the west, their borders stop at The Greenway. The great road into the south. And finally, their southern borders stop at Minas Tirith where Gondor begins.<br>
<br>
The Men of Rohan are the second largest strength of Men residing on Middle Earth. Masters of the Mearas (Horses), they're incredibly deft with mounted weapons...Including spears, sabres, bastard swords, and the short-bow. In their own dialect, their kingdom is called &quot;The Mark.&quot; So if you were to hear &quot;What news from The Mark?&quot; they would be asking for news of Rohan.<br>
<br>
Any detachment of Men bound to their horses are called the Rohirrim, or Men of Horses in the tongue of Elves. Particular, Eomer is the Third Marshall of the Mark. He is the chief Horseman and is essentially the General.<br>
<br>
Hama, slain at the battle of Helm's Deep, was the Second Marshall. He was the chief guard of Theoden.<br>
<br>
Helm's Deep was the fortress forged by the Kingdom of Rohan in times of war. Wrought by hand from the ground skyward, Helm Hammerhand devised a fortress that has never seen a loss in battle.<br>

*The Istari have a hierarchical order in Middle Earth. From lightest to darkest colors. When a lighter color has seceded from the path of good to do evil, the point is reached where he has no color. All the power imbued into this being is passed on to the color right below him. That is why Sauruman the white strayed from his path, lost his power, and Gandalf was now white. This is also the reason he was able to beat the Balrog at long last.<br>
<br>
The Balrogs were as strong as Gandalf was when he was grey. This is why he was neither able to best, or lose to the Balrog...They were 100% evenly matched. Only when the Illúvitar extended a hand to strip Sauruman of his coloring and pass it on to Gandalf, was he able to win.<br>
<br>
This is why he is heard to say in the books &quot;I am Sauruman, in some ways.&quot; For he is!<br>

<br>
What exactly can you do with the One Ring? In LotR the only thing the ring does is make it's wielder invisble and give &quot;true&quot; sight of the Ringwraiths.<br>
<br>
I used to think the ring was to control the other rings, but considering Sauron never used that to warp the elves it seems pretty mute. Also the Ringwraiths can't be controlled with it or Frodo would have a fieldday getting to Mount Doom with 9 invincible protectors and they would never have struck him with the poison dagger when he wielded the ring.<br>
So basically, what the heck is the ring supposed to be able to do? What would a Boromir have done with it to save his people (assuming he would save them first before eventually turning to the dark)? <p>Arch Convoker Rhand Drago'Magica<br>

Only under his command can he kick the ass of the Elves and Dwarves. Through that ring he can command them. But the power of Elrond, Galadriel, and Cirdan is much stronger than the books let on. They're essentially able to hide the Elven rings from vision.<br>
<br>
The Ring CAN control the Nazgûl...Only after you've become one of them. And Frodo knows that it's a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Boromir could have used the ring to outfit a single man with incredible strength, endurance, and agility...Perhaps 1 man able to best the will of 10,000 normal men.

<br>
Some sweet stuff there! I have some revisions for my original though, after a quick run through Appendix A:<br>
<br>
Morgoth came to Middle-Earth after stealing the Silmarils, the Eldar (elves) came to be in Middle-Earth because they wanted them back, led by Feanor - against the will of the Valar. They tried really hard but were beaten totally. They eventually were able to take back at leats one of the Silmarils to Valinor, unfortunately the appendix doesn't detail the rest of it and I don't have a copy of the Silmarillion at hand. Eventually Morgoth got spanked though and his fortress city of Thangorodrim got what was coming to it.<br>
<br>
Sauron was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>known</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for who he was when he went to Numenor. Ar-Pharazon the Golden King of Numenor actually travelled to Middle-Earth to challenge Sauron and he had so many men and was so strong all of Sauron's friends and henchmen just ran away. The Dark Lord pleaded his life and was taken to Numenor, it was then that he bewitched the King, and convinced them it would be a good idea to travel to Valinor (they were not allowed to do that) and claim immortality.<br>
<br>
Well that didn't go down well and Numenor was completely destroyed. Elendil and the rest of &quot;the Faithful&quot; who went along with what the Eldar and the Valar had decreed were the refugees who founded Arnor and Gondor ... Sauron lost his body when Numenor was destroyed and was really pissed to learn that Elendil and his crew had lived on.<br>
<br>
He made it back to Mordor and started with the making of armies and such again, wanting to take it to the last remnant of Numenor (talk about holding a grudge!). He was too hasty though, and the Last Alliance of Men and Elves were able to take him down and take the One Ring from him.  <p><center>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the beginning of the world and the Valar</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
The name of the creator was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eru</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and the elves named him <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Iluvátar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. He was before all else was made. From the thoughts of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eru</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> came the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and there are many of them, both greater and lesser in strenght. As previously mentioned the world came into Being through the Music if the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Melkor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was the mightiest of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, in fact his name means <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>He who arises in might</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> and he and all the other <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> made the great Music before <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eru</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and from the very beginning the discord of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Melkor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> came to be. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Eru</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> let this world that had been created by this Music come into being, and he choose a place for it and it is called Ea. Those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that wished it might descent into the Ea under the condition that they had to be bound to it until its end. Many if the mightiest of the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> went down into the world, and with them was <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Melkor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and the many lesser <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Now, the mightiest of these <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Valar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, for they are the Powers of Arda (Arda is the world, who lies inside Ea). The lesser <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Ainur</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that followed them are called the people of the Valar, or <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Maiar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Melkor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was in the beginning one of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Valar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but he is no longer accounted among them and he is now named <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Morgoth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the Dark Enemy of the World and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Bauglir</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the Deciever. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sauron</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was a maia that was corrupted by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Morgoth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and in the later days of the world <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sauron</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> arose as a new Dark Lord after <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Morgoth</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was utterly defeated.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of the Elves</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
The elves are the People of the Stars, or in their own tongue; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Eldar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. They are the Firstborn and they are bound to the world and cannot leave it. In fact even when they are slain by weapons or die of grief their spirits still remain in the world until the end. <br>
<br>
There are 3 cland of elves, first are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Vanyar</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the fair elves. No vanyarin elf lives in Middle earth in the time of the war of the Ring, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Galadriel</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> has vanyarin blood in her as can be seen from her golden hair. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Only</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> the vanyar has golden hair. Many elves in the movie etc are blond, but if you read the details that Tolkien wrote, almost all of them should have dark or silver hair.<br>
<br>
The second clan are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Noldor</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the deep elves. They are the most skilled in crafts. The high elves that still linger in Middle earth are of noldorin blood. They have dark hair (and in rare cases red hair)<br>
<br>
The third clan are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>the Teleri</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the hindmost, the last, refering to a great march that the elves made long ago away from Middle earth and in wich the Teleri went last. Many of them strayed from the journey and never followed the first two clans and thus they remained in Middle earth. From these 'lost' elves comes the people of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Legolas</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and the elves that lives in Lothlorien. The Teleri loves music and song, and those of them that followed the other elves away on their journey from Middle eart now lives by the ocean on the other side of the sea in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Alqualonde</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the swanhaven. There they ever make music beside the sea. The elves say that in the sound from the ocean one can still here the echo of the Music that created the world.<br>
<br>

<br>
No, the Valar are the greatest of the Singers created by Illuvatar.  Melkor, Manwe, Ulmo, Tulkas, Orome, Mandos, etc., were a few of the Valar.  The Maiar were the lesser Singers -- Melian the Maia, Sauron, Balrogs, etc., were examples of Maiar.  All were able to walk with or without bodies.  Manwe is the chief of the Valar, and Varda is his wife.<br>

Errr... actually, the appendices state that the 5 wizards were sent by the Valar to Middle-Earth to help in its affairs.  All stayed on Middle-Earth.  The last two, Pallando and Allatar, wandered into the East and nothing more was heard from them.<br>

<br>
Err... yes, but the events you give in the 1st Age are all wrong.  There was no battle in Ephel Duath in the 1st Age ... all the battles written about happened in Beleriand.. far to the West past the Blue mountains.  At the end of the 1st Age, Beleriand was drowned in the sea, and only the strip of land to the West of the Blue mountains remained.  That's why Gil-Galad took that area for his realm in the 2nd Age.<br>
<br>
Gondor and Rohan didn't exist at all in the 1st Age.  Although Sauron was known as the Lord of Werewolves in Beleriand, so he was able to take the form of a wolf.<br>
<br>
The Istari didn't exist as such during this time, nor did they band together and slay balrogs.  Instead, the Balrogs died defending the fortress of Thangorodrim, along with many Dragons and Orcs, when the Host of the Valar came to conquer Morgoth.<br>
<br>
Note that Sauron was captured at the end of the 1st Age, sued for pardon, and was granted clemency by the Valar.  He fled to what would later be Mordor.<br>

Most of this is not supported by the texts.  We know a lot about Gondolin, for example.  It was in the Encircling Mountains, near to the realm of Morgoth in Beleriand... about 1000 miles west of Mount Gundabad.  It's king was Turgon, and it was known as the Hidden City.   See the Silmarillion for  a complete description of the events leading to its fall by the treachery of Maeglin, the son of Eol.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Of the men:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Most of this is wrong in detail, time or place.  Gondor and Arnor were founded as kingdoms after the Fall of Nymenor, with Elendil as the High King of both realms, and his sons Isildur and Anarion as the local kings (the kings you saw in the Argonath during FotR were Anarion and Isildur).  After the death of Anarion and Elendil during the First War of the Ring, Isildur took up his father's kingship and began to journey to the north.  He was slain by Orcs and the Ring lost on the way.  His son Valmandil (sp?) escaped with the shards of Narsil and the Ring of Barahir and made his way to the North to take up his father's Kingship.<br>
<br>
In the south, Gondor prospered.  The Kings were wise, and their watch upon Mordor was constant.<br>
<br>
In the north, Arnor prospered for a time, but then fell prey to internal disputes and wars.  A new kingdom rose near Mount Gundabad, the Kingdom of Angmar, and that realm made constant war upon the men of Arnor.  The Witchking of Angmar was a dread sorceror who ruled that land.  In the end, Arnor fell, and it's line of Kings were forgotten.  Aragorn is the heir of those kings.<br>
<br>
(and it was later found out that the Witchking of Angmar was no other than the leader of the Ringwraiths)<br>
<br>
In the south, plague and war reduced Gondor's strength to a shadow of its former self.  And, when the Witchking issued a challenge to Earnur the King, he rode out alone to confront him in battle.  Never to be seen again...<br>
<br>
No other man or women was found of the line of Elendil, so the rulership of Gondor was taken up by the Stewards, to be held in trust until the King returned again.  After a thousand years, though, nobody ever expected that to happen.  Boromir is the eldest son of the current Steward of Gondor, and Faramir is his brother.<br>
<br>
That's why the knowledge of Aragorn's existence was such a shock to Boromir... the moment he arrives in Gondor, he upsets a rulership of the Stewards that's lasted over 1000 years.<br>
<br>
The Land of Rohan was gifted to tribes of men that came from the North who helped Gondor in their hour of need.  It has since grown into a very strong land and is bound by treaty and custom to help Gondor.<br>
<br>
Whew!  That's all for now :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kassinova>Kassinova</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 167<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 7:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8328.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ...</span><hr size=1> thanks eloina, my head hurts <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 249<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 9:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8328.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hogfather's Lord of the Rings Primer (long!)</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>What exactly can you do with the One Ring?

<br>
It's never really specified in the books.  A few stray bits say things like, &quot;The Ring will give me the power of Command&quot;, or &quot;all the works of the Three will be laid bare should he regain the Ring&quot;<br>
<br>
Ultimately, we know that through the One, Sauron could command those corrupted by the 3, 7, or 9.  Since the Three were never touched by Sauron, he could not command their wielders, although it's somewhat indicated that he could affect their works.  The dwarves proved too intractable to be commanded, so he was forced to work with Men.<br>
<br>
In Tolkien's Letters, he makes the comment that Frodo could have commanded the Ringwraiths once he claimed the Ring, although it's quite likely that they would have tricked him into staying on Orodruin to await the coming of Sauron himself.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, Tolkien chose to use the Ring and Sauron as unseen forces of impending doom, rather than as tools with defined abilities and powers.  So, we'll never really know. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=menarion>Menarion</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 11:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8328.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Hogfather's Lord of the Rings Primer (long!)</span><hr size=1> Thanks for correcting some of the innaccurate stuff Eloina.

<br>
Of the Ainur: All the original creatures created by Iluvatar were called the Ainur. There were many Ainur created by Iluvatar, both greater and lesser. Assisting in the creation of Middle-Earth were 14 of the greatest Ainur, and they were called the Valar. <br>
<br>
The king of the Valar was Manwe, and his wife was (I think) Varda. The lesser Ainur who came to Middle-Earth became called the Maiar, and they assisted the Valar in everything.<br>
<br>
I can only remember a few of the other Valar, and I don't have a copy of the Silmarillion sitting in front of me, but here goes.<br>
<br>
Ulmo, who was lord of all the waters of Middle-Earth. He alone did not forget the troubles of Elves and Men in all the long years of the wars against Morgoth.<br>
<br>
Orome, the hunter. He it was who first discovered the Elves after their awakening.<br>
<br>
Aule: He's the guy who created the dwarves, in imitation of Iluvatar. Iluvatar initially chastised him, because Aule did not have the power of creation (The Flame Imperishable) and so the dwarves would forever be puppets, having a semblance of life only when he controlled them. He  was ashamed, and as he turned to destroy them, they were fearful, and shrank from him. Iluvatar had forgiven him his trespass, and given life to the dwarves, but doomed them to sleep until after the Elves first walked the Earth.<br>
<br>
Tulkas. Not sure what his special deal was. He didn't come to Middle-Earth with the original Valar. Rather, he came in the time during the shaping of the world when the Valar were being hard pressed by Morgoth. Tulkas was very strong, and a great fighter, and I believe Morgoth feared him.<br>
<br>
The Maiar: Some of them had names in the Silmarillion, even the ones who didn't go bad. The examples that come to mind are the Maiar who piloted the Sun (a female) and a Maiar who piloted the Moon (male.) The one on the Moon desired the woman on the Sun, so he constantly chased her, which is why the Moon is less constant than the Sun, supposedly.<br>
<br>
Of the Silmarils: The Silmarils were 3 holy jewels created from the light of the two trees. They were created by the greatest of the Noldor to ever live, Feanor. Pretty much the entire fate of Middle-Earth was influenced in one way or the other by the Silmarils.<br>
<br>
After their creation, Feanor became jealous, and did not desire that any other see them, so he hid them in his home, and wore them only sparingly. (Keep in mind, all this is in Aman, the Undying Lands where the Valar live.)<br>
<br>
After his defeat, Morgoth was imprisoned in Aman for thousands of years. He was eventually released after professing to be reformed. The Valar believed him, as they had yet little of understanding of Evil. So, for a time, Morgoth was free to walk in Aman, and he saw the Silmarils, and coveted them. Eventually, with the help of Ungoliant (a nasty giant spider thing) he destroyed the Two Trees, casting the world into total darkness. (This is before the sun and the moon existed.) <br>
<br>
(The bit where Morgoth enlists Ungoliants help is a great passage. He tells her that he'll feed her with countless jewels and says something to the effect of &quot;Yea, with both hands&quot;<br>
<br>
After destroying the trees, Morgoth traveled to Feanor's home, killed his father, and stole the Silmarils. He then fled with Ungoliant, where he paid her fee of stolen jewels. He keeps the Silmarils hidden in one hand, and when Ungoliant demands he keep his promise, he refuses, and she attacks. However, he is saved by his Balrogs, and together with his Balrogs he flees to Middle-Earth to his fortress.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, Feanor is rousing the Elves for war against Morgoth. He travels to the coast, takes the ships of the Sea Elves (can't remember their name) by force after slaying many of them, and then crosses to Middle-Earth. This is the first of many betrayals that take place in the pursuit of the Silmarils.<br>
<br>
After reaching Middle-Earth, Feanor is hot on the trail of Morgoth. He falls into a trap, and is set upon by MANY Balrogs. As credit to how much of a bad ass he is, he's undaunted and continues to fight. He is eventually slain, but his descendants continue the pursuit of the Silmarils.<br>
<br>
Only one Silmaril was ever recovered from Morgoth, and that Silmaril was carried into the West, into Aman by Earendil the Mariner. Upon hearing Earendil's account of the plight of the Elves in Middle-Earth, the Valar amassed a great host and rode to war for the final time against Morgoth and destroyed his forces utterly, save for those who sued for pardon (Sauron) and those who escaped deep into the earth (Balrog in Moria.)<br>
<br>
Morgoth himself was cast into the void. Morgoth's two remaining Silmarils were stolen by Feanor's sons the night of the victory, but because they were so stained by guilt and evil-doing in their pursuit, neither could hold the jewels without being burned. I seem to recall that one of them jumped into the ocean and perished, not sure about the other one. Neither were ever recovered.<br>
<br>
As for the Silmaril that Earendil carried, it was set to the bow of his ship, and his ship thereafer sailed the heavens. Fast forward to Fellowship of the Rings, when Galadriel hands Frodo the 'Light of Earendil, our most beloved star.&quot; Nice how they tie that stuff together, huh?<br>
<br>
Minor correction...Numenor was to the West of Middle-Earth, not the East. <br>
<br>
Well, that's enough for now I think.<br>

<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.tolkiensociety.org/faq_frame.html">www.tolkiensociety.org/faq_frame.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
wherein one part of the faq asks:<br>
-------------------------------------------------<br>
Is Legolas really blonde or dark?<br>
<br>
Tolkien went to some lengths to avoid describing Legolas: in the Pauline Baynes picture of the Fellowship, painted while he was still alive, Legolas is the only one wearing a hood over his hair. This picture is not an absolute reference, as there are certain known oversights in it, but there is probably some significance in the deliberate muffling of this well known character.<br>
<br>
We know that Legolas's father was blonde. (He is the Woodland King in The Hobbit, who is described, roughly, as having leaves in his golden hair.) The other often-overlooked point is that every single elf ever described in person in LotR and The Hobbit, apart from the family of Elrond, is fair-haired. And they are all blonde apart from Celeborn, who is silver-haired.<br>
<br>
So why did people start to think that Legolas might be dark? The primary reason, historically, is Tolkien's note at the end of the Appendices to LotR, where he more or less says that all the Eldar were dark except the golden house of Finrod/Finarphir/Finarphin (depending on the edition).<br>
<br>
That there was something amiss with this paragraph was not fully apparent at that time, because until The Silmarillion was published there was no clear reason to distinguish the Eldar from other elves. You simply never meet a dark one apart from Elrond's relations.<br>
<br>
When The Silmarillion came out it quickly became clear that the paragraph perhaps should read &quot;eldar&quot; for &quot;Noldor&quot; or similar; and even then did not stand up, because of the vigorous crossbreeding of the ruling houses with the fair-haired Vanyar. If you substitute &quot;eldar&quot; with something like &quot;Finwe's immediate offspring&quot; it comes out about right.<br>
<br>
This is why it became canonical among some analysts that Legolas was dark. It's backed by a paragraph in The Great River where Legolas's &quot;dark head&quot; is seen against the sky. Readers who jump on this sentence forget that he was being seen in the dark, against a dark sky, wearing a hood specifically designed to make him hard to see. Even an albino painted in phosphorescent paint would look &quot;dark&quot; under those circumstances.<br>
<br>
So is Legolas dark or fair? We don't know. Tolkien's oldest elves were fair, and it's not clear why he adopted a &quot;majority dark&quot; policy. Various theories about the origin of elves and dwarves in folklore in the late 19th century may have had something to do with it. (They were by some identified with the Picts, a thought-to-be-dark race in Northern Scotland.) Or he may have been trying to make his golden-haired elves special - there's quite a lot of circumstantial evidence in that direction - although, as we all know, the special dark ones, the house of Luthien, are very special indeed. Perhaps he hadn't made up his mind which appearance he preferred Legolas to have.<br>
<br>
To sum up, Legolas is probably the only elf in the whole of Tolkien's works who can legitimately be issued in two different colourways. Or carries a wig. <br>

Maedhros jumped into a fiery chasm because the pain of the Silmaril drove him mad.  Maglor threw his into the sea, and wandered the shores ever after, lamenting his loss.<br>
