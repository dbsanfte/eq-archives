You know what would be really cool?  If VI would make a mage weapon that PROCCED reclaim energy in melee.  That would be the ultimate in redundancy as you might get the chance to fight your pet maybe once ever.  ..Would be the only effect I can think of that would be worse than the current effect on our velious bracer =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufg2010.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fg2010</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 93<br> <font color=#333333>(8/5/01 7:19:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Luclin Uber Magician Robe!</span><hr size=1> <br>
Who cares that we don't get cool affects on items.  +25 int?  Jeez.. what more do you want.<br>
<br>
If you ask me.. these items should not be no drop.  People that farm plat to buy good gear should not have to be limited to crap gear.<br>

To the person who started this post, I do agree we have a few too many items with that lovely effect.  I wish VI would put some thought into something more useful, like levi ring, waterstone, or coldstone.  Then again we might get a right click Bind Affinity if we are not careful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
How about the mage thats just as skilled as you, groups 50% of the time and solos 50% of the time?  Somone in a small or in no guild?  Someone that does not like the political BS one needs to deal with to be in a large guild?<br>
<br>
You can be welcome in groups due to your skill but you won't be getting any &quot;great&quot; gear usually unless you are in the guild thats hosting whatever raid or group your on.<br>
<br>
Alone or in a small team I can farm the items I need to get the plat I need to buy some decent items.  The problem is I happen to see a lot of poorly played mages that have better gear because of the guild they happen to be in.<br>
<br>
As in real life nothing is fair and that should be expected.  To simply sheepishly go along with this without any complaint is not something I will do.<br>
<br>
This is an old argument and yes it is quite certain VI favors the &quot;large&quot; guild.<br>
<br>
Its too bad there are not challanging and rewarding objectives that can be realized solo by Mages, but I think this goes for Necros and Druids as well.<br>
<br>
I thought that SoL was going to be great until I learned about the fact they will use the Warren's loot code for it.  <br>
<br>
Aparently this is supposed to be group oriented.  Somehow I don't believe VI is talkign about a group of 6.  <br>
<br>
In my opinion we need an expansion that supports a group of 6 in regards to being able to find uncrowded spawns that drop spells and offer quests and other loot rewards.<br>
<br>
While I hope this will be SoL I doubt it will be.<br>
<br>
Back to wearing crap gear and having to have 2 sets of crap gear - one for resists (raids) and one for soloing (int centric).<br>
All because I dislike politics to the extent they are played on my server and prefer smaller groups of &quot;friends&quot; that feel the same way.<br>

I have an idea fq2010.  get you're whiny ass self in a larger guild.  prob solved.  That mage who isnt as skilled as you has better gear cuz either he took the time to make friends in that guild, or did have friends in that guild.<br>
<br>
Some damned good stuff is buyable anyway, BD gear for one, and there's plenty of good buyable equip for int/mana.<br>
<br>
@#%$ you can buy SoV quest armor, just pay to multi-it.  Though there arn't exactly a horde of ppl in EC /auc to multi it, but there are some.<br>
<br>
But the WHOLE point of no drop items bein the best in the game is so that you'll get off your ass and go adventure in a dangerous place, with a lot of friends.  Why else would one leave the protection of EC buyin low-sellin high, or farming dungeons where they're at little to zero danger? <p>Thon Tarliser

<br>
Lets examine this responce.<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;I have an idea fq2010. get you're whiny ass self in a larger guild. prob solved.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Playing with a very established and &quot;old school&quot; server population makes this easier said then infact done times 1000.<br>
<br>
On the server I play on Mages do not fit into the established tactics that the large guilds and the many other guilds that worship and follow them use.<br>
<br>
To obtain membership into said guilds one would need to kiss a lot of ass.  As I have stated before plenty of times this is not something I will do in a MMOG.  Real life is one thing.. fantasy world quite another.<br>
<br>
I attribute this most strongly to the design of the Mage class and the average age and maturity of the EQ and for that matter MMOG player. <br>
<br>
<br>
&lt;&lt;That mage who isnt as skilled as you has better gear cuz either he took the time to make friends in that guild, or did have friends in that guild.&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
Exactly.  However such gear should be in reach of any Mage that puts his time in and groups/plays the game.  Compareably this is true for just about any melee class.  Why should it be so different for mages and other casters?<br>
<br>
I realize what I said upsets the kids here that are going though that point in their lives where its important to them to have a sence of self worth and of power over their enviornment.  Hell I was a young adult once to.<br>
<br>
The point in this lesson is about the fact that skill has almos tnothing to do with progress with equipment or epic.  Its about who you know.  This is true for all classes in EQ but its a LOT more true for non-hybrid casters since they need entire raid teams to get comparable equipment that other classes need a group or 2.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion, you know you don't need to agree with it.<br>

So you are saying that melees can easily get a single group of friends and head over to ToV and get some armour. WOOT, I think I better work on my warrior twink a bit more.<br>
<br>
As for the comment about the age, well I am not a teenager, early twenties actually and I think it is you the bitter old guy who has not found the right group of people (<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> see guild</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->)to hunt with.  You don't need to kiss ass to get into a guild that can help you get the gear you so desire.  The other person who responded had a good point.  I was in ToV, with a chance of dying and you want to buy the same robe for running around Guk and having no worries of death, since you are such a skilled mage?  <br>
<br>
bah<br>
<br>
All I can say is I am really glad your opinions are not those of others.<br>

If you don't want to be a part of a big team doing the top stuff, getting the top items, EQ is not the game for you.  The key is its a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER game, not just a couple people multiplayer.  If you want to do the hardest stuff in a game, but with only 5 or so people, play BG2 or Diablo 2.  EQ is designed to make LOTS of people work together, not just a few.<br>
<br>
As for the original post, yeah I'm sick of reclaim energy items too.  I wouldn't wear that robe though, no hp.  MR is useful for resisting fears and such, but the other resistances are usually pointless.  Once you're over 100 in each, you can be buffed to close to 200 in them, and any higher doesn't add as much as wearing HP gear would.  However, since the robe is a joke not really worth pointing out why its good or bad.  VI said they're planning on putting focus effects on SoL armor (makes your nukes cast faster, hit more, cost less, less resisted; heals are faster, more efficient, etc) rather than spells that are either crappy, or have their cast/recast times made so crappy they'd almost never be used. <p>~~

I don't really see twinking as any different than farming for cash.  Either way the character gets equipment that he/she did not quest/kill for or loot. (Please don't bring up the argument that if one character on an account earned something, they all did.  That is another debate.)  So one could even be extreme and say that you are not worthy of any gear you paid for, rather than camp, quest, or kill for.  If this is the case, we really have no need for vast amounts of money, as spells, food, etc can be bought with modest amounts of platinum.  <br>
<br>
But what about items that nobody would use by the level they are self-attainable?  The green silk drape comes to mind.  Should we just destroy all those since higher levels do not want them and all lower levels did to get them was raise cash?  I bought a green silk drape at level 30, and even then thought it was nice.  At level 5, like the green silk drape or not, it would have seemed &quot;uber&quot; to me. <br>
<br>
I can see how a person who's character has never been twinked might (notice I say might) get upset at the thought of &quot;uber&quot; gear being attainable simply with money, but I suspect most characters at this point have been twinked a little since the game has been out quite a while.  Also, please note their is twinking, and there is TWINKING.  I think we all know the difference in the two.<br>
<br>
In the end, it is just a game.  We are Magicians, and as it has been stated in the past, give us a bag of malachite and we are good to go if need be.  Equipment is a nice enhancement, sometimes an even nicer status symbol, but we can survive with average gear.  <br>
<br>
Play the game the way you want to.  If you want to spend your time of raids summoning mod rods while you wait for an Apothic robe, great, you are seeing lots of cool stuff in the game.  However, if someone else wants to spend their time leveling and earning cash to buy an Apothic robe (were in not no-drop), let them.  Just have fun.  As for me, I will be traveling the world in my green silk drape with a smile on my face.<br>

P.S.  I look like a Lime Skittle in my green silk drape, but I still love being a Mage.  )<br>
<br>
P.S.S I wanted to reply to Sarion after reading his post.  If all the casual gamers left EQ, there would be no EQ.  For every person in an Uber Guild like Afterlife, there are probably 10 or more not in uber guilds.  I agree with you that joining a large guild is the best way to enjoy all aspects of the game, but I assure you it is the money of all the casual players that keeps the game afloat.  I could be wrong, but I am guessing at least half of EQ's customer base is made up of casual gamers, probably closer to 60-70%.    <br>
<br>
*On a side note, anyone ever seen an information on average guild size/character level by server or as a whole?  That would be neat information to see.  Seeing average time played would be cool to look at as well. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=copperrfield>Copperrfield </A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.domdeluise.com/gallery/nimh.jpg BORDER=0> at: 8/10/01 3:34:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uanguss.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Anguss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 69<br> <font color=#333333>(8/10/01 3:38:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=130.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://members.home.net/moonie1/thumbnails/cyris_som_th.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Luclin Uber Magician Robe!</span><hr size=1> Welp, you could always move servers if you don't like the politics.  Maybe I'm not understanding why you think a massively-multiplayer game should cater to soloists.  As for the &quot;uber&quot; philosophy.  Sure to do large-target raids you need lots of folks, but a significant portion of really nice gear is dropped by mobs capable of being killed by 2-group combinations of talented players.  I hate to say it, but if you can't find a guild with that many peeps willing and able to face that kinda challenge, then this prolly isn't the game for you.  My main gear has been gradually going no-drop.  I used to bitch about velious and caster gear, but given the drops the last 2 months I can't complain anymore.  Of course, the stuff is nodrop, ya gotta be there and contribute if ya want the loot. <p>Toem 51 mage<br>

<br>
I was talking about the Quest robe or/and the other top Mage rob in SoV.<br>
<br>
TOV is another situation all together.<br>
<br>
Comparably melee classes can get better equipment then int casters with less group effort.  This is an unbalance.<br>

You don't need to kiss ass to get into a guild that can help you get the gear you so desire. The other person who responded had a good point. I was in ToV, with a chance of dying and you want to buy the same robe for running around Guk and having no worries of death, since you are such a skilled mage? &gt;&gt;<br>

Speak for your own server... I qualified my statement with &quot;On my server&quot;.  Maybe on your server proplr love mages and are easy going and fun.  Hell, that would be great.  Congrats on making the right server choice.<br>

<br>
&quot;I realize what I said upsets the kids here that are going though that point in their lives where its important to them to have a sence of self worth and of power over their enviornment. Hell I was a young adult once to&quot;<br>
<br>
Wow, and since when the @#%$ did being an adult make you so high an mighty?  Jesus, how old are you?  and you play a game, and get as worked up about it as most ppl that do play it(including &quot;kids&quot;).  imo you are fuckin sad if you try an pull age off as makin you better.  my friends known ages(i don't go askin em, when it comes into a guildchat conversation or so) range from bout 14-42 or so.  age does not matter a damn bit.  It could be argued that you work a 9 to 5 job, in a cubicle, takin @#%$ from some loser boss, and have to feel better about yourself by playing a game where you have some real power, more effectively imo then &quot;kids&quot; who need to feel real power, why don't you go and beat your wife or somethin, make you feel like a real man then(well, if you are a man /shrug).<br>
<br>
FYI i'm 17 years old.<br>
<br>
But no, if you want the good items bad enough, go kiss that ass.  i know i sure as hell would if that was the case(and it isnt for me, and isnt for you).  While you play in groups, if you notice someone who seems pretty cool, and is in a decent sized guild, make friends an tell him you're interested in joining.  if he aint an officer, he'll hook you up with one.  and you'll be able to start goin on their raids as they see if you're cool(and since you like braggin bout your skillz it seems, you'd have no prob impressin them right?).  The only place i could see you'd have to kiss ass would be to join a guild like LoS/AL/FoH/etc.., like the TOP guild of your server.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what you believe, there isnt a conspiricy of politics to keep ppl like you down, and out of the very high end game.  I spent quite a bit of time in hate before i got my apothic robe, and earth staff(though there are those who've spent FAR more time there, and still are).  I know I, and anyone else who've been after these(except for lucky bastards that get em on their first try) would be damn pissed to see some dick market rat buy what they worked their ass off, dieing multiple times prolly to get. <p>Thon Tarliser

And yes you act evey bit of 17.  Thanks for validating my point.<br>
<br>
I don't need to fill my posts up with 4 letter words and vulgarity to get my point across.<br>
<br>
You know, I started hanging out on the Wizard message boards.  Why is it evey time I go there I see an organized and united community?  I come here and I see people in the middle of pissing contests.  Go figure?<br>
<br>
Yeah your right, real life sucks to.  I work for a living.  The thing is I am the boss where I work.  EQ to me is a hobby.  Ofocuse we get worked up about it.. we all do.  And most of us just hate the fact we get nerfed so damn much.<br>
<br>
As for kissing ass, if you have to do that in a game then you are truly sad.  I have noticed how little loyalty people have to their guildmates or in game friends when it comes to loot/gear.<br>
The level of greed this game brings out in people truly sickens me.<br>

They are very fair to all.  It seems to me that you always use wizards as an example of a &quot;united&quot; community.  I am thinking you choose the wrong class and maybe since you are 60, make a wizard and go hang on their boards.  This way the people who enjoy playing the mage class can do so without someone always complaining about nerfs and such.  I am just making a suggestion, and yes I know we have had some changes, not disagreeing with you there.  I am just sick of seeing your post about using the wizards as an example, if you like it, join them.<br>

You are damn thick skulled aint ya?  I said you DIDNT have to kiss ass, only that there's a tad chance if you wanted in like the TOP guild of your server.  <br>

What server do you play on btw?  I'm pretty sure i asked that last time, why don't ya answer which &quot;old school&quot; server w/ all these guilds that hate mages, and you gotta kiss ass to get in?<br>

Follow advice in my previous post for joining a sizeable guild capable of doing high end raids, since it'd prolly be wasted if i posted it here again, since you don't seem to pay attention much. <p>Thon Tarliser

The Familars may be like that but I doubt it.. they seem to be heading the direction of stat/rezistance increasers.<br>

<br>
I've said this before, but it's always worth repeating..<br>
If you don't like the game (dislike it so much that all you can do is complain endlessly about it), then quit the game and go find one that better suits your play style.  It's a simple solution to a simple problem.  Or better yet, go to the book store, buy some good books, rent some movies, go out and have some fun, play some sports.. whatever.  EQ is not the be all end all source of entertainment.
