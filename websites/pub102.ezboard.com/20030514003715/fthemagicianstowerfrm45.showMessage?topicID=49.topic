<br>
But let me start off by saying that, even more so, I love the /viewport command.  For those of you who don't know what a viewport is, it is the set dimensions from which you can view the virtual world (in this case, the viewport contains the world of EQ).  The fading in and out of the windows grated on my nerves, so I did away with that by changing their properties (right click and change the alpha properties).  If you want to see what I have done with my UI customization so far, click <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://rhionsligo.0catch.com/myUI1.html">Here1</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> and <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://rhionsligo.0catch.com/myUI2.html">Here2</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->.<br>
<br>
The bazaar is amazing. You can find nearly any specific item easily there (provided it is being sold), and it is real easy to find the person you want to buy from (just right click his name in the bazaar window and your character gets pointed towards his direction).  I found small velium bricks for sale for 10pp last night, so I was happy.  I also left my computer on last night so that I could sell some junk I had (Spell:Transon's Phantasmal Protection, 2 crushed flame opals, a crushed onyx sapphire, and a crushed black marble).  When I awoke at 6:20AM this morning, the crushed flame opals and the crushed onyx sapphire were sold.  The bazaar window kept track of everyone who had inspected my goods, as well as who bought each item.  There seems to be an overload of low and mid level items being dumped for sale at the bazaar, so expect prices on mid level gear to go wayyyyy down.  High level gear doesn't seem to be flooding or sold anymore than before, so I'd say that prices on them won't change anymore than they do normally.<br>
<br>
The spell icons....well....I'd say this is the one thing I really don't like.  Before, all the icons were very similar, so if you were looking for a certain *type* of spell, you could easily find those types of spells, then search more narrowly for the one you wanted.   Now, most of the icons are unique to their spell, and it is difficult to remember (at this time) which is which.  It's a nightmare.  The 3 more spells per page was real nice, and it didnt take very long for me to reorganize my book since it was organized to begin with.<br>
<br>
The chat filters are exactly what we needed.  Spam begone!<br>
<br>
The pet window is VERY lacking.  It is not customizable from within the game,  and does not contain the command /pet hold.  The /pet get lost button is right next to the /pet back off button and is equal in size, which is something I feel is dangerous.  Personally, I'd have liked to change the buttons on that window around (for example, my current pet attack hotkey has:  &quot;/pet back off, /pet attack&quot;. This allows me to make my pet switch targets quickly.)  But the thing that makes this window the *most* useless is that there are no direct hotkey links to the buttons.  If you don't know what I mean, think outside the box...  To get to your spell book, you sure could put a &quot;Spells&quot; button in your hotkey window and press the appropriate hotkey on the keyboard, however you could also just press CTRL B (or change that key to just B if you wanted), thereby saving a slot in your hotkeys.  The pet buttons are not directly mapped to keys on the keyboard, rendering them pointless (at least for me).<br>
<br>
I think the green line depicting pet HP is awesome, even though it doesnt update as fast as I'd like (it updates just as fast as any groupmate's HP bar does.).  I feel that, since it is my pet, it should update *very* frequently at least on my end, so that I can respond quickly.<br>
<br>
The inventory window is too big and clunky.  Its got a uselessly huuuuge autoequip area, and all the equipment slots are all randomly strewn around it.  Hopefully I'll find a mod that decreases the size of this window and puts the slots in their previous format.  That being said, the spell book window has a lot of wasted space as well.<br>
<br>
All in all, I love the new interface and I look forward to seeing what crazy mods people come up with.<br>
<br>
<br>
The end.  Hope you enjoyed this. <p><img src="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dsf3/EQ/rhionsligo.jpg" align="center"><br>

<br>
As for mid-level gear, I noticed a different effect on StormHammer. <br>
<br>
As 90% or more of our server is level 60, there was a massive shortage of mid-level items. High end items had dropped considerably in price. Most auctions were for 1k + items.<br>
<br>
Now that the bazaar is active, there is actually a mid-level market again. Most of the prices I saw appeared to come straight from eqprices/allakazam. This will probably change some in the near future based on how quickly things are selling, but its refreshing to be able to find gear that I can afford. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I really like the querying capability, and to be able to instantly compare prices. <br>
<br>
The only knock against the system is people will still need to figure out a decent forum for Item Trades, as many people will be selling while AFK now. But I think that is a fair price to pay for what we've gotten with the new system..... <p>Naladini <BR>

What you said sounds great.<br>
<br>
I agree completely about the inventory.  Too big, too much wasted space.  The mod in the ui forum about making the class picture the autoequip box, with the re-arranged slots I hope he gets working.  Even a mod to change the inventory back to the old one would be nice, though having my little picture of two hands and a glowing ball would also be sweet.<br>
<br>
The spell icons are just too big.  The are rather odd.  I don't mind the new pictures for the most part (why are our shock spells a wand???  Hand!  Hand!!), but the icons on the side are a bit big.  I'd rather have what used to be on test, or the old style.  I find it is also harder to judge when a spell icon is ready, and when recovered from casting because of the fade in/fade out of the icons.  Only my own internal &quot;timing&quot; keeps me casting at max rate.<br>
<br>
I DO like the new amount of spells per page in the spellbook, but like rhion, I feel there is a lot of wasted space in there.  If it was more compact, and maybe the forward/back buttons near the bottom (hey, i'm used to it that way!), I'd be happy.  I'm sure there'll be a mod for that soon.  I'm keeping my eyes open.<br>
<br>
I don't have the huge problem with the pet window because quite frankly, I don't use it at all.  I use the &quot;seperate pet health bar mod&quot; from the ui forum that has in this order from the top: My HP, Pet HP (or blank if not summoned), My mana, My Sta, My Exp Bar.  With this, and my already hotkeyed pet commands, I see no real use for that pet box.  It's not even up.  Ever.<br>
<br>
I really like how they changed /pet report.  Being able to see the buffs on my pet is awesome.  I used to need to hit that key quite often to monitor pet's health, but now I only need for checking the status of buffs.  My pet health bar is my normal updater.  I might be changing my key arrangement as a result (report possibly in less prominence), but that's a change I don't mind making.  Good suprise with buff reporting.<br>
<br>
I like most other things.  I have the fade-in/fade-out of most of the windows the way I like now, and the whole ui is faster, at least for me.  I hope our ui forum here blossoms with many different mods.  Exploring them will be fun.  I just hope that the &quot;modified&quot; settings that you do AFTER you hit /loadskin can be saved for each mod.  IE when you do another /loadskin, that your modifications to the old one (window position, amount of fading, etc) is preserved.  Not sure how to do that yet.  Always defaults on new skin loaded.  Oh well.  I still like the new UI.<br>

I felt exactly the same. This will be confusing for a while, especially for buffs, and especially for the &quot;old men of EQ&quot; who have spent years with the same icons.<br>
<br>
But I think we <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> will</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> get used to the new icons for specific spells, and eventually the advantage of being able to differentiate between buff and spell icons at a glance will pay off. <p><table width = 200 border = 0>
