I just recently camped them from 39-42 then they started conning light blue.  Here's what I did:<br>
<br>
Summon your 39 fire pet.  To check the lvl just send it in on one of the low mobs that walk nearby.  DO NOT accept one that hits for less than 38.  Summon him 2 dagger of symbols and a full suit of fine plate.  Be patient and let the pet DS himself.  Check the names on both druids,  if one is Ceel Moonwhisper You want to send the pet in on him first because he will drive you insane because he will heal the other one.  To pull  just send the pet in and they will both aggro him.  Count to 5  then cast renew elements on your pet.  Once the renew gem has repopped heal him again.  Then click on each to see which one is lowest in health.  Cast blaze once and he should be going down.  Here's the key part,  let the pet finish tanking the other one till death if his health is around 40% or so just to split the spawn up a little.  <br>
<br>
When the first one respawns IMMEDIATELY pull with malise to get him to come to you and out of the aggro range of the other.  Have a hot key set up to tell your pet to /pet back off so that he doesn't go to the spawn point When you get nuked.  Then just chain 2 blazes and he is usually running.  After that just send the pet in on the other.  You dont need to malise again except for the first respawn.<br>
<br>
Why fire and not air?  The druids (or rangers) use a fire based nuke which does little dmg to the fire pet plus the DS is ESSENTIAL when pulling off breaking the spawn. The fire-based DD hits for 175 btw.<br>
<br>
Please forgive the lenght as I just wanted no surprises for all my fellow mages )<br>

My advice is to get a 50+ druid passing through to cast HARMONY (if they will) on both of the druids. This will allow you to solo pull, and holding the spawn is a piece of cake. I reccomend air pet since his stun will interrupt those annoying heals.<br>
<br>
Camped these guys for 2 oranges in 40... took about 3 hours, made 600 plat in the meantime. Not bad, eh?<br>

The triick is to take the caster first, and use your bolt at 60% or less.  I just did 39-42 here.<br>
<br>
Fire pet, BO2, lev rings, elemental defender, summoned armor and daggers.  Basically you want all of the AC and saves you can get.  With the new patch giving you your strongest pet, you're in good shape.<br>
<br>
As you look north to the druid rings, the one on the left is the caster.  Send your pet in to him.  Make sure he stays on him -- I've had a couple cases where the pet has switched targets.<br>
<br>
Watch the casters health.  When he dips into the 70% range, nuke with your bolt.  He should be walking at that point, and yor pet should be around half life.  Nuke him again, and he'll go down.  Heal your pet if you want and try to drag out the battle with the second one a bit so you have time to kill the 1st pop on the next spawn.  Nuke with your bolt when the druid is anywhere under 40% health and you'll drop him instantly.<br>
<br>
After that, I park my pet on their spot and when the next pop happens (caster), I send him in instantly.  Malise and bolt at  60% or so and he's dead.  Then wait a minute or two to spread out the spawn a bit.<br>
<br>
Once you've broken the spawn, this is an easy camp.  Your pet can solo either of them without your help.   And the loot is amazing... from 39-42 I made about 5.5kp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufarmatyr1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>farmatyr1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 143<br> <font color=#333333>(8/7/02 7:38:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Easy break</span><hr size=1> I found a good trick to breaking it. Haven't perfected it yet, but think it'll make it easier. The druids seem to have about 800hp. They won't heal themselves until they are below 60% health. So, if you send in the pet, wait for him to get the first one to just over 3 bubbles, and then cast cinder bolt, he won't have healed himself yet, but he'll be low enough that with luck from the bracer, the bolt will finish him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ustehle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>stehle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#333333>(10/21/02 3:47:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Easy break</span><hr size=1> There are two ways to break this camp:<br>
<br>
1)  watch with amusement as a lvl 11 DE necro ports in and then runs off and dies.  pull the druids as they walk back (since only one goes returns home at a time).<br>
<br>
2)  Lvl 39 water pet (focus)-- plate, daggers of symbols x 2, ring of flight x 2, elemental defender.  cast expedience (probably not really necessary), BOII, Barrier of Combustion and send your pet in.  Make sure you attack the MALE druid first because he heals.  When is health is ~ 45% range nuke him with cinder bolt to finish him off.  Much lower than that and he will start to heal and you will start having to worry about your pet health.  Once he is dead, heal your pet and let him finish off the other druid.  Take your time, prolong the fight as long as possible..<br>
<br>
Once the druid pops again...immediately pull him away from the rings.  I usually set up south of the rings and in this case I would nuke him and run over that hill (while keeping your pet at bay).  Eventually he should show up and then you can engage him and kill (see above tactics).  Wait a bit to break the spawn and then go kill the other druid.  Wash, rinse, repeat.<br>
<br>
The experience is +/- 1% per kill (I'm using the new GUI-- I don't pay attention to blues per kill anymore).  In other words, exp isn't all that good but the loot is great.  You can easily clear anywhere from 5 plat (FS weapons) on up to 20 plat (FS weapons, bow, and gem or something) per kill.<br>
<br>
Good luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=silinye>silinye</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#333333>(12/21/02 2:53:24 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Easy break</span><hr size=1> I killed the two druids that spawn in ec throughout 41 until 42 (they turn light blue at 42).  Basically I parked my pet (fire w/ plate, bracer,rings,daggers, burnout and expedience) a little ways from the camp and nuked one with cinderbolt from a distance to break the spawn. Usually what happened is that the druid would come running and I would send my pet in. Depending on how much damage I did with my nuke, my pet was usually able to keep him/her off of me. Using malaise works just as well for pulling and is generally safer, as landing a 369+ nuke tends to really irk them.   Once the first druid was dead, I would bring pet and myself closer, kill the other druid and then sit down to med. I think there was about 5 - 6 minute respawn time.<br>
<br>
The only real difficulty I encountered in breaking the spawn was that sometimes the druid would not run over to me. I tried to malaise or nuke from a distance and run back a bit. The druid would stand there and cast on me, or, he/she would use a ranged weapon on me and my pet would go flying in to bonk them. Killing two at once is doable, but for me it usually got very messy =( <br>
<br>
There are two types: druids and rangers. Both dropped fine steel weapons, chain armor and the occasional water/mead/beer. Coin drop was good too.  Spells cast consisted of ensnaring roots, creeping crud and lightning bolt(?). The most damage I took from them in one nuke was 174. However, melee is a whole other story, they can hit hard and fast - causing me to run in circles while my pet tries to get them off of me.  <br>
<br>
The money was awesome. I made 500pp and went from 41 to 42. At 42 they conned light blue to me so I moved on =) <br>
cheers and good luck!<br>

Cast Barrier of Combustion on Air.  The Air's stun is helpful but the Fire Pet's high fire resist is more beneficial.  Make sure you give your pet the set of Plate armor and two daggers.  Keep your eyes out for people playing Druids that take roleplaying seriously.  I had a level 46 Druid start healing them when I was trying to break the spawn.  Once the spawn is broken however it is so easy to hold them camp.  Summon some bags and sit back to rake in fine steel.  I suggest binding yourself to the zone line of EC.  If you are in trouble or if some high level person kills the merchant on the other side of the rings then you're only a button push away. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=korff>Korff</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(2/21/03 10:43:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: How can u guys solo those Druids in WC?</span><hr size=1> PCs can't heal NPCs.<br>
