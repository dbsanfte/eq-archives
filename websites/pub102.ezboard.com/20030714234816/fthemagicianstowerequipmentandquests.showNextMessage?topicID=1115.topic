Don't even think of fighting Gornit at your level, however, Gornit is one of the most heavily camped mobs in the game so if you go to OOT and find out who's camping they should let you hang around and loot a set of toes, unless they are totally greedy.  You can always offer to bank for them cos they will be getting very encumbered.<br>
<br>
For the gems there's little for it than to take the hit on your savings, the gems drop off 40+ mobs like seafury cyclopses and sell to NPCs for over 50pp so it's unlikely that someone will just let you loot one.<br>
<br>
The brooms and shovels etc are rare drops off magicians in Najena.  You'll be lucky to survive long in there at 21, best get a group cos you'll be in there for quite a while.  Lvl 50ish mages have to hunt the same magicians for epic drops, so if you find a senior mage farming Najena, ask if you can tag along.  Can't comment on whether it is easier to get them off Alligators in Feerrott, since that patch was after my time.<br>
<br>
The other bits and pieces like griffin feathers you can find on traders in the zones where they drop if you are patient, especially soon after a patch when the traders have been reset.  The traders on Sister Isle on Ocean of Tears (first stop out of Freeport) can have quite a few bits if you're lucky but the toes can be pricey, best to get friends with the Gornit campers if you're strapped for cash <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Failing all this, try the bazaar, if you hang around long enough you'll find some decent folk who hang onto quest items and sell them for a small amount.  There are, of course, rip-off scum who try to sell at prices that a first time player could not afford. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uflambodius.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Flambodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#333333>(8/12/02 2:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Focus quest items</span><hr size=1> I've bought the torch, stein, shovel, and broom-- some of them more than once (made a mistake and turned in the broom instead of the shovel once, and have given items to magician friends).<br>
<br>
The most successful tactic for me has been /auctioning for them in bazaar.  Once I found one in a bazaar search (I think I filtered for Primary but I'm not sure).  But the most successful has been auction.  Usually someone knows someone who has one, or perhaps an alternate character has one.<br>
<br>
I did this starting at level 20, and it was quite expensive for me.  I harvested gargoyle eyes in Ocean of Tears to finance this undertaking.<br>
<br>
I highly recommend getting your torch first if you can, and getting the research components for your 24 fire pet.  My focused 20 firepet outperformed my unfocused 24 earth pet by a wide margin when fighting gargoyles.  Now that I have my 24 fire pet and a torch-- he's fearsome. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ravian>Ravian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 92<br> <font color=#333333>(11/5/02 3:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Focus quest items</span><hr size=1> I fought for the 4 items from the mages I bought most the other stuff in the bazaar.

1. Toes - Got all 4 sets from the HElf vendor in OOT where we buy our pet spells. Cost was around 7-9pp each.<br>
2. Griffon feather - Gypsy vendor in NK. Around 10pp.<br>
3. Gargoyle eye - Same lady as in #1. There are Gargoyles in OOT on Spectre Isle. Around 10pp.<br>
4. Mermaid Scale - Had to farm this, couldn't find it in Bazaar or any vendors in OOT. I just took boat from BB and jumped off the first rocks. Killed a single Alluring Siren and she dropped it. No charge <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
5. Broom, shovel, etc. - Looked in Bazaar on and off for 3 days never saw any of these. I pulled at my Wiz and went to Najena. I only did Magicians but somebody in the zone said anything in the zone can drop them. I'm not sure if that's true and I wasn't taking chances. I just did a 3-4 camp cycle - On way into main area there's 1 Mage in the entry area, 1 that stands not far from there by a gate as you're heading to the stairs that take you N, the 3-4 Gobs standing in SE corner (what spawns here changes so you may get 1-3 Magicians in here), heading N from the Gobs (past a black widow) there's another 4-5 spawn Gob camp, and lastly the Crystal Room. I got 2 of the items in Crystal, 1 from one of the Mages on way in, and 1 from the 2 Gob camps.<br>
6. Gems - Found a couple at gem vendor in SH but couldn't find a star ruby or sapphire. Went to Felwithe and checked gem vendors there. Couldn't find either on most of them but the 1 in the bldg just as you zone into SFel had the sapphire and star ruby. Guess they are drop instead of normal vendor sellable. /shrug. Total cost for all (this is with a 110 Cha) and Ally to HElf &amp; Amiably to SH vendors, was around 400pp.<br>
<br>
That's it.

<br>
It took a few hours to get the broom, shovel and torch to drop in Najena. The items do drop off of any mage in the dungeon - as the broom dropped several times in different locations. It may be easier to camp Rathyl's room/ Mage room - however I would not suggest this unless you have a full group and are level 20+.<br>
<br>
The hardest item for me to get was the stein. I camped Najena mages for over 2 days and it didn't drop once. A higher level ended up giving it to me when it dropped for them. The broom dropped a lot :0 <br>
<br>
I ended up having to buy the gems - which took a week or two of spider silk, bone chip and pelt farming to get the money needed. I killed in lavastorm to get the fire drake scale, and also used the loot from the munsters I killed to go towards the cost of the gems (My mages charisma is fairly low, so if possible get a buff to improve your charisma so buying them doesn't hurt so much). <br>
Also, hunting in guk yeilded atleast 50pp for me - I went there with a friend to camp the froglok tonta knight for the soiled boots (for earthen boots) - wasn't successful, but yeilded a nice sum for a few hours of work.<br>
<br>
I killed in karana during my teens, so I saved every feather dropped from the griffons there to go towards this quest. <br>
<br>
The toes and gargoyle eyes i got very lucky with. I bought the eye in neriak (i'm a de mage) and the toes in the bazaar.  It took some farming on my part to get the cash to do so - as I was also heavily (and perhaps stupidly) spending money on components needed so I could have my level 29 earth pet. What a waste lol :0<br>
<br>
Mermaid scale was very easy, I jumped off of the boat and swam to the isle. Killed two and got a scale right off.  Getting back ON the boat took two tries heehee :0  First time I swam under and then up but wasn't quick enough=) (I was with a friend who cannot gate and needed invis to get through freeport, so we tried to get back together).<br>
<br>
Easiest = mermaid scale and, of course, items bought.<br>
Longest= items from Najena <br>
Ouchiest = cost of gems :0<br>

<br>
The allagators that were inside Cazic Thule used to drop them also. With the changes to CT they were moved to allagators outside in fearrot so can also be gotten there.<br>

Kill only magicians if you will, but your missing another 50% chance of drop from the other spawns<br>

I actually looted 2 of my pages for epic off the DBS in Najana, and saw a shovel drop on them.<br>

Never seen the goblins drop anything, but then wasn't really killing them.<br>

I bought my torch and my broom for around 10-20p each, and after a while in Najena, I ended up with 4 steins, a torch, a broom, and all four pages of the elements, and at least one duplicate of each page - and still no shovel (one of each of the extra focus item drops went to a very happy guildie who was exping in Lavastorm).  I periodically travel to the bazaar to check prices on the shovel, and typically see it listed (when its available) at prices ranging from 150-200.  Last night, someone had one up for 500.<br>
I don't *need* the shovel right away.  The earth pet is probably my least favorite pet, which means I don't absolutely need the shovel until its time to do epic hand-ins.  But it would be nice to know whether the high prices or the low prices are considered normal on most servers.<br>

I was still killing them til I was 26 because the broom just would not drop for me.  I had the others + the pages for the epic for at least two levels.  I had grouped a couple of times while in there one of the groupies said he had a broom.  We were to meet the next night. I was there early killing magicians.  The guy sent me a tell telling me he made a trip back to the bank to get the broom.  He had it and was on the way.  Of course before he got here, it dropped.  <br>
<br>
Any way, at 25 I started taking a Dark Bone Skeleton in my spawn cycle because they were good EP and decent treasure.  After I got the pieces, I then started killing DBS for ep.  They were 4 of them and all of them can be single pulled.  The only problem was if the wandering orge guard wander by just after you started attacking one.   I stayed there until I was 32.  Not once did any of the focus pieces drop.  This was about May of 2002.  .  <br>
<br>
I sucspect the loot tables for the DBS got linked to the magicians tables and probably (have been) /(will be) fixed.  If you are high level and hunting for the pieces, it probably won't hurt to try them, but I don't think they will drop them for long.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kiediscuchulainn>Kiedis CuChulainn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/03 2:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: buy em</span><hr size=1> Just last night I killed Rathyl and Rathly Reincarnate and the Reincarnate dropped A Stein and a Traveler's Pack.<br>
