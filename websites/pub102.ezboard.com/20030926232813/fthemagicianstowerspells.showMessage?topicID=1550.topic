<br>
Was going to ask you about this on the black steel vs. insanity thread, but it got locked.;p<br>
<br>
This is the effect on the necro particle weapon:<br>
<br>
Torment of Shadows -<br>
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 75 per tick <br>
2:  Decrease Movement by 11% (L1) to 65% (L55) <br>
Duration: 1.6mins.<br>
<br>
This is a spell in what I assume is the same line (correct me if I am wrong):<br>
<br>
Embracing Darkness -<br>
1:  Decrease Hitpoints by 123 per tick <br>
2:  Decrease Movement by 73% (L63) to 75% (L65) <br>
Duration: 1.5mins.<br>
Level 63.<br>
<br>
Enchanter Particl Weapon Effect:<br>
Speed of the Shissar -<br>
1:  Increase Attack Speed by 66% <br>
2:  Increase AGI by 40 <br>
4:  Increase Stamina Loss by 0 <br>
5:  Decrease Stamina Loss by 3 <br>

<br>
Enchanter spell:Level 60<br>

1:  Increase Attack Speed by 58% <br>
2:  Increase AGI by 40 <br>
3:  Increase DEX by 25 <br>
4:  Increase ATK by 20 <br>
<br>
(This spell does in fact have lower haste, but has become more popular for many people...and it is from the exact era of the particle weapon itself.)<br>
<br>
How is this different then the a situation where our particle weapon spell can be replaced by a dropped spell?<br>
<br>
Yes, our particle weapon should not be easily replaced.  But why can it not be replaced by a more difficult to get spell?  All I have seen you say is that its wrong for the particle weapon to be worse then a spell you can buy at a vendor..which is 100% correct.<br>
<br>
I want you to honestly look at our particle weapon quest.  And when you do, I would like you to pick out parts that are hard to do by today's standards.  I'm not asking you which parts take the longest to do.  Simply which are the hardest to do.  Difficulty being measured by things like: how many people are required, what kind of gear those people are expected to have to pull it off with those numbers, what levels, how hard it is for these people to fight through the encounter.  <br>
<br>
In this day and age I can only see the Plane of Air item being considered hard-rather then time consuming if your unlucky.  <br>
<br>
Also, I would like to talk to you about a point you brought up.  That point being: &quot;Not many mages have their epic(particle weapon) and those who do are almost always 60&quot;.  Look at when particle weapons were introduced into the game.  They were better then many of the highest end items.  And I only say many because I do not keep up on all of the items different classes can get from kunark so I will give room for error.  In that time period, particle weapons were the end-all-be-all of items.  Items dropping off challenging encounters (for the period).  Only the better guilds would have a shot at them.  They were clearly designed to be in the hands of level 60's at that time.  And to an extent, I believe they still are.  The fact that you see lower level people in lower tier guilds getting them alone should point out that they are not as hard as they used to be.<br>
<br>
I brought up the point that a level 49 mage had his particle weapon.  And questioned if it is right for that mage to have a pet equal to a level 60(perhaps 65) mage and better then a 60/65 necro/beastlord.  You ignored it based on the fact that a 49 supposedly cannot get their particle weapon.  Well, lets say its a 51 mage, does that make it any more right?  If you follow that logic you can say that a level 4 mage should have a better pet then a 60/65 necro/beastlord, which I do not think anyone would agree to....Why is it different for a 51 mage? 51-65 is still a large gap, especially the way the game is designed for the higher levels.  <br>
<br>
I don't want to start any fights over something like this, even though it might seem that way as I argue the point alot.  But this is one of the few areas I feel strongly about when it comes to my mage.  I really do not want to see another expansino go by where I am forced to use an old spell.  I do not want to have to hope for patch upgrades to keep me where I should be.  I do not want to continue to lack some of fun that having to choose certain pets for certain situations brought.  <br>
<br>
When SoL came out and I saw that wizards were having true nukes that were out of reach in the beginning but you could work toward and eventually have to seperate you from lower levels and people who only sit in seb, I was excited.  And then a little disappointed that the same wasn't true of our pets.  I miss the feeling of hitting the next spell level and going out trying to get the items to research my spells.  I miss the rather noticable power upgrades of those levels.  Now all I see is an eternally capped portion of our class (and my favorite part might I add).  Capped because people cling to the idea of it being &quot;epic&quot; and should forever have the security of being the top pet-for whatever reasons they push that point.    <br>
<br>
Look at all the posts recently on the PoP spells.  So many on nukes, very few concerning the pets.  Yes, nukes are important to us.  But pets are atleast equally so, yet we ignore them on the feeling that our particle weapon should forever remain the best....that these spells are not even worth getting for someone who has their particle weapon.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I would like to see what you have to say in its entirety, not the forced snipets pushed into a topic that wasn't meant to talk about it.  Please though, answer the questions I have so atleast I can understand your side better.  Rather then just stating-ie. poa is hard- and never explaining why or completely dismissing me.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showPrevMessage?topicID=1550.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showNextMessage?topicID=1550.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1550.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.threadControl?topicID=1550.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1550.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/subscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to receive email notification of replies"> Click to receive email notification of replies</a> <br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1550.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/ultimate/unsubscribe.gif width=20 height=20 border=0 alt="Click to stop receiving email notification of replies"> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies</a> <br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells>Spells</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
