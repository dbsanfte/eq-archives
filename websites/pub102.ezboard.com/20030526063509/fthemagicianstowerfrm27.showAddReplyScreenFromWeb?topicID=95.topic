A mage (bad guy by name and guild, pretty cool person though), started KS'ing all my kills, this was laughable cause for his mage to do so he had to go oom alot (I didn't have my pet at the time he was doing this, but 1 nuke and 1 pierce o the ole dagger was enough to ensure xp.<br>
<br>
Naturally I obtained my pet and reached lvl 6 (pvp+), this dude that was farking with me earlier was still only lvl 5.  Weeeeeeeeel, He dinged and thought he was all that, he died in about 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
2 Mages same lvl same spells and since pet changes same pets sorta.  He was a twinkie pvp dude, I was a newb to that server (though not new to a mage at all), despite his gear he just couldn't hold out against knowledge of playing the class.  <br>
<br>
Of Course I had him targeted in betwen fights, constantly /c'ing him so I knew when he would attack, so he dings, I stand and turn to see him running full force at me (gnomers are funny runners), I sic pet at him, and start casting as I hit autoattack.  Of course his pet naturally launched itself at mine (thus taking his pet out of the picture for the most part).  I mash my /pet back off hotkey til my pet is close enough to rip him up, and that it did.  When he ran I nuked to finish his pet, now he was stuck I was between him and the zone he was at 1 bulb health (I was 4 bulbs health) his pet was dead and mine was 3/4 health.<br>
<br>
I only had that newb robe on, while he was twinked out.  What made the difference?  3 things really, I had shielding up, I had wasted points in piercing and did tank to keep my defence skills up, and I had pet control.  Where as he didn't have his shielding up, he stopped tanking when he got pet, and even before that he was nuking (4dmg nuke) instead of meleeing (newb weap does 7). He made it to the zone with a sliver of health, and of course I had to ask him why he lost (he was calling me a newb earlier cause of my lack of gear), he started being nice after that and I proceeded to lvl.<br>
<br>
I was 1 kill from dinging 8, and some darkie comes up asking me for pieces to make a pet.  I was offended &quot;pieces to make a pet?!?!&quot; /c (showed even?!?!) /pet attack, 2 minutes later pet has 1 bulb of health off her so I back it off since she hasn't killed me yet.  I ask her if shes going to kill me, she says &quot;no all I need is a piece to make a pet&quot;.  Ahhhh I see where this is going, &quot;so I give you a malechite and your pet will eat me, yet if I don't you'll nuke me&quot; (she was obviously much higher than I since pet couldn't hit her much).  She says &quot;no if you stop now, I won't kill you&quot;, too late /pet attack and I nuke 1/4th of my mana which takes her to 3 bulbs health, I knew I had to meditate in case she decided to run.  Oppps wolf decided to help her out, so I sic pet on wolf momentarily, and OMFG she sat down WTF WTF /pet attack.  Hey I may be newer to PvP but I know a big spell usually comes shortly after people sit down for a second (she was meming a spell as she was on a corpse run).  <br>
<br>
She says &quot;your screwed now&quot; and begins to cast on me, WTF 4dmg!?!?!?? LMAO I am soooooo Screwed as I nuke her for 12, so she dies and I was missing 12 hp's (damn pet kept interupting her).  I go find that last kill to get my ding, then I quickly med enough to gate, since she was obviously bound in zone and now FM and health not to mention pissed as hell.  I get back to my home city and I send her a tell reguarding how I was screwed if I did and screwed if I didn't, she seemed polite despite it all, I then told her how the gnomer told me orange names (darkies) will kill me, she said it was a lie.  <br>
<br>
So I buy my spells and log, my damage was done.<br>
I only mentioned the mages that had crossed my mage.<br>
<br>
All in all, I took 2 mages, 1 ranger (told him &quot;remember the quillmane&quot;), a warrior and a druid (told him &quot;here let me revieve you of your Lewtz so I can sell them back to yas&quot;).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the zoneline saved a couple of wizzards and even more druids.  A few mages lost their pets and I am sure they were having trouble figuring out where they went (as they never attacked me afterwards), it is just too funny to watch a mage /pet attack and nuke then realize his pet is well ummm dead, I can't take credit for killing these mages I left the fun part to the mobs, as I laughed over the loss of their pets.  I really think I like PvP, some people run and some people die, it is fun.  Maybe I'll go back there and see how long the mage holds out in pvp, I mean I know lvl 8 isn't anything in pvp but the darkie I took was in her 20's (though she didn't really fight back and was naked, I was drooling cause erm nm).  <br>
<br>
The point of this though, pvp mages KEEP your shielding up, sure the lvl 1 shield doesn't have magic resist but at 8 they do and it helps you 2 ways, not to mention the ac yeah ok 5 ac isn't much but it was enough for a basically naked mage (that kept his defence up) to take down a twinkie mage (in one of the dreaded guilds on that server).  LEARN to contol your pet, and how to read it's health.  How many mages could have been saved had they checked their pets before they engaged a mob?  I mean these guys were all zoning and probably didn't have time to think &quot;where was my pet?&quot;, ohh well I was just forcibly making them practice their defensive skills (since they didn't seem to learn, killed 1 mages pet 8 times and he never attacked me, so he probably had no clue).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I had a blast, and I had to share it with someone...ANYONE....<br>
<br>
Though I am still wondering who those people are with the neato Yellow tags, they seem real smart.  2 blue names and 2 yellow names were fighting in the lowby area, both melees were melee'ing and the other 2 were healers and all they did was heal.  This is pointless to me, all it is, is a contest of who has the most mana.  I asked the blue guy why he didn't just kill the healer and be done with it?  He said &quot;cause if I attack the cleric, he will attack my druid&quot;, obviously these 2 gents that were hitting in the 100's had never heard of sow.  I mean how far is that yellow named melee going to chase the blue druid before he realizes he needs to save his cleric?  How flipping hard would it have been for the druid to have snared/rooted him while he was on his way back to the cleric? or even DoT'ed him once?  Nope these 2 bluebies lost cause they treated the druid like a cleric, though the druid did get evac off, which I couldn't believe the cleric didn't even try to interupt it (they were sooooooo dead).  Yep my thoughts are PvP's aren't too bright, so it should be an easy server to play on, specially since I can KS every kill and get full xp without having to waste mana, and I'll get to hunt down druids and rangers. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 824<br> <font color=#333333>(8/19/02 6:47:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PvP Mages the problem is not the class.</span><hr size=1> im not sure what it is youre trying to say... but playing on a pvp server for 10 mins really doesnt give you the right to exclaim mages have no problem in pvp :/<br>
<br>
higher level pvp, when everyone has <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> resist gear</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and when your pet is pathetic vs higher level, high ac melees, you would see mages do have real problems.<br>
<br>
1) NO low resist way to do damage. all our nukes are slow casting and easily resistable. in pve this is not much of a problem, but in pvp it is.<br>
<br>
2) NO way to heal ourselves or mitigate damage aside from pet. again, this is not a problem in pve since most mobs are stupid enough to let our pet tank, unfortunately players are a just a wee bit smarter. <br>
<br>
im sure pvp mages exadurate alot about problems (as pve mages do CONSTANTLY whining about how their pet cant hit aow), but that doesnt mean they dont exist. they do. <p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" background="http://www.sebminas.com/eq/sig.jpg" width="490"><tr><td style=filter:glow(color="0080FF") valign="top"  height="10"><font size="3"><br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp<a style="font-weight:bold ;color:FFE8E8; text-decoration: none" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330">Noonie Violetskies</a></font></td></tr><tr><td height="116" valign="top"><font size="4" color="white"> <b>&nbspArch Mage of Thunderwalkers</b></font></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukarrmerrcubed.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Karrmerr Cubed</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(8/19/02 7:00:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PvP Mages the problem is not the class.</span><hr size=1> he obviously knows mages are good in pvp cuz he leveled one up to 8! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukryptopholus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kryptopholus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(8/19/02 7:03:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PvP Mages the problem is not the class.</span><hr size=1> haha playing on pvp server for some minutes and think he knows everything.<br>

<br>
Granted I my pvp experience is from lots of arena and duels... however I have no complaints about mages in pvp, as I honestly have no trouble killing basically any class.  Mages have 1 HUGE advantage over any class in pvp.  That advantage our range.  We have the most damaging bolts in the game.  Use them.  Send your pet on the opponent and run far far away from them then shoot bolts while you are out of their melee or casting range.  If they move to you, run or gate away again =P.  Its rather simple and works almost every time. <p><img src="http://shade.austin2600.org/gtt2.jpg"> </a><p>

<br>
wait till you try to pvp at 50 plus - every other class will just root your pet first off and then all your left with is your slow casting, proubly get resisted blast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uforyst.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Foryst</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 70<br> <font color=#333333>(8/20/02 8:15:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Bolts?</span><hr size=1> Only idiots get hit by bolts...<br>
<br>
But besides that,<br>
On PvP servers most battles occur in places with lots of hills where bolts aren't that effective anyway.  (Most of the highly contested areas just seem to be very hilly.)<br>
<br>
Furthermore, most of the time your epic pet is between you and them (since they are probably running away from you, and EVERYONE runs from the epic pet.) and will get hit by the bolt instead of them.<br>
<br>
Also, on PvP servers people don't stand still and let you cast spells on them that often.  Since they are almost certainately moving if you cast a bolt at extreme range, more likely than not by the time your slow casting bolt spell goes off you will get the &quot;Target is out of range&quot; message.<br>

If you have run3, you can probably keep up with them, enough to cast scars of sigil at least.<br>
