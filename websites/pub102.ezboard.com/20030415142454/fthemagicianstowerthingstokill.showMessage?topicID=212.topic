Note that when I hit 51 my /playtime was just under 15 days...yes, under 15 days. I was twinked and had all my focus items since level one but never powerleveled, I started out with 200 int and some hitpoint and mana gear but I believe any magician can still achieve this without twinking, although it may add up to five days to your playtime. Statwise I maxed out my INT and put the other 5 into agility, although I think strenght is also a viable option. Also I meleed all the way up into level 39, and on occasion I still melee but only if the mob is in flee mode. You decide when its time to stop, I know most casters stop at level 12-16, although Magicians Phantom Armor line makes us ideal melee casters. Ok, lets get started.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 1-10: Get over to the newbie log and start whacking and whatnot. I hit level 4 in around an hour. Now go buy your Fire pet, run back to the newbie log and summon one until it cons yellow. Now start pulling mutiples and using your area affect. I was killing around 5 fire beetles at a time pretty easily. Next roam out into the woods a little and start killing bears and skeletons and move over to the undead ruins and start killing skeletons and stuff, you'll be level 8 in no time. Again, get that fire pet, summon a yellow and stay at the ruins until level 10.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 11-12: Move out into East Commons and start killing anything blue or even. This includes asp, Kodiaks, basically anything that gives you XP. Side note: If you get poisoned from a snake and you know you are going to die GATE. There is some kinda bug that is actually usefull, when you return to your bind point you will be at half health and all your buffs gone(bad) BUT the poison will be gone also(good). Doesn't take long at all to hit level 12.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 12-20: Get yet another fire pet and go to The Overthere. Bind yourself either at the vedors or at the bank. Now face Warsliks Woods and start running towards it, you will see a bunch of mobs that will be red to you and con &quot;scowls ready to attack&quot;. They will not however attack you(excluding Sarnaks). Move to the canyon edge that harbors the Skorpikis(sic) and start hugging it untill you are on the WW side of it. Now look around and you should see things like &quot;a sabertooth cat&quot;, &quot;a sarnak youth&quot;, and some kind of succulants. Most of these will con even or blue to you, with some yellows. Get that fire pet up and have him guard near the canyon edge and start pulling. Try to avoid pulling Sarnak Flunkies because they are pretty tough until you get your 16 pets. You can sit in this one spot until level 16. Now go get your new spells and gate back to the outpost. This time just move out towards the WW side of the outpost and kill anything you see(sarnak conscripts are a little harder but still doable) Don't be afraid to melee some, while you are medding you will heal fast with phantom armor up. Stay here until level 20.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 20-24: Make sure you have all your new spells and go to South Karana. Find the hermits hut and make a hotkey &quot;/say Kill you&quot;. Move to the chimney, stick you nose in and click it. The Hermit will attack you and your level 20 fire pet will eat him pretty fast with help from you. His spawn time is 2 minutes and he is absolutely awsome xp. I stayed here until 24. Be careful not to go afk because every now and then a Tesch Mas Gnoll will wander past and aggro on you, if that happens sick pet on it and gate back to the bridge and camp to clear aggro.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 24-29: Treants. These guys are really nice xp and give nice loot to boot. I rarely had a problem joining a treant group but sometimes had a problem forming one due to the bad faction you get with Qeynos and Druids. On occasion when I couldn't form one I would go pay a visit to the Hermit again. You can get nice xp here past level 29 actaully but once you ding I have a better place to hunt.<br>
<br>
<br>
level 29-37: Gather your new spells and your fire pet, bind at the pillar in Oasis(to the side of the dock in the water) and make sure you bring lots of cat's eye agate and malachites. (Don't bind at the docks because more often than not when you gate/die there will be specs or SG's waiting to smash you due to people training there) Now get on the raft and go to Timorous Deep. Summon one or 2 waterstones and start the very very long swim to location -9000, -6000(roughly). If you could get Dead man floating from a necromancer you can run there much faster than swimming, Levitate usually fades before you reach the island but DMF last over an hour. You will see a big iceberg, and thats what you want to climb up onto. Make sure to invis yourself when you get near it because the mobs there will aggro on you. Now find the side of the glacier with &quot;golra's&quot; (not Hulking Golra's) You should see a wrecked ship on the iceberg, set up camp near it, but not too near it because there is a golra inside that will aggro on you. Now summon a good fire pet, hand it two Swords of Runes and pull a golra with malise. There are at least 7 golra spawns on that side and they can all be easily single pulled. These guys are awsome xp and really easy. When you hit 34 gate and go buy your new spells and make sure you have that 34 fire pet again, come back and stay until 37. Some of them will start turning green at 36 but they are still xp green and with 7 spawns it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 37-39: I hated these two levels. I ended up going to The Overthere and grouping till 39. You can solo here, and it may actually be faster to solo, just don't try the sarnak knights or Sabertooth Tigers becuase they are mean as hell.<br>
<br>
<br>
level 39-44: Go to Dreadlands. As you zone in from FM, turn right as you come out of the cave and start running till you hit the corner. You should see a cave mouth there(snow cave). Now I bet your sick of looking at this type of mob but they, like their brethren are awsome xp. &quot;a Tundra Yeti&quot; is what you are after and in this cave are at least 7 spawns, and sometimes one or two roaming spawns. The roaming spawns are mostly Tundra yetis but can also be Drolvargs, ****atrices and Drachnids. If a drolvarg spawns gate back to the entrance to Dreadlands and take a break, the non Tundra Yeti spawns will eventually roam out of the cave and not come back. I used fire pet here too and you have to start making an effort now to outdamage your pet. These guys are actually spawned close together but they are blind as a bat, easily single pulled with malise. Stay here till 44.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 44-49: These levels really sucked. I ended up back at the Tundra Yeti cave till I hit 45, then tried several other places(45 REALLY sucks) I ended up back in The Overthere with my 44 Fire pet soloing anything blue(mostly Sarnak Knights and Sabertooth Tigers with occasional cacti and chickens) As soon as you get 46 head back to Dreadlands. Grouping here, in my experience really blows for xp. Try to grab a mage partner, or even a wizard if you can and head out towards the Giant Fortress in the snow. No you aren't going to kill giants. Now behind the fortress and over the hill you will see what looks to be an abandoned stone house that is falling apart. If you walk up to it and have a look inside you will see a cave. Head on in and get your fire pet up again and start killing &quot;a glacier yeti&quot;. There are 2 roaming ones and 4 static spawns in the end room of the cave. If you have a mage partner have one use an earth pet and the other a fire or air pet. These guys can be single pulled also, even though they are standing on top of one another. Once I hit level 48 I was able to pretty much hold the whole cave by myself using a fire pet. You'll be 49 in no time here compared to grouping.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level 49-???: Go ahead and make a point to get all of your 49 pets, you will be using them for quite some time. I went back to the Glacier Yeti cave from 49-50 and it only took about 4 hours with my new bad to the bone fire pet. Upon level 50 I targeted a glacier yeti and did a big /rude and vowed to never, ever, ever again look upon another snow monkey. At 50 I went to Ocean of Tears and set up camp on the shoreline of Seafury Island. Get up your 49 fire pet, Cast Burnout 3 and med until he Damage Shields himself. Now go pull one of the many seafury cyclops back to your pet(you don't even need JBoots because they are slow.) Now have a seat, keep the seafury targeted and start hitting your /pet health report hotkey. Amazingly almost every 49 fire pet can solo a seafury. Now when the cyclops starts to run away start casting your 44 shock and type /pet get lost. Right before the spell cast hit enter, causing your pet to suicide. This way you get full xp for the kill and you dont have to waste time waiting for &quot;Goner&quot; to heal up. Summon a new fire pet, BO3 him and med until he DS's himself and repeat. I went from 50-51 in about 6 hours here and made some nice loot to boot. There is pretty much no downtime involved in this since you are medding during the entire fight, only occasionally Lava Bolting to even out your pets odds of winning. You can also just reclaim your pet when the cyclops starts to run but I was too lazy. Watch out for Quag Maelstrom, he is a named seafury and is a bard, you can easily recognize him, he always has a huge horn in his hand. I saw him kill a level 55 bard that was trying to kite him around, but I got tired of looking at him and decided to chain cast him to death. Took me 5 level 49 earth pets casting BO3 and Lava Shield but I did it, he drops a no drop horn that is all/all and is used for the bard epic everytime. Don't bother with him, not worth the mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Good luck fellow mages, hope you level as fast as I have. If you have any questions and are on Tunare server please feel free to message me, providing I'm not in the midst of battle I would be glad to assist in any way I can. Currently working on my epic, taking a break from leveling for awhile. /bye<br>

So mob takes more damage from the shield which means mage can nuke less and still get full exp. Less down time faster killing, but more dangerous because fire pet has lower hit points so it could die faster than earth or water pet if it gets hit hard.  the fire pet has higher agility so it should get hit less but you never know when the mob will get lucky.<br>
<br>
And yes you are right in some situations earth or water would be better and sometimes its just that each of us has his own favorite pet  that fits best with our own style of play. Earth pet you can chain nuke but use more mana  fire pet you have to time your nukes so mob wont agro on you but you use less mana.  Both styles work  its up to you to use what you like.<br>

I think they maxed for 66? but if you keep your shielding up and Phantom Chain? up its not a problemm, they averaged only about 35-45 damage per hit on me, rarely getting in full damage.  I would always have the fire pet up, pull with malise, send pet and med for a few seconds, then nuke, med some more then nuke once again.  If I was FM when i pulled i would stand there beating the hell outta them with my torch, stepping back to get a nuke in every now and then.  Just make sure you wipe one out, then while your pet is healing you should be medding/healing until pet is 100% health again then move to the next one.  Like I said, at 29 you can only kill about 4-5 of them before you have to take a good med break.  Bythe time you hit 34 you are waiting on them most of the time evnen after killing all 7 spawns.  Hope this helps. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=balthemal>Balthemal</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(5/28/01 10:04:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Level 1-51 fast and easy (Dark Elf)</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the info.

a fire pet, its nice to see those pets do so much damage.<br>

<br>
So has anyone got any ideas of were I can go.. (I really wanted to try KC but been a DE <br>
the and still want to bank in OT its not a real option)<br>

20-25 I did in the Swamp of no hope, LOIO (way to many people here for my tastes), and FOB<br>
<br>
26-30 The monkeys outside the entrance to Dalnir<br>
<br>
31-35 The monkey island in TD<br>
<br>
36-40 The mines in Thurgadin<br>
<br>
41-45 The monkey caves in Dreadlands<br>
<br>
46-51 The Bloodgill Goblins in LOIO<br>
<br>
52-54 Wizards in Neriak<br>
<br>
These were the best hunting spots I could find for these levels. I'm still looking for a good place for 55. <br>

I just took my 41 mage to the yeti cave in Dreadlands and sure enough, the yetis are good exp and pretty easy kills. My only problem is avoiding the many wandering giants, spiders and drolvargs.  I was wondering if VI had upped the number of wanderers in that part of the zone or if they were there when you hunted in that area?  Any further tips on where to pull to? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/udeenor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Deenor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 38<br> <font color=#333333>(7/12/01 6:50:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Wizards, aye?</span><hr size=1> I see a lot of people saying the wizards are great exp till 54.  Well, I lost 51 (for the third time) and decided to go there for all of last night.  Total time was about 3.5 hours and I made 1 Yellow bbl.  This doesn't seem like that great of a place to me.  The problem wasn't the low exp from each kill...it's the 10 minute respawn rate.  If this were cut in half, it's be an awesome place.  Wonder if killing the Neriak bank area would be good exp after 55? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Hmmm...maybe the magician trainers...they never have pets.<br>

Apparently your only killing the two wiz at 51 thats nuts. I did the two wizards the necro and the guard. I lenthend it out so that i had time to med enough to kill the next and let the fire pet heal up nice and good. and i got more then half a blue at 51 with all 4 kills. And im still doing this at 52. this is the best place of exp you can find at 49-55 and get good money with the guard swords *9plat*.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uadabpyron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adab Pyron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(9/7/01 9:09:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Wizards, aye?</span><hr size=1> /bump Absolution, this is my guide I was telling you about.

Like to add from 51-55 the 2 wizzies and 1 necro in 3rd gate are the best xp, better than Sebilis groups even.  If and when they are camped, hit OOT and keep doing the Seafurbies for phat loots and some xp, I know after 54 xp blows there but you dont have to run far from Neriak if your main prey is camped.  If you aren't a Dark elf go ahead and kill some of the inkie guards too for xtra xp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=binabus>Binabus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(11/22/01 1:28:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   One Question</span><hr size=1> Hello, I am a 37 mage.<br>
I love your guide sarfa, it rocks!  I just have one question.  When our pet does more than 50% dmg it gets half exp.  In your guide you say that a lot of time you let fire pet take mobs while you med.  Wouldn't it be taking half exp most of the time.  That would really slow exp down wouldn't it?  Or does pet's DS not count as its dmg?  Lemme know plz.  Thanks for posting guide though.  It's great!<br>

Call me unlucky (because I am), but on average, Malise would be resisted 2 of 3 times. Woohoo, I get to cast a non resisted malise for only 180 mana...and even when malise sticks, I get spells that have a max dmg of 176 doing only 10 dmg...what a deal! I have not encountered any mobs (yet) that resist this much. Frankly, static spawn or not, the exp sucks horribly when you end up constantly wasting tons and tons of mana on these (mega downtime). And I also dont see how you can simply pull with malise, nuke once and then start medding, then nuke again. No matter what level of fire pet you cast, you have to heal it at least once...and ANY time you sit to med you will get agro. And if you sit to far back, you cannot use /pet health report and also the pets life bar is mega lagged. The gorlas are OK, but they arent cracked up to be the rave that ppl try to make them out to be. Supposedly the cougars in IC never resist anything and are easy to single pull all day along the shore...same with dire wolves. This may be due to the fact that the person who was fighting them was a necro (posion based spells), but I don't know and am going to test it myself. I have 185 int with +140 mana and I end up wasting up to 50% mana sometimes on ONE gorla...and thats just pathetic. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uadabpyron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adab Pyron</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(12/15/01 2:09:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/sarfa2001/AdabPyronofTunare.html WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: One Question</span><hr size=1> Sorry you had a bad experiance there Xanthis.  Not sure what your doing wrong but I suspect your a) Nuking too soon(I would let pet taunt once or twice, nuke, sit, wait and nuke again) b) You either don't have the focus item for your fire pet or you aren't holding it when summoning your pet.  As for Golras resisting malise. yes they have moderate resist for their level but its been a while since I was there, they could have upped their resist.  You should at lvl 32 only be spendinfg about 15-20% max per golra.  I had 200 int + mana stuff at that level so your percentage of mana used should be a little higher if you are not what I was at then. (This is Sarfa by the way, this is my mage, Sarfa is my Necromancer.)  And for the previous poster, fire pets DS is not considered damage done my the pet, or anyone for that matter, same as any DS cast on anyone/thing, it counts as environmental damage I believe(such as falling).  By the way, this guide may not be as effective now that Fire Pet's DS's have been nerfed.  Luckily I was able to get through all those level before then. (If you haven't heard, pets that cast DS's including the epic pet sometimes take up to and beyond 20 minutes now, nowhere near as fast as 30 seconds max back when I was fighting with Fire pets)  And for Murlow, yes there was a romaing mob or maybe two if I'm not mistaked at the 1st eti cave mentioned in DL, but thankfully they don't pop very often.  If im'm not mistaken their spawn time is 2.5 hours OR they spawn just as fast and roam off and as long as they are not killed they wander until they are killed, causing them to pop again in the back of the cave.  As for a safe spot to pull in the cave, just pull to a room wall, as you know the yeti's cave &gt;tiny&lt; aggro ranges and if you pull there the only add you might get is the widow/drolvarg roamer(s), and only them because they have a loarger aggro radius. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uadabpyron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Adab Pyron</A> at: 12/15/01 2:15:04 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showPrevMessage?topicID=212.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showNextMessage?topicID=212.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=212.topic&index=17><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.threadControl?topicID=212.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=212.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=212.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill>The Hunt</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
