Wait for him to leave the room with the pillars. once he leaves the room... summon a pet and be ready for battle very fast.   he sometimes starts casting before you have finished summoning a pet... but your pet should be ready before he finishes casting his first spell.  kill him in that stone room with the four pillars before moving on.  best to have your pet attack him first be fore nuking... once you kill him.... set a hot key for assisting your pet..... after you kill the first xlottl wait for about 45 sec to 1 min.  then go in the next area and park the pet right before the bridge that goes across the moat.  the next xlottl spawns just inside the gate to the mansion.  sometimes he will be wandering in the mansion.. but no worries... he will come.  just sit on the path infront of the mansion and wait and he will come soon.   if you feel agressive you can run in the mansion and seek him out.  it is a very small mansion and you will find him quick.  he goes upstairs and looks over the balcony sometimes.   just run and get in his sight... and he will start his first cast.... and then your pet will come running.    if your pet aggros him in the mansion   you must run to safe location but in line of fire and nuke him too.    pet can solo one xlottl easy... but two could be risky.  once you have the two x lottls killed you have 8min for the next spawn.  its nice to kill them about 45 sec appart so that when they respawn you will kill them consecutivly (sp) and then you can get back to your television program till the next spawn.<br>
<br>
now you have broken the camp and you have control of the camp.... now run to the left or right side of the cave infront of the mansion and sit and med.   this is the most you will have to med.   by now you should be about down to 30%mana.  just med... you will almost be full by the time the next spawn.   Just face you pet and wait.   the first xlottl to spawn will aggro your pet 99% of the time.  just watch for the action... as soon as you pet attacks... stand , hit your assist key.... and nuke.   and nuke again.   and bam...  mob should be killed in like 13sec.   run and loot... and then go sit in the path infront of mansion and wait.  45sec.   the next lottl will aggro pet again....  stand, assist, nuke... loot.   and now you just keep repeating the process.   very simple. <br>
<br>
Once in a while the xlottl will come running for you... and hit you.   no worries... just run and get out of his way and let the pet take over.  but he does hit hard. after the first 2 rounds you should be back up to 100% mana and you will remain at 100% mana.   only 4 nukes every 7 min.  not bad.<br>
<br>
The loot is not good at all.  sometimes you will get 3pp, words, gloves of rallos zek, amber, etc.   nothing really that good at all. but this camp is good only for exp anyway.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your pet does not need buffs and i would not reccommend buffing your pet... the kills are so very fast... and you need to out damage your pet.  USE EARTH PET.  this is a nice mob to root.  he can hit for about 170 tripple hits.   it hurts... but 95% of the time you pet will keep him in one spot.  it is a good idea to MR and buff yourself... sometimes the xlottle will get a spell to stick to you and it can hurt if he gets a couple to stick. <br>
<br>
 Use Char.  you only have to cast 2 times.   <br>
<br>
Additional notes.... it gets very lonely in there and you will go crazy... i find my self talking in say to my pet.... shouting in the zone when no one is there.  counting the stones on the wall, and when a DE comes walking through the zone... I immediately attack them with conversation.  LOL.  its great exp... but gets very boring and lonely. lol   Also.   you must camp out of this area.   you cannot log back in infront of the mansion or you will have two mobs to kill.  i think that it would be nearly impossible to break spawn.   i always bind at the first zone to neriak.  Going LD is dangerous too.   if you go LD and cannot get back in the 7min... it might be wize to log on as alt character and ask your guild for help.   I went LD once and got my wife to help me with her mage. She broke the spawn before i logged on.  Also on one occasion i was noteing that my lag spikes were going like crazy... i did not take a chance... i gated out... relogged... and then was fine.  but normally there is never any lag in that zone.   but i reccomend not taking chances... its hard to get back in there and not to mention bringing a cleric with you   lol.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well,  i know that i have rambled on and on.   i hope i did not forget anything.      best of luck<br>
<br>
Cavett.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS.  now that you have all the information on the camp... STAY OUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  ITS MY CAMP.      lol<br>

<br>
<br>
you'll build yourself up to ally faction with alot of Neriak with only like 50 plat worth of red wine handed in 4x4 at a time.  And then you can camp right out in neriak third gate. <p><center>

It makes it much simpler to kill the necro, Krizin J'Narus, who spawns near the X'Lottl mansion, when you can just run over the bridge to get there and not have to worry about dodging the guard (it will also help if you and/or your pet gets feared... chances are if you are KoS to the guard and are feared long enough, he will agro). In addition, you will be able to safely summon a pet and camp across the docks from the little platform where Lisvan likes to wander, and you will be able to buy malachite/cats eye agate right in zone. Only took me about 2 hours to get my faction with the guards to dubious, and if you plan to stay here for even 1 level, I believe it is well worth it (especially if you're staying for 49-55). The first reply pretty much covered fighting tactics- use an earth pet, I usually would recast until I got a pet that hit for 54+, and don't buff it, otherwise you will have a hard time outdamaging it. 2 chars (or two shock of swords) is enough to outdamage your pet. Keep in mind that they will cast steelskin if they aren't pulled soon after spawning, so when breaking the spawn let your pet beat on them until you start seeing your pet actually hitting them, and then nuke. If you are running low on mana, 1 char and 1 blaze (if, as I read somewhere in this forum, they have about 1780 hitpoints) is enough to KS your pet by a small margin, but this prolongs the fight unneccesarily, and lessens your exp, because the longer they are alive, the longer it takes for them to respawn <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This is a very boring camp- I suggest clearing them all at once and then waiting for respawn as opposed to spacing out the spawns so that you have 1 fight every 3.3 minutes, because then you have a longer time in between for reading a book, doing things afk, etc. Good luck =) <p><center><img src=http://home.flash.net/~sc2/pics/Padel_Sig.jpg></center></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upadelrathe.showPublicProfile?language=EN>PadelRathe</A> at: 1/8/02 4:12:37 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujinjianmoo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>jinjianmoo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#333333>(1/8/02 8:13:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: its very easy</span><hr size=1> Was on my way to check out the camp, and I was jumped in Neriak commons by a guard.

It took about 50 stacks of wine before the 3rd gate guards were dubious.  (Outer guards were apprehensive).  I made the mistake of thinking that since I was ally with the merchantants and cool with the guards that I could walk freely in Neriak without invisibility on.  Big mistake.  There is a cleric guild in 3rd gate near the zone to Neriak Commons with a different faction.  I had no pet and died before I could zone.  There was another guy in the foreign quarter who attacked and killed me as well.  You can go to most merchants and the bank, but I recommend taking your pet with you when you go to give you time to gate out if something happens and use invisiblity to get to the lake area.  Level 49+ dark elf clerics are hard to find and I was not able to get these 2 corpses rezed, so BE CAREFUL in here if you are not a dark elf. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=gala>Gala</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/02 7:37:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Neriak info please!</span><hr size=1> K..I've been killing wizzies and great xp, but I'm thinking that I should go try the necro.

I prefer to kill them one after another because this way you can go afk, read, watch TV etc for larger spurts of time while waiting for spawns. <p><center><img src=http://home.flash.net/~sc2/pics/Padel_Sig.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showPrevMessage?topicID=146.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showNextMessage?topicID=146.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=146.topic&index=10><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.threadControl?topicID=146.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=146.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23>Levels 51-55</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
