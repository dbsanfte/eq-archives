<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have a ranged AE that lands on more than 4 mobs.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
You refer to the Al'Kabor spells.  Many wizards don't even bother to aquire these, and those that do never cast them.  They suck mana like no tomorrow, and do the damage of an ae a couple of levels behind them.  For nearly every situation that we would be tempted to use these spells, there is a better option from a lower level that costs less mana, and does the job better.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have crowd control spells (snare and root)</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Mages have huge pets that have stun and root mana free, and do tons of mana free dps.  It's not that Mages lack defense, they just lack a convienent way to employ it.  Also, Wizards additionally get Concussion, but then again, your pets have taunt, and stun procs that help with aggro so long as your not standing right next to the mob.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have better cast time spells</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
You got us there.  Wait... those better cast time spells do the damage we were doing for nearly the same mana cost at level 44....  They were a small upgrade, but not all that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizard have better mana ratio on the majority of their spells</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
A mage does not even have to cast a spell to do damage, they can, as Wezloc likes to put it, cast Summon Epic Rogue.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have a variety of based nukes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Fire?  Wizards, yep.  Mages, Yep.<br>
Magic?  Wizards, Yep.  Mages Yep.<br>
Cold?  Wizards, Yep.  Mages, Nope.<br>
You got us there, but then, our cold nukes are more efficient than they are damaging, the level 60 Ice Spear does about 100 more damage than Ice Comet from level 49---but Ice Spear has a Huge recast, is very efficient, and isn't a bolt.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizard have nukes that will land in many situations where mage spells have a very limited chance to land.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Again, based on Resists, we have cold as an extra option.  Lures aren't required like they used to be, and if we use them to get the resist edge, we throw that mana efficency argument right out the window.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have multiply options of escape where mages have one gate.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Your Right!!  Wizards have Gate, Feign Death, and Harmsheild... wait, that's Necro's.<br>
Wizards have Gate, and Evac--which is just like Gate only stays in zone.  Root and Snare are crowd control, which can buy time to run and gate, but then so can your Pet.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Wizards have the avaiable to move through zones with relative easy of transport spells.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
Very true, but is there something that Mages can do for themselves and others?  Summon Foci, Arrows, knives, armor and weapons for pets, EB stones, Lev Rings, Damage Sheilds...  All of which increase your group desireability, whereas a wizard has his damage and evac.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>You ask why mages have suddenly received vendor spells to increase their power such as focus items and FoT. The answer is in class balancing the finally figured out Mages have fallen way behind since level 50 and need redefine their roles. ...  FoT is merely the restoration of what mages were pre 50. Now if they could scale our pets in tune. While the new pet improvements are nice its not enough.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Let's compare, best damaging nukes at level 50--49 since there was no 50 nukes.<br>
Lava Bolt, Mage, 810 Damage<br>
Ice Comet, Wizard, 1120<br>
<br>
Wizards have a 2.8 ratio, Mages a 2.7....  Wizards hold the edge in casting time by .7 seconds as well.  Mage nuke is a Bolt.<br>
<br>
Lets advance to Kunark.<br>
Seeking Flame of Suekor, 1024 damage, 320 mana, 7seconds cast.<br>
Sunstrike, 1615 damage, 450 mana, 7 seconds cast.<br>
<br>
Ratio is SSoS 3.2, Sunstrike 3.9ish, with cast time equal.  Again, Wizards are around 1/3 more damage on thier best nuke over mages.  Both spells are Flame Based.<br>
<br>
Vellious actually saw us lose ground as far as nukes go, while mages got nothing.  Ice Spear is hellishly efficient at 4.0 ratio, but with a long recast, and does barely more than Ice Comet from 49.<br>
<br>
Luclin saw Wizards get Super rare, though nice, EER and GSS, while mages got a DD that matches closely with their Kunark Spell.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
If FBoT was to put you back into balance like Pre-Kunark, the bolt would do 1600'ish damage, with a 4-ish mana ratio, similar to our Sunstrike spell.  It would also drop off a mob like the Emperor to be fair, elsewise, your SoFB was already in range to put you balanced with wizards if you want to consider only those spells that DONT drop off the emperor, with the exception of SoFB's poorer Ratio.  The fact that FBoT all but duplicates the spell that drops off the Emperor with the exception of it's being a bolt is unfair, given that it is vendor bought.  It should be noted that at the point that if FBoT did 1600ish damage, then Moon fire, being double what Ice was, is just fine at around 1200 damage.<br>
<br>
The Alternative (if we are looking at maintaining Pre-Kunark style balance) would be to give Wizards a Matching spell at 61 that did 3k Damage at a 4-ish mana ratio--this would also maintain the balance in nuking power.  Given that Wizards always have to work harder for their nukes, It would probably not be our vendor bought spell however.  I'm perfectly happy with either option, but then I'm in the &quot;Good for them&quot; camp as far as balance is concerned.  My anger is directed at VI, for not balancing properly in the first place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as manaburn is concerned, it would have been fine as it was, if Wizards really were supposed to get a 3k nuke at 61 and scale up from there.  The fact that some classes are being over powered doesn't mean your hated class of the week is one of them.  A 3k Nuke can Crit for around 7k damage, and as has been noted, Wizards Crit fairly often on normal nukes.  Your average, Joe Sebelis Wizard Manaburned for between 6 and 8k.  It was only the ubers that generated those massive 8-11k manaburns non-crit.  With those kinds of numbers, adding a Wizard or 2 would equal your average 5 man MB squad, except for the crits, which cannot be relied on when you only get one nuke.  So Please, let the manaburn issue go, it was no more overpowered than the existance of Damageshields in a pet class's lineup, Ch for Clerics, or Slows for shaman, it was just more flashy.  A large enough group of SK's could do the same with their actually instantaineous Harm Touch if they wanted too.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: Changed text to reflect Ice Comet not being a bolt.  Kind of silly of me, I thought it was, and have even been casting it.  I was wrong, thought that fact doesn't shine any more favorably upon FBoT, except that the alternate 3k nuke at 61 Wizards should get should be a DD instead of a bolt.  <p><br>
