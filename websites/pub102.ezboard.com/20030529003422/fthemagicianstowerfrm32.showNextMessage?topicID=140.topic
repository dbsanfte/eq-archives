I am kinda bothered from this question because many people have stated that casters shouldnt benefit from loot at the same rate that melee classes do.<br>
<br>
Well at pre-50 I can agree that casters are fairly powerful and gear really isnt all that important compared to melee classes. However post-50 things change and the degree at which mob power grows takes a giant leap forward. Due to mudflation melee are able to deal with the increase in NPC power, but casters cannot due to spell level restrictions. <br>
<br>
Now there are very few buyable spells post 50 and as we all know the really good ones can cost alot.  What does loot mean? When I hear the word &quot;loot&quot; I think anything that drops off of NPCs. If this is the correct definition of loot then casters are very loot dependant post 50 maybe even more so then melee classes and should scale in the same way.<br>
<br>
RBG is something that drops randomly off of Krup frogs in Sebillis. Same goes for many other melee weapons and armor that drops in sebillis. Why is it I have to kill Jugs to get spells to increase in power but a 28% haste item drops in areas of the zone that are no where near the difficulty of Jugs? Why is it I have seen more RBGs drop then I have seen Turpor (always miss spell that damn spell) scrolls? Same goes for Muzzle.  I am very loot dependant. Without spells my power is very limited and by having those spells drop as loot makes me just as in need of loot and items as the melee class fighting next to me. <br>
<br>
Do we want the same things? No, I could care less about a primal 2hs but I want a spell that is on par with primal weapons dropping also.  People like to down play mana/hp/ac items but they make a dramatic difference. What can a lvl60 mage kill with no items that is worth mentioning?  Having extra hp/ac items on has saved me many times. Just like having Jboots and Burntwood stave have saved me a number of times. This idea that casters dont need loot as much as melee is just crap. Maybe that was true pre-50 but things are very different post 50. Mobs are so overpowered compared to PCs that a naked caster is just as helpless as a naked melee. I would venture to say that being able to hide/sneak, FD, use defensive disc, cast spells more then help the naked melee. I have seen many naked warriors use there disc that acts like a 8sec divine aura to make it to the zone. Something aggros the monk he just FD same for the SK.  Hybrids have defensive spells that are on par with casters yet can wield primal and benefit from loot just as pure melee. Paladins have LoH and root even naked. So casters have no advantage naked that puts them anyway over and beyond what melee can do naked. Because of this casters should scale in the same way that melee classes do.  At lvl56 I have dropped near 30k for spells to increase my power. These spells didnt cost 28p off of a vendor. So I wish people would stop talking about vendor purchased spells. Most of the good spells post 50 are dropped and most drop in no so pleasant areas of zones. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucolleen2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colleen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#333333>(4/1/02 7:05:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/colleenmage/eye.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Should Casters improve from &quot;loot&quot;...do they a</span><hr size=1> Spells are easy to get, and even when you do have them, you still gain very little increase in power.<br>
<br>
I think what most people mean when they talk about casters improving in loot is not the exp grind you seem to be in, but rather in the endgame.  Meles comparably equipped to you (assuming here, you said level 56, don't have all your spells) are not nearly as far in performance from you as mele's with primal/ntov are from casters with ntov etc.<br>
<br>
The gap widens as you level and get better gear, by the very high end game the gap is very large, since casters get diminishing returns on high end gear. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=78838">Colleen Ebonfyre<br></a>

I'd like to see warrior kill blue con mob  naked(or vendor only bought equipment). I can easyly do that.If a caster developed in power by gaining items as much as melee from naked level we'd be gods shooting deathtouches out of ass with machinegun speed~<br>
Casters are not far behind melee as it is (in lots of fights we are ahead)<br>

<br>
Melees are utterly dependent on gear.  The gap between the best equipped melee and a modestly equipped melee is large, and think is a fair reward for having gear dependency built into their class.<br>
<br>
Casters in comparison, are currently relatively independent of gear, and fair more dependent on level and their spell books.  This is a great advantage.  For example, when I was 49ish, I could solo for experience completely naked except for a stack of malachite while I waited for rez.  The gap between the best equipped caster and a modestly is comparatively much less than for melee, but then that is exactly what I would expect.  It would not be fair for casters to enjoy both the benefits of gear independence and dramatic improvement through gear.<br>
<br>
While I do think it is reasonable to ask that caster gear to make more difference than it currently does, the best gear should not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;uberize&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> casters on the same scale it does melee.<br>
<br>
Separately, I do not find the notion of making casters as dependent on gear as melee particularly appealling.  I see no compelling benefit of making such a radical change to such a fundamental element of class design.<br>
<br>
To be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>as</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> dependent on gear as melees means that the spellbook would have to impotent, and indeed that is what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Krilen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> stated:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Simply put, casters need to scale with level and items the way melees do.  Weak as hell with no items, powerful with items.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->At that point, you might as well get rid of the spell book altogether, and put <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>all</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> spells as right-click effects on class specific items.  Only then would casters become as dependent on gear as melees.<br>
<br>
I think that is an absurd idea, and that no one seriously proposes that.<br>
<br>
Instead, what is probably being proposed is that spell books be significantly weakened and caster dependence on gear significantly increased, and I do not find this the least bit compelling as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;fix&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  EverQuest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in any way.<br>
<br>
Consider the impact on the existing player base if it were implemented.  Either the compensating focus effects would be on existing gear, or it would be on new gear that dropped.  If it were not on existing gear but only new gear, existing casters would find that their power dropped dramatically, <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>and</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> having to engage in frenzied competition for those spawns that dropped the necessary items.  Since casters are now significantly nerfed, they would less desirable by groups and guilds whose assistance they would require.  The reduction of power would likely mean that casters could not solo for those items.<br>
<br>
Alternately, suppose the focus effects were retroactively added to existing items, scaled appropriately with the difficulty of obtaining that loot, which is what I think the proponents of this idea would say would be best and fairest implementation.  Immediately, all casters would examine their inventory, and likely discover that they are missing an important focus effect.  Many would be crippled by the lack of appropriate focus.  Those with the greatest variety of spell effects, requiring the greatest number of focus items would be hard pressed to wear adequate resist gear.  What are the odds, for example, that a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Velium Blue Diamond Bracer</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would retroactively include an important focus effect?  Casters would be in the position of making much greater tradeoffs in order to wear resist gear.  But as spell casting is the main activity of casters, there would be no choice but to wear these items, otherwise, as intended by the proposal, spells would be weak.<br>
<br>
As an illustrative analogy, it would be as if almost all resist gear for melees were on weapons, and that in order to gain resists, they would have to use a significantly sub-par weapon.<br>
<br>
Even then, assuming that ensuing chaos comes to an end, and every caster has the necessary focus items <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;appropriate&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for their level, what would be the net effect?<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  If you're a casual player, you should be less powerful than a powergamer...I play a lot...You play 1 hour a week...And yet...you're just as powerful as me.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The stated purpose of this proposal is that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;casual&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players would have their power reduced, while <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;uber&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players would have their power increased, and so far as I can tell, this is also the only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;benefit&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that is offered.<br>
<br>
A net transfer of power away from casual players in order to benefit dedicated players simply in order to satisfy the sense of fairness of those who would benefit most from that transfer strikes me as self centered.  Worse, it is exactly those <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;dedicated&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players that <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>already</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> consume the most resources from <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  EverQuest</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> such as bandwidth and spawns.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, I find that caster dependence on spell books rather than gear a fundamental design decision and a fair distinction between casters and melee.  I see no credible arguments advanced in favor of this dramatic change, and dire negative consequences.  To the extent that dedicated casters need to be further distinguished from casual casters, I see no reason that cannot be accomplished through no drop spells dropped on raids, rather like the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Ancient Spell Line</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which is already in the game, and will likely be extended.<br>

<br>
At present, there are two vital stats for pure casters: intelligence and mana.  Hit points and armor class are a luxury and resists, while important in certain circumstances, are generally not a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> major</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> determining factor in our gear selection.  The only exception to this &quot;two stat&quot; rule seems to be enchanters: we also need to pull high charisma (though the value of charisma is greatly debated).<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Melees have a much wider range of stats to balance.  Aside from the basic character attributes that are vital to melees (HP, AC, STR, STA, AGI and DEX, also INT/WIS for SKs/Ranger), they have to balance damage ratios, varying weaponskills (and weapon advantages/disadvantages including things like ability to bash), procs, etc.  In the high end game, it's not uncommon to see a melee switch weapons 2-3 times over the course of a fight to maximize/minimize his taunt/damage/proc effects.  In addition, they often have to make the same sacrifices that we do for resists, when needed.<br>
<br>
Each point of strength for a melee is a corresponding increase in Attack.  Each point of Dexterity increases their chance at a proc or critical hit.  Each point of AC increases their damage absorbtion, and every three points of Agility increase their damage avoidance.<br>
<br>
Casters... we have Intelligence (increases our mana pool), Mana (increases our mana pool).  Charisma reduces enchanter resists on something (whether it is just charms, or charms and mezes, is up for debate).  Sure, AC, HP and AGI are nice, but (theoretically) we shouldn't be meleed anyway, so these things are *mostly* luxuries that we persue as secondary stats.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
We need more Prime Requisits, like melees, I think.  We need to be able to optomize our equipment to reduce monster resistances to our spells, to increase the melee power of our pets, to scale up or down our taunt, to increase our base damage (or spell durations, in the case of enchanters).<br>
----------<br>
<br>
I suspect it is too difficult to code this in based on statistics, at this point (unfortunately).  It is not too late to put these abilities on items, however.  Simple things like &quot;+10% Skill Modifier: Specialize Conjuration,&quot; for example, would make a world of difference for me (alteration specialist, though mezes are conjuration based).  Items with Channelling bonuses, effects that increase the difficulty of your magic/fire/cold/poison/disease spells to be resisted... or one line of your spells (perhaps the Shock line for mages, for example).  Items that resist the casting times on clickable items... items with procs that go off based on spell-casting rather than melee... all of these are possibilites.<br>
----------<br>
<br>
It bores me to know that there is a set of gear our there that is the &quot;best&quot; gear than an enchanter can have.  Once he gets that gear, he's done.  Melees have to adjust their gear for certain circumstances... have to prepare for situations where they have to slow, or hold aggro over an entire raid, or bash, or whatever.  But once I get items x, y, and z, all I need do is equip those and go about my business, and that's it.<br>
<br>
Where's the creativity in that?  The problem solving?<br>
----------<br>
<br>
If I have to sustain a nerf to get that sort of variety in my play, so be it.  Go ahead and make mezes virtually impossible to land at a 90 cha... fine with me.  Make them extremely reliable at 255 cha.  Make my alteration spells take longer to cast at a 90 dexterity, but make them take a fraction of that time at a 255.  Give me an item that has a chance of procing a caster-equivalent of avatar whenever I cast (+100 dex, sta, agi, int, mana) or that procs a memory blur on my target.  Give mages and item that can proc a bolt when they cast direct damage spells, or proc Burnout 4 when they summon a pet.  Give clerics items that can proc a 150pt self heal when they cast a heal.  <br>
<br>
Give me things that do 1/10th of this, but give me a reason to choose item x over item y that's a little more complicated than &quot;how much mana does it give.&quot;<br>

I never have enough time to go on planar raids anymore, only have 2 pieces, I'd love to have the option to purchase good tradable gear with clicky effects that improve my abilities. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unecridious.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Necridious</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#333333>(4/4/02 6:46:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Caster should remain largely independent of gear</span><hr size=1> I don't mind being dependant on my spells alone.<br>
<br>
My only request is that if I'm to give up AC, HP, and Melee damage, that I be compensated equally with those spells.<br>
<br>
I also want to be compensated for being resource dependant (mana).  I run out of mana, and I can no longer aid my group or myself.  Assuming all goes well, I must then wait for my mana to return before I can do anything else.  That's 2 disadvanteges rolled into one-- limited time, and then downtime.<br>
<br>
Melee are limited by HP in a similar fashion, but HP is easily replaced from a number of sources.  Healing spells-- No less than 6 classes can heal to one degree or another.  At least 4 can provide HP Regen spells.  Several items provide either regeneration or buffs that can be used as heals.<br>
<br>
Mana is a different story altogether.  1 class can directly &quot;heal&quot; your mana-- and that is very inefficient.  2 classes can provide Good Mana regen, and a few others can provide 1/tick. Very few items can provide better Mana Regen, and all but one of them drop off Mobs that will hand a small guilds @$$ right back to them.  The 4 INT casters all have a form of mana regen- though only Necro's and Enchanters are worthy of the name. Harvest and Mod Rod just don't cut it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And that's all I want remembered...  If spells are what I do, fine.  But make sure that I'm not giving up more than I'm getting. <p><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/atl/d/a/dastorys/Pictures/Necsig.jpg>

<br>
Not really, go to any melee board and look at what they mostly say to improve and you will see the same two things mentioned all the time, AC and HP.<br>
<br>
Sure STR helps raise our ATTK score but not by enough to make me want to strip out AC for STR. <br>
<br>
Dex helps with Procs and Crits, but after 75 DEX through gear your better off relying upon a Shammy to DEX buff you as you are losing a TON of combat ability to gain DEX. Also procing weapons are a really bad idea if your not a Warrior or a Knight, you gain mega agro from alot of procing and the chain/leather based melees cant hold agro to long or their dead / wasting Cleric mana.<br>
<br>
AGI has a really small effect on a melee, we gain 1 point of AC for every 6 or so AGI. Again not enough reason to drop AC or HP gear.<br>
<br>
INT and WIS for the Hybrids is not that big a deal either, some of our good weapons have high scores in these stats so we can keep open slots for AC and HP gear.<br>
<br>
STA is what Melees look at once they have the best AC and HP gear, the only real mile stone to break with STA is 100 so we dont have degraded abilities for being tired out.<br>
<br>
Resists are not to much a bother till the big end boss fights where Dragons are AOEing alot, but even then we normally rely upon the casters to help there.<br>
<br>
Anyone that worries about more than AC and HP is normally hurting themselves BAD when your a melee, even if you dont get hit much during a fight you need that AC and HP as a melee to save your but wile the main tank gets agro back. Casters need AC / HP as well to survive agro as well but I know when Im playing my Mage I make damn sure to never get agro off the tanks. <p><A HREF="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=105786">Zyrexx Shadowfyre</A>

People who spend more time in the game SHOULD advance further than those who do not. That should be common sense...holds true for anything and everything, whether in games or in the real world. You see it as self-centered, I see it as self-motivated. It's a natural progress. You spend more time and you become better at what you do. In everquest that generally means gaining levels and obtaining items. Is it selfish to say that a talented Musician, who practiced daily, shouldn't be paid more than one of lesser skill, because the latter did not, either by choice or fate, practiced as much? Of course not, because such claim is absurd and unrealistic. Everquest is no different than this.<br>
<br>
However, that is not to say that I agree with some of the Elitist comments that I've came across here. I do not wish to reduce the &quot;casual&quot; gamer's power for the sake of it (and from my interpretation, neither did the poster whom you quoted from) - power should be where it belongs. Currently the Magician class as a whole is lacking, and as such more power should be expected and granted.<br>

<br>
    I personally feel that casters should experience the same upgrades that melees experience from getting better items. In the end game (which is where I'm at ), there are SEVERAL items that all vastly improve a melee( i.e. primal, ntov armor/weapons) while anything that a caster could get would only add a couple more points to resists/int/mana( a minor improvement at best). Just because a caster can cast spells while naked( although nowhere near as effectively as fully geared), does this mean that we shouldn't be able to be upgraded through items? <br>
<br>
    The only thing that really limits an int caster right now is our mana pool. If a warrior is almost dead, a cleric can easily replenish his hit points. But if a mage is oom, there is no equvilant way for us to get our mana pool replenished. Furthermore, a warrior can help lower the amount of damage they take by getting better armor. Besides the mage summoned focus items, what ways are there for a caster to lower the amount of mana they use when casting a spell? <br>
<br>
   Melees can also upgrade their ability to attack through weapons. A previous poster stated that a warrior will switch weapons 2-3 times during a raid. I'm willing to bet that most casters cast at least 2-3 spells during a raid, so I see that as being equal. A melee is allowed to deal more damage by getting a better weapon whereas a caster is limited by the amount of damage that our spell does. <br>
<br>
    Being a mage who has been on countless raids, I wonder why it is that my spells are just as effective as a mage who has never been on a raid. I see every melee in my guild becoming a powerhouse while all I can do is hope for a piece of gear that might give me a couple more int points. <br>
<br>
  As it stands now, casters aren't as dependant upon gear as a melee. Simply because the gear we are offered does not help us do what we are supposed to be doing, and that is casting spells.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><a Href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=16295>Mistress Maverness Erudchild</a>

<br>
In fact, after the choice of weapon, one haste item, and base AC and HP, buffs and songs currently have far a more profound effect.<br>
<br>
Gear dependency as described by its proponents would represent a far greater burdern on casters than melees.  Not only would casters have to level to get the spells, they would have to obtain the spells themselves, as well as the focus items to improve those spells so that they are no longer <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;weak as hell.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  In contrast, melees would have no equivalent of a spell book or spells to limit them, but only a small number of skills that are trivial to obtain and improve through their use.<br>
<br>
The advocates of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Weak Non-Focused Casters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, in pursuit of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;fairness&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for themselves, neglect the impact this would have on casual and especially new players.  How many newbie casters, discovering the impotence of their spells, contrary to the tenets of every fantasy role playing game they have ever played, would give up before 20th level?  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Twinking,&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> while listed as a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;benefit&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of their proposal, only benefits those who can twink, and functions are a barrier to entry for new players.  As it is, the existance of classes that are relatively independent of gear provides an adequate powerbase for new players to learn the mechanics of the game without being so weak that they quit in frustration.<br>
<br>
Casters would also experience more difficulty than melees with gear dependency because trade-offs between various items would be much more involved.  For melees, only a few inventory slots are critical: the weapon hand or hands, and whatever slot their haste item occupies.  All other slots are essentially interchangeable: any slot can used to swap out AC and HPs for resists or whatever.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, under <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Weak Non-Focused Casters</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, caster might be dependent on half a dozen or more inventory slots, several of which might be critical.  That is, the caster might own only one focus item that makes a critical spell, like mezz, charm, haste, or slow non-impotent, and so that item could not be swapped out for other gear.  In order to move power away from spells and onto gear, key spell effect factors like magnitude of effect, duration, mana cost, spell casting speed, opponent resistance, spell range, and so on.  As has been demonstrated with the existing focus items, some focus effects that are appropriate for damage are not appropriate for other effects such as healing, so that damage, healing, and haste/slow percents are unlikely to all be effected by the same magnitude of effect focus item.<br>
<br>
The net result would be that equipment slot trade-offs would be much more onerous for casters than melees, as more items would be absolutely necessary.  In order to make those trade offs easier, those who could afford it would have to acquire substitutes for critical focus items so they could trade them off if necessary.  So a moderately well equipped caster would have to carry three sets of gear: the gear they wear, resist gear, and back up focus items to allow them to wear their resist gear.<br>
<br>
In other words, making casters dependent on gear would, for most casters, make them even more dependent on gear than melee are.<br>
<br>
Presumably <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;dedicated&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> players could obtain the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;best&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> items, with multiple appropriate effects on good slots, but all others would suffer.  In general, the suffering of other casters is ignored by the proponents of this proposal, who are concerned primarily that they have be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;unfairly&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> denied the fruit of their labors, and are willing to take them at the expense of others.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> People who spend more time in the game SHOULD advance further than those who do not.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Why can't this be accomplished simply by the introduction of more compelling caster loot, especially at the high end, without weakening spells and making casters dependent on gear?<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I personally feel that casters should experience the same upgrades that melees experience from getting better items.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As the game is presently designed, that would be unfair to melees.  Since casters are largely independent of gear, and melees are dependent, it is only fair that the gap between the best and worst equipped casters be less than than the best and worst equipped melees.  Casters enjoy the benefit of gear independence, they should not therefore improve as much through the best equipment as melees do.<br>
<br>
I am not against improvements in caster gear, especially in the end game.  I agree that current caster loots by and large are not compelling, and do not function as an adequate reward.  However, when adding new caster loots to the game, while they may improve casters more than current loots does, along the lines of the focus effects, they should not be as potent as melee gear.<br>
<br>
What the proponents of this idea are saying is that no reasonable new or retrofit caster loots bearing new and existing focus effects could possibly be a sufficient reward for their effort, and that instead existing caster must be made weaker.  Worse, the cost of caster gear dependency would be paid by those least likely to benefit from it, while the proponents are all players who would gain it the most.<br>

<br>
Casters/priests are very hard to twink.  They are very dependent on their spells and have a very limited mana pool to use from. After a few levels, their melee skills and low mana pool make them very difficult to twink.<br>
<br>
However, you give a warrior 2 pre nerf centi swords, a fbss, a fungi tunic and he can level like made.  Add in a druid from 1-35ish and then a shaman from 35ish on, you can easily powerlevel a warrior up to 50 in days played time (faster probably).<br>
<br>
Anyways, casters are dependent on spells while melee is dependent on loot.  The Torpor/RBG analogy is a very good one.  Torpor is by far one of the most sought after 60 level spells for shaman.  It greatly increases their power and allows them to become what they were meant to be at 60.  However, the rarity of this spell is insane.  It drops from kunark dragons/OS (RARELY) / or VP (key quest that is insane and the RvR of this dungeon is outta wack anymore).<br>
<br>
RBG's drop off of random mobs in OS, albeit rarely, but it doesn't take a raid to get them.  COF's have dropped from naggy for almost 3 years.  SCH's are replacing FBSS's because of the added beneft of stats/AC and they drop like candy too.<br>
<br>
Dropped spells, IMHO, are what has caused alot of the problems.  Had spells been vendor available from the release of Kunark things might have been different.   <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=00DD00)"><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFF66; text-decoration: none" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=118288>Souldreamer</a></div>

<br>
Whereas I am not overly against twinking, I mean I hate letting all those loots rot in the bank, it does serve as a barrier to entry for new players, who cannot compete with twinks and will only become frustrated.  Making it so that all classes are subject to twinking will make it difficult to recruit and retain new players, but will only serve the interest of existing players with excess loot.<br>
<br>
The fact that casters are less gear dependent allows for character-centered players as opposed to loot-centered players.  The current situation with spells being character-centered versus gear being loot-centered enables a spectrum of gear dependency.  That is pure casters are the most independent of gear, followed by priests, hybrids can overcome some gear dependency with spells, and pure melees being the most gear dependent and hence loot centered.<br>
<br>
Making everyone dependent on gear to the extent that melees are would have the effect of making everyone necessarily into a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;loot whore,&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and drive other player styles from the game.<br>

Which Verant mentioned they're putting these focus effects on equipment already ingame.<br>
<br>
Casters power lies in their mind (Int/Wis) which should increase over time.  I don't want my power coming from the item I've attained.  The equipment I get should just enhance my power.<br>
<br>
We don't need drops with right click ice comet.  Anyone play Blizzards Diablo games where you get staffs with charges of spells that get recharged?<br>
<br>
I deffinatly think that lvl 60 magicians that are dropping Vulak and Seru should be able to get items that make them do more damage then the lvl 60 mage killing Trakanon and Vindicator.<br>
<br>
A lvl 60 war with Vulak weaps/gear is preffered in a group either EXP or Raiding.<br>
Any lvl 60 caster Vulak equipped or Non guilded can do the same damage in an EXP group or Raid.   <br>
<br>
Where's the item to strive for?<br>

I have always felt that it was handled inadequately in EQ - if I were to design the game I would definitely put up a &quot;recommended level&quot; on many, if not all of the items. However, this is Verant's game and whichever decision they make, the players can only comply or at most suggest an alternative. Now, I would go ahead and say that a twinked Caster would perform MUCH better than an un-twinked caster. Vastly increased manapool, as well as items that have some useful effects (such as Zlandicar's heart) can make a huge difference. Twinking a caster is still beneficial. However, the adventages gained from twinking a caster does not scale with the astounding power gained from twinking a melee. That's the difference.<br>
<br>
On the subject of &quot;Are casters dependent on loot&quot;, I would say &quot;Yes&quot;. Once again it's not as drastic a difference as loot on a melee, but a difference nevertheless. A wizard is purely limited by his mana. An uber wizard with 4k+ mana, epic, manna robe, Greater Familiar, horse, 15FT items, lvl 60 Luclin spells etc etc is going to perform a HELL lot better than a wizard without. Necromancers generally seek to improve mana and hp...and thus a Necromancer with high hp regen (gained from a combination of items) and large manapool is definitely going to outperform a Necromancer without. The example of loot that you're bringing up is only focus items...but there already exist some excellent caster loot that benefits us without being imbued with a focus effect. However, there isn't enough of such loot, relative to melee loot.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Why can't this be accomplished simply by the introduction of more compelling caster loot, especially at the high end, without weakening spells and making casters dependent on gear? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Here is where I believe you're misunderstanding. For one thing, no class is *dependent* on gear (allow me to further elaborate). A lvl 60 Monk wearing &quot;common&quot; loot can still adequately perform his function. However, the same monk wearing uber loot may accomplish it better. And also, what you have said is exactly what everyone is asking. Focus items are only a portion of what could possibly be the balance that melees and casters needed, and even that is not yet set in stone. You have suggested the possible outcome that casters may have to switch out slots in order to accommodate. But that is already happened right now, to a lesser degree. You see casters switching out some of their slots for FT items. But that is not a big issue, simply because many items featuring a FT agent also has excellent primary stats. I see more or less the same thing happening with introducing items with focus effects.<br>
<br>
The problem of melee/caster balancing ultimately lies at the end game - where a caster simply cannot advance himself much more than what he already has, while there's still room for melees to improve. And while not neglecting the lower levels, the endgame is where Verant should be focusing mostly. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=175.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=175.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=175.topic&index=18><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=175.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=175.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=175.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
