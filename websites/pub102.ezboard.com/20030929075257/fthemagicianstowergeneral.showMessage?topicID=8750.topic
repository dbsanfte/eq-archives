(hope for the lowby mages)</span><hr size=1> I was playing an alt over the weekend, and was amazed.<br>
<br>
A low-mid 30's group, looking for more.  35 monk lfg, 34 rogue lfg, 24 mage lfg.<br>
<br>
Group consisted of, 31 cleric, 32 warrior, 30 wizzard, 29 ranger, 29 cleric.  Who would you pick?  Who did they pick?<br>
<br>
They picked the mage (much to my surprise).  At a time in a mages life where they are feeling underpowered (20-33, or at least when I remember feeling extremely weak), and they opt to grab him.<br>
<br>
I was shocked and pleased to see the mage get picked over those that had 10 lvl's on him.  He needed it more than the other 2 did (as they could solo some locals, but he couldn't).<br>
<br>
Of course the group, being cleric heavy, would have benefited more from either of the other 2, I found it hard to object to their decision of grabbing the mage (however the other guy that got passed up, found it easy to object).<br>
<br>
Just something positive I saw and thought I would share it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mantria>Mantria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 489<br> <font color=#333333>(2/10/03 4:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8750.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.DaveShirley.org/neil/rock_beast_03_t%5B1%5D.gif height=150 width=150></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A new Leaf??

<br>
I'm just curious. Why do you think they'd bennifit more from a monk or rogue?<br>
<br>
Warrior can pull, warrior can tank, warrior can do damage. that's rogue and monk.<br>
Mage can summon a pet and use his own spells thus giving ALOT of dps to the group.  Not a flame just curious why you'd feel the mage wasn't what was needed by this group.(personally sounds like a good choice given the make up of the group already)<br>

<br>
My last pick-up group excursion to Dreadlands at 42, we had a cleric, enchanter (who was pretty useless and on my &quot;never group with&quot; list), 2 monks, a warrior (highest at 44), and me.  We were pulling 3/4 at a time and tearing them a hole.  XP was good, and mana/health level was constant.  One monk's main was a 60something Shaman who sat behind and SoWd/buffed as necessary.<br>
<br>
I had to leave to study.  Said goodbye, saluted Vebaner, and gated off to bazzar to sell my wares.  10 minutes later, I catch a tell from the warrior &quot;Dude, you gotta come back.  We are getting beat and had to go back to pulling singles.&quot;<br>
<br>
I was grinning ear to ear.  &quot;Check the Yeti Caves.  I bet you'll find another mage in there.  Either that or wake up the enchanter and teach them to mez.&quot; <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I saw the rogue hitting 40's and BSing 100's<br>
I saw the monk trippling and quading (rarely) for 30-40, plus kicking for 80's.<br>
<br>
My thought here was, not so much the added dps that either could add (since 24 pet=24ish hits+mage being able to bolt for 130-if memory serves?)<br>
<br>
It was their camp.  They were having to pull 2-3 casting mobs at a time cause no FD puller.  This itself wasn't a problem, but it was a strain on the group.  Even with pulling 2-3 casters, and no FD puller, the rogue would have enough taunt to help keep the adds off the healers/wizzard.  They weren't able to pull from deeper in the zone because they were lacking in CC.<br>
<br>
That being said, the mobs were 27-35, making them all red to the mage, thus increasing resist rates. <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I am happy they chose the mage, I am amazed that the group picked him over the other 2 lfg'ers.  They knew he was a mage, and they picked him over the other 2, a tear went to my eye in joy.  <br>
<br>
Sure his dps was well appreciated by the group, rightfully so, I just didn't expect them to see him as a dps machine.  Even though the monk/rogues dps &quot;might&quot; have been higher (both mediocrely equiped based on the numbers I saw-then again one of them was me and I know my equip is sub par) over time, the chain casting dps that the mage brought to the table for the big pulls greatly reduced the amount of time those mobs lived. I just didn't expect the group to see him for that, they never saw me for that when I was around that level (sniff).  <br>
<br>
Mantria, thats all I meant.  The ability to single pull, or to help with agro management, since they lacked CC.  There was 13 non casting mobs at that camp, and 8 casting mobs there (3 solo pullable casters by warrior, a duo caster pull, and a tripple caster pull, anything past that is insta train by a non FD/hide-sneak puller).  Which a 21 mob camp is nothing to sneeze at when repop is 15 minutes, especially when 1/4 of said mobs were yellow/red to most of the group.   They could have gotten 4-6 more mobs if they were able to single pull past where they were pulling (even though they were already pulling from quite a distance away), which really could have been done by either rogue or monk.  <br>
<br>
Essentially, they had a 2-3 minute break before repop's, clerics were reportedly 60-80m most of the time.  On the 3 caster pull it's 2 healers(cleric/shaman), 1 caster (necro/mage/chanter).  I am happy they got the mage, I am amazed that they saw him for a dps machine, I applaud them for being smarter (about the mage class) than 90% of the people I see on a day to day basis.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ailurya@themagicianstower>Ailurya</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(2/10/03 6:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8750.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A new Leaf??

<br>
I've noticed a nice increase in damage output with the 34 nukes, and a self-DS-ing MS1 pet is a real beast, but I must say I never felt particularly underpowered from 20-33; the nukes were getting weak by the 30s but the pet improvements mostly made up for it, and I ripped through 20-24 in Paludal, 24-29 in Echo Caverns and the SK aviaks and 30-34 at the Golras. Of course pre-Luclin, without the Paludal and Echo XP bonus, that would probably have been rather different. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pissed1vi2soe@themagicianstower>Pissed1VI2SOE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 599<br> <font color=#333333>(2/10/03 6:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8750.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   new Leaf??

Something I didn't see when my mage was at that level.  I am amazed and happy that it's there.

It wasn't because of the extra damage the mage could do, resists would play a big part in less damage, but for the simple fact that they were looking for a group XP bonus and a lvl 24 mage would suck the least amount of XP from the rest of them.  Just look at the level numbers.<br>

I know you may not agree with me, but that seems to be the mindset of pickup groups these days.  <p>Tadwen Brytewisp<br>

I can't believe that; even at their level you'd need to get 14% more XP to justify having an extra group member, and, while I forget the numbers, I don't think the increase in group bonus from going from a five person group to a six person group is anywhere near that large. Unless they expected to kill mobs at least 10% faster from having the Mage there wouldn't be much point. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ailurya@themagicianstower>Ailurya</A> at: 2/10/03 7:12:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordgojirax>LordGojirax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 452<br> <font color=#333333>(2/10/03 7:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8750.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojhead.jpg width=98 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A new Leaf?? (hope for the lowby mages)</span><hr size=1> With Mage Pet/DS you are adding enough DPS to justify the bonus, and with the Mage being level 24 he doesn't take 1/6 of the exp as you would expect.. he takes 24 shares of exp versus the 30+ shares that the rest of the group members are taking.<br>
<br>
The math does pan out.<br>

I know everytime some damage dealer is leaving a group I am in I always look for more mages to add.

na mage is not underpower until 50-60 <br>
otherwise they are fine... esp. if they got a horse early on. <br>
