However, me and a group of my guildmates, Ench, Cleric, SK, Mage and Shaman all went to CB to do some slaughtering of EMp crush in the tower... We're there for about an hour when a group comes up and starts killing stuff... we basically ignore then and anytime something spawns and hits me it died instatly... so their monk thought if they trained us we'd die and they could take our spots... needless to say that didn't work but it annoy'd us enough to buff all the tower mobs and most of the room where the Lord spawns with Aego, Fos, Sta, Haste... and then I equiped them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We then left and went outside the castle to watch... we warned the group just outside the castle not to pull anything from in it because we buffed them... so we plvl'd one group outside and watched the other group die over and over again trying to get their corpses.

<br>
Ive had bad experiences with beggars and giving them things. I remember once I had some stuff collecting dust in the bank so I decided Id go give it to someone. Well I go to Freeport and quickly a low level caster asked if I had some plat I could spare. I told him no but here you can have this, so I gave him like a green silken drape and some other low level caster gear and he sends me a tell and says I dont want this crap, give me 100plat. After that I never gave anything to a beggar only to people who didnt ask.<br>
<br>
Also if you give into a beggar it tends to get bad because you give to one beggar all the other beggars in the zones beggar sense starts tingling then I am mobbed by every beggar with in a 10 mile radius.<br>
<br>
One time I did the mod rod trick completely by accident, I was casting weapons and armor for newbies and I gave a mod rod to a person to use as a weapon and told him not to right click it. Well a person saw him wielding it and asked if I could summon them a rod too, so I said sure gave them a rod but didnt think to tell them not to right click it, I thought they knew what it did since they asked for it. Anyway they right click and die and then send me a tell and asks for another one, I thought ok they were bitten by the snake and they are going to use it as a weapon from now on. <br>
<br>
About 10 mins later I was in Commons trying to sell stuff and I get a tell from the person again, WTF all this thing does when I click it is kill me. I said yeah it will when you right click it I thought you knew sorry. The I get a tell back saying whats the point of a thing that if you right click it you die its stupid. I said at higher levels the effect wont kill you and when used will give you mana for hps its just that at your level you dont have enough hit points to take the hit. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kathodos>Kathodos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 328<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 5:42:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.battle.net/war3/images/human/units/portraits/waterelement.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: N00B memories..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Baervon:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> It seems he would give newbs 20pp to drown themselves in the lake.

<br>
I also remember just before PoP I was sitting in The Arena with a druid friend training rare languages (as you have to zone after each point, a druid succor in Arena was the quickest way to zone).<br>
<br>
A guild of about 25 players, levels between 35 - 50, begins to zone in and bind using the soulbinder, as they had planned to have a guild event in the Arena.<br>
<br>
As I was level 60, I was walking around in the Arena watching their duels assuming none of them would try to engage me.  A level 36'ish druid decided he'd take a go at me, so I invis'd, walked off to a corner, and summoned my epic pet, fully buffed it, then walked back into the centre of the Arena and set the pet to guard.<br>
<br>
The druid ran up, looked at me, turned to look at the pet, cast SoW on himself, nuked me then made a break for the Arena PvE/PvP border and safety.  He didn't make it 5 feet before Jobantik ripped him apart (/thank Velocity).  The rest of his guild slowly started attacking the pet one at a time, and getting killed off.   Then they tried attacking in small groups.<br>
<br>
Eventually their guild leader (50 warrior with a 60 monk alt, who I'd been chatting with while this was happening) formed them up, and they used the epic pet as a raid mob. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   They had set up cleric complete heal chains, the works.  Was going well for them, until one of their clerics gained CH healing aggro, and the pet switched to the Cleric!  I didn't order the pet too, so it took me by surprise.  Their healing promptly fell apart, and the pet started cleaning them up.  A few of the less valiant members made a break for the Arena entrance, but the pet caught up with them and dropped them about 2 feet from safety.<br>
<br>
I was laughing so hard it hurt. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Their guild leader came back with his 60 monk to tank (using a 2H'er) and I used the pet commands to keep aggro on him and made sure the pet didn't switch targets.  Their 25 or so people completed their &quot;raid&quot; on this second attempt, only losing a few.  Was a lot of fun for them and me, and after several of them had thanked me for the fun, and I them, I left. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=59365" target="top">Kathodos</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Battle Cleric of Tunare - Tholuxe Paells<!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=279732" target="top">Kantreach</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> - Arch Mage Antagonist - Tholuxe Paells</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=fizzlekin>Fizzlekin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(1/11/03 11:28:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=45>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Stupidest Newbie Complaints</span><hr size=1> Does anyone remember when you could log into the world as a creature in one of the lower level zones?<br>

I remember we would all be spawned in oasis and we would hide in the water under the docks.  Once we saw someone come and sit down to med, we would all pop out and gank them as orcs.  Im still laughing now just thinking about it, good times indeed.  I wish they would have kept that feature.<br>

i used to sit in the field of bone at lvl 60, paying for bonechips (faction quest for cabilis), and summoning shuriken off my bracer for newbie monks. some would just go &quot;wow&quot;, some would beg for money or items, and one guy just wanted information on the monk class. he's still one of my best eq friends to date, has gone from lvl 7 to 43 in the meantime, asking me for advice and opinions regularly, and i'm ready to provide them whatever i may be doing at the time. and he's getting some twink items now and then when i'm too damn lazy to sell them for a few 100 pp. next will be an 8th coldain ring mq when we find the quest npc up, the guy is getting paid for not being greedy in the long run. <p><a href=http://www.monkly-business.com>[65 Transcendent]</a> <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=592>Sensei Ronaan</a> <a href=http://www.wolfsclan-eq.de>< Wolfsclan ></a> - Retired. -</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ginneh>Ginneh</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(1/31/03 9:15:41 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=51>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Spamming noobs</span><hr size=1> One day I was in Qeynos hills with my friend and then this 5 warrior newb comes and spams the zone, it got annoying so I told my friend brb, told the spammer to meet me in North Qeynos and said I'd duel him and he asked what that was, i told him it was a fun thing<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Minding our own buidness, a monk came strolling in and started attacking us in the PVP area. We asked him to be nice and not kill us and did a /who on him and we come to find out he is a level 47 monk. He pretty much wiped us all out seeing that we were all level 1 toons. Not to take such actions lying down, we log on our mains and proceed back to the PVP area in FP. The highest level player in the guild was about 30 at the time and when we all showed up and we let him know who we were and he about peed his pants. I was playing a druid at the time and I learned that Darkness was a great spell. Makes the person it is cast on see just a black screen. No ui, no buttons, just black. So he is running around hitting at nothing, dotted, snared then rooted and getting smacked by the wizzy with us. In the end he was begging for his life and asked us to stop. We did, when he exited the PVP area but the dots got him anyway and he lost exp for it. We were young then, but we still knew how to whoop up on people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showMessageRange?topicID=241.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showMessageRange?topicID=241.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showPrevMessage?topicID=241.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showNextMessage?topicID=241.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=52><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.threadControl?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergoofystuff>Goofy Stuff</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
