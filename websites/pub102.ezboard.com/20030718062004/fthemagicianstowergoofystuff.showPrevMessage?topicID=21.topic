<br>
Elrond tell the Guild: OK, I’d like to bring the guild council to order. We are here today to discuss Gandalf’s loot whore attitude, and his blatant KS of the Balrog in the mines of Moria. Strider, do you want to tell us what happened please?<br>
<br>
Strider: Well, we’d just had one helluva fight, a train like you wouldn’t believe, more orcs that you could shake a fist at, and a really nasty named Cave Troll.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Which idiot pulled that lot?<br>
<br>
Strider: It was that darn noob Pippin’s fault, he went too close to the to the well and got agro….<br>
<br>
Elrond: Ah yes, I’d meant to bring that up, what on earth made you bring those level 5 haffers with you anyway? Are you quite mad, you know their agro range is half a zone in these high level dungeouns’<br>
<br>
Strider: Well we didn’t have any choice really, they are friends of Frodo, and he insisted on bringing em along, and as you know, without his quest ring, we can’t do the Dark Lord quest.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Well why didn’t someone else carry the ring, save all this bother in the first place?<br>
<br>
Strider: That’s down to Gandalf, when he hacked the EQ.INI file, he found out that the ring has a hidden effect. In addition to the invis, it’s got some kind of charm dot. Over time, the more you wear it, the greater the chance of the Dark Lord charming you across the zone.<br>
<br>
The theory is, if the haffer gets charmed, it won’t matter, he’s bright green to all of us, so he’s not exactly going to do anybody any damage. But if you give that ring to a lvl 60 tank like Boromir, well that guys a walking meat grinder, he’d nail half of us in a minute if he got charmed, last thing you need if you are on a boss mob is to have Boromir as an add.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Darn, a cross-zone charm!? I really do wish Verant would fix these kind of bugs on the test server before they put them on live. Anyway, back to the matter in hand, Gandalf’s KS of the Balrog.<br>
<br>
Strider: Well we dealt with the first wave of adds ok, but their must have been some form of chain agro, because we must have pulled to whole darn zone, including the boss mob, the Balrog. Gandalf tried to get evac off, but he was being stunned like crazy, so we shouted ‘Train to zone’ and legged it.<br>
<br>
Fortunately, we’d all got Run Speed 3, and the haffers still had their SoW from before we zoned in, so we managed to almost outrun them. Unfortunately the Balrog is pretty nifty on his feet too, because he caught up with us just before we reached the zone.<br>
<br>
Elrond: He’s mean, how on earth did you escape him? He completely wiped MF last week, and I thought only Magister had killed him up till now?<br>
<br>
Strider: Well all the rangers were using their Sureshot discipline like crazy as we ran, and we got some really nice crits on him, plus we landed snare, so we had time to land a few nukes too. By the time we made the bridge he was down to 50% health.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Why didn’t you just zone, even at 50% health, you should never have tried to take him on?<br>
<br>
Strider: To be honest, I think some of the guys were still a bit miffed at having had to leave the Cave Trolls corpse before we had time to loot it, (he’d been carrying that rather nice Club of Moria too), so they saw a chance to still get some phat loot.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Jeez, we have way too many loot obsessed people in this guild. When will they learn, we are an RP guild first and foremost, loot is secondary to all.<br>
<br>
Strider: Anyway, we are actually doing quite well, Gandalf runed himself with his epic, and bold as brass, blocked the Balrog from getting across the bridge, don’t ask me how the elven druids and dwarf clerics managed to keep him up, but they did. I think it was the pallies who really did the business though, I saw 6 LoH land on him.<br>
<br>
Elrond: WHAT!!! Are you telling me you used a lvl 60 wizzie as your MA, are you quite insane?? Why on earth wasn’t Boromir on the bridge, he’s the guild MA??<br>
<br>
Strider: It was an accident, we hadn’t had time to shrink anyone, and we just couldn’t get past Gandalf to take agro, plus, Gandalf was being stunned like mad, and even when he did move to get away from agro, he got summoned right back again.<br>
<br>
Elrond: Jeez I hate wizzies who can’t control their agro.<br>
<br>
Strider: Well in the end, it didn’t matter, we somehow kept Gandalf up, and with all the ranger bow crits, the druid dots, and the damage we’d already done to him, we finally got him to run. Unfortunately, there's a known pathing error on that bridge, and the Balrog fell into the pit.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Gandalf disbands his group, and jumps right in the pit after the Balrog. Next thing we know, everyone gets a faction hit, so we know the mobs died. We immediately start a hollering and a whooping, I mean, the Balrog is the biggest mob this guild's dropped before, and we all sit down, and wait for Gandalf to call the loot. <br>
<br>
But we don’t hear anything from Gandalf, and when we try send him a tell, he’s offline. Not to worry we tell ourselves, its just an LD, he’ll be back, and he can succor to the zone out with the loot. So we wait, and we wait.<br>
<br>
By now, everyone’s starting to panic, there’s only 10 mins left on the loot timer. Noone's got lev any more, so when we try to jump into the pit, people take a 10k fall, and have to be corpse summoned. Plus, out of the blue, the train we had left behind pathed its way to us, and we all had to zone. Well we waited forever outside the zone for Gandalf to come back, but he never did. Boy were we pissed I have to tell you, all that phat loot, poofed.<br>
<br>
So we continue on our way, and a few days later, who appears back in /GU but Gandalf, and he’s apologising like crazy, saying his cable went out, and he just couldn’t get back on. We’re all sympathetic, right up until someone in guild sees that Gandalf not only has a new robe, but a new staff too, and when we look it up on Allys, its only drops from the Balrog!!<br>
<br>
The bastard must have still had his lev up, and Manaburned as soon as he hit the bottom of the pit. Because he’d done so much damage already, he got the kill, looted it up, and /Q’d out.<br>
<br>
We’ve confronted him about it of course, but he says he went on a raid with Magister, and they let him have the loot, because compared to all the VT loot, the Moria stuff is crap, and none of em needed it. None of us believe a word of it……<br>
