<br>
I had to get this off my chest.  Aftter I saw this board and read the posts I was very impressed and I thought this was a good way to exchange info.  So I decided to go check out other boards. (Sorry Rebo but I had too)  What I found at the other boards I went too was most disturbing.  I went to a message about soloing I solo a lot for exp and feel that Mages are great at it.  Well this poster listed all the good solo classes and of course he did'nt mention Mages.  Why??  He said the Wizard are a great class to solo but Mages were just not up too the task!!!!  This disturbed me, so I went to eqvault and saw that there was a Mage forum there.  What I read there was even worse everyone was complaining that our class sucks.  We have no unique abilities or spells they said.  Our summing spells were a joke they said.  We are the least powerful class they said!!!!!   And these are the Mages complaining.  SO I left that forum and went too another Mage forum, much like this one.  (but not as good)  I saw there was a disscussion of posts about Mages and groups.  When I read that I was completely discusted.  The posts mainly were from mages and they all were complaining about how we had nothing too offer groups?!?  How everytime they joined a group they were turned away for being a Mage or were not allowed to summon a pet because &quot;it ate up too much exp&quot;.  SO in the past too days I have read many posts on various boards and forums.  What I got from them  is that Mages are no good at solo or in a group.  That our spells are weak and our summoning ability is usless.  This makes me sick!!  Please someone post and tell me we are a great class.  I know my Lvl 18 mage rocks!! How come no one else seems to aprieciate us??  Sorry this is so long but I had too tell someone about what is being said about us.  Thanks for reading this (you are very paticient).  <br>

Not at all!</span><hr size=1> First off let me say that I am only lvl 20 mage now and Im not sure how hard it is gonna be down the road for us since we skip a few spell circles on DD spells.  I have played a wizard up to lvl 40 on another server and I will say whoever said a wizard can solo better than a mage must be totally high on drugs!  My wizard even had Jboots too and was still having to zone more often than my fellow mage friend was at equal lvl w/ jboots as well.  I am enjoying the hell out of my lvl 20 mage much more so than my wizard (especially at lvl 20 since wizards get a crappy highly resisted DD at this lvl).  As far as the ppl complaining about their mages well goto all the class boards and you will have ppl complaining about their wizzies, necros, etc, etc, You just can't please everyone that plays this game.  I also wonder if some of these ppl if not all that complain KNOW how to play their character the correct way?<br>
<br>
The grouping part is one thing I haven't had too much trouble with my mage so far but I can see a lot of ppl's ignorance later on down the road of not wanting us in group by stating something as false as our pets eat up too much exp which is total nonsense.  Especially at higher lvls I would love to have a mage in group w/ a Duel Wielding pet w/ burnout and dmg shield!  It cuts down on down time and damage to the group big time!  I know this from playing w/ a mage in kithicor at night w/ my wizzie and one other person in group.<br>
Another nice thing about mages and I have heard them complain as well but just looking at the stats its not bad at all is the modulating rods we summon at lvl 44.  225hp for 150 mana is a better hp/mana ratio than the shaman's own cannibalize which is 50 for 25.  It would be most useful to a cleric/druid/wizard for emergency heal and evacing (i've only evaced my group w/ my wiz only ONCE btw so its not an often thing like a lot of ppl think).  We also offer great dmg shields to cast on tanks and malise line like the shamans for lowering the resistances and will stack on enchanters debuffs.  True, a lot of what I have seen and read on the average summonings are quite useless really but there are a few that are in demand and helpful.  Bandages/food/water/mod rods/ and ive read ppl talking about the sword of runes and have seen ppl online auctioning for one.  The most important thing to have in group w/ a mage is the pet!  Trust me, I have noticed that by not allowing the pet to do more than 50 per damage he doesn't eat up hardly any exp at all and if the group is letting the pet do that much to a mob then its time to find other stuff to kill anyway hehe.  I have noticed the exp split when grouped w/ one other person and no pet is summoned too.  According to GZ (for what its worth) pets in group only eat up an average of ONE WHOLE PERCENT.<br>
<br>
I know in this post I compared the wizard against the mage a little bit but both classes are excellent in their own ways in groups as far as I am concerned and enjoy playing them both (especially the mage =)).  I hope this helps boost your confidence in the mage class and hope to see others input as well.<br>

a very slow computer so I couldnt go in dungeons or even big groups. No one solos<br>

taking down a MOB the easiest, I also count the little things (especially food and water),<br>

Our class is totally self relieant, our regents can be bought in any town, our food and water<br>
is automatic, our pets have a variety of uses, and our spells are geared to keep us<br>
out in the field, only stopping to dump money and loot. A mage that didnt care about<br>
loot or money could stay out soloing a VERY VERY long time (only stopping when his pet<br>
regents gave out). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uronaldorvladimir.showPublicProfile>Ronaldor Vladimir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(2/21/00 3:53:35 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.homenetwork.fsnet.co.uk/Mage_Compendium/Images/Profile.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   I agree</span><hr size=1> Zanzabar has hit the nail on the head, that is what being a mage is all about :-) <p><html>

I am a level 41 (42 by tonight) Erudite Magician on the Innoruuk server, and I lead a guild called The True Dominion. We fight for all that is good in Norrath and I will put my life on the line to save a total stranger.<br>
<br>
I tell you all of this so in case you do not believe what I am about to say, you can come find me and see for yourself that I am honorable and trustworthy in my statements.<br>
<br>
You shall never find a person more dedicated to the mage class than I am. Before I got EQ I did some research on what class I wanted to be. After a while I decided that whatever class it was, I wanted it to be a pet class, leaving it down to 2 real choices, necros, and magicians. I'd already decided at that point I wanted to be an Erudite. I finally decided on magicians due to the multiple pet abilities, and the great dmg spells, and the ability to be totally self reliant. Since that time that I first created Morpherios, I have not once switched to another character. I've spent all of a total of 10 minutes playing other characters. When asked why I never tried a new class, I'd simply return the question and said &quot;Why bother? I've already found everything I need right here.&quot; and then promptly blew something up to proove it. <br>
<br>
The magician is not without it's flaws. One of them being, if that pet dies, you either zone, gate, or run. Unless that mob is on it's last legs, you don't have much of a chance. Some of our summon items are also rather lame. However I've gotten use out of a lot of the things, such as the staves, on corpse retreivals. When you  have lowered mana, It helps to have a nice 10 dmg weapon there to help. Now, the thing is, in order for something to really kill you, it HAS to kill that pet. Unless you're trained or you get more than 2 high blue mobs on you at a time, you're not gonna die if you keep your wits about you.<br>
<br>
FACT: We EASILY have the best pets in the game, and if used properly they will serve to be a better personal tank than any warrior, ranger, paladin, or shadowknight you'll ever group with.<br>
<br>
FACT: Out of any class in this game, we are easily the most self reliant. You buy a good stock of, say, 120 reagents for pets and maybe the phantom shield spells, and you're set for a LONG time of battle in the field. I've gone a month already (real life month, playing 5 hours a day at least) without leaving a dungeon. I never had to leave, weight reduction bags to keep weight low, food/water/bandages/coldstones/pet weapons. Everything I need right inside the spell book.<br>
<br>
FACT: Magicians have a versatility unmatched by any class. Necros are great soloers. Druids are too. But when was the last time you saw them soloing stuff in a dungeon reliably, or a high risk area that was confined. We nearly always solo stuff toe to toe, we can't fear, we can't kite (with the exception of the Jboots people) we can't stun or root (not counting pets, but even when they do, they're going toe to toe with a mob) we can't snare, we can't blind. What do we do? We send our BEASTS of pets into that mob head on. And we blow the sh*t out of it. Our pets' automatic abilities enable them to let us play like that, to do the work quick. I've already been fighting in guk,and ended up with 3 mobs, all about mid blue. I buffed, armed, and flame shielded myself and pet. Sent my pet into the 3 of them. 1 of them was able to get away, and attacked me head on, my pet managed to hold the other 2. I was thinking &quot;oh crap, gate time.&quot; But just before I began to cast, a wonderous thing happened, and I swear to you this is true. My pet, rooted one of the ones he was on, rooted the OTHER one he was on, ran up to me, and rooted the LAST one so I could back off, then he taunted it off me. Together the 2 of us killed it very fast. Then he moved on to the next one. He went after the one closest to us, but the one in back broke root. He casted root on it AGAIN and held it in place, and me and him went and killed the one in front. By this time I was low on mana, but being the earth beast that he was, I threw a heal on him, and he went ahead and solo'd the last one the rest of the way down. True story, not one part is exagerated. And if you need to know where this happened, Lower Guk, take the left hand slippery ramp from the dead side zone, walk down the ramp, down the long hallway, into the circular room where 3 spawn. anyone who's been down there knows that room. <br>
<br>
Another tactic too many people over look, and the one the mages do best, /pet get lost. To those of you unfamiliar, this is used to make your pet die immediately. But it holds a very very rewarding purpose. Let me set up the scenario for you. You're fighting a hill giant. The giant is under half, but you're pet is almost dead, you still have mana to spare but not enough time to blast the HG before the pet dies, what do you do? Type /pet get lost       but do NOT hit enter. Instead, get within pet command range (usually about the same range as a /say would reach) and start to cast a new pet. Once the casting is JUSTabout done, like the last quarter of the last casting bubble, hit enter. Pet suicides, new pet comes out INSTANTLY. Send that bad boy on the HG and now you have the tank you need to finish your fight, no fuss, no muss. Works very very well if used in the right situations. <br>
<br>
That's all well and good, we can solo well. How about groups?<br>
<br>
Just after the patch went live for mage pets to weild weapons, a 50th mage summoned a pet, gave it weapons, burned it out, and flame shielded it. His pet solo'd a bok in lower guk. Think of how useful that would be in a group, especially without an enchanter. Pull to many? Put the pet on one or 2. He'll hold em just fine. Also, at level 39 the highest pet you make can do 40 dmg per shot. Now when he does that 3 times, sometimes 4 a round. Plus if you're using water or fire, he nukes, or if you're using air he stuns, or if earth he roots. That's one hell of an upfront man. And that's just the pet. We can still nuke hard, sure maybe wizards out dmg us with spells alone, but what happens when they go OOM. They sit. What happens when we go OOM? We sit, while our up front man bashes the HELL out of that mob. Ok, how about our dmg shields, best in the game. You got 2 tanks, throw a dmg shield on each of them when the fight gets hairy. If there's more than 2 mobs, that shield's gonna do over 200 dmg in less than 15 seconds. Not bad considering it takes all of, what, 3 seconds to cast, uses little mana, and you just let it work it's magic while you cast yourself. It's like a dot almost. The mob literally beats itself to death while hitting the tank. So you say &quot;well ok but necros can do real DOTs&quot; sure but this one lasts longer than a DOT, and can potentially do more dmg if the fight lasts long enough. Let us not forget coldstones, people love that ultravision. How about bandages for your monks and tanks when there's an absence of a healer? Or food and water to stave off that trip for a group member needing to go to a town to buy while the rest of the group slows down it's progress. Weapons for pets instantly. Malise series to debuff the mobs resists on everything we need, not just magic, but magic cold fire poison. And if you have an enchanter, the tashan series, double your pleasure double your fun, with a red mob that can't resist worth a damn!<br>
<br>
Anyone who's complaining about being a mage should have their head examined. We have power to spare, and a style unique to us. You can fight in a group for 3 hours, and on a whim just decide to go solo somewhere else, and have the power to do that easily. The only people who will turn you away from a group are those who haven't had a good mage in their group yet, be persistant to get them to let you in, and show them what we can do, it'll make life easier for the next mage that comes along needing a group from the same people. So fellow magi, rejoice, no we do not &quot;suck&quot; nor are we poor soloers, or groupers. We are strong. We have all the skills we need rolled into our spell book. Now if you'll all excuse me, I have some hill giants to solo. Let the good times roll!<br>

Keep in mind, people tend to do a lot of whining about thier class... especially on everquest.com.<br>
<br>
I've played a Warrior to 16th, a Druid to 24th and a Magician to 31st.  Magicians Rock! (though I still miss SoW. Oh well, I hang out regularly with a Druid!).  <br>
<br>
Wizards are the *worse* solo caster class.  They can root and nuke but, if root doesn't stick, they are in trouble.  Necro's are probably the best solo class.. they can dish out a lot of damage and have a lot of defensive skills (steelskin, invuln ability, shadowstep, etc).  Necro's are overpowered in my opinion. <br>
<br>
Enchanters rock.  If you ever wanna go on a dungeon crawl, bring a good Enchanter.  Area Effect Mez kicks butt.<br>
<br>
Magicians do have their weakness: They are reliant on their pet for defense (no root, no fear, no shadowstep, etc).   However, they have the best pets in the game, they have the most versatile, they have the best dmg-to-mana spell line in the game (dmg shield), and they have great DD.   They can easily be solo'd from lvl 1-29 without much problem.  30+ starts becoming more of a problem, but there are still many things to fight (I'm 31 now).. its just that 29-33 is the weak point in our lives (still got that 170sh blast).  But still many places to hunt solo to get xp (harriers are easy kills for good xp. Avocets as well if you research the earth pet).   <br>
<br>
On top of all this, we make great groupers.  Not only can we finish opponents almost as well as a wizard, we can dmg shield tanks and provide an extra tank.  <br>
<br>
As for our summoned items, they are pretty useful. Everyone wants a coldstone! Bronze spear is a good MR for fighter types (dag of runes for mage types).  DPocket comes in handy, and Daggers/Swords for pets.  Summon Food/Water means we never have to go to town except for banking.<br>
<br>
One thing I think Verant should do is put more useful spells on our items.  Like conjuring wands with a cool spell, etc.  I've grown to like summoning a staff of runes with cancel magic (or is that symbols?) and using it to cancel a mob's dmg shield.  Its like a free spell.<br>

Listen to this expample:<br>
I was camping the magi room in lower guk.  There were 3 mages, a monk, and a ranger.  Us magi had 2 air pets and an earth.  Well our ranger pulled 5 Dar's, we had no cleric or healer, adn we literally slaughtered those 5 dars.  No one dropped below half life and the fight lasted 1 minuite tops.  Mages are some of the best classes in the game.  We are a two for one deal, the pets are awesome and we are second to only wizards in direct damage, and even then not by very much.  Plus we get fire sheilds, this is an immense help!<br>
to say the least we are one of the best classes in all of norrath.<br>

They have to have the fear spells because their class is just basically poison and diesease class. So they have to  keep the enemy running around long enough so that the poison or their pet kills them. They cannot summon food,water and weapons like we can. They cannot summon Heatstones (effect serpent sight) or Coldstones (effect UltraVision) like we can. We can tons of AoE spells, what is better than killing off 3enemys with just a few AoE spells? Necromancers would have to keep them feared off. Magicians can solo,I think, better than anyone!      <br>
<br>
    (and this is a magician sight stop talking about how nerco. are better than mages becuase they aren't. each class has its own speical ability and put together can make a superior fighting force)<br>

<br>
Magicians have enormous power and yes Morph I have had my pets taunt multiple enemies off me before. Doesn't happen often but occasionally when the hate lists luck out your pet will run around and attack a couple of mobs once each before settling down to his more normal &quot;attack one target until dead&quot; routine.<br>
<br>
As far as I am concerned is that the magician's best ability is that of an emergency destroyer. Druids and necros etc rely too much on being able to kite or reverse pet kite. In a dungeon this is not easy or feasible. A mage can say &quot;Oh no !!&quot; and just stand up and go toe to toe when things go bad. Our pets are well designed to keep a mob off us even when nuking like crazy.<br>
<br>
In a head on confrontation where there is no ability to move or retreat NO class in the game can even come close to the destruction a mage can deal out. We may have to med afterwards but everything will be dead.<br>
<br>
In regards to mages vs necros just remember that necros can't chain cast pets anywhere near as efficiently as mages. Master this ability early in the game, I didn't really learn how to do it until in my high 30s which was a waste.<br>

Remind them that you can summon things and what you can summon during down times.  A simple message like &quot;Anyone need some food or perhaps some throwing knives?  Arrows&quot;?  I have made many rouge and monk friends just by keeping their throwing dagger suply un-depleted.  Monks tend to like them in weightless bags another summon of ours.  There is always going to be time when your puller runs out of arrows and needs more.  Our arrows are adequate*.  In the level range of having spear of warding you still will group with people who do NOT have something better in at least one of their hands.  Edjucate people.  Remeber these facts about our items. Our throwing daggers are better than anything that can be purchased from a merchant - period.  Heatstone can be held in the off hand for both the ac and vision bonus.  (I don't know if cold stone can be as well but most casters tend to have something better in their off hand than 5 ac, not at the level you get heatstone however).  Free bandages are, well free bandages.  Free food dito. (especially 20 for 25 mana).  This is all I know so far being only level 25 but common sense dictates that certain item summons are going be nearly if not completly useless later on.  This is as it should be, why should a level 20 spear summoning be an excelent spear at level 40?  Why should a level 20 fire spell be and excelent spell at 40?  Or a level 20 fire pet for that matter?  Do you catch my drift?  At level 24 there are better two hand blunt weapons that our summons but they tend to involve long camps or large amounts of platinum.  Ours will do in a pinch * if our items were always better than what can be aquired through normal methods then we would be way to powerful and way to desirable.  That is all for now.  Our items are nice and given the right circumstances and effort on your part, people will learn just how desireable we are in a group.  Our summons are a big part of what we offer to a group always remeber that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukainzo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>kainzo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/20/00 7:48:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Summons</span><hr size=1> Hey all this is seytok of the rathe server i think mages are a VERY powerful class i play both mage and necro. today i was SOLOing slate in EC (im lvl 42) id say thats pretty powerfull class to be able to solo a almost even mob in the 40's wouldnt ya say?. i also solo alot in DL and DL is a pain to solo in but mages seem to handle it quite well.

It was the best group Ive ever been in.  I was barely able to get a nuke off befor the mob was killed.  Couple of air and earths with one fire and water.  Was the most fun I have ever had grouping.  Even when 3 or 4 mobs came at us we handle them with ease.  Who needs a healer when pets regen so fast and the mob cant even come near us.  Id love to take a group of 6 mages to Lguk or any of the other dungeons that warriors etc say we cant be of use with our pets.<br>

In my opinion the magician can deal out more damage then any other single class in Norath.   The wiz can hit hard with nukes but the pet makes up more then the difference between casts.  Far as necros go,  I dont know much about them,  but id take the mages pet over theres any day.<br>

<br>
I am a lvl 57 mage. also play a 56 Druid. 51 Enc 51 Cle.<br>
My mage is my primary character and I will never stop playing him but dont fool yourself on some issues.<br>
<br>
First off:<br>
Soloing ....Druids are master hands down. They forage food and drink, they can NOW snare and root + dot thier tagets. DOTs = more Dmg over a period of time for less mana. in the outdoors druid is KING of soloing. NOT the mage. In a dungeon mage and necro are about even. We can do more damage but necros have defense i.e FD this is very valueable, if you think it isnt you need to play a FD class.<br>
<br>
below lvl 50 mages are king of the DD hands down. <br>
<br>
Second:<br>
Post 50 we are not relies upon for our dmg output nearly as much. More for Debuffs, dmg shield summonings etc. Most other classes will be picked over us for dungeon groups. Outside zones we can still solo to get good exps. But this game is made for groups...soloing will not get you good equipment- money-or a lot of friends(which is important at higher levels)<br>
<br>
When we get call of hero our life changes..we are now wanted in large scale raids so we can bring up people as others leave or just to get more firepower to smoke that ever so nasty mob deep in chardok-the hole-sebilis-etc. <br>

<br>
if we sucked soooo bad why would the wizzies be b@tchin bout how we can ALMOST do equal or more dmg, AND necros complain bout our pets being SO overpowering?<br>
<br>
answer: we got the best of both worlds awesome pets, and enuff ammo to knock a shuttle outta orbit, sure we may not get as much bang per spell as wizzys, but with our pet keeping the mobs off our backs we don't need it =)<br>
<br>
and as for pets eating up xp that only applies to SOLO work, not grps, was fixed long ago. grp xp normal, solo if pet does 50% dmg or more, it gets half the xp, with our nukes, pets should NEVER do more then half the dmg, less we get jumped while medding<br>
<br>
in summary, Mages are great soloers and grp charcs, they can go either way equally well<br>
