<br>
i'll start by posting some ideas i have been brainstorming lately which i recently submitted via a comment to the dev corner @ verants official boards.<br>
 <br>
feel free to contribute <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  helpful</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> constructive criticizem of my ideas, or post original ideas of your own.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
[*]before any actual balance work is done, verant needs to make an official statement citing where they feel every class should perform offensively in long term damage (or synonomously &quot;over all&quot;) against the warrior, just like they did for melee classes earlier in the year.<br>
<br>
this seed should be formed based on 3 important factors:<br>
-the speed in which some classes do damage...<br>
-the longevity with which some classes do damage... <br>
-the amount of support some classes have, and how important those supportive roles are. things such as damage absorbtion (tanking), pulling, sow, heals, ports, stuns, mez, bash (to interupt casting)... all that stuff should be judged on a case by case basis, and assigned a worth value. <br>
for example, <br>
-the less situational an ability (tanking vs pick locks), the higher the worth value. <br>
-the less potent an ability (air pet stuns vs cleric stuns), the lower its worth value. <br>
-if the ability is readily available on gear accessable to non-native classes, the worth value will drop, and the degree of availability will dictate by how much it will drop. <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  for example, eb might be considered worth extremely few support points, since it is readily available to non-native classes as well as highly situational.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
the higher your net supportive value, to counter balance the lower your net offensive value, and vise versa.<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BALANCING CASTING</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
1.01 enter caster focus items. make the word &quot;focus&quot; synonomous with &quot;caster weapon&quot;.<br>
<br>
[*]1.02 make it impossible for a caster to cast an offensive spell w/o a focus equiped in their primary slot. when you attempt, you receive a message: <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;you weild no focus through which to channel mental energy!&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. this step is very important: it makes casters dependant upon gear, like melees.<br>
supportive spells, however, may still be cast without focuses. the entire point of the introduction of focuses is to allow scalling for offensive spells, therefore, supportive and utility spells should remain the same.<br>
<br>
[*]1.03 focuses which make supportive spells more efficient to cast should also be available, however they will not be as prevelant or manditory.<br>
<br>
[*]1.04 implement a new tag titled &quot;focus&quot; to indicate which items are focuses, and which are not. not all caster primary &amp; 2/h equipable items will be focuses. <br>
<br>
[*]1.05 make focuses rarer for primarily supportive classes to obtain. this is also important: it clearly etches class roles in the sand, and adds a respectability to the job of an offensive caster (it always irks me as terribly unbalanced that any time an enchanter wants, they can nuke pretty darn well...)<br>
<br>
[*]1.06 make focuses have different values, depending on which class is equiping/looking at them. (i.e. a nec/wiz/mag/enc focus would weild the best stats for the wiz, worse for the mage, worse still for the necro, and the worst for the enchanter.)<br>
<br>
[*]1.07 focuses may have the following attributes: <br>
-mana cost<br>
-spell impact<br>
[the following values will typically be zero, except on mid-high end (L30+ zones) focuses.]<br>
-cast time<br>
-fizzle rate<br>
-resistance chance<br>
[the following will typically be zero, except on high end (L50+ zones) focuses.]<br>
-reduction to hate<br>
<br>
these properties will be quantified by percentage values.<br>
for aesthetical purposes, we'll use a 1-20 scale where every number equals 5%.<br>
the scale can go into negative numbers, allowing greater flexibility. <br>
last, every offensive spell will be &quot;seeded&quot; using the current stats as a base model to apply values against.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  example 1:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->lets assume you're a L49 mage. in your primary hand, you hold a well rounded upper mid-game focus. it has the following stats: <br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  mana cost factor of 2<br>
impact factor of 4<br>
cast factor of 2</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
you cast lava bolt.<br>
base stats, this spell costs 300 mana, does 810 damage, with a cast time of 7 seconds. <br>
<br>
focused, this spell costs 270 mana, does 972 damage, with a cast time of 6.3 seconds. (mana/dmg ratio of 3.4... <br>
an increase of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  .7</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and an efficiency boost of about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  26%</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  example 2:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->lets assume you hold a different focus -- this one is more of a high end focus, unlike the first. it differs from the first one, in it is designed to mold your spell to do substantially quicker, smaller bursts, yet very efficiently:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  mana factor of 10<br>
impact factor of -5<br>
cast factor of 4</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
casting lava bolt:<br>
cost 150 mana, does 608 damage, cast time 5.6. (mana/damage ratio of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  4</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->,... an increase of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  1.3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and an efficiency boost of about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  47%</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.)<br>
<br>
as for the other properties, fizzle, resist, and hate mods, the higher the percentage the less chance to fizzle/resist of course. (i.e. a focus with a resist factor of 5 would mean a 25% reduction to chance of resisting. this would mean that of every 4 resists you would get unfocused, you will only get 3 resists forcused.)<br>
<br>
[*]1.08 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  the bonuses on focus items will only be effective while grouped.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> for balance when soloing, you will cast with only &quot;base&quot; efficiency. this step is also crucial to making casters more efficient -- change the way spells work inside and outside of groups.<br>
<br>
[*]1.09 include an &quot;others spell damage&quot; filter in the new gui, with the default being on. a good chunk of the caster imbalance problem is perception based (exadurated). doing this will help &quot;debrainwash&quot; the player base.<br>
<br>
[*]1.10 make mana regen items as common as melee hp regen items. there is no reason that i can see which 17 hp/tic items fall from the sky, allowing melees to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  solo</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> with very little down time, yet a ft2 item, or even a stackable 5 mana per tic regen item should be viewed as uber and made no drop <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .<br>
<br>
[*]1.11 spells should be made to draw less hate than they currently do. there is no logical reason i can see, why when a spell is resisted it draws just as much hate as if it werent resisted.<br>
<br>
[*]1.12 remove researching and dropped spells from the game. casters should be balanced around gear from now on, and spells will be treated like melee discs/abilities/damage tables, meaning granted with level. spells will be awarded by your guild master at the appropriate level, free of charge.<br>
<br>
[*]1.13 resist rates should be cut, esspecially for lower level casters , and for higher level casters vs some uber mobs. many feel they are currently too high.<br>
<br>
[*]1.14 newbie caster's daggers should now have a focus tag on them (since otherwise they wouldnt be able to cast). the focus will be statless, and function only till level 20.<br>
after level 20, the caster must get out in the world and hunt down a real focus weapon, just like melees do              <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
it should be noted that focuses for newbies will be available earlier than that, but i figured it is only fair to allow a bit of a &quot;buffer zone&quot; for the new player.<br>
<br>
[*]1.15 fix the multi-caster dot stacking issue. this is will do alot to make some casters more efficient to have around. (i.e. 1st necro casts splurt, 2nd necro cannot.)<br>
<br>
[*]1.16 decrease the resist rates on rains. they are already limited in being ae, there is no reason for the resists to be so high.<br>
<br>
[*]1.17 <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  impose a minimum nuke amount.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> a nuke should not be able to land for less than 33% of total damage. it makes no sense that i can see, that backstabs have a minimum damage limit and <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  not nukes</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> which are resource-based.<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BALANCING PETS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
2.01 implement a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  wealth</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of various pet focus items, some which stack with other focuses, some which dont, all of various effects and potency. this is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  the golden ticket</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to fixing and scaling pet casters. focusing a pet should and must be viewed like equiping a melee.<br>
<br>
the following focuses will be introduced. all stack w/ each other as well as existing focuses, except the class unique bracelet series -- it (mostly) doesnt stack with earlier forms of itself. to receive the benefits, simply equip them before summoning your pet: <br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  gloves</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give a strength/attack boost. there will be lots of these gloves at all stages of the game (yes even the high end/raiding game), and they will be where the majority of your pets attack rating comes from. the best gloves, of course, will be only available to mage pets.<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  necklaces</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give your pet bonuses to its spell damage and/or reduces its likeliness to be resisted.<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  bps</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give your pet an ac/agi boost. there will be lots of these bps at all stages of the game, and they will be where the majority of your pets ac comes from. <br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  arms</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give a hp boost. again, they will be found at every stage of the game allowing pets to properly scale.<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  range slot items</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give your pet a signifigant boost in a specific resistance. if you summon a water pet while wearing the fire resistance focus for example, your pet will be completely imune to poison, and practically imune to fire.<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  belts</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which give your pet haste.<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  special ability jewelry</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, which will grant your pet extra abilities (i.e. an earring which makes your pet fearless for an example).<br>
-<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  bracelets</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, unique to each major pet caster (mages bracelets being the best). these bracelets will be made in 4 installments available at all stages of the game. they will stack will all focus items, but not with themselves. the last installment will stack with 1 of the previous installments, but no more than that. the last installment will be for &quot;uber&quot; raiding players only. the bracelet will grant your pet: <br>
-more damage to pet spells, <br>
-haste, <br>
-ac,<br>
-attack <br>
-level(s),<br>
-resistances<br>
-make your pet spells less resistable<br>
-increase the duration of utility spells<br>
and so on.<br>
<br>
furthermore, every mage pet type will react differently to pet focus items, so as to keep the uniquness of each element in tact.<br>
<br>
[*]2.02 to allow for seemless scaling, nerf unfocused pets so they are similar to a melee fighting naked. this point, as well as point 2.01 will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  only apply to major pet casters</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (mage, nec, bst). this will help bring a greater margin of superiority between our pets, then say a shaman or an enchanters pet.<br>
<br>
[*]2.03 make the burnout series and valiant companion undispellable (and similar pet buffs of other casters).<br>
<br>
[*]2.04 remove/higher the pet haste cap.<br>
<br>
[*]2.05 in the new gui, do away with random generated pet names.<br>
change mage pets to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  character's elemental</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, for example. they are sloppy, and subconsciously i feel they make people uneasy around pets.<br>
<br>
[*]2.06 in the new gui, include a section for pet health bars.<br>
<br>
[*]2.07 make pets indifferent to everything.<br>
<br>
[*]2.08 make /pet hold a general skill. this and the above point will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  completely and totally eliminate any pet-related pathing problems</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
[*]2.09 introduce post-epic pets in raid-level zones (st, ntov, ect), which are conjured via items.<br>
<br>
[*]2.10 make the current epic pet more accessable to mid 50s mages like the rogue, wizard and monk epics (all which substantially increase dmg output for all 3 classes -- even the wizard epic if used properly).<br>
<br>
[*]2.11 newbie major pet casters (mag, nec, bst) will be given &quot;pet focus gloves&quot;, &quot;pet focus arms&quot;, and &quot;pet focus bp&quot;, in similar fashion to how the newbie warrior starts with a tunic and a training short sword.<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  FIXING THE TWINKING EPIDEMIC</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
3.01 this is really easy. simply, impose a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  skill limit</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on all items.<br>
when a level 10 warrior trys to equip a lammy, he wont be able to, and will receive the following message:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;you must have at least 190 skill in 1hs to weild this weapon.&quot;<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
when a level 10 wizard try to equip a new focus from sebilis:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;you must have at least 190 skill in evocation to utilize this focus.&quot;<br>
</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
and when a level 10 mage tries to equip the 3rd class specific bracelet:<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;you must have at least 190 skill in conjuration to utilize this pet focus.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
i think you get where im going with this                  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
armor will work on defense caps.<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BOOSTING END GAME CASTERS</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
4.01 as you may be aware, of all the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  primarily offensive</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> classes (rogues, wizards, monks, mages), mages have the greatest problems in the high end game. (by &quot;end game&quot;, i am refering to encounters vs level 55+ creatures).<br>
<br>
many have logged battles, and found mages were on average capable of only <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  bardic damage output</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> during such events. <br>
the commonly accepted theory, is this extremely low damage output is caused by the fact 60% of a mages damage output is in his/her pet -- but the nature of pets is such that their attack rating and level does not permit them to be effective vs very high level mobs.<br>
<br>
this is very much a problem for us, since the mage doesnt bring nearly as much support to a situation to warrent bardic offense. a mage brings both 3rd rate offense, as well as 3rd rate support during such encounters, making them not nearly as efficient as almost every other class. most will agree, that the plight of the end game magician is in dire need of attention.<br>
<br>
however, if some of these key points were to make it in the game (focus items for pets and casting, as well as making pets indifferent, and making pet hold a general skill), this problem would be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  resolved</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
for example, an &quot;end game&quot; mage could go with his/her guild to st or ntov, pick up pet focus items and scale their pets accordingly to meet challenges they will face, just as rogues and monks do.<br>
<br>
allowing pets to scale up via gear to meet challenges the &quot;end game&quot; pet master is expected to meet, is no more unbalancing than melee equiping themselves to meet such challenges. in fact, most mages/nec/bsts would agree: it is very much a needed step.<br>
<br>
it wouldnt trivialize the game and &quot;less difficult&quot; challenges <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  in any way moreso</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than well equiped melees do.<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  MAGE SPELLS/ABILITIES</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
5.01 the magician spell &quot;summon focus&quot; will be introduced, but only after real focuses flood the game, making it common knowledge a casters damage is suffering unless he strives to get the best focuses available (like melee weapons). the summon focus will be used mainly for crs (like summoned weapons) and will allow for worse than base damage output.<br>
<br>
5.02 increase the length of higher level ds's, so they become more mana efficient. with the prevelance of 70% slows, this is a necessary change.<br>
<br>
5.03 change all mage nukes to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  conjuration</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
5.04 change the new luclin nuke so that it is 1300 dmg/400 mana.<br>
<br>
5.05 introduce new mage nukes at level 29, and level 39.<br>
<br>
5.06 make our dot line more mana efficient. there is almost no reason to use these spells over nukes since the ratio is about the same. in fact, they are less efficient when you consider dots may not work to full effect.<br>
<br>
5.07 introduce a series of summoned weapons, designed to add a proc to our pet. (upgrades to sword of runes)<br>
<br>
5.08 add more summoned creatures to the game (not really spell related but in the same vein).<br>
<br>
[*]<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  BALANCING PVP</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->-<br>
6.01 to cut back on griefing, make people exempt from pvp for 3 minutes after engaging an npc. this will help stop people from killing others who are low on health after fighting an npc.<br>
now, i know what youre thinking -- exploiters paradise. <br>
ive thought of a pre-emptive measure for potential exploits; make it so you wave your right to the &quot;3 minute rule&quot; if you partook in pvp within the past 5 minutes. (i.e. you cant just run up and whack a fire beetle if things are going bad)<br>
<br>
[*]6.02 to cut back on griefing, make people exempt from engaging in pvp after death for 10 minutes. <br>
no more corpse camping.<br>
<br>
[*]6.03 party members should no longer be hit by &quot;friendly fire&quot;<br>
<br>
[*]6.04 change the way resists and melee damage work in pvp. its not fair that casters are subjected to a 66% rule, but there is no penalty for players resists and melee damage.<br>
<br>
[*]6.05 alter the way pets work in pvp. the level difference between player and pet is completely unfair. change it so when an opponent attempts to cast on your pet, he is met with a resist check as if he cast on the pet master. <br>

Not because I think we'd do better with them, but because if you don't have a focus at all (ie: after death) then you're oh so very much more screwed if a little green mob walks up and starts to smack on you. Oops. You can't cast any magic. Oh well.<br>
<br>
Add casting Foci to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> improve</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> potency of spells, make it easier to cast the spells (less fizzles, perhaps. less mana certainly), give the spells a bonus to hit (harder to resist finely channeled magic as opposed to crudly done), I don't know about a minimum damage since in lots of cases spells smack mobs for max anyways (watch a melee hit for max most of their time. Hah.) Only on uber high end mobs will they hit for nothing, if.. your level isn't anywhere near the creature. Solution to that is to get levels, get inside melee range, and make sure it's been tashed, sundered, malo'd, and everything else you can think of to strip it of protections.<br>
<br>
For pets, these Foci can also be used to help make pets better, to channel them out into a stronger state. Note: We HAVE Foci already for this, BUT we just can't get to them anymore. I doubt we ever could. As it is, the Earth Staff is not thought of as a Focus item, but rather, an Epic Quest piece, and that's primarily why people want it.<br>
<br>
My thoughts on class balancing:<br>
<br>
Casting:<br>
-Perhaps add Spell casting Foci to improve damage/to hit values of spells (this can be taken care of via Arch Alt Advancement skills mostly)<br>
<br>
Pets:<br>
-Add Mage-specific Pet Foci into the game that add a single skill (flurry, rampage, enrage, etc) to the pet, or improve pet damage overall.<br>
-Make pet level comparable to their summoners level. Nothign worse than watching your max 58 hitting pet.. being.. unable to hit anything worth killing because of the massive level difference. (Note: This does not say much for improving pet damage caps, only level-based calculations)<br>
-Improve pathing, Make pets Indifferent. This indiff thing people whine over just means that one can't leave a pet by a KoS mob and get xps while you sleep. It will not mean that the pet will not come to your defense if you get attacked (sheesh <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br>
-Add a spell for binding your pet to you. Lower Valient Companion's level. Nothing worse than being on a raid and.. not being able to use your pet for fear of it being Translocated or Feared away. Binding your pet to you would basically 'intercept' any teleportation attempts on your pet and bring it back to you, with a stun time, perhaps (pet shaken after being trapped between 2 wrenching magics). Valient Companion, people are STILL not used to this spell being available, and since most can't use it anyways unless you're 59, much of your time raiding is without your pet because of fearing mobs.<br>
<br>
I didn't get much of a chance to read the rest, so I'll stop there. For Magicians, our problem is with our pets and the lack of usefullness in big situations. Understand (as I learned recently) that us magicians have a KEEN advantage over other pet classes. Tailoring our pet to the kind of AoE the mob uses. Our pets are highly resistant (should be immune) or immune (fire only) to most kinds of magic (fire, cold, poison, disease). The air pet also seems quite resistant to magic as well (not sure how that works out), just not anywhere near immune. If your pet isn't hit by AoE spells, then it's simply academic. Pet == added damage. Our class does need work, but not necessarily some of the drastic changes proposed. <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>

Noonie while I do feel that you have some good ideas, many of your ideas would just cripple magicians even more.<br>
<br>
No pet focus? your pets suck.<br>
No casting focus? cant cast any spell of that type?<br>
<br>
Got your Epic? Well now you can't get the benefits of the stats because you have to hold a pet focus or a spell focus and your epic won't act as any sort of focus.<br>
<br>
The epic pet should be THE best in the game at any time. After suffering through that quest i am quite sure that any epic mage would be PISSED to have another pet spell / right click effect that made a better pet.<br>
<br>
Epic pet should be scaled up.<br>
<br>
The idea for the foci to improve spell damage, decrease mana and fizzles etc and the same for pets is a nice idea though.<br>
<br>
I also like your summon idea limited by character level or skill level as to be used, flagged of course to be usable by a pet of a given SPELL level.<br>

huh? you just put on the pet focus items on while summoning, and then take them off.<br>
<br>
oh, and im sure the epic itself would be changed so it had a spell casting focus tag, and was a very powerful focus at that... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
the epic pet itself would also stand to benefit from the focus items. like i said above: every pet type would respond to focusing differently, so as to keep each pets uniqueness in tact. (i.e. a 57 earth pet and epic pet summoned with the exact same focuses equiped, would always result in the epic pet being better than the earth pet, and by the same margin of superiority which currently exists)<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>

im sorry but really, it shouldnt and the fact that it is, shows <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  serious</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> underlying class problems.<br>
<br>
epic weapons are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  kunark era</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. every melee has weapons which are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  better than epic</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in velious.<br>
<br>
like i said, my plan was to equate melee with casters. therefore, i would like:<br>
1) to make the epic as easy as rogue and monk epics and<br>
2) to make post epic pets in st/ntov type zones.<br>
<br>
from a community stand point, we would be <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  far</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> better off if this were to happen. it would be a collective post 50 damage upgrade.<br>
the key is, to think about <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  the community</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and not the individual who may have busted his but to get his epic.<br>

when dealing with balance issues, its wise to think first of the community at large and only second if at all of yourself. you cannot balance a game around 20 mages who have their epics...<br>

again, i would like to say the intent of my list was to make casters <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> just as gear dependant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> as melees are. this is my goal, since it's impossible to equal casters to the upside of being a melee (great ability to scale, great damage output), without bringing the downside as well (total gear dependancy).<br>
<br>
an unevitable biproduct of the upside, is almost total gear dependancy.<br>
<br>
but, if you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> really</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need to fight your way to your corpse for whatever reason, if you read my post carefully, in the mage &quot;spell/abilities&quot; section i noted that eventually the spell &quot;summon focus&quot; would be added to the game, and it would allow for worse than base damage output.<br>
<br>
this would be similar to a melee grabbing a summoned sword from a mage and hacking his way to his corpse need be. <br>
imo, it is a fair and necessary step.<br>
<br>
you can still summon your pet as well, which would be like an unequiped melee. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 55 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 32 Erudite Enchantress<br> Morell Thule server.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=uncleistivaan>Uncle Istivaan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(1/12/02 11:34:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  well i agree to a degree...</span><hr size=1> a caster should NEVER be forced to hold an item just to cast offensive spells, but an item that improves spell casting in some way is a good thing.  I can think of too many situations where being forced to hold an item would be deadly, too me that could only be the ultimate nerf.  Tanks are not FORCED to hold items just to do damage, they can attack stuff with their hands, and that is better then nothign.  Like Rhasin said, if you have just died and are naked and anything comes after you, your just a gimp chew toy for the mob, and nothing you can do about it.  Pet specific focuses would be nice, and perhaps to solve the problem of holding epic and focus, make all focuses secondary items.<br>
<br>
As far as pathing goes, well your pet should always make a direct path to you until you get say 10ft? away from him, then he switches to follow pathing.  Verant has made it pretty clear they have no intention to ever fix pathing or even worry about making new zones with decent pathing.  If you have been up to luclin, its just like old times bad pathing is everywhere, and now even in some outdoor zones.  I think to just make a small change to pets AI would be best fix, and probly not that hard to implement.<br>
<br>
I think another thing mages need are better summoned goods, id say 90% of the summons i have are trivial junk that was a waste of my time to even scribe.  Some are good like mod rods and the new armors are ok, i love the new resist gears, very nice there.  Most of the other stuff like bristlebanes bundle, the only use i have found for this spell is gettin myself drunk for free when i am depresed that i cant find a group LOL <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Other things i would like to see, caster items are WAY to rare, even just improving drops on existing items would make me more than happy, been to hate, Kael and PoG many times camping for hours, nothign drops for mages.  Yet druid and tanker items drop like candy, you ever seen the drop rates on vermi armor for druids from fear?  its crazy, i took my druid up there and got him almost a full suit in 3 hours, and its about that kind of drop rate everytime i go to fear.<br>
<br>
Moreover, it should be easier to get mana regen items, to me, being able to get mana back faster = haste for a caster.  We all know that tank haste items are a dime a dozen these days, but where are mana regen items?  Well we got the robe and eye off CT, and of course some neat new ones that drop in luclin, but even still, I think there is a better chance for hell to freeze over then to see the items ever.  On top of the rarity items, my findings lead me to believe the FT series buffs dont do much...<br>
1. FT items do stack with other FT items, but a cap of 10mana/tick<br>
2. FT DO NOT stack with other mana regen buffs, clarity TPP, lich...etc, they only stack with your base regen<br>
3. The rarity on FT items is insane, sure luclin has probly more than doubled the items available out there, and i am sure one day i might be able to get one or two of them, but what use if they dont stack with anything except themselves, at 59 i will be able to give myself 7pts per tick in buffs and with the arch skill 10 total.<br>
<br>
However my source for finding FT item info is just a good friend of mine, someone i would refer to as an &quot;EQ Guru&quot;  but i dont know if this is really true, if anyone can give me concrete proof that proves or denies my findings on how FT items work, please, do tell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Also not only should FT items be better drops, they should have some drops that you can get off regular mobs in regular xp places jut like warrior haste items.  Its not like FBSS drops off an uber dragon that takes 50 people to kill and has 500k htps...no i can solo the frenzy and get my own FBSS, or i can buy one for 2-4k on my server.<br>
<br>
I didnt read your entire post yet hehe, but i will go over it more soon, i like the idea of changing casters for the better, but, i am not holding my breath :P<br>

However, my suggestion would be to make the pet an undercon, lots of undercons in luclin, take the stonegrabbers for instance, they con light blue at lvl 54, most of em, and hit for 110s, very fast attack rate and rarely miss.  All npcs go ona skill system just like players, the difference being that they are born with max skills for their lvl, players have to earn them.  A pets skills cap could be increased, so that he can hit high lvl mobs and do full damage and not miss that many times, and in reverse, his AC can be buffed as well as his dodge, parry type skills.  It would be nice to give our pets special abilities like mobs have, such as summon, rampage and enrage, but it would only be fair for tanks to get these as well I think, so that pretty much rules them out.<br>

Do you think that the mana pool we have without items equivilent of our level would let us survive the world? Hah. Currently, without some of the uber items that could be had.. (I have only Thurgadin quest sleeves as 'uber' loot, though I have the silk for Skyshrine gloves <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), my mana pool is suplimented 40% by items alone. Add those gloves of mine (and the nice +int they have to them) and viola, probably closer to 50% of my mana pool is gear only. For me to solo, it takes most everything I have at level 55 to deal enough damage, and without my items, and upgrading them to get better bonuses and resists out of them, I cannot deal out as much damage. You think we're not gear dependant? We're just not gear dependant for directly dealing damage. We are gear dependant for maintaining damage output, for having enough damage in us to take down bigger and better things.<br>
<br>
Who're you kidding, though, about summoning your pet to help you fight to a corpse? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  You have to have reagents, and while it's probably wise to have reagents in the bank... you have to be at the bank when you die to get reagents, and cash, to be able to cast your pet, to fight down to wherever. The last time I tried to fight to a corpse (in Chardok), a druid had to go buy me malachite. Turned out, we didn't have to anyways, but you see the point. We can't fight our way to our corpse without stopping at a bank for reagents. We also have little to no AC when unequipped, whereas a melee probably tends to have a great deal. Without AC to keep us safe, at least casters can deal out damage as well as before. Just.. not as long.<br>
<br>
Anyways, reading on further, I notice that you talk about fixing other things in the game as well. I don't really think any of us want to start pointing fingers at other classes and going 'We need to fix this in their class so we're balanced'. Since VI designed things like the Sleeper, Velk, and many of the dragons off of what a Warrior could do and take, to have them redesign warriors or the like.. would require them to redesign the end encounters. Besides, it's VI's vision to scale up, not down. Note how no melee class got downgraded with class balancing. That's what needs to be done for the Mage class.<br>

Here is another point I think we should make note of as its very important: we have NO defensive capabilities or spells, and very limited support capabilties/spells, with the normal give and take we should recieve more dmg output in return for low defense.<br>
<br>
I would suggest taking posts from other casters boards, as I'm sure they have posts just like this, tacking them on, and sending them to verant! While its important to discuss our issues among ourselves we must try and include verant as much as possible and make them aware of just how unhappy we are!<br>
<br>
One last thing on the epic: Foci are based on %s, therefore the pet would not become weaker compared to other pets. Post epic pets would be very highend, 99% of mages would never see them, but that 1% that would, imo deserve it. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: most of the discussion on the epic quest has been the most selfish BS I have ever heard. So it was hard for you. Show some maturity and be happy for someone else that its easier for them.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uskimmins.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Skimmins</A> at: 1/13/02 1:53:27 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/02 3:36:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=14>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif height=40 width=40></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: what i think needs to be done to fix mages...discuss.</span><hr size=1> To borrow from DAoC:<br>
<br>
All intelligence casters (in all three realms) are required to hold a focusing stave in order to operate at peak efficiency. Casting without this stave makes your spells cast with less efficiency, ie higher mana cost for less effect. Doesn't matter as much in the game as you are only naked by choice, but I do believe focuses should (AS THEY WERE FREAKING PROMISED) be adapted into EQ. <br>
<br>
Noonie is definitely on the right track. Verant <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> has to stop</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> balancing casters as a medium, with melee's having superior/inferior gear. A casters gear should directly equate to their ability to perform. Without that, there is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> no real difference</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> between a Magician who is in cloth, and a magician who is in north ToV gear.

All around it sounds good but don't hold your breath.  VI might increase drops on things but that is it.<br>
After helping a friend of mine today transfer a new weapon he bought to his Pally I was pissed off.  MAde me want to switch main to a Shadowknight.  A 44/45 2hp weapon with many nice +stats and Boil Blood proc is f'ing overpowering.  Only good thing about the weapon is lvl 55+ only can use it.  Still pissed me off...there is an even better dmg/dly weapon in PoG I've heard. <br>
With the types of high end weapons that have come out with Velious an now Luclin melee can now outdamage same lvl casters, I don't doubt it.  Just get a haste buff from a belt you have and go to town.  We MIGHT be able to kill faster but there is that whole aggro issue.  I nuke twice in a row and I'll probably get smacked around.

this system is weak and biased against casters. <br>

its a necessary step if casters ever want to become equal with melees. you cannot have that level of scalability, without becomming gear dependant.<br>
<br>
you are going to have to take the good (scalability, great damage output), with the minor bad (slightly more difficult crs).<br>

I don't mind scalability upwards, and in some situations, without Foci I'm not doing my proper damage. HOWEVER, I've played my magician to the 55th level with the restrictions and godawful prices we have to pay for some spells. You want to add to that, godawful prices for gear as well. I'm sorry, I don't think many mages are going to go for that JUST to do any sort of damage period. If you think this is going to go well for Wizards or similar (unless you wanted this foci idea mage only.. which wouldn't fly well totally anyway), I doubt that they're going to like it much either.<br>
<br>
Don't you think with the ammount of nerfing that's been done to the Magician class, amungst the meager fixing that's been done, and nerfing to other caster classes (Necros, specifically), I think we're all a little tired of being nerfed, made into nothing more than paperweights, if that. You kind of missed my point that already, casters are gear dependant, just not for direct damage. We don't need weapons, we don't need armor class, necessarily. We need added resistances, we need items to increase our mana pool. We need foci to improve our damage, but why must we take total dependance for any damage what so ever? Just because we have to take some bad with some good? Don't you think the bad we have already (pathing, slow spells baseline, poor damage baseline, poor resists vs higher level mobs, poor pet performance vs higher level mobs) is enough? What else bad do warriors have to deal with if they don't have Uber weapon X? Umm.. just.. damage, right? They still get decent AC without gear, way higher than ours. They.. can't aborb as much damage? Well, yes, I suppose, but even still, HP and AC buffs do quite a bit.<br>
<br>
I'm probably just talking out my rear on what a warrior's deficiency is, but right now, it seems as though they're not very deficiant, and while they need their gear to do any sort of damage (and need to keep upgrading their gear), they don't also incur added costs of spells (sometimes, upwards of 10k if you're really unlucky) and even just finding the stupid spells (Burnout 4, Muzzle of Mardu, Pouch of Quellious, amungst others) is a pain in the rear. As it is right now, finding decent weaponry for Magicians sucks horribly. I know we don't melee much, but for as rare as the Burnt Wood Staff is, and from where it drops, it aught to have something better than Cinder bolt on it, and it aught to be at least a decent 2hb weapon. Some added stats wouldn't be bad. That's just based on the rarity of it.<br>
<br>
Here are some other ideas that might be worthwhile to investigate to make Mages gear dependant:<br>
<br>
-Rare weaponry/items with Lure-based spells on them. Slow casting, but hey, we can at least do damage to lure or highly resistant mobs.<br>
<br>
-Make Pet Foci that we can actually achieve through quests, somewhat ardiously, perhaps, but at least we can achieve them without having to reach the stupid 7th island in Sky. I'd like to see how many mages actually are able to get their Post-50 Foci, and have used them instead of aquired them for the epic only, or ignored getting them (a la Air staff)<br>
<br>
-Make Pet Foci that add special abilities (secondary slot only, can only grant pet a single special ability). Perhaps random (yet not often) flurry attacks, perhaps the ability to rampage, perhaps improve their own skills (reposte, bash, kick), perhaps no special abilities but improve their damage cap a bit.<br>
<br>
-Make channels that we can use/wear. A medallion that we can funnel magic through to boost damage output, gloves that improve casting time.<br>
<br>
I don't think anyone minds needing specialized equipment, BUT crippling us to the point of a level 1 character if we're equipmentless and without a focus to cast spells.. I.. just do not like that what so ever. I figure at higher levels, fighting nastier creatures, we'll become dependant enough on these foci/weapons that without them, we probably wouldn't be asked along. <br>
<br>
And frankly, I could care less what DAoC does about the matter, whomever mentioned it. Everquest isn't DAoC, and I'd rather it not become DAoC. If I want that game, I'll go play it. <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>
