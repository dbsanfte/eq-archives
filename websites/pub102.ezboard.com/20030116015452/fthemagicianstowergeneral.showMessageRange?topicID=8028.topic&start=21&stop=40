i said, monks are <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>pretending</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> mage pets are overpowered to make themselves feel better about their recent nerf. if mage pets did tank better than monks i would admit it was overpowered. the thing is they dont. <br>
<br>
whereas, my points on dire charm were relevant at the time. dire charmed pets were outdamaging some of the best offensive classes. dire charm is in pop now much more balanced, but at the time it was not. <br>

Care to test that?<br>
<br>
I've been told by a cleric /ooc'ing for damage that they had a magician pet tanking and that it was easier for him to keep the pet alive.  I didn't ask for details.  I'm sure some of that is the result of no healing aggro on pets, but I'm equally sure that some of that is the result of a pet with virtue basically matching my hp and tanking &quot;like a warrior&quot; as in hp dropping at a steady and predictable rate.<br>
<br>
I'll be glad to sacrifice myself a few times in a test of Who Dies First.  I'm decently equipped and level 65 with lots of AA, and I'm definitely not sure of the outcome.  That, in itself, is a problem, as I already know which one of us does more damage.  I should be equally sure that I'll still be standing with half my hp left when the magician pet dies.<br>
<br>
As to a couple comments above, any ranger or rogue <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>that is as well equipped as I am</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> *will* tank better than me.  I've seen it.  I see it often.  A rogue tanking better than me is more than a little bit insulting.  Again, I should be sure that I'll still be standing with half my hp left when the rogue dies.  Either that or I need some serious damage improvements to match or exceed rogues, because if I tank worse than rogues *and* I do damage worse than rogues, what's the point of being a monk?<br>

<br>
Well the water pet tanks as well as the mage tanks, wich means its a wet paper bag. A monk at half life with res effects and who is slowed can out tank it. However Here is the kicker, The &quot;tank&quot; model most monks are using is the Air pet, AND the Hit points the monks are giving our pets is from the 65 earth pet.<br>
<br>
Baisicly most monks are comparing themselves to a weird combination of the air+Water+Earth pet, The simple fact is mage pets are now extreamly specilized in what they can do. And the pet you &quot;think&quot; we use really does not exist, Sorry I wish we had a magma ellemental or a steam ellemental but we dont.<br>
<br>
A pet that tanks a good as you will <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> not </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Out damage you, It will not even reach 30% of a well equiped monks DPS.<br>
<br>
Please dont give the air pet the water pets DPS, And dont give the earth pet the Air pets damage midigation, They simply are not as &quot;oober&quot; as you guys are making them out to be.<br>

Strange last I checked, you were out trolling on the monk boards trying your best to show that charm is 'disgustingly overpowered' in your own words.

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
besides charming, what can casters do which is so overpowered? <br>
<br>
oh and only 1 caster class can really charm. 3 have very situational charm spells. i agree that charm is disgustingly overpowered, but that asside i fail to see how casters are so overpowered, or so much more powerful than a monk anyway. esspecially a pre-nerf monk. care to elaborate on your wide swing of the nerf bad?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

oh and you would be surprised what &quot;mature players&quot; will say and do. the enchanter community hates me, because im not afraid to say how overpowered i think charm is. they honestly believe that 400+ dps from a charmed pet is balanced. heck im a mage, and i will GET to do that charming soon, and i still admit its overpowered. some people are just greedy, eh what can i say.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

You troll on other boards looking to spread your crusade against enchanters that has been going on for almost 2 years now, and once your trolling backfires against you in the form of 'mage pets are pretty powerful too' you run back to the safe haven of mage's tower and complain that monks are looking to get mages nerfed.

actually, what i was doing was correcting the monks. they were swinging their fists at all caster kind, when it was only enchanters and more specifically charm which was the tool which allowed that ridiculously overpowered action to occour. <br>
<br>
i was simply telling them enchanters are the only class who can do that.<br>
<br>
so, its not that the monks didnt think charm was overpowered, thats what the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>whole monk started topic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> was about. they just assumed that all casters were as overpowered. <br>

lol, why do i even bother even responding to you enchanters. <br>
<br>
1) the new L65 mage charm has been reported to do upwards of 400 dps in bot, lasts for about 10 minutes, and is relatively easy to reapply. you cant dismiss what ive been saying as simple class greed, trying to &quot;get the poor enchanters nerfed&quot; anymore.<br>
<br>
2) again, like i said originally, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>monks are making up lies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about mage pets so they can then pretend theyre overpowered. that i have a problem with. again, like i said originally, if mage pets WERE overpowered and tanking signifigantly better than monks, i would AKNOWLEDGE it. <br>
<br>
whereas, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>no one is making up lies</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> about charm. enchanters are literally soloing hoh, with pets that do over 300 dps. if you cant see the glarinly obvious balance problem in that, i dont know what else to say to you. you are impervious to reason.<br>

Why would you take a monk over any other class (except for where FD pulling is utterly vital)?<br>
Other class can either do MUCH more damage, and tank nearly as well.<br>
Nearly and much damage and can tank better or a LOT better.<br>
Not to mention all the utility (something which monks don't really have).<br>
Not very good for monks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Few (if any) monks seriously want pets to be nerfed.<br>
But quite a lot feel that after the mitigation nerf, and with the DPS increase many classes get post-PooP, that monks could use a small (10-15%) base damage increase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Pets are where they should be.<br>

Only in Kael Drakkal, Noonie.  For the record, could you say Dire Charm is over powered in Kael?  Probably.  Hoss, the leading guild on Druzzil Ro, defeated Vindi with *gasp* 6 people about 3 months ago.  Wanna guess how they did it and who/what tanked?  You guessed it, a Dire Charmed pet!  However, that does not diminish the fact that it's entirely situational.  Kael just happens to have high HP, hard hitting, low level mobs that fit the Dire Charm &quot;magic trick&quot; perfectly.  It's not like they can go to any other zone and do the same.<br>

And if that charm breaks when they're not paying attention, that is one dead enchanter.  I've toyed around with Necro undead charms myself also.  They usually make awesome pets....until they turn on you and kick your ass.  =P<br>

To be honest, I'm not really sure why they nerfed the monks.

The warrior is well equipped and has been MA against numerous decent mobs (eg. Rumble, Vindi).<br>

Our pets are tanking just fine. The 61 air pet out tanks the majority of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>average</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> monks. Also remember that duels are not a clear picture. In duels pets only do 66% of there damage. So if the pet got the warrior to 8% health think what he would have done if he could have used the other 34% of the damage he normally uses against mobs. <br>
<br>
The air pet tanks better then most monks and does about 25 more dps then paladins using windblade. I don't think that is overpowering but denying that they can do that doesn't help our cause. Mages are just fine it is monks that are broken. The epic pet could tank better and out damage the majority of non-uber melee before the nerf lol. I mean people seem to have forgotten how good this pet was and still is. Also I used the water pet to tank Radir in UP so no it isn't a wet paper bag. When I was farming for Fungi the other day the water pet was able to solo shrooms with only 15% health loss, and would regen that health back in 20 to 30 secs. It isn't a weak tank at all just that everything tanks bad in PoP. People should use these pets outside of PoP. Go to UP and then compare how your pet tanks vs. a melee of equal level. You might be surprised just how good our pets are now.<br>

In part this goes back to the mod rod nerf and also the flavour of their new expansion. <br>
<br>
This is why you are seeing such insane things ( like Enchanters soloing Woushi ) . As long as the mob you fight with your charmed pet can be slowed, you will have this type of situation.<br>
<br>
This really has sod all to do with the Monk/Mage pet situation. When people start to feel inadiquate, it is not always because of other people's power - personally I see this as a design flaw starting with Verant. It still amazes me that they did not think something as big as this out. 400 dps for PoP charmable mobs is very realistic for more than 1 class. <br>

I can tell you that I disagree with ALOT of what Noonie says.  But, I recall those threads too, and that was a LONG time ago.  Heck, I think that may be the time when I just retired my enchanter (over a year ago, at the LEAST).  <br>
<br>
The problem, which some of us have warned about, is that some mages are throwing numbers on this board, which are literally begging to get the Mage class nerfed.  100 dps, etc, etc pets, and 200 dps etc, etc sustained dps.  And if anyone questions it, they get yelled at, and told to leave the boards.

youre talking about something which happened like over a year ago, for awhile i did take the enchanter up as a main. ive long retired my enchanter as a casual alt after many mage issues were addressed.<br>

they are casual, loose numbers. one thing is for sure its not under 200 dps at all, or at least ive never heard of any pop charmed pet besides the dc ones doing under multiple hundreds of dps. as far as im concerned, once youre talking about 200+ who cares if its higher, know what im saying? anything after that point and it just gets to be cartoonish.<br>

i dont care if people can solo, i dont think people who solo should make better exp than a group, but thats neither here nor there. i dont think they should be soloing in tier 3 planes. tier 1, tier 2, ok. tier 3? come on...<br>

im not on a &quot;nerf crusade&quot;, if i was on a crusade i would be proactive, writing letters, ect. im just sharing my opinon regarding this issue, and my opinon is it greatly comprimises balance and general game integrity for enchanters to be doing hundreds of dps for a nominal risk like that, in virtually every single pop zone.<br>
<br>
even enchanters themselves will admit the &quot;hefty tag&quot; is exadurated. a novice enchanter could put a minor slow on the mob to somewhat limit its dps, making it easy to manage, while still outdamaging the best equip rogue in this game. in fact the enchanter who soloed wuoshi wasnt even in a raiding guild i believe.<br>
<br>
whats the difference though. its TABOO to admit when another class is overpowered. it doesnt matter how overpowered, its just not fashionable to mention it. whatever.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=immlazen>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 168<br> <font color=#333333>(12/3/02 8:24:23 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Holy monk boards!

READ THIS MONKS:  When they took away TRods/COTH....where were you?  Where were you when Magicians didnt have their Nukes upgraded?  How about anything other then EPIC pets getting there butts kicked.<br>

Magicians have gone through so many NERFS because of misinformation that it is funny.  How about playing a Magicians and understanding what you are talking about.<br>
<br>

<br>
MONKS:  Did you realize that Beastlords and Necros pets do about as much damage as the Magicians pets?  Furthermore, Beastlords can slow.  Necros can fear/kite/etc.  <br>
<br>
So why is it that you only see the Magician pet as a threat?  Is it because Magicians depend on there pets more then Necros.  And our pets dont lasts 8 seconds without a main tank in POP,,,even with slow.<br>
<br>
3rd<br>
<br>
Magicians are pure damage.  With our pets we are a pure offensive force.  The &quot;KEY&quot; word is Nukes plus Pets.  <br>
<br>
Magicians are not soloing in POP.  You have a few classes soloing mobs.  So where are we overpowered. And you come to a Mage board and try to justify getting Mages nerfed.  Quit acting like a bunch of kids.  Grow up.  <br>
<br>
Hmm,,,wait a minute how about Charm/Manaburn/Lifeburn....etc.  Shamans/Enchanters soloing dragons?  I dont know about you,,,but Magicians should be last on your hit list,,,especially as hard as we have been hit with the nerf stick.<br>
<br>
Also, even with what every class can do, I never ask for any to be nerfed.  I do ask for the best pet in the game (which is argueable now) and a decent nuke.  But trust me, a monk is more prefered then a Mage.....especially on a raid.<br>
