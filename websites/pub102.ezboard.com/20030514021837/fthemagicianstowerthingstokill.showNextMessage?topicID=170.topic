Lets see..... best solo..... I know I've had some interesting ones, can't think of many right now. <br>
<br>
I took Slexin (however you spell that skeleton's name in BW) at 51. Had just dinged, not a single scrap of blue. Was a rough fight. Ended with pet dead, and me medding for the last killing nuke while he was still rooted from the dead pet. Barely got out of that one, but a fun fight. Dirt off the first kill too, fun.<br>
<br>
Another fun one was when I camped the blacksmith room in Eastern Wastes alone. Annoyed full groups outside to no end, who wanted to take the camp from this single Mage. The elites were mean. The hardest fight was when 2 elites popped back to back. Was a profitable camp though, the Dark Ember dropped after 5 hours &lt;groan&gt;.<br>
<br>
Best fight with a partner? Me (52) and a chanter (51) friend went to the Hole, took out a 52nd level Rock Golem, and his Elemental Crusader at the same time. Now that was some good exp.<br>
<br>
Me, the chanter, and a druid took out the Sarhdwurm Matriarch in GD by ourselves. Tons and tons of hp, and can complete heal. Unstunable I think too. Nasty fight. Too bad the loot was for tanks, and no-drop.<br>

Liar. Guy hit for about 140ish, average plane mob, had no pathing...but he had MASSIVE regen. Every second I wasn't on him he gained back 1/4 his life. I had to chain cast pets like a mad man, if I didn't get a pet on right when I needed it on, he would've gained life back. <br>

I tend to die more often than not when soloing really tough stuff, being a frail mage and all.  I far prefer a partner, group, or raid.<br>
<br>
I guess the toughest solo success though would be the fierce impaler guy in KK.  He was up, I had a tough time with his PH's and didn't realize he was a different MOB.  So I pulled him like normal, and he beat me and my pets to multiple pulps.  Fortunately the zone line is there, but I beat him in the end.  I think I was lvl 49 at the time.  He also dropped the rare harpoon, which again I had no idea it was his rare drop.<br>

<br>
ALL of the specs at cave to PoF portal at once. I was going in to kill Cyndreela and knew i would have to deal with some specs on the way in.. I was 51 so I made my handy 51 earth pet. Peeked in through the fake wall and saw 2 specs.. I was like oh goody! Only 2. Got a little closer, still only 2, so i sent me pet in and proceeded to chain cast one of them down so we could get the 2nd quick. 2nd came right at me and I backed to the side through another fake wall i was unaware of and 2 more jumped me. So now there are 3 full life specs, one almost dead. 1st spec dies, and i proceed to /back off retarget to try and get my pet to get all of them taunted and rooted.. when i back into 2 more. God I felt lucky! Another dies after franticly casting him to death, i am now out in Feerrot constantly backing pet off to get him to retarget, and i am moving backwards, casting every once in a while.. finally they spent long enough taunted on my pet that i could safely chain cast on the one he was fighting. And before you know it, 6 specs dead, pet almost full health unbelievably, and me almost dead. Not sure if i even got exp, but at that point i was glad i didn't lose any. It turns out Cyndreela was camped!!!!! LOL<br>

I ahve had a few other beatdowns, but this one happened last night. We were in ToFS, trying to get key to 3rd floor(ok so its not solo). But, we kept pulling ghosts in large numbers, and i would lay waste to them with scintilation, usually took 2 trys to kill all of them. Well We kept pulling larger and larger bunches, till we decided to pull the whole left half. Well, that wasnt a good idea. Our pally pulled them all, and once they all were beating on himi cast, somewhere in the realm of 12 were in range and huge battle spam pursued sending me into a a lag shock, but it was short, i cast a second time and the spell got off right before i died, and i got a nice overhead veiw of the flammes surrounding me and killing all the ghosts. <br>
<br>
Apparently after the first cast all 12 or so cast some poison based DD, Got multiple lines of &quot;you skin burns as poison seeps through&quot;. All my other resist excpet poison where close to or over 100, so probably could have resisted the other spells they usually cast. Well i died right quick, but i calcualted i di about 16000+ damage for 722 mana. Not bad. I think it was worth it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukalamos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kalamos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#333333>(3/19/01 10:42:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=181.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Post your toughest solo smackdown Mages :)</span><hr size=1> I tried to solo Cazel in Oasis at lvl 50 one day when I was passing through.

  I wasn't crazy enough to set this as my plan for the day...  I was on a Fire Giant raid , unfortuneatly no Enchanters had come.  The leader of the raid a wizard no less sends me a private tell.  His instructions were for me to NOT assist and instead SOLO the 2nd giant that was guarding the the entrance to the Giant Rooms!<br>
  This sounded highly irregular as a tactic but his logic was that I did not have to win, meretly keep the giant focused on myself and as many earth pets as I could throw at it until the other 17 players on the raid had defeated the first giant !<br>
  Well it worked !  So well in fact, that it became our strategy all the way to the last pair of giants near Nagefen's Lair.  As a side note it has become a running gag in my circle of acquaintances, even more so now that I have the epic.  <br>

The enchanter started &quot;running like a noob&quot;  (quoted that fyi) and zoned.  I Had been trying to run around and target the guy due to lag and her running around.  Finally she zoned out and here he comes at me.  I started chain casting the 54 water pet with mastery staff and then DS it as soon as its out.  I sat to med between casts as I started at half mana and was afraid to nuke and let pet die.  So this guy ate 5 level 54 focused water pets.  I am finally down to 20 mana when hes at about 30% HP and decide to hit him with nukes.  Nuked him down and pet survived with 5% HP left and I have no mana left at all.

The pet was a greater voceration air with 2 stun whips, burnout and damage shield. This was before the nerf to pet weapon proc rate. I pulled with the 1K lava bolt and nuked hard for the next 20 seconds...almost every time he turned to smack me down the pet would get off a stun on his back.<br>

Dread Widow and Gullerbacks at 51 were also fun fights.<br>

I think most fun though are the 3 LDCs and some bats fights at 51.

<br>
Now, with epic pet, I've managed to solo mobs in hate (one of my goals when i was lvl 50 dreaming of level 60). My best solo ever I think was all the way to Djarns room in sol B to camp it. Using banishment and epic pet, I got lucky on lava guardians being up and was able to get to the room solo, once there, holding it posed no problem after taking the time to split it. Never got a djarn in 3 hours though, dont know how i would have faired against him.<br>
