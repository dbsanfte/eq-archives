(Some mines, some harbor.. I don't remember the names, but about 5 different zones.)<br>
<br>
Everything was green except a few light blues.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Observations and concerns:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>1 -</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
The mobs have a TON of hit points and hit like pansies.<br>
<br>
This is possibly an indirect nerf to charming, since it won't be worth it really to turn these mobs against each other as the fights would take too long.<br>
<br>
After killing a bazillion mobs, I've noticed ZERO worthy drops. Not even anything useful to a level 35-50 player.<br>
<br>
Since I didn't get exp, I can only HOPE that for a level apropriate group, the exp is staggering and awesome here, because the loot is aweful.<br>
<br>
It takes so long to kill these, that I can't see it being worth Xp grinding here for anyone. I forsee this expansion being a ghost town in a month if they don't do something about that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>2 -</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Pet aggro.<br>
<br>
I was roaming through with my level 65 Necromancer. I'd send my pet at a mob and the mob would completely ignore my pet and run at me while my pet beats on it HARD.<br>
<br>
I would usually feign it off, but often even when I stood up, the mob would turn on me again.<br>
<br>
In 65 Levels I've NEVER had a mob ignore my pet when I hadn't cast on it yet and I wasn't in melee range. (Except death touchers.)<br>
<br>
I decided to NOT feign once, and just kinda kited in circles checking to see what would happen with my Mage if I was there. (Granted, he's got Epic and if ANY beast in the game can get aggro it's him.)<br>
<br>
I kited around for a LONG time and it took a considerable time before it would turn on my pet, and I had to be very careful what I did or it would turn back on me.<br>
<br>
The Melee range was also HUGE on these and I had to get against the far wall quite often in the Mines of Torgiran to avoid being considered in &quot;Melee range&quot;<br>
<br>
Sit aggro was also monsterous as well.<br>
<br>
Very tough zones for something that's supposed to be for levels 35-60.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and observations?<br>

Least in the mid level zones. This place is a lot like jaggedpine in terms of difficulty, so take that whole 35-60 thing with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of adds. a LOT of adds here if yer not careful. Place looks like KC on a bad day if yer standing in the wrong spot.<br>
<br>
Now... as for loot... you are incorrect. Loot in this place rocks much. Made 3k in two days there farming light blue stuff. Most mobs drop like 6pp per kill, have FS imitation weapons, and randomly drop mid to high level gems. In addition to that in durlak I've seen mobs drop high level research components. And green stuff is dropping a lot of very neat loot at random.<br>
<br>
The entire expansion is a lot like a lesser version of seb. Thing is tho, the charms and named spawns can be kind of rare, but they're worth it once ya get em.<br>
<br>
Soloed a named for a greenish crystal thinggy, forget the name offhand. 4 wis 4 int 9 hp 9 mana 9 vsm currently. Stats based off how many specializations you have maxed. Currently have 4 out of 5 and working up spec conjure.<br>
<br>
Also got a 30/35 4 wis monk/bst 2hb second night into the release off a green mob. Not great, but definitely not too damn shabby.<br>
<br>
Trust me tho. The loot is there. Just takes some time to find it. Beats the hell out of HGs at least.<br>

Naw, their hp's aren't that high, their regen is GODDLY.<br>
<br>
Noticed this with my monk there day 1.  Get a mob down to 20% health, FD it off and it's full health in 5-10 ticks (I swear most were gaining 20% health every tick, some were only gaining 10%).  I was noticing it was taking me 2-3 ticks to take 20% of their health off, and when the RNG would string horribly, they would gain health every couple ticks, so I fd'ed to see their regen.<br>
<br>
Their hp's are a little lower than most mobs their lvl, they are just regening 200-240 hp/tick (based on my dps averaging out to 40, and some ticks they were gaining hp's on me), rough guesstimate though.  Of course while not agro'ed their regen was in the 300-400hp/tick range.<br>

That said, LoY is a return to the Old School style of EQ - remember Kunark, Velious, and Luclin, where mobs had a helluva hps but hit relatively low? This is an extension of that.<br>
<br>
This is not an extension of PoP.  The title PoP implies one thing: mobs that hit obscenely hard but give obscene exp.  This is, IMO, one of _the_ biggest mistakes with the way PoP was designed in that it overpowered charm, made soloing extremely inefficient for any class who depends on fighting a monster blow-to-blow (all melees except rangers + shamans and mages), and made exping so easy that practically everyone's 65 in a couple of weeks and were AAxp farming.  <br>
<br>
Now, fast exp I don't mind, but fast exp while trivializing all other content?  That's the mistake PoP made - it became POINTLESS to exp anywhere BUT a PoP zone, because PoP exp was so obscenely fast.  This meant that any and every zone SoE made before POP is going to go down the toilet in the # of players / zone.  At the time, that was bad enough, but there is one more disadvantage that you don't consider when an expansion is first released:<br>
<br>
The fact that unless SOE makes ALL their future expansions like PoP in terms of exp-gain, PoP is going to be the exp expansion of choice for years to come.  In other words, every expansion post-PoP must have PoP's exp modifier or become ghost towns and underused.<br>
<br>
This fact has come back to bite SoE in the ass.  Right now, people are still in LoY in troves because they're searching for charms and possible good drops, but once these farm-fests end, LoY is going to become a ghost town just like Cazic Thule, Sebilils, and Chardok are nowadays.  Those zones used to be hot - _the_ exp zones of choice where the risk was high but the rewards were higher.  Now they're empty.  Why? Because you can exp in PoP instead, where the risk is really not fainting because of boredom (let's face it, how hard is it to fight golems in PoValor? Yet that's one of the best exp spots in the game) and the rewards are many times that of other zones in terms of exp.<br>
<br>
It's not LOY's fault, really, that people will come to neglect it.  LoY is a very balanced expansion - the mobs aren't particularly hard (I don't know what problems you were having, personally, but 170-200 hitting mobs with 10-15k hps is about right for the levels/loots these guys drop.  Look at CT - the mobs there hit for 220-400, but their levels are similar to those of LoY mobs.)  and there are good loots to be found in every zone - plus each zone is pretty interesting in its own respect and can all be considered fun dungeon crawls.  <br>
<br>
If there's any expansion to blame in the days to come, it should be PoP.<br>

Shamans can still solo, quite efficiently.

<br>
The problem is that they overdid it - the exp for hard hitting blues for my sk at 52 is almost non-existant. I grouped with a 53 sk, and together we killed 41 blue con mobs - all max hitting for 115 or more in the castle throne area in Gulf of Gunthak, and the total reg exp I gained (aa exp set to 0%) was one blue bubble.  And while the money loot / basic weapon 'fs' etc is not bad, its not worth the trouble, as the majority are casters - the augurs and mystics nuke for up to 500, and were landing malisement on my 56 mage with 117 mr with ease. The graphics are definitely great, and its nice to explore new content, but I certainly see these zones as being empty graveyards within a couple weeks - the only people in there will be the ones still trying to do the spell quests. <br>
<br>
The doubled bank space and possibility of an item in the charm slot (free stats!), armor dyes, drogmors etc were worth the 20 bucks to me I guess. I still have yet to see a charm though :P <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=scrawlstarsummoner>ScrawlStarsummoner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(2/28/03 2:46:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8927.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ...</span><hr size=1> Agreed on the aggro issue.

Saw a mosquito up on the beach (green) and decided that I would clear the area so that I could sit and regen HP safely.

The worst for me though is they F'd up my graphics!  My mip-mapping does not work so everything (even old zones) looks crappy.  The spell particles do not seem to work right, I turn my levels to low, opacity to 5% and when I cast BO3 there are sooo many particles I can barely see the pet!<br>

<br>
What is the net effect of high regeneration mobs?<br>
<br>
First, it lowers the value of slow.  Making the fight longer means more time to regeneration.<br>
<br>
Second, it exaggerates the difference between mediocre and high damage dealers.   You essentially subtract the regeneration rate from the group DPS, which means low DPS essentially stands still.  At the same time, high hitpoints also reduces the relative value of damage dealing itself.  It negates group power.<br>
<br>
Third, it makes soloing less valuable, and larger high DPS groups more valuable.  You need to deal enough damage to counter the regeneration <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> kill the mob in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
<br>
If balanced correctly, it would work in the favor of high DPS melees, since the fights are longer and sustained DPS becomes more important.  However, I doubt it, simply because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Verant</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> appears to rarely correctly foresee the consequences of their choices.  Caster DPS is so much higher than melee DPS nowadays that I doubt the fights will last long enough for the sustainability of melee damage to win through.<br>
<br>
While it would encourage full groups, only the most effective damage dealers will be welcome beyond the core of the group.  Mediocre classes would be even more marginalized.<br>

Hmm... I was hunting down by the docks in Dulak (I think it was Dulak), and the greenies there (to lvl 65) dropped like flies.  I could keep about 15-17 MOBs clear in the 20 minute repop.  (Was killing a quest MOB to get an uncommon drop, took me 8 pops.)<br>
<br>
When they hit me (which was rarely) it was in the 40-120 range, but they seem to hit slowly and miss a lot.<br>
<br>
Not sure if this is common to all the zones, but I didn't see anything of what you mention.  Low HP, easy aggro control, and minimal regen. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=51722>Muse Liesa Lovely</a><BR>

Terrible way to test.  A lot of mobs regen *super* fast if they aren't aggro.  As a monk (that lives through wipes) I've seen this often where a mob will be full health from 10% in 2 or 3 ticks.  If they were really regenning like that they'd be impossible to kill.<br>
