<br>
I am writing this now as a summary of a few of my main points, the basic errors made when creating EQ, or in running it these past 4 years.<br>
<br>
I won't suggest that I haven't enjoyed EQ or that I don't think for the most part it has been very well designed, but for future products of this type if for no other reason, I present my top XX list of things that were or are mistakes.<br>
<br>
1) The con system, unfortunately for VI they choose way back when not to have a con system that was equivalent for PC's and NPC's, in other words a level 1 mob != level 1 PC, and a level 50 mob != level 50 PC for relative power. <br>
<br>
This has had many effects that continue to trouble the basic design of the game, the single most significant of these is the relational scaled power of certain types of spells. Charms/Mezs/Roots etc... any spell which renders a mob incapable of acting directly or reduces there effectiveness by a set amount(ex. slow) scales exponentially with character level, which is why in expansions like various and luclin you saw the role of enchanter vs. main target mob reduced for powerful targets.<br>
<br>
Now obviously this goes double for any spell, which turns the mobs considerable power against it, ie. charm, I won't bother going into graphs or direct numeric examinations of just how out of whack this has all become those numbers only ever become debating points.<br>
<br>
The effect that equal relative power would have had is simple, if a target mob is level 60 and a pc is level 60, then a spell which directly eliminates the ability of a mob of equal level to act is understandable and certainly balanced with those taking and doing damage.<br>
<br>
This has also had the effect of making soloing vs. grouping vs. raiding a major balancing act, if a 60 PC warrior is approx equal to a 60 mob warrior(either would win 50% of the time solo with reasonably skilled people) then<br>
<br>
If a mob is meant to be a &quot;raid level target&quot; then simply raises its level, does it really matter if a target is red by 10 levels or red by 40? so long as everyone can effect it.<br>
<br>
This leads me directly into point number<br>
<br>
2) The level factor, direct level as a factor in the game mechanics is used WAY to much in EQ, direct level should have a small effect on most things, whether it is attack ability, save ability...<br>
<br>
For some strange reason the game designers decided early on that level would be some kind of overriding statistic meaning literally 10x as much as any other statistic.<br>
<br>
This has had the effect of separating people based upon level to such an extent that OFTEN the people with whom you most enjoy associating you are unable to because of level difference. Having literally a 6-10 level range that you can associate with for the majority of the game means. This has also marginalized the value of skill vs. level and gear. In EQ gear and level are king, in my best guess making up 90% of a characters overall value, what skill exists is primarily a function of how good your computer and connection are.<br>
<br>
The effect that reducing the value of level in most of the calculations in EQ would have is to in effect increase the value of gear and skill, something that would allow for more specialized characters threw equipment selection and the application of tactical methods. In addition if level value was reduced then the level spread could easily be justified to have been increased allowing players more grouping options.<br>
<br>
3) exp value determination system, part of the con system really, the problem here is that a level 50 mob solo can total certain level 60 people, while getting totaled by other people in turn, in addition to the fact that equipment plays such a HUGE role in determining what is difficult and what is not for any particular class or level.<br>
<br>
The solution is rather simple really, a relative con system in combination with a falling mob xp value. When you consider the nature of the theory behind &quot;xp&quot; both are perfectly reasonable, even obvious and logical (always an added bonus) The con system would probably be the easiest and could tie in nicely with a relative value system determined by system economics. <br>
<br>
In other words Base Level + relative value of equipment * class situation modifier(cleric soloing 5, cleric grouping 2 etc... which could of course become an easily determined sliding value based upon xp garnered by classes per time period average), the falling mob xp value is simple, the more times you kill a mob(type of mob) the lower that mobs xp value falls, this is in line with both the &quot;anti-camping&quot; policy and the theory that your not going to learn much from killed a goblin for the 10000th time as you did for your first 1000 (where do they keep coming from btw).<br>
<br>
This would have the effect of making the game more &quot;realistic&quot; within its own boundaries and philosophies of the genre, and creating a circumstance where the relative &quot;power&quot; of a character is much more accurately gauged in comparison to the mobs there fighting.<br>
<br>
4) Gear, while I realize that the mainstay of the issue involved here (here being in EQ) is the dated engine, and in all fairness this complaint can't truly be made before SoL, I will state it as a MAJOR issue in the game, there are a number of &quot;sub-problems&quot; here, the first being the general statistical nature of the value of gear. <br>
<br>
In general an upgrade to a piece of equipment will have upgraded ac/hp/mana/attributes/saves. And while for certain pieces of equipment this is fine, There are FAR to few items with &quot;unique and interesting&quot; effects. Even now in EQ there are very few to no items that are truly interesting, there are items that make people drool to be sure but nothing that creates a new dynamic, nothing that lets people truly break out of the base tactical molds.<br>
<br>
New and interesting items would create a sense of value that isn't based directly upon statistics, consider the focus items and there value next to a piece of loot, I personally removed a vulak earring to wear my focus earring, the statistics on the vulak earring were FAR superior to focus earring, but the earring had an effect that outweighed any ear slot item in the game and yet was both reasonable and balanced. Interesting items can be both balanced and invaluable, quite the benefit when your trying to keep a game from becoming stagnant.<br>
<br>
As another &quot;sub-issue&quot; related to gear, the sheer volume of it comes to mind, why is it that every MA of every major guild uses the same 2 weapons and the best weapons at that? would it really be that difficult to have even 10x as many unique items of relatively similar value? This really not that difficult, lets for example take a BF(blood frenzy), generally acknowledged to be the best SoL available taunt weapon (ignore for a moment that it comes off a mob that can be done with 20 people-and no I @#%$ you not), what would it hurt if one of them was a 16/21 weapon that gave 150hp, or had a slightly different effect... adding 100 more lines of hate etc...<br>
<br>
Named loot should be FAR less common then it is, at this point I don't think I know of a major warrior on my server that doesn't have BF (still the best taunt weapon available imho) and there all exactly the same. This could all be handled very easily by even the most basic of randomizing modifiers.<br>
<br>
Less loot would only increase the value of individual pieces of loot and in conjunction with loot that is at least to some extent randomized and more interesting with more unique abilities could create an environment where loot is more or less then the sum of its statistics, imagine an environment where loot was not so easy to rank...<br>
<br>
No-Drop/level requirements... etc... is another area of loot that I have some trouble with, philosophically I have a real problem with twinkling in an RPG, having said that, at this point I don't consider EQ to be an RPG it is a hierarchal strategy game which has a high minimum entry fee in time. I don't really in any sense have a problem with a high level person giving a item of some value to a low level person simply because in any kind of practical social situation that WOULD happen having said that twinking for the purposes of power leveling has always struck me as rather lame (not that I didn't do it once or twice or 9 times) So for no particular reason I would like to see the following done<br>
<br>
1 character per server per account (if you want to play another character then start on another server, its not that tough)<br>
<br>
Remove all no drop items from the game with the exception of perhaps some &quot;soul bound&quot; items that return to you every time you zone, or maybe do damage to someone else trying to use them, but this would be an item hook rather then punitive game mechanic.<br>
<br>
remove level required and recommended from items with the exception of perhaps some &quot;intelligent&quot; items that simply will not allow themselves to be used by &quot;lesser powers&quot; but this ONLY if named items are made FAR rarer.<br>
<br>
I think that would create a situation where twinking with significant items would only occur very rarely but no more rarely then would be practical or realistic in a social game.<br>
<br>
And the last thing I will talk about is the “realism” of loot, while receiving a sword from a relatively humanoid mob is fine by me, receiving one from a giant worm is well, silly. The simple solution to this is to involve the tradeskill people in this, what if and enchanter + blacksmith could combine there talents to make a bitching hat out of some body part, maybe make a half dozen of them… at least it wouldn’t seem quite so silly to be looking at someone holding a dagger that’s supposed to be some creatures spine and actually looks like a masterwork elven dagger.<br>
<br>
<br>
I had some other gear related ones but those are the major ones.<br>
<br>
5) spelldat being client side, this was quite possibly the biggest mistake VI made when originally creating EQ, a parse able file describing the effects of every spell in the game? and what’s worse every &quot;effect&quot; in the game? short and simple never ever ever do this again. being able to match up every aoe, every proc to its exact stats with a parser sucks.<br>
<br>
6) rooted/dting/summoning mobs, these are three of the lamest game effects that exist. <br>
<br>
I will start with rooted mobs, for some strange reason IV will just stand there regardless of how much one of our guilds enchanters pisses him off, I don't quite know why, I know that he sees him and is annoyed at him, but he just stands there. This might be a cool effect for ONE mob, having more then one mob rooted those is just plain silly. Off the top of my head, perhaps, a mob shackled to the floor with some chains, perhaps a mob confined to a room with some sort of magical barrier , perhaps some mob confined to his own tiny little dimension ok ok ok. But a mob that just stands there unmoving is idiotic on virtually every level that exists, it doesn’t even serve game mechanics in any real meaningful way.<br>
<br>
Dting mobs, I am sorry but this is just plane annoying, the actual game effect is moderate depending on how often a mob does this but all this does is increase zerg factor, there is no skill in getting or not getting DT’d, instant death maybe realistic under some circumstances it may suit the enviorment, but to the vast majority of players something that is inevitable despite skill gear levels or anything else is just plane annoying. It adds nothing to the game of value and takes away a great deal of fun, but that’s just my opinion.<br>
<br>
Summoning, what I would like to know is who thought this up? I mean seriously, what inbred jed thought it would be a good idea if mobs of no particular importance or relevance could just wave there hands and bring characters into melee range. While I understand this was to cover up any potential shoddy programming in its many forms wouldn’t it have been better to create 2 simple situations to cover this up? Ranged attacks and fleeing? If a mob can’t reach someone he starts using his ranged attack, if he doesn’t have one or if the pc is out of range the mob flees? maybe calling a friend with a ranged attack if there intelligent enough for that?<br>
<br>
I don’t know I understand the source of all three of these things but in practice and in game they are imo the worst combat design flaws I have ever seen in any game bar none (whether in EQ or any other game).<br>
<br>
7) The damage problem, due to the fact that there are far to few actual roles in EQ and far to many classes there is a large lump of classes whose “sole” purpose is damage (while no class actually doesn’t have any other skills these all claim to have none) These include Wizards(who have teleports skins blah blah), mages(who have focus items, mod rods blah blah), rogues (who have the only virtually full invis), beastlords (who have SLOW, and some excellent buffs), monks (who have FD and mend), necro’s (who have umm lots). All these classes veying for one roll(and theres more then that really) and whats worse is that there are classes that aren’t even as valuable as these in most circumstances because they don’t do a lot of damage. So the problem comes done to the fact that EQ comes down to A) absorbing damage and B) doing damage, the solution is rather simple, well really theres a few potential different solutions. You can either add a C) and a D) to EQ or you could balance the actual game but balancing classes ability to do the A) and B), that means taking into account just how much a 70% slow does vs. how much a cleric can heal and how much damage a rogue can do. Personally I would prefer a combination of both, I think that classes should be reletivly balanced in A) and B) while adding a C) and D) of whatever type can only add depth to what is largely a very shallow world.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  economics, its odd that a world that is to large for so many reasons can be to small for economics. Unfortunatly its true that virtually no normal economic rules work on a population of 1000 people (the approximate active in economics on each server). So how do you change this? Pretty simple again, make a mega bazaar where people from EVERY server can interact, if for no other reason then an arena fight between FOH and AL would just be to entertaining it would have the minor side effect of correcting about 75% of EQ’s current economic troubles. The problem with the formation of EQ’s economy is that it was designed and based upon a much larger scale economy then actually exisits.<br>
<br>
I understand that perhaps this would be “technically unfeasible” but I really honestly can’t think of any direct barriers considering all of EQ is done by “zone” farms not “per server” farms.<br>
<br>
one other things about the economics, make the npcs buy goods at a half assed reasonable price, after all goods leaving the game is only a good thing in a game where nothing wears out.<br>
<br>
Hmmm theres more but looks like I actually have some work to do for a bit  woot…<br>

<br>
One of the mian problem is that items don't wear out, so we have a trickle down effect running for 3 years on a lot of servers.  EQ2 is adding durability to items so they will eventually wear out and be taken out of the loop. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~arch/pics/eq/gillious.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Also, no zoning when you're outside. I wish they had DAoC's guild system as well as the Guild Emblem and a guild roster page complete with ways to tell when the last time a person was online. And the big thing I wish EQ had was: NO MOB PUSHING. That's right. Mobs don't move when you hit them. What a concept.<br>
<br>
EQ is a near 4 year old game and it shows. The new graphics don't do anything but decrease your framerate to the point where it's not even worth it. There is no Level of Detail algorithm that drops polys as your framerate drops, so places like the Bazaar where a lot of polys can be on the screen at once are lag fests where you get like 1 frame every 3-4 seconds, even with a good computer with plenty of memory and a top notch graphics card.<br>
<br>
That said, the gameplay value is what keeps me playing, and a lot of recent changes have made the gameplay a bit more than it used to be, so I'll continue playing for a while at least. Depends on when SWG is released /grin <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>

One idea I disagree with is making loot rarer.  I think that would just increase the already considerable gap between the haves (those in uber guilds) and the have-nots.<br>

One character per server - I think twinking is what really throws off the economy.<br>
<br>
Item decay - Give each item a HP value as well as some sort of &quot;Hardness&quot; or &quot;resilaiancy&quot; rating.  Overtime these items would lose &quot;Hitpoints&quot; until there are almost usless.  HP loss could be determined based on the resiliancy.<br>
<br>
The biggest problem with this has been the argument about working hard for an item that will eventually wear out.  I don't think it has to happen that way.  In RL things wear out - your two options is either replace or repair.  Can do same thing in game.  While in town find an armorer - spend some plat and get that BP fixed.<br>
<br>
High end magic items may be imune to wear, or wear very very slowly.<br>
<br>
Higher skilled tradesman could make items that last longer.<br>
<br>
<br>
Level Restrictions on item effects.   A sword is a sword is a sword.  A level 1 newbie shouldn't be able to use a sword as well as a a seasond vet and shouldn't be able to do as much damage with it.  The sword is not the killer - it's the user of the sword.  (Magic effects not withstanding.)  I'm not suggesting the sword can NOT be used - only it will not be as effective in the hands of a newbie.<br>
<br>
Magic items can be restricted based in Wis or Int scores.  Do you have the will to be able to control excalibur?  What about a cursed item?  You cannot drop that cursed sword until you increas your will somehow<br>
<br>
<br>
just some of my opinions<br>

1) The con system, unfortunately for VI they choose way back when not to have a con system that was equivalent for PC's and NPC's, in other words a level 1 mob != level 1 PC, and a level 50 mob != level 50 PC for relative power. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Yeah, I agree with this.  The level of a mob is not the same level as a player.  Instead of making a conning system based on the level of mobs, make it based on the difficulty.  If I have no chance of killing a level 60 mob when I'm level 60, don't make it con even, we obviously aren't equally skilled.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> In general an upgrade to a piece of equipment will have upgraded ac/hp/mana/attributes/saves. And while for certain pieces of equipment this is fine, There are FAR to few items with &quot;unique and interesting&quot; effects.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Completely agree.  Gear is probably one of the most disappointing aspects of EQ because Verant fails to realize how much potential some of this stuff could have.<br>
<br>
One of my favorite items are the Cleric gloves that can be turned into a hammer.  Wouldn't it be great if there were more of those items?  For example, a 12/20 staff that can be turned into a 5/18 sword with a 100dd proc.   <br>
<br>
Another thing is the useless right click effects on items.  Excluding melee, these items are almost always useless.  Why would I stand around for 30 seconds to cast Rune 4 when I can easily get the mana back medding to cast Rune 6 in that time?  I think the mod rod change could be used to make items like this more unique.<br>
<br>
Give right click items a recast time.  Instead of making an item that can be cast every 13 seconds to do 325dmg, make one that can be used every 10mins to instantly do 1000dmg.  Or give Clerics and item that can instantly cast a 1200 heal every hour.  This would make wearing certain items a lot more strategic.<br>
<br>
I also have to comment on stats.  It's my opinion that all stats should be useful in one way or another.  As it is, pure melee classes never benefit from INT/WIS.  Casters never benefit from STR/AGI/DEX.  Barely anyone benefits from CHA.  Stats should be useful for everyone so that you have to make choices in what you wear.  For the most part, it's pretty easy to decide what to wear.  Gee, do I want to wear this item with 10int or the one with 20int?<br>
<br>
To sum up, I just don't think Verant puts enough thought into making items.  As it is, barely any items have useful right click effects or %-effects which means that certain items will always be superior than others and there will rarely come a time when someone has to decide which item they'd rather wear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>pelldat being client side, this was quite possibly the biggest mistake VI made when originally creating EQ, a parse able file describing the effects of every spell in the game? and what’s worse every &quot;effect&quot; in the game? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, I partially agree with this.  I don't think people should have access to knowing what every mob casts.  However, I don't think Verant gave us a good enough system to determine what our spells do.  When I first started, and got enough money to buy my first spells, I had no idea what to buy.  For the most part, the names give absolutely no indication of what they do.<br>
<br>
Parsing spells is also good for knowing spell effects you can never determine.  Like how am I supposed to know that Protection of the Grove gives mana regen unless I sit there and time it.<br>
<br>
So, I agree that people shouldn't have access to it, but I also think Verant should've given better in-game referances to what certain spells do. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

<br>
The answer to both of these questions is that VI is always tuning the magic system (and I wouldn't be surprised if the mana pool has been changed without warning as well).<br>
<br>
Its a lot easier for VI to make changes to the SPDat, knowing full well many people will be aware of the changes before they ever hit the live servers. They've been prone to data entry mistakes with quests and NPC text throughout the history of the game.<br>
<br>
That being said, I think these are fine suggestions, and perhaps in EQII they will be able to design a few NPC's that are able to recite the SPDat info (serverside), so any changes they make would be updated automatically. From an RP perspective, there should be 'wise old sages' in game that can discuss the effects of these spells in detail.<br>
<br>
No Drop items make zero sense and the flag should be removed. There really isn't anything else to say on this. <br>
<br>
I also think they should put a min level of 45 on the Fungi Tunic, and sit back and listen to the screams..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
As for limiting the # of peeps on a server, twinking, etc. I think they will do what they did with EQI, they'll get a feel for their playerbase and make adjustments to keep people around as long as possible. (EDIT: Remember when Kunark came out? All of the weapons had been redone, and only the ones in Kunard were really Iksar usable.)<br>
<br>
Right now, it would be very awkward for a brand new player to take up the game due to the tremendous imbalance in the economy. Odds are, new players will have high level friends, and will want to have a fast path to the top to meet up with them. Anti Twinking / Buffing rules would make it difficult to draw new people in. Especially with the absence of newbies in newbie zones. <br>
<br>
VI/SOE will do whatever it can do to try to keep the game accessible for new players, while trying not to alienate the high end players. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
1. The Con system.-- amen. <br>
Monsters should be assigned a 'threat' value determined when the monster is created by the design team, and should con appropriatly to the PC.<br>
<br>
2. The Level Factor.-- again, I totally agree.  <br>
I don't think that at any time in any way level should be a factor.  Trying to hit mob x with 1000AC and a 1hb skill of 15 should be just as hard at level 60 as it is at level 1.  The skills are limited by level, they should just use that and ignore level.  Same goes with casting, the casting skill/offense should act against the resist in the same fashion as Weapon skill/Offense and AC.<br>
<br>
3. The XP system.-- I personally like the idea of a Threat rating on an NPC rather than level determining the reward for defeating it.<br>
Lets say we have 2 mobs, both level 5 with 150hps, hits for 21 max, with an AC of say 100.  The first is an Orc centurion, the second the Orc Apprentice.  Currently, both will grant 50 xp when killed since they are level 5, but that's not really fair, because the apprentice will sit there and chaincast Blindness on you all frigging day until it's killed.  In a system with a threat rating, the Apprentice would be worth more xp despite it's level, because spellcasting would raise the difficulty of the encounter, unless it was balanced by some other factor, like low hp, less attk or damage, etc.  If the AI is going to be so stupid as to have casters beating on PC's with (with warrior like ac/hp/damage) and casting spells once in a while as well, then they need to be worth more, or drop more loot, or some other balancing factor.<br>
<br>
4. The Gear issue.-- Here is where we part way somewhat.<br>
The problem with gear and it's distribution is the same problem with 90% of the game's design: Lack of Imagination.  Personally, I would like to see tradeskills see a much larger role in gear than we currently do, combined with item decay.<br>
<br>
Problem 1-- With item decay, we quickly run into the problem of naked people walking around, because even orc pawns are kind of stingy with their cloth armor, much less anything actually substancial dropping.  Solution--standard gear is extremely common, like something on EVERY mob.  If it looks like it's wearing leather armor, then by god you should be able to loot it, if you can stand the smell of an orc pawn's skivvy's, of course.  This creates a problem of it's own--if you consider newbies dressed in leather or even basic chain a problem, but even that is easily addressed.<br>
<br>
Quality vs. Quantity<br>
Make the everymob common armor very poor in stats--after all, orcs don't look to be very patient, skilled, or all that maintenence minded either. In fact, respectable merchants won't touch the stuff--so you can't sell it for an easy fortune.  However, with a bit of skill, you could perhaps salvage the leather from the armor, and with several pieces make a better piece of your own armor from it.  Of course, killing animals and getting their pelts would be cleaner and easier, but they would have to first survive an extra tradeskill check to be made appropriate for use in armor--with the various qualities determining exactly how good the armor can be made, for instance, only very high quality leather could be used in the creation of the legendary elven cloaks that conceal the wearer from their enemies (+% to Hide and modifies racial ability to do so).  So a newbie takes a wolf hide, and has his choice of attempting to cure it into low quality leather, or high quality leather, and the quality of the armor made from it would be likewise modified.  The salvaged orc leather would only be of the lowest quality--and thus nearly useless, reflecting it's common status.<br>
<br>
As we go higher in level, the same principals can be applied.  If the monster involved is roughly humanoid, you could probably wear it's chain, or even plate armors, but not without some refitting.  Orcs are bigger than elves, smaller than barbarians, etc.  For that chain to be useful, your going to have to use an armor skill to see if it can be salvaged, and even so, taken as is be very poor.  Some races might actually have very high quality armor available, but have any of you seen a Shissar?  Care to try and wear his pants?  In these cases, the loot serves as raw materials for making of the items, rather than as direct loot.   This is very important because of Item decay.<br>
<br>
Decay, Ordinary stuff, and the exceptional.<br>
Without decay, the above seems like monty haul, and the world will soon be awash in player created armors salvaged from the various creatures of norrath.  With decay, your going to be needing more of whatever to replace or repair what your wearing.  With cloth and leather, this is an easy, trivial matter. <br>
<br>
However, we must speak of the decay and repair of more expensive items.  You could, with all of your salvaging, simply sell your salvaged goods, and pay an armorer (NPC or PC) to fix it.  This is fine, especially for common items.  If your a skilled tradesman, you could take your raw matierials, and fix it yourself--also fine, and greatly depends on your level of skill vs the quality of the item.  Joe Sebelis might know how to maintain an ordinary suit of plate armor, but it takes a fine craftsman indeed to repair the exceptional armors developed by the various races, and near godlike skill to maintain the powerfull enchantments imbued into ancient armors who's secrets of manufacture have been lost for ages, like those found in the dank dungeons of ancient creatures that should have died long ago.   Some items might require very skilled PC repairman, as no NPC's are going to have the skill required, or if they do, the cost is likely to be outrageous.<br>
<br>
The Point.<br>
What's the point of all this?  I'd personally like to see elves wearing elven chain.  High leveled/Rich elves would wear high quality chain, low leveled/unskilled elves would wear what they can get.  Same goes with all the races.  I'd like to have to make a choice, salvaging the magic cloth of Venril Sathir's robe to maintain and repair the known enchantments of my own people, or else suffering the maintenence of the ancient and powerful enchantments that are no longer fully understood, or perhaps were never understood.  Perhaps some items would be special in that they do not need this maintenence, but that would be a rare and wonderful power of it's own.  Currently, few wear cultural armors as most are matched or exceeded easily by dropped items.  Also, while I may not be able to kill Venril, or Vindi, or Emp...  I might aspire to salvage enough high quality enchanted materials from his underlings to make good items for myself given time---Thus the casual player isn't shut out, he's just got to go down a different path.<br>
<br>
5. The Spelldat file being client side.--  I'm half and half with you on this.<br>
No, we should not know exactly what every mob in the game can do to us--unless we directly experiance it, and perhaps not even then.  However, If I'm a Wizard, I should know <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Exactly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> what the spell I'm casting does, if it's in my book, I had to learn it.  This should have been handled in game however, Damage, duration, range, special effects, etc... should all be listed when I rightclick the spell for a description.  I'd be terrified IRL if the pilot of my airplane just worked the knobs of the aircraft controls without knowing what they did.  I'd be astounded if the carpenters that built my house had no clue other than the name of the item what a hammer was for.  Now, if the spell came from an item, like a right click, then yes, perhaps that spell--as it cannot be permanantly learned-- would have it's details being a bit foggy.<br>
<br>
6. Lame effects.-- I agree to a point.<br>
To me, the only lame effects are the ones that make absolutly no sense.  Summoning- unless the mob is a caster, or drops an item with Right click Call of the Hero, it should not summon without a very good reason.  Perhaps summoning is a special ability of the funny race of moon men, or dragons developed it eons ago, etc...   But ever other Giant, Toad, Wurm, High levelmob x should not be able to summon you.   <br>
I agree with Death Touch on the grounds of gameplay.  Now that is truely lame, to just kill someone.  It should, at the very least, get a resist.  Unless it's used sparingly-- IE mob x will deathtouch x times every 4 minutes--meaning you have 4 min to kill the mob or half your force is gone, in 8 min, your likely wiped... its just stupid.<br>
Rooted mobs make no sense, unless there is story to back it.  Perhaps the mob has been commanded to guard this spot, and won't move from it regardless of the consequenses...  But to root it just to prevent a certain pulling technique is stupid.  It's another indication of the lack of imagination at VI.<br>
<br>
7.  Economy.  It is what it is.  Making it serverwide would not be better, nor neccesarily worse, just different.  Most people will still generally charge the maximum amount they can get for any given item.  Item quality and risk/reward  will still be out of balance from Original/Kunark/Vellious/Luclin/PoP because VI has no imagination, and is unwilling to give us a way to improve old items (with very few and unreasonably high cost exceptions). <p><br>
