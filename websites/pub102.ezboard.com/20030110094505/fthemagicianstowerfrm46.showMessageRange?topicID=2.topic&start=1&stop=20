But what happens if 5-6 of the zones are nothing BUT summoned creatures in PoP?  I think this is HIGHLY likely not only because we have the planes of fire, earth, water, and air, but because not only do we get all kinds of new anti-summoned stuff, so do a lot of other classes.<br>
<br>
Look at the ranger weapon self buffs... bonus damage against summoned, plus they now get more of the druid anti-summoned line. <br>
<br>
We get mez summoned, charm summoned, and aa skills dealing with summoned.  Despite all the ranting, they aren't STUPID.  They not only want you to spend time playing out all your skills in PoP, they want you to want to go back and get more Luclin ones.  And this is how they are making you want them, by making them more useful.<br>
<br>
I for one trust the people who are under NDA who can't say anything more than &quot;throw out your preconceptions&quot;, &quot;you won't believe how much they've listened to us&quot;, and &quot;this is gonna be great!&quot;<br>

AA 'stacking' requirements will prevent someone like myself from working up to 65 and then getting the planar abilities right away, so it looks like they've done a good job maintaining the difference between someone who's been a 60 for a couple years, and someone just getting within range now...... <p>Naladini <BR>

Assuming it is referring to the pet, Elemental translocation sounds like the ability to zone with pet.<br>

<br>
For example, summon your best pet, give it armor, weapon, buff it, etc. etc., then suspend it.  Summon up another pet and use that for the day, or to solo a really really big creature.  When your now second pet is about to expire, pet get lost, recall your suspended pet, and hopefully be able to finish that creature off.<br>
<br>
If that's true, pet chaining will get a ton easier.<br>
<br>
Plus now I could use a pet with armor and weapons, where as I typically don't, because I use my elementals as disposible tanks when I solo.  When it gets too low, I disperse and summon a new one, so it's not really efficient to summon armor and weapons for each individual elemental.<br>
<br>
With suspend, if I get low on mana, suspend my current pet, chain a few monsters together to get mana back and bring the old Jibober back.<br>
<br>
Also I tend to cannabolize pets after I get resurrected to get mana back.  With this, I could start cannabolizing pets before I even get resurrected.<br>
<br>
We won't be defenseless running through zones anymore.  At the start of an evening, summon a pet, suspended it, then run from A to B.  When that annoying greenie jumps you, recall your pet and let it deal with said annoying spawn.<br>
<br>
These are just off the top of my head, and who knows if any of these work, I'm not on the beta.  But I am getting excited by the prospects, and potential uses of these. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ulordgojirax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LordGojirax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 137<br> <font color=#333333>(9/24/02 5:11:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm46.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojhead.jpg width=98 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Suspend ...</span><hr size=1> Jobaber says: &quot;Taunting attacker master&quot;<br>
