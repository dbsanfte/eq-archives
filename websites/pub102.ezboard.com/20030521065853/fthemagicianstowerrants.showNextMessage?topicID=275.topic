Here's my theory to why there will be one more expansion after PoP, bear with me.<br>
<br>
Pre Kunark: Ice Comet is a research only spell (soon after a quest was added to make it easier to obtain) with rare components and high failure on combine and Mage spell Lava Bolt reigned supreme. Mages were the most powerful nukers in the game. The wizards were outraged and Rend was introduced and Ice Comet was made easier to obtain. Mages were slightly second best nukers.<br>
<br>
Kunark: Mages were given extremely minor updates in nukes and Wizards and Druids were upgraded significantly. The best mage nukes was a 1024 dmg bolt which made it situational at the increasingly larger raids. Druids were the new second best nukers with nukes equal to our best bolts, wizards were clearly supreme.<br>
<br>
Velious: Wizards receive their most efficient nuke, Ice Spear of Solist further establishing them as best nukers. Druids receive potg and self mana regen spells along with wizards (manaskin) etc further widening the gap in nuking power. Mages receive the 2 most horrific ideas of spell lines in Vellious, Dots (Wrath of elements etc) and pet illusions (MS3). Note, both these spell lines have been abandoned by Verant in PoP. Mages hit rock bottom!<br>
<br>
Luclin: Elderick's Electrical Rendering and Garrioson's coupled with class abilities to improve DD spells (which we dont get) take wizard dmg to the obscene range. Druids receive Moonfire. Mages receive Shock of Fiery Blades a smaller nuke than even our bolt. Druids clearly recieve a better nuke and we dont have a new bolt which is equal to the best druid nuke as before. The nuking gap is further widened. Mod Rod 2 revitalizes the role of a mage on raids. It is impossible to consider some raids feasible without it. Pets dont eat as much riposte, pet dmg is increased, the 6 level limit is reduced allowing pet procs to land. Mages may have lost all the nuking power since EQ opened but with pets being upgraded they are on track again, although situationally, as pets will always remain situational. Even this small throw of bone is enough to elate the naive magicians.<br>
<br>
PoP: Enchanters and Clerics are given superlative nukes in Insanity and Destroy Undead (both 4:1 ratios) and even the cleric general purpose nuke Condemnation is only comparable to the mage best nuke. Druids/Wizards arent even in the picture. Mages once again plunge in nuking and hence total power. The new pets are relatively lame as 60 warriors on test post how the new pets beat them when they were unbuffed and not hasted and fought dual weilding against a mage pet , burnout hasted, muzzled and damage shielded, and the pets are nerfed before they are released.<br>
<br>
New Expansion after PoP: Necros and Shamans, the last remaining caster classes who cant nuke better than mages, are given better nukes and finally mages are relegated to the bottom of the nuking power and the EQ experience is complete ! <p><img src="http://www.wraithguild.com/shots/qotd/sig.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uh0gfather.showPublicProfile?language=EN>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 533<br> <font color=#333333>(9/22/02 9:06:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/photo.gif width=90 height=112></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So sad it's funny..... are you surprised ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The new pets are relatively lame as 60 warriors on test post how the new pets beat them when they were unbuffed and not hasted and fought dual weilding against a mage pet , burnout hasted, muzzled and damage shielded, and the pets are nerfed before they are released.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Umm is this conjecture or has this happened?<br>

I'm skeptical because this was the case with the epic before the upgrades and they made it <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> stronger</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. <p><p><center><img src="http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/hog.gif">

If you'd READ the post on eq.castersrealm.com you'd notice that THE SPELLS ARE STILL BEING TWEAKED!<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Also note that the spells are in Test stage and many of them are still being tuned with the actual numbers so don't panic just yet if you think something is the same as a Level 34 spell, it's probably still in development.&quot;<br>
<br>
And since when did mages HAVE to be the best or 2nd best nuker in the game? Our epic pet is godly, we can summon nearly-full sets of armor, mod rods, debuff resists, have the best DSes in the game, can summon HASTE ITEMS, can summon 10slot 100% bags, have a 5hp/per tick regen *Along with mod rod makes it pretty nice*, can summon focus items (Which, mind you, no other class can do.), we can also summon our epic(So if we die, whoopdiddy doo! We can just resummon our epic and get our corpse back, assuming its not a big raid, and just solo work.), and the list goes on and on..... We were never meant to be the masters of SPELL damage, we were meant to summon things (OH! I almost forgot, CoH is a godly spell and NEEDED on some raids, are druids needed on raids? You can do without them... Wizards? Same.... Mage? They can do without us, but are missing out on haste items for those who don't have one, an awesome pet, mod rods, CoH, ect.) <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=389687">My Magelo</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umurghkhor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>murghkhor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 53<br> <font color=#333333>(9/22/02 9:09:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=329.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: So sad it's funny..... are you surprised ?</span><hr size=1> hehe it's definitely conjecture.

1) it has nice damage but it doesn't give THAT big a RvR advantage on above situations so it can be left out <br>

Our guild consists of around roughly 50% Euro and 50% US players. Now you know that some of them have to work, sleep have a RL etc etc.<br>
<br>
What does this mean?<br>
<br>
Well, it means that some people will be late for raid XXX. Without CoH those people could NOT enjoy Ssra, Vex Thal or any other raids. If you did not understand what the spell CoH really means for our class and YOUR guild you missed something very important in your mages career, heh <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=0000CC, strength=4)"><center><a style="font-family:Verdana; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none; font-size:14pt" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3300>Sage Cyricus Bloodbane</a></center></div>

ignored for most mages I think. For myself I list the following<br>
reasons.<br>
Pets were useless or dangerous in raids for a long time. <br>
 <br>
Our epic did not appreicably boost a guilds power .<br>
 <br>
Our nuking power got less and less whether do to resists or<br>
no new nukes at all.<br>
 <br>
Our pets were gimped by the haste cap which they said did<br>
not exist for long a time.<br>
<br>
Our most important spell from Kunark was COH which stayed<br>
true until the advent of Trods. COH could be done by a botted<br>
mage.<br>
<br>
Until just recently our 60 pet was only marginally less powerful<br>
than our epic pet.<br>
<br>
Until focus items and trods our summoned stuff was mostly<br>
junk. And still is imo<br>
<br>
Our adv arch skills were craptastical.<br>
<br>
Trods  were the boon and bane of the mage class. They gave us a defined raid roll. They are also so good that one mage<br>
can provide mana for all current ingame encounters. They<br>
did not open up high end raiding slots in the way other class<br>
skills did.<br>
<br>
Our damage skill was broken and then 'fixed' and it only took<br>
10+ months. It also sucks after being 'fixed'<br>
<br>
Mages have voiced their concerns about the direction of the<br>
class since the middle of ROK. Thru SOV and then SOL and<br>
we have seen some improvements. Improvements we were told were not 'possible' by VI. This is the new crop of raid mages that are voicing the same things as raid mages of a year ago. Either way POP will have to have some spectacular<br>
incentives to play a mage. To recompense for years of being<br>
lied to and or ignored for me to play again. <br>

These spells are quite valuable under the right circumstances, and if you read the forums more thoroughly, or experimented with the spells themselves, you might realize this.<br>
<br>
Here is one example.  I am sitting at the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Nexus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, waiting for the elevator down to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Dreadlands</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> so I can farm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Mature Chromadracs</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for AA and smithing components.  I am the recipient of a random act of clarity, indeed <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> KEI</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
Now <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> chromadracs</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dispell, and I do not want them to dispell my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> KEI</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Therefore, I would like them to stay in one spot rooted, beat on my pet, and die, thank you.  By chaining the two dots and healing my pet, the enemy stays rooted and I effectively never get aggro.  Since the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> chromadrac</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> never attacks me, it never dispells my buffs.<br>
<br>
This is just one example where the dots come into play.  Read the board, actually look around at the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerspells">Magician Spell Forum</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, and you might learn something.  Just because <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>you</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> have not figured out how to use a spell well, does not mean the spell sucks.<br>
<br>
Likewise, prior to pet upgrades, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Monster Summoning 3</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> was a viable pet.  If you can't figure out what to do with a pet with the hitpoints and melee of an earth elemental, and the damage shield of a fire elemental, then I just don't know what to say to you.  Perhaps if you made a habit of reading the <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pet Forum</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> with an open mind, you would have known this already.<br>
<br>
Sadly, the MS line was not upgraded when the GV pets were, and it is a loss.<br>
<br>
As for nukes, well it is clear to me that all support classes must also be <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>adequate</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> damage dealers in order to be welcome on raids beyond the numbers required for support.  That is, surplus support yields diminishing returns, while additional damage stacks.  With the recently massive upgrades to our pets, they are a much more reliable and significant source of damage, and thus, nukes are less critical to mages than they once were.  It is therefore not surprising to find our relative advantage in nukes decline.<br>
<br>
For me, it comes down to the pets.  If they rock, we rock.  If they suck, we suck.<br>

dude, if you meant you get low agro associate on the dot so it won't attack you... <br>
just wait like few seconds before you nuke with char... or whatever nuke you have... <br>

or if you meant that dot won't dispell the root of earth pet... <br>
... you know the initial DD componenet of that dot have a chance of breaking root right? <br>

Also, the idea behind a DoT is that it's more mana efficient but takes way longer to work it's dmg as compared to a nuke. <br>

our dot is just not that more efficient compare to our nuke ... may be like 2% more dmg/mana ratio ... <br>

and pet that ds itself.. let's see... so everytime u get that pet you have wasted may be 10 times trying ... <br>
<br>
chaining a normal pet would be more reliably and again... for soloing <br>
chain &gt; all <br>
i think that's agreed upon... <br>

<br>
... it's just like saying<br>
with the new nukes upgrade to chanter, their haste buff are less critical at raids due to they can do damage themselves at raids now. <br>
<br>
No it's not. same with mages... <br>
<br>
also, pet upgrade was needed 3 expansions ago .... but they didn't give it to us for years....... <br>
<br>
we were gimped for a long while before then .... <br>

<br>
  For Chroma's try this. <br>
<br>
  Pull with Malosini.<br>
<br>
  Sick pet, than manastorm them, and back up as soon as it it is done casting. I did this a ton while in Skyfire for our clerics, and not once did it leave pet to chase after me.<br>
<br>
  When the 3rd wave was done, I moved to max range and rained again, or a Shock of Steel, as mob wasn't leaving pet by that time.<br>
<br>
Try it and see.<br>
