<br>
a few quotes..<br>
<br>
&quot;This information was created from many message boards, uber guilds, general EQ history, and hints from NPCs through the PoP storyline. <br>
<br>
After killing Rallos Zek, and you talk to the gnome in PoK, she talks about how Meldrath the Marvelous talked about making a machine that would tear into time. Furthermore, it requires all of the Elements to power it. She also says it's possible to &quot;go back before the time where Zebuxoruk was imprisoned&quot; <br>
<br>
Zebuxoruk, was imprisoned by ALL of the Gods. Why? It's hard to say, but probably because he spread teachings that Gods are more Mortal than Norrath realizes, thus creating anarchy. The Gods banished Zebuxoruk to the Plane of Time. <br>
<br>
The entrance to Plane of Time is presumably in a small, false wall in Innovation, where 4 towering Clocks are in a room. When clicked on, they say, &quot;The gears try to turn, but they lack power&quot;. <br>
<br>
So, you need a power source. There is speculation that you create an Unfired Medium Container. Then use Multi-Elemental Glaze, which is the combined glaze from all of the 4th Tier Glazes. You then glaze the container and fire it. This creates a container suitable of holding all of the Elements at once. <br>
<br>
You then need to combine in this container... the Elements. This is presumably dropped off of the 4th Tier Gods. The Rathe, Xegony, Fennin Ro, and Coirnav. Combine the Elements in the container, you have a power source which can power Meldrath's machine. <br>
<br>
It's also very likely that the Plane of Time was built for a single encounter. That is the Zebuxoruk/Kerafyrm encounter. As you know, Kerafyrm was released by the Ancients. Kerafyrm, too was forsaken for being 'too powerful', and could destroy Veeshan herself. After killing a Boss Mob in Coirnav, they say that your tampering with the Elemental Planes will be the End of Norrath, saying that when Zebuxoruk is freed, he'll team up with Kerafyrm, and destroy Norrath. Veeshan will interfere, but she will die. <br>
<br>
So, after we kill the 4th Tier Gods, get the power source for Time, we step 'back in time' to where all the Gods of Norrath are imprisoning Zebuxoruk. <br>
<br>
Apparently, you and your raid force want to free Zebuxoruk. So, you kill every God in Norrath... from Cazic Thule up to all of the PoP Gods in the Plane of Time... since the Gods are killed, Zebuxoruk is no longer imprisoned, and presumably summons Kerafyrm to destroy Norrath. <br>
<br>
Veeshan interferes and tries to stop Kerafyrm and Zebuxoruk from destroying the world. So... it is up to your raid party to fight WITH Veeshan against these two. How is it possible? Maybe this was a specially-designed raid that does not abide by the normal NPC vs. NPC game, where if Veeshan by chance killed the Sleeper, it actually would leave a corpse or something. But in any case, it's up to your guild to decide the outcome. <br>
<br>
So, your goal is to destroy Zebuxoruk and Kerafyrm with Veeshan's help. Should you be good enough, congratulations! You just saved the entire world. Who knows what the reward is? I've heard anything from the opening of another 5th Tier zone, to having your picture posted in-game in the Halls of Honor under the title &quot;Saviours of Norrath&quot;. <br>
<br>
Again, this is not 100% accurate. It's speculation BASED on what NPCs have said, the History of Norrath, and things we've seen happen in the Game in the past. To me, it sounds very likely. <br>
<br>
You may flame me when you're ready. <br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
&quot;If what my research has told me turns out to be true, or at the very least, accurate enough, it should answer many questions. <br>
<br>
For those of you that like to know the story behind the game mechanics, it will also enlighten you. <br>
<br>
Around the same time PoP was launched, Sleeper's Tomb underwent a revamp, and the story included the Sleeper being set free by the Ancients. <br>
<br>
Well, it would make sense why he would be set free in this time frame. It also answers the question of how the Sleeper can be killed. For those of us that haven't been living under a rock, it's been a dying question on the Sleeper and his death. <br>
<br>
It's already been demonstrated that we do not have the power to kill him, this is true. <br>
<br>
But Veeshan does. But she needs our help. Having the Wurmqueen on your side when fighting the Sleeper should add a GREAT advantage on your side, and make the fight more fair. <br>
<br>
It also answers the question of why Zebuxoruk would be the God of this Plane. <br>
<br>
If you read your PoP manual, you'll see that all the deities despise him. He has no allies. If all the deities of Norrath can put aside their differences to despise Zebuxoruk, including those who we normally wouldn't associate with hating (Erollisi Marr), then we can see that Zebuxoruk poses a signifigant threat to the wheel of Order and Discord. Since Zebuxoruk has been stated to indeed be Mortal, then we can see that the Gods would choose the Plane of Time to be a suitable prison for him, since they obviously can't risk killing him (or maybe he's too powerful to be killed by the Gods, thus they imprison him instead). <br>
<br>
Since Zebuxoruk is imprisoned by the Gods, you can probably guess he has a grudge against them. He may not be evil, he may not be good. But he is a threat. <br>
<br>
The question I'm begging is... &quot;Why would we WANT to release Zebuxoruk and risk the chance of losing?&quot; other than phat lewtz... I guess when you're that High Enough in level, and that good... <br>
<br>
I guess the only thing you can do is try to defeat the most powerful things with a big risk to the rest of Norrath. <br>
<br>
Rest assured, whoever succeeds in the Plane of Time encounter will be rewarded with something very very big. <br>
<br>
But what if they lose? If you consider what happened to Velious when Kerafyrm was released (mass slaughter in several Velious zones)... it's scary to think.<br>
&quot;<br>
<br>
interesting eh?<br>

<br>
I'm very impressed by the storyline of PoP I've heard about so far, even if its only a few pieces of the puzzle. Hope to find out more about it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Its quite sure that part of this story involves freeing Zebuxoruk, but for what reason? From what is known about Zebuxoruk he stands for neutrality, and the elders in the PoT speak about &quot;reaching balance&quot;. I suppose the reason why Zebuxoruk has to be freed is to help reach balance between good and evil deities.<br>
<br>
The rest of the story posted above is too speculative IMHO, I highly doubt the Sleeper has to do anything with the PoP story...but we'll see <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
