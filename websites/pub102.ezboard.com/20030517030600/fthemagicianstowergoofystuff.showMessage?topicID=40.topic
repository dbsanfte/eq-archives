class balance debate is the high number of posts in the message boards<br>
complaining that wizards don't get pets. I can only assume that these posts are<br>
written by failed lowbie wizards who have neglected to undertake the research<br>
necessary to master the full power of their class. <br>
<br>
Each of the many prosperous wizards I have met in EQ has been well aware that<br>
the wizard class indeed has pets, that wizard pets are in many ways far more<br>
potent weapons than any other pets in the game, and wield those pets to merciless<br>
advantage in the dungeons and wildernesses of Norrath. In order to balance this<br>
excess of power, Verant has wisely attached a number of difficulties to the use of<br>
wizard pets -- They are more difficult and expensive to summon, more difficult to<br>
control, and they take a much bigger portion of party experience than any other<br>
pet type. Further, the control interface is atrociously bugged, with some commands<br>
completely broken, and others giving unpredictable (sometimes catastrophic)<br>
results. <br>
<br>
The worst difficulty with wizard pets, and the reason why I'm writing this, is that<br>
they are very much an undocumented feature. You can't simply pad into your<br>
guildhall and find all the secrets of summoning neatly packaged on a scroll and<br>
proffered for sale at the cost of a few gold coins. You have to find it all out for<br>
yourself. Indeed, as the many misinformed posts in the forums show, even the very<br>
existance of wizard pets is something you are expected to deduce on your own<br>
while adventuring. <br>
<br>
On principle, I cannot approve of &quot;spoilers.&quot; Neither, I presume, can the community<br>
of veteran wizards who have earned their pets the hard way, hence the veil of<br>
secrecy about the matter. On the other hand, dissatisfaction among the uninformed<br>
has risen to such a pitch that I feel the time is come to publish a brief primer and<br>
guide on the subject. <br>
<br>
***SPOILER FOLLOWS*** <br>
<br>
PART 1 -- How to Summon Your Pet There is no need to obtain or scribe a spell<br>
scroll for this. All wizards are able to cast the summoning as an intrinsic class<br>
ability. To do this, first enter the zone in which you intend to hunt, then enter the<br>
following command: <br>
<br>
/shout Group seeks lvl [your level] tank <br>
<br>
Expect many fizzles. In fact, this spell fizzles so often that the fizzle message has<br>
been disabled to spare you the spam, so on failure you just get stony silence. On<br>
the bright side, it costs you niether mana nor items to cast (...initially, that is.<br>
You'll pay through the nose in terms of mana and items as your pet goes into<br>
action.) Don't be discouraged. Keep casting and soon your tank will appear. <br>
<br>
PART 2 -- What is a &quot;Tank?&quot; <br>
Just as enchanters get animations and magicians get elementals, wizards get<br>
&quot;tanks.&quot; While I would have thought, before reading all this &quot;Give us pets!&quot;<br>
nonsense, that the sight of a wizard plunging nose-first into peril with his faithful<br>
tank in tow was one of the more common sights in Norrath, it is, I suppose,<br>
understandable that one could overlook them. Let us take stock of the tank, then,<br>
and compare it to the other caster pets. <br>
<br>
Tanks are most like mage pets in both apperance and behavior, though they are<br>
substantially inferior in combat power. They can be easily distinguished from each<br>
other in that tanks have heads, although this is purely there for decoration. Like<br>
mage pets, tanks may be given weapons to use, but should not be given anything<br>
that you expect to get back. Fortunately, unlike mage pets, tanks generally come<br>
equipped with weapons on summoning, hence the prudent wizard doesn't give them<br>
Jack Diddly. Finally, just like mage pets, most tanks have some kind of minor<br>
magical attack, along with an unrestrainable tendancy to use it exactly when you<br>
don't want them to. <br>
<br>
PART 3 -- Getting a Good Tank <br>
In contrast to the common practice of other pet-wielding classes, the high failure<br>
rate of the summoning means that wizards cannot expect to summon and destroy<br>
thier tanks until they get an &quot;even pet.&quot; The &quot;/tank get lost&quot; command is bugged<br>
anyway, leading to unpredictable results. If you simply must destroy your tank, it is<br>
far more efficient to send it out on a pull, invis everyone in the party while it is<br>
gone, then hit the &quot;disband&quot; key as soon as it makes contact. It should return to a<br>
point near the camp and, if invis holds, it will mill around a little until it finally<br>
succumbs to the pulled MOB's. At this point you may attempt to cast a summoning<br>
for another tank. (N.B. It is widely rumored among higher level wizards that<br>
repeated use of this method results in a higher fizzle rate for the summoning.) <br>
<br>
PART 4 -- Fighting with a Tank in the Party <br>
Tanks, like enchanter pets, are largely automated, with one important difference:<br>
Tanks are highly active and aggro on almost everything. This has its good and bad<br>
aspects. On the one hand, tanks can be set to auto-pull MOB's and dice them up<br>
at camp, netting you exp while you med, eat, watch TV, fondle the girlfriend, etc.;<br>
on the other hand, they have a variety of obnoxious personal habits, such as binge<br>
drinking, sexually harassing the party's druid, and pulling trios of fire giants while<br>
you're at 10% mana. You have to take the good with the bad -- just remember to<br>
always have gate memmed. <br>
<br>
The typical &quot;tank pull&quot; goes something like this: <br>
<br>
The tank is buffed and told to pull. <br>
The tank signals readiness to pull by chugging ale until he weaves and commenting<br>
on the druid's breasts. <br>
The tank departs and the druid bitterly starts listening to Ani DiFranco tunes while<br>
she meds. <br>
The tank returns suddenly with about four dangerous and upset MOB's on his tail. <br>
The tank says &quot;Incoming!&quot; <br>
With the exception of the druid, who is still jamming with Ani, the group leaps into<br>
coordinated action, focusing their attacks on the group's bard. <br>
The bard's instrument is vigorously lodged in his rectum so that the party can<br>
target the enemy. <br>
Acquiring your target by assisting the puller, you light off your most potent nuke. <br>
Your target rushes you, and you summon the tank to your aid saying &quot;ON ME!&quot; <br>
The cleric pulls the remaining 3 MOB's off the tank by healing him. <br>
The enchanter highlights the MOB attacking you by casting mesmerize on it. <br>
The tank, guided by the blue flash, rushes to attack the mezzed MOB. <br>
With mez broken, the MOB continues to pound you while the tank attempts to<br>
taunt it off you. <br>
Taunt succeeds a few seconds after you die. <br>
The cleric, forgotten in all the excitement, is killed by the other 3 MOB's. <br>
With the cleric dead, the tank panics and trains his MOB to zone; meanwhile, the 3<br>
other MOB's pounce on the medding/grooving druid. <br>
The druid prepares to evac while the enchanter prepares to mesmerize the MOBs<br>
off her. <br>
The bard extracts his instrument from his nethers and strikes up a tune, taunting all<br>
the MOBs off the druid. <br>
The enchanter mesmerizes the bard. <br>
The bard dies and the druid evacs to safety with the enchanter. <br>
Of course, it doesn't always go this well, but this is the general idea. <br>
