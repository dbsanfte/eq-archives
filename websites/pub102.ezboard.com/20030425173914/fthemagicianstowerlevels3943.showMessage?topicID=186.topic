But it's dangerous and you need a lot of room.  I learned this method in NK... I would think that RM would be too cramped.  SoW is way better than jboots, btw, and at least initially, you'll want to have sow cast on you.<br>
<br>
Make sure you have pet taunt off.  If you can, have a druid cast sow on your pet as well.  If not, use expedience.<br>
<br>
Take your best bolt, face away from the giant at max range, and cast.  Immediately, cast again.  By the time that the first bolt arrives your second one should be done casting.  Start running, and send your pet in.<br>
<br>
Now, the tricky part is to be able to use the 3rd person camera view to see when the HG turns on your pet.  Stop, immediately cast your bolt again, and a second one if he doesn't immediately turn back to you.  Keep doing this until he comes after you.  Run like hell again, and try to stay out of his range.<br>
<br>
Once you get this trick down, you can kite quite a few things that are slightly bigger than what you could normally take down.  I used to run around Seafury island with a group of 6-8 cycs in tow, with my water pet backstabbing along.  :-) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barmodius>Barmodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 4:45:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hill giants?</span><hr size=1> Here is a mana-intensive alternative for HGs for a good white-knuckle fight at 39.<br>
<br>
First, Summon a focused fire pet, BOII, Expedience, Tiny Companion (I swear that spell makes my pet last longer!)platemail, 2 swords.  Make sure he casts his DS before pulling!!<br>
<br>
On me - KEI, Greater Shielding, Phantom Plate, Spirit of Wolf.  Ring for fast casting, bracelet for power nukes, earring for low cost nukes.<br>
<br>
Spell lineup - 1. Blaze  2.  Shock of Spikes  3.  Shock of Blades  4.  Malaise  5. 29 Earth pet (fast cast just in case) 6. Renew Summoning  7.  Renew Elements  8.  Gate<br>
<br>
Pick a single HG, because adds will kill you fast.  I grabbed one from the eastern part of West Karana.  Pull with Malaise, and send pet in.  When the pet is at 80%, begin to chain heal starting with renew summoning.  The recast delay sucks on both spells, but you can cast one while the other refreshes.  You will be able to keep the pets health up pretty well, but it will lose probably 1-4% per round.  Some rounds the HG will miss or hit for low damage.  When you see this, cast Shock of Spikes (speed is the key here), then immediately resume chain healing.  When you feel brave or feel the fight is going well, stick Shock of Swords in the heal rotation.  Every little bit of damage helps, and it casts very fast.  Using this, I was able to keep the pet up above 50% health, and take small chunks out of Mr. Giant.  He turned to run at 14%, so then use Blaze and finish him off.  Varn had 37% health at the end, and I had 33m.  Never got aggro or considered chaining a decoy.<br>
<br>
Not efficient for xp, not a proven tactic, but damn fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kpm2k>kpm2k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.faceoff.com/media/pics/200211063895673-F.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/03 1:26:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: hill giants?</span><hr size=1> Well I just hit 40 .. and well, went for my run to the SRo .. came across the Sand Giants .. They seemed to go down pretty good.  At 39, my pet hits for 40, nukes for at least 70 . Parry's, Riptoses and wears plate armor.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     This is the focused pet and I am using the level 39 FIRE Pet.  The Air pet may work a little better because of the stun and interrupt, I'm not sure, but I've always used Fire pet since level 29 or so (Split Paws) with great success.  <br>
<br>
But as far as the SG's, my pet handles them really well.  Maybe two heals and he's good.  But, if the SG doesn't have a weapon, then he seems to hit a lot more, and harder and you'll have to heal more often.  Something to try which I haven't, but may be too much Aggro -- is to nuke with Cinder Bolt when pulling .. for the SG i was at yesterday I just pull with Malise life alway so he doesn't resist the cinder bolt or blaze later.  Every fight that I get into required TWO nukes.. I try Cinder Bolt -- usually in the neighbourhood of 380-399 damage.  Dying to break the 400 marker !!!<br>
<br>
Well, I think I'm off to Rathe Mountains tonight to try out the Hill Giants .. Will post if anyone is interested how it went.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kpm2k>kpm2k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.faceoff.com/media/pics/200211063895673-F.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/16/03 1:29:21 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barmodius>Barmodius</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(1/21/03 3:22:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=4>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Update</span><hr size=1> OK, you can easily take out a hill giant.  I was in Rathe yesterday with my lvl 40 mage partnering with a lvl 36 enchanter.  When she left, I decided to take a single pop solo, and it was almost too easy.<br>
<br>
<br>
First, I know many folks love the fire pet.  Time to put it away and get out a focused air pet.  I think you can buy it at 39 and you can easily buy all the items for the Broom of Trilon at the bazaar (although everyone should suffer hours of Najena hell like I did).<br>
<br>
Next, give it a set of Phantom Plate, an elemental defender, and 2 swords.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Once when I did not equip a pet to fight (focused fire), the Hill Giant was hitting for 96 damage or more.  After the armor, the damage moved in the 70s-80s and lower.  Burnout II and Barrier of Combustion.  Send pet in and malaise.<br>
<br>
The glory of the air pet over fire is the agility.  It simply was not getting hit.  Fire and Earth take pretty serious beatings vs. HGs, and you end up spending all the time healing the pet.  The air pet dropped below 80% once.  He probably could have solo'd it.<br>
<br>
Watch the pet damage, and nuke after he taunts.  3 or 4 cinder bolts will do him in.  Maybe a shock of spikes at the end to keep him from running.<br>
<br>
After that, I stayed and tried the same tactic with 2 more HGs.  It was just easy.  My only problem was frikin dr00ds trying to ks everything in the rathe mtn zone.  I learned that if you pull with malaise, you WILL get ks'd (some crap about no damage, no claim), but if you pull with Cinder Bolt, dr00ds don't have a chance.  If they rooted, I would just use it to my advantage and cinder bolt from max range.  Wait til it is dead and they shout to zone about a ks, and watch every mage, wizard, and necro collectively shout &quot;boo frikin hoo, ya stupid dr00d!&quot;  Well worth it in sheer satisfaction.  Get SoW potions or Jboots just in case you get a little too much aggro.  At 96 damage per hit vs. a 39 dress-wearing mage (about 800hp?), you won't last 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
Spell line up:  1. Cinder Bolt  2.  Shock of Spikes  3.  Fire Bolt (low aggro damage pull)  4.  Malaise  5.  Burnout II  6.  Renew Summoning  7.  Renew Elements  8.  Gate <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=barmodius>Barmodius</A> at: 1/21/03 6:16:10 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kpm2k>kpm2k</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.faceoff.com/media/pics/200211063895673-F.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(1/22/03 7:15:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=186.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Update</span><hr size=1> I'm now 44 ..

Stick to Warriors and Wooly Rhinos though to make 43-44 faster.  Pull Rhino's with a Cinder Bolt, let the pet get the rhino down a bit and nuke once or twice more.  A heal WILL be required.

He does require a heal here and there.. and I used the PoP spell (tiny companion) -- good and bads for it .. 1) hard to find him sometimes ..  2) he's cute .. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     Maybe he gets hit less ?

i was there in rathe today for about 2 hours soloing the HGs with my 39 Fire pet, had summoned him some chain, swords, and a ele defender,<br>
hit him with BO2, and expedience, and he went at them pretty good, one or two heals, <br>
he would end most fights with more than half health, <br>
<br>
i pulled with malise, and then rained of lava, and one cinderbolt or two blazes and they would run, <br>
<br>
was easy, i also kited broog bloodbeard, or whatever  his name is, <br>
i had sow potions and ran up and down the main hill, <br>
and would nuke when he was coming down after me, <br>
(mobs run slower down hills)<br>
<br>
i was FM when i did this, and had a little help from a 41 cleric who healed me when i was hit for double 105s<br>
he was red conned, he killed my pet very fast! <br>
one of the very best places ive found to lvl, <br>
<br>
that is if you can handle the loser higher lvls there farming plat! and KSing everything from lizardman warriors to the HGs themselves....<br>
<br>
anyway must haves are <br>
1, kei.<br>
