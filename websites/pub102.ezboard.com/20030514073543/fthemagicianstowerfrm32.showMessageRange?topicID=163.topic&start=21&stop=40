That you, as a mage, immediately recieve tells upon logging in is a fine tribute to your social standing.  Congratulations, etc, here's your cookie.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing these people who hit you up for a group are friends, or people who desperately need a COH'er for a raid, on account of there being almost no magicians online.  I wouldn't believe you if you told me that strangers hit you up for XP groups.  Why would they?  Once we remove the aspect of your personality, there is only your class, and your class is not as good as a lot of more highly available ones.<br>
<br>
Now if you played one of the Holy Trinity, you really would have strangers hunt for you asking if you want to join.  I hunt for strangers to groups all the time.  Mostly clerics, but sometimes warriors, rogues and enchanters as well.  Even druids and shaman if I can't find a cleric.  Never mages.  Even if I wasn't a mage, I still would never hunt for a strange mage to group with me.  Aside from being a dangerous class if the player isn't competent, it's simply not as useful as more available alternatives.  Even if the mage was right in front of me, I would frankly rather wait for a rogue or just take a wizard, because at least the wizard makes it easy to evac to the zoneline when the group wants to break.<br>

Build groups.  Not only will you have control of your playing time, but you will gain skills that are just flat invaluable to a guild.  Finding someone who can handle even a Group Leader position on a raid is tough.<br>
<br>
B.  Forget the standard xp group crap.  If you sit around looking for a cleric, warrior and enchanter for your group then you will sit a lot, and when the group is formed they won't be happy with you being there.  Try a ranger, rogue, shammy, bard, etc.  Feel your way into the first few pulls, and encourage folks to play around a bit to find out what works.  All that is really required of a group is some type of healing, some type of melee, some type of damage, and some type of crowd control (root works, dont forget it).  <br>
<br>
C.  Get the heck out of the crowded zones.  If there are four or more people LFG, and you can't get them to form up a group, then leave.  Go somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Nonstandard groups are mucho fun, and making them work will make you a very popular person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugrumples.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grumples</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 510<br> <font color=#333333>(3/25/02 4:05:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=23>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_exclamation_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Grouping IS a social issue!</span><hr size=1> And if the classes were better balanced, that would be unnecessary.<br>

Your confusing me now. As a mage I cannot control 3 adds. As a mage I cannot cast a spell that doubles everyone's mana regen. As a mage I cannot Main Tank for the Group. As a mage I cannot pull in many situations. How is this perception? The flaw in your argument is that you believe there is some stereotype or perception issue here. There is not. Our only role is to deal damage in your classic group. And the reality of the matter is there are very few positions open in classic styled groups for a class that can only do damage. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> This is not Social.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I could agree with you if you were to change your position some. I could agree with you if you were saying: You have to use a great deal of social skills to overcome the lack of role that Magicians currently have, because a magician's core abilities are not that attractive to your classic grouping setup.<br>
<br>

<br>
During the rare times I want to group with my mage, I am grouping with my friends' alts.  Frankly, I made my mage knowing this-Warriors are almost completely dependent upon groups and I get sick of that.  My Mage is my selfish character, my Warrior is my grouping character, and my Druid is my selfless character that I basically use for running around lower level areas healing and buffing. <br>
<br>
I can tell you this:  it is absolutely true that Mages and Wizards are passed over for groups.  If i have to choose a Cleric over a Mage or Wizard as my Warrior I am darned well going to pick the Cleric, because the Cleric will keep me alive.  If I have to choose between the Mage and the Wizard, I will take the Wizard because he can tl, and put out an immense amount of damage, plus he can root, making him a little more effective at crowd control.  Now, think what you like, but this is an honest post from someone who plays a mage; though maybe not as high level as most of you.<br>
<br>
Though I am unsure what VI's vision was when they created the Mage, what I see is a class that predominately solos, is designed to be better solo than in group, and who's skills have been watered down.  I, for one, look avidly forward to the &quot;class balancing&quot; in the hopes they get off the fence in regard to mages--either we are a soloing class or a grouping class, but I think that trying to make them both is making them too weak in each department.<br>
<br>

I, and many others, chose to construct other types of groups, with a different set of roles.<br>
<br>
I am often the puller, so much so I am relieved when someone else volunteers.  <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is often the main tank.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I wouldn't believe you if you told me that strangers hit you up for XP groups.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->As I've said, I build groups, I don't <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> LFG</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and I generally only group with strangers when someone I know invites me to a group that includes people I do not know.

I am not the only poster who believes that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are pretty good in experience groups.  While I agree that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are not popular, either to play or to invite, I maintain that this says more about players' perceptions than any objective weakness of the class.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The flaw in your argument is that you believe there is some stereotype or perception issue here. There is not. Our only role is to deal damage in your classic group. And the reality of the matter is there are very few positions open in classic styled groups for a class that can only do damage. This is not Social.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This is <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>very</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> social.<br>
<br>
First of all, the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;classic group&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is entirely a social construct, as are the roles within it.  Objectively, there are only two requirements for an experience group.  First, the mob must die in order to yield experience, so damage dealing is necessary.  Second, you must avoid dying yourself, so damage mitigation is the other role.  Kill, not get killed yourself.<br>
<br>
These are the <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>only</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> necessary roles for a group.<br>
<br>
Various group styles are all different means of accomplishing this.  For example, in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Area of Effect</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> groups, damage dealing is done in the obvious way, and damage mitigation is primarily through stun, and to a lesser extent, pets.<br>
<br>
In my prefered playing style, pets tank, and act as the damage mitigators.  No player required to tank, and healers, while nice, are hardly necessary.  It's only when a player tank gets involved that I have to change styles and worry about them dying.  If it is just pets, well perhaps <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Gobaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s brother <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Jibaner</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> will do better.<br>
<br>
The classic group setting is simply one popular style of play, and judging classes solely against that style is not in the least objective.  The classic group IS a stereotype.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Now if you played one of the Holy Trinity, you really would have strangers hunt for you asking if you want to join.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Death to the Holy Trinity!

When a stereotyped playing style <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (&quot;classic&quot; group)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> yields stereotyped results <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Mages are not wanted)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, it is a mistake to elevate the stereotype to an objective truth.<br>

School for social scientists to pontificate on their navals? Utter nonsense.<br>
<br>
The original poster is correct. It is the experience of *almost all* mages. Mages ARE less desirable in groups. It's just a fact, not a social commentary. Hell, I know well, my alt is a 60 Cleric, and I won't take an unknown mage over an unknown rogue or monk, they are just are not in the same league TECHNICALLY (social sense is IRRELEVANT).<br>
<br>
However, most players, including me, group with friends over strangers, regardless of class. So Suzanna gets groups, with friends, and my cleric will group happily with mage friends. This is normal. And when Suzanna can't get a group, she solos until friends come online.<br>
<br>
But to anyone who uses social science claptrap to talk riddles round the OBVIOUS FACT that clerics and enchanters find groups with strangers far easier than Mages and Wizards are talking out of their rears, and let's face it, we all know it.<br>

<br>
First off, when you first made your mage, when you were reading that little blurb about your hometown, perhaps you saw that the class/race combination you chose was of Moderate to Hard difficulty..<br>
<br>
Perhaps you have also seen that a barbarian warrior is of Low difficulty...<br>
<br>
Obviously, mages are a challenge, and a certain type of person enjoys playing the game in a more difficult setting (call it masochism, call it whatever you like)<br>
<br>
However, there are certain spots/times that a mage is quite useful.. IE, the smart group in crypt has a mage, as well as a rogue.. why?  because when the evaccer has to log, you don't have to leave.. Same goes for Every Single xp camp that you cant walk to from the zone without fighting.. If people don't see that, then they are fans of having to fight from the zoneline all over again, and hope someone else doesn't steal the camp.<br>
<br>
AE grouping gets brought up constantly... And it is a viable solution.. are you and the 2 wizards next to you LFG?  find one of the twink chanters that switched from mages, grab a cleric (prolly also a former mage) and a pally (go figure, also LFG), and you have a group to make the &quot;standard&quot; group get pissed cause there's nothing for them to pull.  Hell, if you get lucky, they'll offer to pull for you  (&quot;if you don't give us pulls, I'm gonna train you&quot;... I've had people tell me that)<br>
<br>
Still can't find a group?  go find an sk, they're usually soloing too... there, now you have a partner, whose strengths happen to be where your weaknesses are.<br>
<br>
If you're trying to get into stereotypical 'perfect' groups, you're competing against every other non-Holy Trinity class for that one coveted spot... so don't bother, it's a waste of your time.<br>
<br>
Mages are a jack of all trades class.. you Can crowd control, on a limited basis.. you Can mana battery a group, just takes effort, you Can be an offensive presence in a group..<br>
<br>
What a magician Can't do is convince A_Warrior_LFG_001 that the world continues outside of velks or seb or ME... that there is an entire world (plus a moon) in between those port spots, and that there are things to kill there, too.. <br>
<br>
So find yourself a partner, make yourself a group, make it as unorthadox as possible, you'd be surprised.<br>
<br>
If you're not willing to leave those zones, then please do make a different class twink, and allow the other players to know who the serious mage players are.<br>
<br>
What it all comes down to is fun.. if you're not having fun, because you &lt;u&gt; perceive &lt;/u&gt; that nobody likes mages, don't play your mage anymore.. If you continue playing your mage simply because you spent so much time on him, then play a different game.<br>

If this is the case then I bet you level slow as piss cause you sure as hell arent playing in any zones where you get good xp.<br>

Mages = suck, sorry, thats just the way it is.  You can flame me &amp; post your crap arguments about social this social that all you want, but the fact is mages = suck, end of story.  They offer poor utility to groups, substandard damage output, and dont even solo well post 50.  I know most of you dont wanna hear it &amp; would rather just stick your head in the sand, but its just fact.<br>
<br>
This is coming from someone who played a mage as his main for since release, has mage epic, boots of bladecalling, muzzle of mardu, blah blah blah.<br>
<br>
Mages SUCK - think i'll just reiterate that again for those of you that missed it above.  Mages dont solo well, cant outdamage meele, pet cant tank in 99% of situations, cant crowd control, only buff is a dshield, no snare, no evac, no port, crap summoned items - think i'll just stop there...everything a group needs...well mages aint got it.<br>

So then you are not denying that if you want to get into a &quot;classic group&quot; which btw is the most common, you will have better luck with a few classes other than a mage.<br>
<br>
Right now I think your arguing for arguments sake, and ignoring the initial point that he said that he has trouble getting into a group after level 50. I'd hate to give young mages the wrong idea about the problems they will face because you expect other mages to always be a group leader like you. <br>

I LOVE non-standard groups.  Much more fun and exciting (uh, why I play EQ).  I would not say that I pull often, but quite a bit.  Heck, I solo some, so I know how to pull.  =)<br>

Many people play EQ.  Some play for different reasons.  I love the fact that while some of my guildies are making the &quot;perfect group&quot;, me and my non standard buds are chuggin away PLAYIN EQ, pullin and havin fun.<br>

<br>
If you want to stumble into a deep dungeon group wiff strangers, then I fell Magi are not the class to play.  If you want to group wiff a bunch of strangers easily many other classes have better perception/skills/lower risk than Magi, but that is not to say that magi &quot;can't&quot; do it.  =)<br>

Magicians are not wanted like other classes and magicians do have a lot harder time getting groups then most class.<br>
<br>
Now, forming groups is a good alternative to sitting LFG for hours but I am still trying to figure out how does forming your own groups change the fact that magicians are not wanted in groups as much as other classes?  IMO it doesnt. It just stops you from having to wait for a group. Normally if I try to form a group with my mage it takes forever. Someone will join and see that I am a mage and disband. This is something that happens alot.  I will often try to form groups with paladins and druids first. Since they are wanted about as much as magicians in the normal experience group. The problem is most melee will not venture any where deep in a dungeon unless a cleric is present and I guess for good reason.  Druids and Shamans just dont stack up to clerics due to the overpowered nature for complete heal.<br>
<br>
I like dungeon crawling and basically just because I am a mage I will have to for go that because there is no way I am going to form a group easier then say a cleric or a enchanter that is sitting in sebillis or velks forming a group.  After about lvl 52 I decided that I needed a alt because magicians just have to hard of a time finding groups.  I have a lvl 58 bard now and group getting with him is effortless. 58 bard LFG and I am spammed with multiple tells &quot;join us&quot;, &quot;we will fight to the zone to get you&quot;.  I never have groups go out of there way for my magician. When I am creating groups when I am playing my bard and there is a rogue or a mage LFG I have to say I am going to take the rogue or the monk. They bring just as much damage output and also other things like corpse recovery and pulling ability. CoTH, Mod Rods just doesnt stack up to pulling/tankng/corpe recovery in normal experience groups.<br>
<br>
I dont believe magicans suck because by good I play a lvl 56 magician but we have major problems that need to be fixed. I still am waiting to see what changes are going to be made to the class because as of now no balancing has been done just lots of low lvl changes to bring in more new people. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 451<br> <font color=#333333>(3/26/02 6:54:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Difficulty with grouping in 50+ or just cause I am a mag</span><hr size=1> gallerus - you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   are</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> watching what your warrior hits for, right? do you honestly think your mage cant top that? your EPIC mage?<br>

<br>
a warrior of your level probably will be about 60-70% of my total damage (depending on your equip), and probably 40% of what your mage could do.<br>
<br>
do you know how to play your mage? unless your warrior has some <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  incredibly uber equipment</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, you were doing something seriously wrong as a mage.<br>
<br>
mages do have a spot in groups, and there is a good reason to recruit them. they increase the groups total dps. a mage is the second best class (possibly even the first) in an exp group for this role. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  despite popular belief classes who deal alot of damage are very much necessary for functional groups</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
<br>
you can have the best damage absorber (warrior), <br>
the best damage mitigator (enchanter), <br>
and the best damage repairer (cleric)...<br>
but i assure you. despite having all that support, that group is going to get SQUAT for exp unless they get 2 or 3 real damage dealers (rogues and mages).<br>
<br>
edit:b ut like the original poster, i get so incredibly frustrated by the poor perception of my class. i just wasted an hour trying to join a group, and then another trying to form my own group. the joining a group i knew was going to be ridiculous, no way anyone would want me to join... but i decided to try anyway. of course, with no success.<br>
<br>
as for forming a group, ive tried it. sometimes im successful, but often many people dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  want</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to group with a mage. i doubt its a social issue, as im relatively unknown on my server so i dont have a bad reputation at all. all <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  they</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> know as a perfect stranger, is that im a 57 mage, and they think mages suck. therefore, they do not want to join my group as they think my group will suck too.<br>
<br>
its getting to the point where this game feels like work and not fun. they seriously need to do something to change the perception of this class. make pet damage spells hearable. make nukes hearable. do SOMETHING so people start to &quot;get&quot; that im not just sitting there soaking up exp, that im part of the reason those things are dying :X. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 56 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61427" target="new"><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 45 Erudite Enchantress<br></a> </p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 3/26/02 7:02:38 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugallerus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Gallerus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(3/26/02 9:00:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=163.topic&index=35>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Difficulty with grouping in 50+ or just cause I am a mag</span><hr size=1> I havent parsed epic pet damage output, but standard pet damage output isnt that great - last I checked, 54 water pet damage is topped by lvl 60 ranger, monk, rogue.

But in any case, you still need some plate tanking class since someone has got to tank - and please dont tell me that pets can tank - anyone who uses that argument is a total n00b.<br>
<br>
&quot;despite having all that support, that group is going to get SQUAT for exp unless they get 2 or 3 real damage dealers &quot;<br>
<br>
This is exactly correct...your mistake is to lump mages into the &quot;real damage dealers&quot; category.  We havent been there since shortly after the release of rok.  Meeles of similar level with slightly above average gear do anywhere from slightly less (warriors) to way more (rogue dps is sick &amp; wrong) damage than magicians in most cases now &amp; have the added ability to do things like take hits and to function normally during overpulls (where as a mage all you can do is spam /pet backoff while the chanter gets things under control) &amp; not die in more than 5 hits.<br>
<br>
Things were good prerok - we had no hps &amp; you had to know how to control your pet in groups, but we were compensated by being the *premier* damage doing class - over time, there was *no class* that could compete with a lvl 49 pet in an xp group prerok.  Meeles have all had their dps drastically increased (easily available uber haste, WAY better weapons, higher levels, better combat tables, higher atk, etc etc) - our dps have not noticably been increased, except for the ridiculously hard to obtain epic pet, which does STILL does not close the gap sufficiently (although it goes against VIs statement when epics 1st came out that they didnt want them to be so important that they would be the basis for making grouping decisions ala manastones, but they messed up again - imagine). <p>Borstal 58 Barbarian Warrior<BR>

1 - Monks add monks to your damage dealer list.<br>
2 - seriously you would consider taking a mage over a warrior that do 30% 40% less damage????? <br>
The warrior can tank, the warrior won't brake mezs, tha warrior wont train you, if the mage were to train you you would loose far more than the additional XP you gained with his additional damages.<br>
<br>
Now let us say that you have a group of 5 that are trying to make XP. The only thing they need is XP (not help their local fellow magician that has trouble to make XP) so they will try to fill the last slot with the class that will give them the best XP.<br>
And let us say that you have this group <br>
1 monk<br>
1 ench<br>
1 ranger<br>
1 war <br>
1 Cleric<br>
<br>
To simplify the things let us say that the monk the warrior and the ranger are dealing the same amout of damage that is 40% less than a mage. Those 3 will deal 180% the damage of a mage, add a new warrior and you have 240% the damage of a mage and an additional tank (that can always help), add a mage and you have 280% the damage of a mage. That is 16% damage increase in your group. <br>
Sincerely this group does not need a mage, it needs a rogue, another monk, a wizard maybe for evac. If those person are supersitious and are afraid to be trained they will even choose a warrior instead of a mage. If they think that an additional warrior can save their but in case of catastrophy better than a mage they will pick another warrior. <br>
As for the pet saving groups by tanking. I don't think that players that don't play pet class think of pets that way, they (rightfully) think of pets as liability. I play my magician well however, in full groups, the pet means more often trouble than he is saving the group.<br>
<br>
However at 60 with water pet, rod2 and clarity2 or Kodiacs, regrowth and  12 AA points, the mellees that are below 54 generally just cannot compete with me as damage output, I have the real feeling that i can deal 2 or 3 times their damage. But then again a level 60 rogue will make me feel a parasite in the group, just picking xp while doing very little damage.<br>

While I may not be getting absolutely the best experience in the game, I start exping within 5 minutes of logging in, and continue to exp until the call comes to raid.  I don't worry about camp checks, because I can apply my grouping strategy in a variety of places.  People send me tells asking me if I can join in gaining experience.<br>
<br>
Some theoretical maximum of experience gained per hour means nothing if you are LFG, or if the camp is not available.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Mages = suck, sorry, thats just the way it is...the fact is mages = suck, end of story...I know most of you dont wanna hear it &amp; would rather just stick your head in the sand, but its just fact.

However, my response is that there are other group styles, and by acting differently, a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> need not suffer.  Stereotyped play is not the only possibility.<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Right now I think your arguing for arguments sake, and ignoring the initial point that he said that he has trouble getting into a group after level 50.

I am suggesting that there is an alternative to stereotyped groups.  I would hate it if young <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> let stereotypes dictate their choices, and conclude that they suck.<br>
<br>
If all you want are stereotyped classic groups, then you deserve your self imposed exile.  If you chose to live inside a prison of your own perceptions and others, and I cannot convince you otherwise, then I have no choice but to leave you to rot there, even though the bars are solely in your mind.  For those who are brave enough to risk going against the crowd, I assure you the rewards are worth it.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I am a strong and active advocate of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Maigician Class Balance</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, so no one should accuse me of believing that <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> have no problems.  I do however believe that they are less than many others, and that alternatives exist to classic groups.<br>

<br>
There are also several ways to get peoples attention when LFG and /ooc is the most pathetic way.<br>
<br>
Try this a couple weeks and see how it goes.<br>
<br>
Enter a zone like Seb.<br>
/who enc(or any class)<br>
/tell enc Hey ENC_Name_Here!!  Hi I'm looking to have some fun and get some experience.  Send me a tell if a spot opens up in your group.  That cool?<br>
Ench_name_Here tells you.  Sure, Okay, or. Hey we have a spot opening in 5 minutes.  can you make it to NG?<br>
<br>
Add the people that are friendly and invited you to group to your friends list.  then you can /who all friends. and send them a tell saying you had fun in their group the other day and if a spot opens you'd enjoy grouping with them.<br>
<br>
Go ahead and turn /lfg on<br>
<br>
/who LFG - <br>
/tell LFG_01 hey! want to Duo with me while we LFG?  <br>
LFG_01 telss you &quot;Sure&quot;<br>
/invite LFG_01, /invite LFG_02<br>
<br>
/who all LFG can help too.<br>
<br>
I may not recieve tells from people asking me to group all the time but it does happen.  And when I've never gotten a rude response from someone I've sent a request to.<br>
<br>
Then ten minutes later you may recieve a tell.<br>
Nice_Guy_010 tells you &quot;Hey buddy you still LFG?&quot;<br>
/reply Sorry Nice Guy but we'll have to group next time.  Just got invited to AE group!!!  Good luck tonight!<br>
<br>
edit* just and addition.  I got invited to fill the 6th spot consiting of the following group in Seb.<br>
<br>
War<br>
War<br>
Rog<br>
Cle<br>
Wiz<br>
<br>
Thanks go out to the Spirit Guardians on Saryrn.  We then proceeded to lower zone out trying to root adds and keep our heads above the water.  <br>
<br>
Not everyone out there is out to keep the mages down.<br>

Sorry, the only reason I made this point is because earlier you said this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I fail to see how this is self imposed if other classes do not have the same issue. <br>
<br>
However, I do agree that there are definitely ways around the problems that mages have getting groups, but it takes a very proactive approach that is not required for several other classes. If you love the class, you will find a way around the lack of role for a classic group. All of which solutions involve using Social interaction to overcome.<br>
