I know that having envy of spells that mages do not possess will get me nowhere, but the one spell I am truly envious of, would have to be the Root line of spells. Let's face it, every single class that has that blue strand of mana under their health bar has the ability to root or snare in some form or another, except for the Mage (and the Beastlord up to this point).<br>
<br>
Supposedly, the fact that our earth pet has the ability to root, lets Verant off the hook in this department.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;Magicians get no fear or root spells.  They are the only pure caster which has this penalty.  In return they get pets which constantly taunt the mobs off them, and some pets have the ability to root a mob as part of their special attacks.  Magician pets are also relatively cheap to cast, both in terms of components and mana, even at high levels.&quot; - Casters Realm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Although Necro, Beastlord, and Shaman pets do not have the ability to root, their pets are equally efficient as Mage pets, as far as hitpoints and damage dealing goes -- especially Necros and Beastlords. I use the Necro, Beastlord and Shaman as examples, since they have the ability to control their pets, and well, Druid and Shadowknight pets are not on the same level.<br>
<br>
I'm tired of relying solely on my pet (to an extent) in almost every non-raid situation. As an example, If I'm running through a zone invis, and something happens to see through it, or if invis drops, I'm screwed without my pet -- especially on a corpse run, or if the mob has any speed increasing spells. <br>
<br>
I might be getting off the subject here... all I ask is a simple evaluation from the mage community on what they think of the idea of implementing some sort of a root line of spells to the Mage's arsenal. Or perhaps better examples to solve this problem. I would like anyone's input.

However I don't think we'll ever get it. That is as ingrained in Verant's thinking as clerics being the only viable healer when it really counts.<br>
<br>
I'd accept a 5 second casting time, no reagent, enchanter level pet as a suitable solution tho. It wouldn't even have to be able to attack as long as it could taunt. Won't help us solo, as we can only have 1 pet up at a time, it would only be good as a defense. <br>
<br>
Verant seems to think that giving us root would make us soloing powerhouses. Don't point out that necros get root and pets nearly as good, they've decided they don't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uchadly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>chadly</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 76<br> <font color=#333333>(2/18/02 2:09:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Root Envy - What do you think?</span><hr size=1> I think they should put a snare effect on elemental maelstrom , and give us a lesser version around 24.

<br>
Our roots are the Best, they taunt, they hit (ask a druid if they would like a DoT root spell), they cast, they can proc weapons, they can be healed, they can take damage, they can be buffed, etc etc etc........they are called PETS.....<br>
<br>
All of the classes that have root, also have a chance of breaking root with any DD spell, if they break their root, they then have to worry about mob being in their face.  Mages can cast 1 root (their pet), buff it a bit, send it to target, if mage out taunts his root, his root is still dealing damage and taunting the mob, mage can safely stand there taking the beat down til pet taunts and generally can back out of melee range.  Hmmm every other class you mentioned has to either root it again or blast it down.  Either way our roots are better than theirs, heck look at the mana efficiency.<br>

BTW curiouse about what your going to do with a root? Root mob, /pet attack?  Erm...................<br>

<br>
I agree that our pets are possibly the best form of root in the game when it comes to a single mob, and when we're prepared for it. But as I cited above, in the instances we do not have our pets (when traveling, raiding, etc), it would be nice to have some form of crowd control if we do happen to be aggroed without our pets.<br>
<br>
I remember when I was in my 40s, I used to run through Dreadlands, even with jboots, terrified that I would get caught by a drachnid. When you've got 700 hitpoints, a mob is dual hitting for 80s, and it's running faster than you, you just hope to be close to a zone.<br>
<br>
Root would just be a nice wham-bam-run kind of deal, or possibly some form of crowd control that, unlike little Jobober, doesn't take 10 seconds to cast, can work on multiple mobs (You can only have ONE pet at a time), can't break mez, and won't disobey it's master. The worst it could do is fizzle, get interrupted, or just not hold.<br>
<br>
Again, I agree that our pets are underappreciated in their abilities, but there are many scenarios where a pet is either not needed, or it's just not safe to have it. And in these instances, it would be nice to have any form of a wham-bam-run kind of spell. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uodibillauxes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Odibil Lauxes</A> at: 2/18/02 6:18:13 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uquinean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quinean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#333333>(2/18/02 7:16:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: root</span><hr size=1> Might I suggest looking into getting some of the following items.<br>

<br>
Although those items are a good suggestion, they are highly resistable, and quite a burden if you plan to carry more than one. I'm currently using a Bioluminiscent Orb in my offhand, which blinds the mob and sends it running as if it were feared. Don't get too excited... this is no substitution for fear, since if you're in melee range, it will cease to run and begin pounding on you. Again, great suggestions, but to say the least, most Mages aren't running around with a Bio Orb in their hand, nor do they want to carry a backpack full of unreliable silks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Isatron,<br>
<br>
I'm not really sure where Root falls into play in your equation. Improved Reclaim Energy + Elemental Pact has the potential of giving a Mage infinate mana even without the aid of Root. Maybe if you found yourself getting low on mana while engaged in battle, you would root the mob, reclaim pet, and get another while root kept the mob at bay... which is currently possible to do while chain casting the earth pet, albeit risky.<br>
<br>

<br>
Everyone's forgetting why I even wrote this. I long for a day where I do not have to rely solely on my pet, since I seem to use it less and less as my levels progress -- in certain situations, of course -- being able to hold my ground or get away safe enough to see another day, without making a huge game imbalance. I believe Root is the most reasonable request. Consider this, most other classes don't even have the slightest clue that we aren't able to root. I may sound ignorant, but it's not much of a game imbalance if everyone already thinks we have the spell to begin with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 440<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/02 3:14:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif height=40 width=40></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Root</span><hr size=1> Any mage who has played to 50 has had <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> dozens</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> of &quot;MAGES CAN'T ROOT???&quot; comments said in their groups.

The problem is not obvious at lower lvl, but is glaringly apparent post lvl 55..  <br>
<br>
A root cast by lvl 60 wizzy is very different from those cast by dingy little Jobarer who is only lvl 45.  This makes a big difference when you are taking on blue mobs who easily quad you for 150+.  Jobarer would have difficulty landing root on mob while lvl 60 wizzy and dr00ds have much better chance with their own casting.<br>
The same of course applies to air pet stun.  <br>
<br>
Even though we get Root and Stun via our pet, it's not the same as we mage casting them.  This is important because as we level up, difference between pet level and caster lvl become huge... so that's why our pet miss a lot or rarely stick root/stun even on low blue cons.<br>

To be honest, I would rather have root/stun post lvl 55, rather than have them on Greater Vocarate pets.... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugaladriels.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Galadriels</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/02 4:06:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  ....</span><hr size=1> Just to note that either offer mage some form of defensive spell or buff up pet's effective lvl to 50+ would both work.. but I still prefer to have a caster based spell rather than pet based defensive spell post lvl 55.. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uodibillauxes.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Odibil Lauxes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/02 5:23:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Euriped</span><hr size=1> Exactly, Euriped.

So what. Chain casting pets is already possible with a little practice. <br>
<br>
Necros could chain pets with thier root, if they needed to. The reason they don't chain is simply because they have better options, not because of anything to do with thier pets. Same thing with any other pet class, but even more so. Only beastlords are unable to chain pets, but with thier superior pet heals, and still very nice pets they are at less mob mercy than we are. Besides, they do get sow in the 40's I believe, which often would be all they need to survive most situations.<br>
<br>
Root would be nice, but truthfully I'd rather have something else that is in character that accomplishes some defense. An insanely good personal only DS would be in character, and would help against low greens. A quick cast time pet that you can throw in the mobs way while you run. A personal CoH that has as good a chance of clearing aggro as an enchanters mem blur. A line of summoned wands with 1-3 clicks of some of our low level nukes, perfect for killing low greens that aggro, without us having a low nuke up, or us using an overkill nuke (this also wouldn't let us solo any better really as they could be either too low to be worth using on an xp mob, or too mana intensive to keep except for emergencies).<br>
<br>
With some creativity there are in character alternatives that Verant might be willing to consider. Then again, they might decide it's just cheaper for them to give us root and call it &quot;summon shackles&quot; or something vaguely mage-like. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usinghaovercast.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Singha Overcast</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 88<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/02 2:33:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Root Smoot</span><hr size=1> <br>

Unless it's vs one critter, you're out of doors, and you haven't hit it yet. And if you don't already have gate memmed, by golly you're not going to sit to mem it because all taunt goes out the window then.<br>
<br>
FD or something would be nice... I can't see it fitting with the mage class, but hey, I can't see how getting whomped by greens fits either.<br>
<br>
Maybe pb ae root, unresistable, lasts for 16 seconds or something, enough to back up, mem gate, cast it... long recast on the spell.<br>
<br>
Or maybe improved gate, having a very quick cast time (equiv to necro fd) that makes you temporarily invincible, at which point you proceed to automatically gate (with normal cast time). So you basically get 2 chances to fizzle the spell... would cost more mana than reg gate (maybe 2x?) and you still have to go to your bind point... unlike everyone else. An automated chain spell, if you will. Dunno, just rambling.<br>
<br>
Oh oh, here: (this is wacky) Personal fear-shield. Self only, each time they hit you they have a chance to be feared for a very short duration. Wouldn't be usable for soloing, for obvious reasons, but could be pretty  good at defending against greenies.

I know what (Improved) Reclaim Energy is... but that wasn't my argument. I understand what you mean by keeping the mob rooted while you reclaim your pet and cast another, but like I said, this can be done currently when using the earth pet. I'll admit it's risky, but it can still be done.<br>
<br>
Speaking of an infinate mana pool, have you seen an epic Wizard with a manastone or a mana robe? (DiamondSkin/Rune + Lich = Infinate Mana). Or how about going as simple as a Necro in Lich form? (Lich + Lifetap = Infinate Mana).<br>
<br>
Aside from having class envy, I would be equally happy with Gaeelae's idea... a root which could only be used without the presence of a pet (Similar to Eye of Zomm - &quot;You can only have ONE pet at a time&quot; message.) It's just a thought. <p><center><img src="http://www.e-slackers.net/odibilsig.gif"></center></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=177.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=177.topic&start=41&stop=47>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=177.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=177.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=177.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=177.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=177.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=177.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
