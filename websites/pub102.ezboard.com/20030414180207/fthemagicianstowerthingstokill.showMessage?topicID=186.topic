They were specifically asking about an Orc Camp in EC which had two blues and one green con.<br>
<br>
Although some of us provided some possible strategies, the general consensus was that solo Mages are not good at this type of thing.  So I was wondering if someone here might have any good ideas for doing this.  Let's not limit it to the specific example.  How can Mages effectively break spawns at any level whether indoors or ourside?<br>
<br>
I'll post some of the ideas from the other board later. <p><img src="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~tabb/XtalName1.jpg">

<br>
But some other things I have tried with varying success.  <br>
<br>
On a double spawn, send a flame shielded pet.  Let them beat on him a bit, then burn one down fast.  At this point you can gate, zone, melee or let the pet solo the second.  It all depends on the strength of the mob compared to your pet.  If you zone the idea is to rush back and kill the second before the first respawns. (depending on level I have done this at the Bloodgills in Lake of ill omen)<br>
<br>
Another tactic, park your pet and set you gate spot somewhere close.  Pull the camp and run away from the pet.  Get some distance and gate.  If you gate with in the zone your pet will not pop.  Now run into camp and pull the remainder.  (I read this here but have never tried it )<br>
<br>
Another tactic in Kunark if you run far enough away the mobs will lose interest and return to their spawn point.  You can use this to pull singles.  e.g. at the giant camp in FV, pull with malise, you will get two, run down the hill and one or both with stop and start to return to the camp.  By controling you range you can get one to come and one to return to camp.<br>
<br>
You can also try pulling with different spells and tactics.  In kedge (entrance room) if I cast I always get more than one fish but if I just agro by swimming into range I can often get only one.<br>
<br>
You can always ask for a little help breaking a camp.  It never bothers me to help break a camp when asked.  <br>
<br>
Jboot, guts and a close zone are all you need <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>

This is not easy for a Mage to do.<br>
<br>
The key is to just somehow, anyhow, kill just one of the camp critters and live.   If you can do that, you can stagger the spawn.  We are able to kill stuff fast and we have a pet that can root -- so this can be used to make this workable.  Sometimes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A lot of it depends on the kind of mobs they are.   Many undead camps are easy -- the will all aggro on your pet and stay on the pet.  Send in pet, nuke like crazy, kill one, run away/gate, come back later.  Some Undead are smart though, like Spectres, but then you can easily kite these around, stopping to toss a pet or nuke back at them now and then, until you stagger them also.<br>
<br>
Hmm, what else?<br>
<br>
Well, you do know that aggro radius drops around mobs that are much lower then you (like low blues), right?  So, trying to break camps of low blues may help you to pull less then the entire camp (Oasis Spec Island comes to mind, at 44th, I could often single pull the ones in the corners). <p><b>Seek Pyremaker</b><br>

<br>
 At 50, I had a real tough time killing the cooks in Mistmoore solo. But I ended up finding a trick.<br>
 I was bound at zone on the MM side.<br>
 I was invising myself then i was going in the kitchen and targeting one of the cook (the left one being a better choice). Then I was going back in the hall on the gargoyle room side and waiting for the spawn at the end of the hall to move away. I then conjured a pet and sent him on my targeted cook. He was usually taking at least one of the HTs. After a few seconds, one of the cook and the other mob were rushing out of the room towards me (sometimes only the other mob, wich was making things a bit easier) and I received one HT. I would then just gate out without doing anything. Rarely, the non-cook mob would teleport with me to the zone (bug) wich makes things easier.<br>
  Otherwise I just zoned out, came back invis and go back to the hall of the kitchen. The cook and the other mob are then usually out of the room, in the hall on the gargoyle side, and you have 3 or 4 minutes before they go back to their room. I was going to the opposite side of the hall and killing the 2 mobs there without pet with SoS while being cautious of not aggroing butler room, and while having the lvl 34 DD memmed to avoid having one of the mobs running in the hall and aggroing the cook and her friend.<br>
 Once these 2 mobs are dead, i could just make a pet, regen with phantom armor, and pull the cook or the other mob as soon as the other one would go back in the room. The cook inside the room wouldn't aggro when the pulled mob was passing in front of her door. Once only one cook and one other mob were left in the room it was easy. If the 2 cooks were left only, i would repeat the same method as above.<br>
<br>
 Breaking camps with pull/gate/come back is one of our camp breaking methods, basically the only one available in dungeons for non single pullable mobs (it also usually involves finding safe spots first, and knowing how mobs will aggro through doors, etc..). The only important things for really tough things to break is to make lots of different tries, and to gate/run often. Gate as soon as odds are against you, or gate if u go low on life even if you have a chance to win.<br>
 Running one of the mobs far away with jboots and sow while the pet fights the other one is also good, especially in kuniark. You have to wait for the mobs that you're running, to avoid having it assist the other one on your pet.<br>
 To fight tough single pullable pet classes NPC, always pull with a DD on the pet, and kill the pet first. Beware of mages NPCs with earth pets as the earth pets do run away fast (like the hole elementals). Pets usually die fast to anti sumon spells, wich are unlikely to be interrupted/resisted.<br>
 In some cases, using the things dropped by the goos with one charge of immobilize can be usueful to break a camp, but risky.<br>
 Another method is to train the camp on NPCs that are kos to the mobs (butlars in CS can be trained on the little villages on the beach for instance).<br>

<br>
The information in this thread has been very accurate on how Mages can break up a multiple spawn site by themselves alone.  One more bit I could add here is that the use of a zone line when close can also make all the difference.<br>
<br>
Example : Velks Lab in the Great Divide.  I once read a post on this place being great experience for a solo Mage but when I went there at 50 I was unable to figure out a way to split the spiders (roughly half the spiders are invisible by nature so singles are often doubles there).  When pulling I would invariably get 2 of the buggers and that would be one to many for my pet to handle.  Those spiders have a nasty bit of fun called Velium Deadly Poison which is just that.  Really nasty stuff.<br>
<br>
To break the spawn set (about 10 minutes for the spiders and stuff down there on the main level) I would make and buff a pet fully, then pull the gargoyles in front to clear the way to the spider pair on the right of the entrance.  I would target the most available one and send the pet in.  If you send in the pet before you cast you will not get the second mob to rush you outright, it will tend to jump the pet.<br>
<br>
Let the spiders work on the pet and the DS until the pet reaches about 60 to 50 % life then Lava Bolt the targeted spider.  If all went well you'll be able to cast a second bolt or SoS to finish off the spider before the pet dies and they come for you.  Once they turn towards you or the pet dies, run back and zone back to GD.  There cast Invis and then quickly zone back in.<br>
<br>
If you were able to kill the first spider outright, you'll have a few minutes to wait to keep the spawns apart before you kill the second one.  If the first is still alive, either risk just a lava bolt to it's head or make a pet and repeat until it's dead.  Once the spiders are split you can pull the partway up the ramp with malise if you want or to get the one on the left side I would buff the pet up and send him in alone.  The angle the spider is at prevents you from casting on the spider (even though it's targeted) unless you walk *right* in front of it.<br>
<br>
This is a bit off the subject but I hope it helps<br>
