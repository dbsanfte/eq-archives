You're one of the sureliest people I have ever met in EQ.  How quick you forget what most mages were asking for.  You're easily blinded and easily sway.  Your opinions change rapidly, but usually go back to a negative stance invariably.<br>
<br>
Were you not the one boasting how powerful epic was again again?  How it was tanking mobs in UP and even the big Zelniak?  Were you not one of the advocates that the new pets not have a distinct advantage over Epic given the time sink the epic is?  Were you not the one that also has said, like the rest of us, that current pets (pre-PoP) don't hit boss mobs well and that their procs don't even land?<br>
<br>
The new pets do everything that most mages ask for.  They don't totally usurp the power of Epic pet.  They have Epic pet damage against exp mobs which is more than adequate.  They are a nice boost for non-epic mages so there is a boon there.  However, being level 60 makes them way more raid friendly, which was the big sticking point for all mages.<br>
<br>
GV pets do fine damage to exp mobs, especially epic pet.  Almost no mage was asking for a boost there.  What we were asking for is a boost against boss mob encounters and we got that with the new pets.<br>
<br>
Mages in PoP rule.  I was in PoD today with another epic mage.  Everyone in our party died except the two of us with two underbulks still alive.  We killed them both and then CoH'ed the people back to our exp so we could keep going.  We have plenty of power and with more AA I'll have even more.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you're looking for but with new pets I think we are nicely balanced for the first time since I've been playing.  Love playing my mage now.<br>
<br>
BTW, 2 hours killing mobs by castle in PoD not one parchment drop.  Must be &quot;working as intended&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wezloc@themagicianstower>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1189<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 2:57:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  hmm</span><hr size=1> OMG what is it with people attacking me?

Yes I did and he is powerful against these mobs. However the new experience trash in PoP is hitting for the same damage as Zelniak. So yes having epic tank Zelniak was great fun but having him do that against all the mobs i face daily isn't fun. No epic isn't all that powerful now that all the 60+ *EXPERIENCE MOBS* are hitting for 500+.<br>

I won't even go into detail why this makes no sense what so ever, and how it totally goes against your first statement.  Also mages that didn't do epic should not get epic damage for free. Sorry that is how I feel. You didn't do the epic quest like I did so why should you  now have a pet that is equal damage to the epic pet while I still have epic pet damage. Basically you are equal to me now without having put in the work. That is what I have a major problem with.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>However, being level 60 makes them way more raid friendly, which was the big sticking point for all mages.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Again another useless point. Pets are indifferent now so them being lvl 60 means nothing.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>GV pets do fine damage to exp mobs, especially epic pet. Almost no mage was asking for a boost there.

<br>
More missinformation and not stating the truth. I wanted epic pet to hit raid mobs. I quested for this pet because I wanted him to be the main pet in my arsenal. I wanted him to proc against raid mobs. They would make epic pet lvl 60 tomorrow and it would only help those with epic a tad. The new &quot;experience mobs&quot; kick hella ass if you didn't noticed and even if epic was 60 he would still get chewed just like the new pets are. I always wanted epic pet's damage to transfer over to raid mobs. Also we have no idea yet how powerful raid mobs are. We are going to be lvl 65 so mobs could be lvl 75 or more. Something tells me lvl 60 pets are not going to proc on lvl 71 and higher mobs mark my words.<br>
<br>
That aside I have always been nice to you and at one time you were in my guild. To lash out at me with personal attacks because I don't agree with you is rather sad. I just makes me laugh when I see trolls whining about people that they say are whining. Don't you realize how dumb that makes you sound?<br>

I have looked over many parses and logs of my own, and 63 seems to be the magic lvl... so, in PoP it is safe to assume that once you leave lake of ill nightmare and start to adventure in tier 2 and 3 zones... you'll see a big difference between epic and post 60 pets.

Epic Vs 61 Air Pet</span><hr size=1> I'll refrain from rehashing my whole point (and refuting every point in Wez's rebutal) which was clearly laid out.  Enyil really made the big point that I made.  Epic (GV) Vs boss mobs level 65+ don't do nearly as much damage due to level difference.  The new pets should.  If they don't then we'll have something to moan about.  Level 60 has nothing to do with pet indifference, it has to do with pet hitting more, for greater average hit, and its procs landing more against boss mobs.  Therefore, doing more DPS.<br>
<br>
If you have ventured out into the planes you have seen that unless you are a root dotter or can pet kite like no ones business, soloing is gone in the new planes (there are some people quadding in PoD but that is not the norm--to a less extent in PoV--nerfed now it would seem).  Hence, the pets ability to tank is not really needed.<br>
<br>
The final point was most epic mages seemed not to want the new pets to usurp the damage power of the Epic pet, but wanted an upgraded pet that would hit boss mobs better.  The new pets seem to hit that bill.  If you are killing mobs level 45-60 epic is your pet of choice given it overall dps, tanking, and DS.  If you're killing higher level mobs maybe the new pets are what you want.  It would seem that everyone got the best of both worlds. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=xushni>Xushni</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 243<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 5:20:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.t-online.de/home/520013139003-001/pstgif.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duel....

<br>
Wez, you bring attacks on yourself, you have one of the most negative attitudes on the board. You try(and probably think you are) making yourself look good, yet that quote above does nothing but say &quot;Hi! I'm Wezloc, I'd rather piss and moan then take 2 minutes to understand a post&quot;<br>
<br>
The advantage of the level 60 pet is the increased DPS against raid mobs, namely in spell procs from say a water pet, it would also stand to reason that they have slightly high attack and would hit more often(I am not going to say that is fact).  I still use epic pet on Emp Ssra for his proc damage. and I pet those are mostly partially resisted. A level 60 pet would probably get alot more procs in for full damage which could be nice. On bane only fights(emp seru) Proccing weapons can account for a large amount of damage, especially for non bane people.<br>
<br>
I heard of a rogue in anothe guild doing 9k damage or something during seru fight with a burning rapier(pre rod nerf, fight was a bit longer, but probably not much)<br>
<br>
So it seems to me, that the higher level pets(with thier own spells, summon weapons etc) would have a better chance a doing more damage than a lower conning(now light blue epic). <br>
<br>
I don't agree that epic isn't the best pet, It was lot of time invested for a pet that I might stop using and an item I don't equip. I'd love to see the level raised on the epic pet, but doubt it will happen.<br>
<br>
Either way Wez, stop trying to &quot;rip up&quot; post, although you will undoubtedly rip up(or try to) mine. If you disagree with a point of view, why not say it in a some what respecful manner, instead of acting like you are the hot @#%$. Although you probably don't blieve me, you aren't always right. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://namelessorder.com/images/xushni1330.JPG"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=broddathep>Brodda Thep</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 6:52:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duel....

This is too much.  Talk about a rediculous line of thought.  Getting new pets that do more damage than old pets is called progression.  You got the advantage of the pet for a long time where other mages did not.  That is your reward for doing the quest.  <br>
<br>
Just because a warrior did his epic does not mean he should do more damage than another warrior who did not when they are both wielding a BoC and hatebringer.  <br>
<br>
No item in the game should hold its worth forever.  It is time to move on.  Just be glad it has lasted you as long as it did. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jehmgryphonkin>Jehm Gryphonkin</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(11/3/02 10:21:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=792.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://claim.goldrush.com/~kmcclure/jehmicon2.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Duel....

Epic pet would have trouble hitting another pet that was 9-12 levels higher then it is, while the air pet would tear up anything that much lower... seems to me Epic has better DPS, if it can match something it would have that much trouble connecting with. <p>Jehm experiences a mystical transvergence.&lt;BR&gt;<br>

<br>
Its simple, because YOU, yes YOU, the mage with the &quot;orb pet&quot; can have those very same pets as an upgrade too.<br>
<br>
Hello??!?!?! anyone home??  when you make statements like this, what you are truely saying is, &quot;I went thru a lot of trouble to be more uber than other mages, and now we are all on the same level again and I don't feel uber anymore&quot;  <br>

But there is a pattern on this particular thread that is kinda bugging me, besides the act that this got totally off the subject in a few posts.<br>
<br>
Tipareth did you all a favor by posting the results of a fine little battle he had with another person.... This information IS useful in some way..... and almost all of you had nothing good to sy except.. &quot;Can't you do this??&quot; or &quot;Why don't you do this?&quot; or &quot; You should have done this instead...&quot;<br>
Reguardless of how helpful the information is to you.... Most of you didn't know any of it.... and worst of all you aren't saying things like&quot; Man thanks for the info Tip&quot; or &quot;That's c00, if you do it again try this...&quot; or even &quot;Man I think I am going to try MY epic pet VS my friend's Air and see what happens&quot;  <br>
The people that this applies to know who they are.... really should be ashamed and should really appologize..<br>
Thanks for sharing Tip...<br>

I.E. a level 65 mage probably isn't summoning a level 46 pet - correct me if I'm wrong.<br>
