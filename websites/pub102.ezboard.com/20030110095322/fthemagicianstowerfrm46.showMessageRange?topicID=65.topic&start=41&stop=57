How about the ones we have</span><hr size=1> <br>
I am not advocating a great need for a new heal either (although less rarity on the 60 heal would be nice), in fact I put it a few steps below other needed priority spells.  What I am advocating is that chain-summoning does not automatically disqualify us from being able to heal our pets efficiently, like some people here seem to believe, just because we have a 'trick' we can do to replace a mostly dead pet with a fresh one.<br>
<br>
By that same logic a Beastlord should not have pet heals since they already have general purpose heals, and so pet heals are not 'needed'.<br>
<br>
What I am against here is the narrowmindedness.  I'm glad some mages enjoy chaining, great, do your thing.  It is a viable tactic....but it is not the gospel that mages MUST live by, and many prefer not to, instead believing in the way of the 'sustained pet'.  Saying those ones don't deserve a pet heal that can be at least partially as efficient as chaining is biased by thier own preference and has nothing to do with true balance.<br>
<br>
Raz says its a 'bad idea' to allow an efficient heal for pets.  Why? because he is ingrained to chaining.  I can just as easily say that its a 'bad idea' for a mage to be able to chaincast/reclaim pets for zero mana usage and be killing very powerful mobs while doing it, or regaining mana at unheard of rates by exploiting Reclaim.  Its all in the viewpoint, and we all have one.<br>
<br>
But...<br>
<br>
When someone like Raz, who takes it upon himself to be the 'voice' for mages is one of the people showing this bias, mages of the other persuasion feel like he isn't speaking for them...and they are right.<br>
<br>
Raz, if you really want to be that 'voice' you need to be more centered, and not toss away everything that doesn't fit into your picture with a &quot;You didn't prove it&quot; response.  If the 'voice' is too laden with your thumbprint then you are not speaking for all mages, but instead speaking your own opinion.<br>
<br>
See both sides.  <br>
<br>
With 2 weeks until PoP goes gold (CDs are burned) we don't have alot of time to build a consensus of what we need, and for the most part we are spinning our wheels on technicalities and minor issues.  Mages are the one spell casting class that has not had a single change(positive OR negative) to our initial spell line up yet (other then the typo on the 60 charm, and giving us access to the Imbues).  That is worrisome.  Either they are finalized, or they haven't received our feedback amongst the noise.<br>

How about the ones we have</span><hr size=1> Before I go off, it is entirely possible that the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Planes of Power</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> environment will require a pet heal upgrade, and that now is a critical time to ask for <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>that</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->.  It is difficult to decide if one is needed without seeing the zones and mobs.<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Finraziel:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->  What I am advocating is that chain-summoning does not automatically disqualify us from being able to heal our pets efficiently<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->Not quite what I am saying.  There are two different issues here.<br>
<br>
First, has to do with the question, is it <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>necessary</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->?  If there are other options, then an improved pet heal is not necessary.  If mages were prevented from doing something they reasonably ought to be able to do, and no other choice, then need would be clear.<br>
<br>
In this case, what the existance of chaining pets suggests that the magician in fact already has a choice: they can chain another pet instead of healing.  This weakens the necessity argument, because what you are saying is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;I don't like this choice, give me another.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Arguing that you need something because you refuse to solve the problem using your existing capabilities does not make for a very convincing case.<br>
<br>
The second issue is one of balance and over powering.  Currently, chain casting is a viable alternative to sustaining pets, and has various tradeoffs.  Sustaining is faster, safer, but takes more mana.  Chaining take less mana, allows for somewhat stronger opponents, but is slower and much riskier.<br>
<br>
If heals were so good that you could almost always avoid chaining pets, then that would give the most of the benefits of chaining pets, with none of the risk.<br>
<br>
A limitation of the epic pet is that it is designed not to be chained well.  A heal that is a close substitute for chaining would be a strong upgrade to the epic pet, as chaining is a strong technique.  Does the epic pet need to be made stronger?  Probably not, or at least not in that way.<br>
<br>
The evidence is that the existing pet heals are adequate for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Luclin</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> era.  While that may not be the case for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  PoP</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, all the concrete examples given in this and other threads using the existing pet heals has shown them to be adequate to the task at hand, i.e. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Yeldema, Ice Burrowers,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> 4-arms, etc.<br>
<br>
The proponents of a super pet heal have yet to put forward as much as even one concrete example where the existing pet heals fail.  What mobs ought you to be able to solo that you can't because the existing pet heals are too weak?<br>
<br>
Instead mostly what I hear is that some mages want to play <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  &quot;GI Joe&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with their pets, and dress them up with all kinds of expensive gear.  Well you can do that now, and there is a cost versus reward of doing so: when the pet dies, you lose the gear.  Seems balanced to me.<br>
<br>
What are you saying then?  That the reward of giving them gear is outweighed by the costs?  Then maybe you should consider carefully under what circumstances you give more expensive gear to pets.  Like maybe in a group with a healer.<br>
<br>
You also seem to think that I am some kind of rabid chainer.  On the contrary, I chain or sustain as the situation dictates.  I have mules with big chunks of inventory devoted to pet weaponry, mostly gnoll hide lariats and yakeshas.  When do I bring it out?  When the reward is worth the cost.  Unless I am soloing low DPS opponents, I don't use whips.  When I am with a group with a real tank and healer, out come the whips, or, when I get my epic, the yakeshas.<br>
<br>
I already have the option to equip my pet, and the cost is already fair and balanced.<br>
<br>
I see the demands for a super pet heal as little more than a grab for raw power without any compensating cost or risk.  You want more power for less cost and less risk.<br>
<br>
I would rather ask for needed upgrades or fixes, like some solution for the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Wizard-Rod</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> problem, which <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a gaping hole in the current class design for mages.  Which, incidentally, was made most clear to me by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Finraziel</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>

Well it is YOUR opinoin and yours only, you speak only for yourself, as I do for myself.<br>
<br>
What you think is over powered or not is again WHAT YOU THINK but not what I think.<br>
<br>
Many agree with me, many agree with you, but again when posting you speak only for yourself.<br>
<br>
The tone of your posts are almost like your speaking for Verant and saying why you FEEL we shouldn't get a new heal. AND STOP calling it a super pet heal. Again your bias shows with such blantant wording. A super pet heal is a nice way of you convying to others that you thing this concept is way over board, it is not a spell but a super spell with all the implications of such.<br>
<br>
Bias Raz is throughout all your posts (as I am biased in what I believe), though I freely admit I am am biased and think the idea of an IMPROVED (read the word improved and not super) pet heal.<br>
<br>
You disagree, and no matter how many posts say CHAINING is NOT, repeat NOT a viable option if you have the Epic pet because of the recast time of 20 sconds, and the 5 minute timer on making a new orb, you over look with the tired old, well chain the GV series. <br>
<br>
Thank you NO, I did the damn quest. I got the pet, I WANT to use that pet. I want to heal that pet so I can be as effective as possible using that one pet with it's 50 point flame shield. THAT as you may know is the reason it is so good. The flame shield. You chain a pet and you lose the one big UNRESISTABLE benifit of the epic pet.<br>
<br>
You cannot refute that the epic pet's flame damage shield is one of it's best points. While it proc spells they can be resisted, this shield cannot be, and I want that shield up. I want to substain the pet so it stays up.<br>
<br>
That reason and that reason alone is MORE than enough for substaining an epic pet with heals over chaining pet, not to mention armour and buffs on the pet.<br>
<br>
A super heal NO NEVER, NO ONE ASKED for one. A VIABLE heal with no reagant cost. Hell Ya, give it to us. A 2000 point heal for 500 mana is NOT over powered. It is more mana than a new GV pet, and a less hit points than either a GV Earth or Epic pet by over a 1000 to over 2000 hit points.<br>
<br>
Super power pet heal. No. Viable, and usuable. YES.<br>

<br>
You have your opinion, to be sure, but really, where are your <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>arguments</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->?<br>
<br>
I have argued we have other options.  We do.  We have pet heals.  The epic can be chained three times.  Furthermore, just because you have your epic does not prevent you from casting other pets.  You can DS any pet after you cast it.  The options already exist.<br>
<br>
Your counter argument is that you refuse to chain the epic, and refuse to cast any other pet.  You <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>want</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> to heal instead.  Fine.  You want it.<br>
<br>
I have argued that the existing pet heals are adequate, and pointed at the existing mobs that epicked mages can already solo: Yeldema, Ice Burrowers, various 55+ mobs in Luclin.  <br>
<br>
Read <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=6925.topic">How fast can you AA EXP ?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> or <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub6.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessage?topicID=6924.topic">Do we overestimate our high end solo power?</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> for examples of what people already solo with the epic using the existing pet heals.<br>
<br>
In contrast, you simply <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>claim</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> that the existing pet heal is inadequate, with no proof offered other than it is your opinion that it is inadequate.  How?  Why?<br>
<br>
You've failed to provide even one instance where the pet heal fails to allow you to solo a particular mob.  If it is inadequate, you should be able to name numerous examples where it fails.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> If mages can preserve their pets against strong mobs already with the existing heals, then exactly how are those heals inadequate?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Answer that.<br>
<br>
And yes, a 2000 pet heal for 500 mana <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;super pet heal&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>is</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> too good.  It has a better damage to mana ratio than any mage nuke, cannot be resisted, generates no aggro, and would almost always be preferable to a nuke.<br>
<br>
Refering to my earlier model for pet heals, a 2000 HP pet heal for the epic against a 70 DPS mob <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (like those found in Cazic Thule I believe)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> would buy the pet nearly 30 seconds of fighting.  While back-to-back kilo-nukes would close the second gap by a comparable amount, it would generate much more aggro, and would not actually extend the life of the pet.  The advantage of heals over nukes, as demonstrated by <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Goladus</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is that by extending the life of a pet they allow time to cast additional spells.<br>
<br>
So what you are proposing is a heal that is better than every nuke we own or are ever likely to own.  And this for a class whose specialties includes nuking.<br>
<br>
If instead, we extrapolate from the existing pet heals, we get something like this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Level 64ish, costs 500 mana, heals 1200 HP, 8.0 second cast time, 7.5 second recast.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Here is a spell with a 2.4 mana ratio, better than but consistant with our existing heals.  It is smaller than what would be our biggest nuke, just as the existing pet heals are.  It has advantages and disadvantages compared to nukes, and is not always clearly better.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as for speaking for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, here's a hint.  I have found it very useful when arguing in favor of improvements and upgrades for the mage class to try to see things from their point of view.  Much more compelling, I have found, if you can anticipate and counter all the various likely arguments.<br>
<br>
Much more compelling than <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;I want it because I want it and that is reason enough.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>

<br>
I would say this is a <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> argument</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. Might not be what you want to hear but I think Calebe has valid points. Clerics/Druids/Shaman/Paladins are all getting upgraded heals. Necros and Bst are getting upgraded heals. We also know that with every new expansion mob hps increase and dps increases. So with all those things that pretty much says without a doubt we need new heals. Look at the super fast heals that are being given to Paladins and the new uber heals druid/shaman have. Obviously PoP is going to be a expansion where healing for alot and fast is gonna be very important, more so then any other expansion.<br>
<br>
So I guess my question with all that well known evidence how can you argue against a new heal?  <br>
<br>
We need some pet buffs period. Elemental Regens, hp increasers and some new heal over time spells. We are the only pure casting class that can cast a hp regen buff. So healing over time is something we can look to in terms of healing. I think heal over time spells are very good ways to balance healing power. Maybe mages have the best heal over time heals while bst have the best heals and necros have the most mana efficient heals. Dunno but a new heal is needed. I am not saying that I agree with Calebe's heal idea but a new heal is needed. Our nukes are being weakened pretty much. They are not keeping up with mob damage/hps and our role has move more towards a support class with good damage more then a damage dealer with support spells. One end game raids mages for the most part don't do much damage at all. They can do damage but most time they won't. I think increasing our pet utility and group utility overall is in order if our nukes are not gonna keep up with druids/wizards.<br>

Again you state:<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
You have your opinion, to be sure, but really, where are your arguments?<br>
<br>
I have argued we have other options. We do. We have pet heals. The epic can be chained three times. Furthermore, just because you have your epic does not prevent you from casting other pets. You can DS any pet after you cast it. The options already exist.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
How many times do I have to say this. <br>
<br>
1: The damage shield of the Epic is far superior to our castable damage shield. 1 reason you want that pet up.<br>
<br>
2. It takes 20 seconds to chain the epic pet, not 10, not 5. 20 Full seconds and there is no way presently to lower that number. can you chain a 20 second pet, of course you can. The risk though is 20 seconds compaired to 10 and with Quick Summoning 5 seconds. <br>
<br>
Why ever do the epic quest, if you will chain the Greater Vocerate Series as it is WAY more effiecent than using the Epic pet except as cannon fodder, and disposable?<br>
<br>
Again as many know the 60 Water Pet does damage very close to the Epic Pet, if positioned properly in a group.  <br>
<br>
The Epic Pet should be the pet of choice soloing, if a mage solo's, BUT it isn't effiecent to do so if your taking mobs that require chaining pets. <br>
<br>
As for your statement, that you keep saying we have other options. Have I at anytime said we didn't? <br>
<br>
Nope not once. I have argued that we should have MORE options. An improved. NOT a super heal spell.<br>
<br>
I have given what I thought would work. Wez has suggested a heal over time. I would be willing to entertain that idea also, over a direct heal spell.<br>
<br>
The difference between us Raz, if your a closed book. You say. chain pets. Many say, we want a seconds option because of<br>
<br>
1: Time spent summonming amour<br>
2: Stun whips or other weapons given to a pet<br>
3: Paying for a buff to help the pet live longer<br>
4: The INNATE damage shield of the Epic Pet.<br>
<br>
These and other reasons are why I want to substain a pet. Others feel the same way.<br>
<br>
I have pointed these reasons out and you have the audacity to state:<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Much more compelling than &quot;I want it because I want it and that is reason enough.&quot;<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Wrong, and again your bias shows. Many reason and again I stated 4 above is WHY many would want to keep one single pet alive over chaining pets.<br>
<br>
Weather you think it is a valid play style or not doesn't matter at all, as it is VALID to me, and to many others. Again your arguments are biased to your view point.<br>
<br>
It seems those against a pet heal. Weather a direct heal, or a heal over time, will read what people say, and ignore the points that are inconvient.<br>
<br>
I mentioned the 50 point flame shield.<br>
<br>
Raz argues you can cast your own on a new pet.<br>
<br>
33 damage verses 50 point shield. Easy to see which I would prefer.<br>
<br>
2000 point heal for 500 mana, is less than 50% of the hit points of an epic pet, for the same mana cost of summoning a new orb and pet. A very valid point, which you chose to ignore. I never put a casting time (if you failed to notice on this suggestion. However I would suggest it being 10 seconds. The same as a GV series of pets). So in the time it takes to heal 2000 points, you can have a 3500 pet out. <br>
<br>
It is ALSO over 1000 hit points less than a GVE pet and 100 mana more than chaining a new pet.<br>
<br>
Points made, and arguments made.<br>
<br>
As for mobs that I think we would need a new pet heal for, that chain casting won't work on. NONE. Chain casting will work, and is VERY VIABLE. I never argued it wasn't, I only am arguing for a second option. A improved pet heal is a very viable option, or as Wez sugegsted a heal over time, like a celestrial type spell.<br>
<br>
I am in favor of giving magician options on dealing with mobs. An improved heal is one such option. Some reasons I have out lined more than once, so stop saying no reasons were ever given, as that is 100% false. You disgaree with those reasons. Granted, as I disagree with your reasons, also granted, just stop saying no reasons were given. <br>

3 Minutes ago, I just tried to help someone with killing Liuetenant that was pulled to Kael zone line, he owned my Epic.  A better heal wouldve been good in that situation.  I had him down to 40 health, but had to zone.  I was low on health from earlier and I know if I made another pet, the Giant would attacked me first before pet got agro again.  So in that situation, Pet heal wouldve been better.  Oh consequently I logged.<br>

<br>
All hit fast/hard and have 20,000+ hit points.<br>
<br>
A druid can solo the Skels that drop their armour for No read that as 0 mana.<br>
<br>
Free root/snare/epic dot. The skels they kill do not summon. A better heal is needed on these type mobs because if I tried to solo one, they rip even a epic to shreds damn fast. <br>
<br>
Over powered not when another class can kill them for no mana use at all, and YES I have seen a druid do it, but they prefer to spend 35 mana on ensnare, but don't have too, and these mobs drop the 3rd best Druid armour in the game. This is not to say I am asking for a nurf on Druids, but pointing out what other classes can do, and THEY ARE getting serious upgrades. <br>
<br>
They rip through an epic pet in no time flat.<br>
<br>
So for your example. The whole Umbral Planes zone. Where I would heal a pet over chaining any time, as you need that flame shield up as long as possible.<br>
<br>
Also I am sure Raz you know mnay a zone you chain, that if you had a better heal you would use it, and use those Yaks your luggng around KNOWING you would keep th pet up, because you have that second option to heal it.<br>
<br>
This entire thread has deteriarated on a new pet heal. It isn't Prove to Anyone that chaining pets is valuable, and so a better heal is not needed. IT IS many saying, give us that second option to heal our pets with a spell that makes that game style very viable as well.<br>
<br>
People like options, and the more the better. Umbral Planes is a great example where heals would be a blessing if they were made viable, as the experience in that zone is great, and the drops are as well.<br>
<br>
If you haven't checked it out yet Raz, do so. You will I am sure like the experience, but be prepaired to chain pets if you solo, as our current heals won't cut it.<br>

( i keep jboots up in case i have to move quickly and need to click off the horse)<br>
<br>
heres what i do. summon Gvoc:Earth. burnout3/cadue of flames on pet. tagg gnoll with white ceramic band. mob arrives send pet and click burnt wooden staff till mob dies. fight lasts about long enough to get 2 maybe 3 nukes off with BWS. <br>
<br>
repeat for next gnoll. <br>
<br>
ok now 2nd gnoll is dead and my pet is normally at a bub of health or lower. i have regened the mana it takes to summon the pet in the first place. <br>
now my options are heal pet: takes 5 casts of transons to heal the pet. <br>
or summon new pet and rebuff. <br>
<br>
5 casts of transons = ~1200 mana<br>
summon new pet+bo3+cadue = ~545 mana<br>
<br>
why exactly does it cost twice the mana to heal a pet than it does to summon a new one. this is not a combat situation im talking about this is downtime reduction. <br>
<br>
if the heals were even close to the efficieny of summoning a new pet i'd keep one around. but for the cost of 5sp every 2 kills.  i can have nearly double the effective mana per kill. <br>
<br>
shrooms in bw vs gvoc earth bascially 1 pet per shroom. <br>
ive never run across a gvoc pet that walked out of those fights with enough health to be worth healing as opposed to just reclaiming and summoning another. <br>
<br>
the question is what is the point of muzzle and the summon armor series if chaining is supposed to be the end all beat all tactic that we use. the pet heals were introduced before the great pet balance of `02 gvoc+ pets were given more hp but the heals remained the same. its time they were fixed and a new one added for pop. <br>
<br>
This is the same problem that druids had before they were given the 2950/400 mana heal. were not asking for anything even close. it simply isnt practical to heal a 3000+ hp being with a 900hp/400 mana spell. at least we have the option of letting it die and just getting a new one.<br>
<br>
when they first introduced pet heals our heals were 2.0 and 2.2 ratio's our nukes were 1.3 and 1.5 ratios. <br>
with luclin our pet heals stay at the 2.2 ratio. <br>
and our nukes are 2.7 and 3.25 ( char SOFB)<br>
wheres the advancement? sure thier bigger but not more efficient. <br>
<br>
lets look at the future. with the proposed POP spell lists on test, our nukes are now securly in 3rd and dropping into 4th place. were not getting any utility spells other than new focus items and some crap for jewelcrafting. so what the hell is left. Pets. and if the pets are going to make up for the lack of spells we will have then we are going to need to be able to keep them alive. why because while the pets alive it our best offense and defense at the same time. we mearly serve as a means of getting it out there and supplying support to it. and as of the current spell lists were losing the ability to do that effectivly also. <br>

A Pet heal would always be far less efficient than summoning a new pet. However, a Pet heal a) Enables you to keep your current pet up (good for giving proccers to the pet) b) Has no aggro issues (getting summoned) and c) Is a more viable option for the Rain-Heal method we all love.<br>
<br>
Now, I personally would not use a new heal. But I'm a chainer. From my perspective, except in a few circumstances, healing is a folly. However, it is a spell line, and we should have that line continued.<br>
<br>
I propose - 8.0 Casting Time, 7.0 Recast, 1200 Damage healed for 400 mana. Its better than our existing heals, but does not impede on Beastlord heals (they are the masters of pet healing). <p>"History is just a set of lies agreed upon" - Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte

Pet heals increase your tanking power.  They don't necessarily increase your ability to grind a certian number of experience points per hour, but they can, and for those of us who could care less about xps/hour and more about just overcoming different challenges, the pet heals are a great situational tool. <p><center>
