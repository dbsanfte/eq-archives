No one class will always in every zone be dominant over every other.  It shouldnt be that way, how fun and balanced would EQ be if that were the case?  Chanters have great use in BOT and other zones and are virtually useless in others.  Our benefits on raids are minimal and we are basically just buffers.  <br>
<br>
 Chanters are balanced when u think about it.  Yeah we currently get pets who do 500 damage, then the next day we are almost useless for damage, its give and take.  Right now people see the take side but arent thinking of the rest of the time we have our hands in our pockets watching everyone else have all the fun <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=puzzler011>Puzzler011</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 6:19:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=122>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: charm</span><hr size=1> Horzanarshom, you sir are have no clue what your talking about again play the class before you open your trap, if any pc has decent MR at all the chanter can......well lets go through it shall we, 1) rapture, unless of course your not ebayed and have any general knowledge of pvp your foe puts a low dot on him/herself and that takes care of any mezzing you'll be doing 2) strip your buffs: fair enough i know how much that hurts, losing those buffs really makes you look for the nearest zone line huh lol (or tash if you like casting that first) 3) tash another great spell, your hurting now huh 4) root resisted 5) dd resisted 6) chanter begins to get the crap kicked out of him 7) repeat steps 1 through 6 if you live that long. <br>

It just breaks my heart that your Beastlord was able to solo to level what 58-60 with little effort, you sir have no idea what your talking about when it comes to pvp and playing a chanter otherwise you wouldn't be on this board claiming we are a good pvp class if we &quot;know what we're doing&quot; . chanters have been smacked by the nurf stick more then any other class in EQ.<br>
<br>
You want the chanter class to be buff hoes, and have to group to get exp, which is what most of us had to do till what level 55+, get a grip, seems to me the whining award goes to the Mages here after reading all the threads. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1544<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 6:25:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=123>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sebminas.com/eq/baby.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> No offense, but really who cares about PvP?

Lots of classes suck in pvp. Mages are easily one of the worst pvp classes, probably worse than enchanters.

<br>
Let me try to break a few more thoughts down here.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>First</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, someone said I didn’t offer any suggestions. (Are we reading the same thread? I’m tryin to come up with ideas here, perhaps you skimmed past that?)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Second</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, Balanz, I’m sorry we fail to amuse you any longer. I’ll hack off a pinky and mail it to you if that’ll amuse you more. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Third</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, someone said that I’m just here because my Wife is an Enchanter and I only want to stop her from being Nerfed. Not true.. I’m speaking on the Enchanter issue because I’m more familiar with their cause than I am with Shaman or Wizard issues. Period. (Ok, well there might be a SLIGHT bias because it upsets my wife when people start screaming Nerf without giving any glimpse that there’s compromise that can be reached..)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fourth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, I killed some Mini-Bosses last night in Plane of Storms for some BoT keys for people. The tank during our first fight in the Forest was a huge frog. There was no CH chain and they told the Warriors to just try and look pretty while avoiding agro. That was kind of sad and I can see how that’s a slap in the face. They just said “Someone heal the frog every so often.”<br>
<br>
I’ve seen Verant tune content to preserve spells forever. (Quad kiting and AoE groups come to mind.)<br>
<br>
It still seems unfair for them to make Charm worthless as a fix for the current problem. I definitely think certain areas (Like that Boss in Bastion of thunder where you can get to them with invis and use the portal as an instant escape) need to be tuned in general, and not just based on Charm.<br>
<br>
With that said.. I like the ideas some people have had of reducing the effectiveness of a charmed mob. Lower it’s regen. Lower its damage output. Heck, lower its health. (Although I could see that being used to soften up a mob, then break charm and get an easy kill.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Fifth</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, for you potty mouths out there (Enchanters and Mages alike.) the words A-hole and moron are BOTH wrong and should BOTH be reprimanded. Let’s try to fight kindly here.<br>

<br>
Most of the enchanters that have come posting here are just slandering and throwing personal insults and attacks in.  Then they don't make any valid claims.<br>
<br>
Death is not a valid claim<br>
<br>
Graveyards and massive exp pretty much make up for a death (without rez) even 20-30 mins easily while solo.<br>
<br>
You have no chance to lose your corpse.<br>
<br>
How willing would you be to go take on a room full of named if you have to run back there and get your corpse from under their nose?  Not bloody likely I'd wager.<br>
<br>
So what if you die?  You start back with full mana just get your gear back on in a few mins and go at it again.  Rez?  Well then you have to wait what...5 mins of medding w/mana regen to get all your mana back?<br>
<br>
In POP, if you die you die.  Just wait at the GY and wait for your corpse to spawn, loot it then be on your way.<br>
<br>
Other zones you have to go get your corpse yourself.  I don't see chanters going into places like Howling Stones solo and doing the same tactics there.  Why not?<br>
<br>
Because they know for sure that if they die, they'd have to get back in there and try to get to their corpse again...which ain't easy to do in that place alone.  Been there, done that (I zoned in with another mage, neither of us knowing that the zone-in was unsafe and after 3 cr attempts I got my items and successfully gated out).<br>
<br>
Risk vs reward?  There is no risk in POP, only that you'll fail and will get another chance as soon as your corpse is back.<br>
<br>
And I'm also one of the people who is 'jealous' of the amount of EXP that can be earned per hour with this thing.  I am having to plan out what AA points I am going to spend on because it'll be a while before I get enough to spend on something else big again.<br>
<br>
1 AA in 20 mins, i'd just fill up everything possible.  And i'm sure that they are too.  So yes, I think its crap that other people have to sit lfg for hours, hoping to group with other people that are good players and won't end up getting you killed every time a mob is pulled, while chanters are running around farming AA like its plat.<br>
<br>
No one class should be able to hit 65 then have /GOD MODE ON<br>
<br>
Multiplayer game with different classes and skills, they should have to work together more the higher one gets.<br>
Not become totally independent.<br>

<br>
One good suggestion is to include a slow component of 50% or so in the charm. (Or Atk debuff, or anything that will cut dps down to approx rogue level). A chanter will never replace a rogue in the 'damage dealer' spot then since there will still be all the problems inherant from having a 500 dps bomb ready to explode on the group at any moment.<br>
<br>
The other suggestion I think reasonable is to add a recast time to CoD; say 5 mins. To me this gets charm back to what I believe was the original intent - to temporarily turn the tide of battle, one mob against its former allies (but what do I know about that). 500 dps against you turned to 500 dps for you is a 1000 dps swing after all, that's still a HUGE ability when you think about it.<br>
<br>
DC I think *is* well balanced in PoP. Noonie said it well when she said that she could practically go afk when being beaten on by one of those light blue things. I recall they have been parsed at 50dps or so, meaning you could be beaten on for a minute without really breaking sweat, hardly unreasonable in the least. And if the chanter dies or goes ld or the pet dies, it's gone; there usually isnt a pet available in camp. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1545<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 6:54:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=127>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sebminas.com/eq/baby.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
BTW just so you know, verant pretty much killed aoe groups, much like i warned the wizards on graffes that they would do over a year ago. I suggested that directly nerfing the potential amount of targets a pbae spell could hit, would make verant more accepting to the idea of pbae grouping and therefore them less likely to nerf it in the future. No one saw things my way, all they saw was &quot;omg you want to nerfz uz!&quot;. In hindsight if they had only directly nerfed the ability so that its potential could be hard capped, pbae grouping probably would be an option today.<br>
<br>
What vi did to aoe type groups was the effective equivilant of never making a cod spell in the first place. Wizards and mages got no new pbaoe spells and pbaoe in pop for decent exp is pretty much not a realistic possibility. Basically, it would be like verant trying to solve the charm problem by removing the spell line all together. Cant say thats a better fix than just limiting charm potential, can you?<br>
<br>
Nerfing charm directly so there is a hard coded restriction on what you can do with it, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will be better for everyone</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> in the long run.<br>

You even said it yourself. Charm pets are starting to be used as mas for raids, which trivializes so many roles (aka NERFS countless players main source of contribution), it really is disgusting. I cant believe you honestly think avoiding hurting a handful of enchanters feelings is a valid reason to completely nerf all melees and all tanks, as well as trivialize damage dealing of all types. What about the feelings of the warrior who logs on, joins a guild raid, only to see 3 enchanters maing? What about the rogue who stands there doing nothing because getting in melee range = death? Enchanters have OTHER stuff to do on raids, even if theres no cc (there usually is) they still can whip up an animation and nuke, which is easily ~80 dps. Melee dd's and tanks just <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>do nothing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> because of charm.<br>
<br>

Hurting Enchanters in general is WRONG. I don't care who it is. A tune or nerf to this skill should be able to be done while keeping the game fun. Removing the spell altogether would hurt them.

Or how about CoD not being as good on a mob that hits for a mere 180?  Or again, the fact that the chanter probably dies quickly and has one heck of a time getting corpse back?<br>
<br>
Decent EXP compared to what?  Before POP, I would duo mage/cleric (55, 53) in KC or VL and it would take literally hours to gain any exp.  Due to people KSing, all camps being taken, etc etc.  A lot of wasted time and not much exp was gained.  I killed giants in BW for 3 levels solo (taking hours on end) and it still took forever, but it was considered &quot;good exp&quot; because I was making about 1 blue per hour doing it.<br>
<br>
Now POP is out and all of a sudden 1 yellow per hour is &quot;good exp&quot; (may be exaggerating here but its way more than 1 blue).<br>
<br>
So you say that at 64 everything else is crap EXP but maybe its just that POP is so much better than everything else, it raises to bar too high?<br>
<br>
Anyways, you won't see the chanter risk going deep into HS because its not worth it.  And it shouldn't be worth it to solo in PoV, BoT, etc, etc, either.<br>

Firstly don't knock Wizards.  I feel that pre 60, they are the most shat on class in EQ.  When levelling all my chars 1-50, I always see wizards lfg and no one wants to pick them up because all they do is damage.  At lower-mid levels, people want group buffs and mana regen and haste, etc, but the wizard gives none of this.  The wizard is seen as a waste of space pretty much.<br>
<br>
Don't get me started on druids.  They get everything and always have.  I can't tell you about them.<br>
<br>
Pallys are almost in the same boat as wizards.  Until higher levels, they are passed up in favor of rangers, warriors, sks (fd), just about everything.  So they can solo in what...one zone?  I'd say thats a fair trade (not).  To get shafted for how many levels so you can solo in one zone?  I doubt many solo there anyways.<br>
<br>
Shaman I don't have a real good answer for you.  Since about lvl 44 shaman are great at soloing because of slow.  I see them grouping more than not in POP and don't know any lvl 62+ shamans really well and I don't think any of them solo so I don't know what to tell you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>

<br>
Who cares about rez?  Killing solo for 1 hour more than makes up for EXP lost.  In fact unless you lose your level, it would hinder you because you would lose all of your mana and have to regen it.  And if it takes you 10-15 mins to buff up, well I don't know what to say about that other than maybe you need to spend 15-20 mins organizing your spell book.  Unless after casting a buff you have a 1 min recast time?<br>

I will knock wizards and druids and Paladins because they have been ubalanced in terms of experience gain since forever, you cant argue it because you know im right.  When you see a druid with C3 kiting 4 mobs in CS, and getting what was AT THE TIME insane experience, did Chanters bitch?  When Wizards were quading Raptors in TD did Chanters bitch?  Was this balanced experience?  Paladins sky rocketed in Luclin in FG in ability points over almost every class because they were getting 1 point every couple hours, was that balanced?  <br>

So your inconvienced 20-30 minutes per death. Assuming your not dying every other minute, thats a very very very very minimal risk to Charm. <br>
<br>
Spend 30 minutes getting a rez, rebuffing up, and spend the next hour gaining 3 AAXP. Big risk there ..... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Like everyone said its not CoD thats the issue, its the way PoP was set up. Not saying that PoP was set up porly, probably the best expansion in EQ. But it was set up without any foresight. (Like the majority of EQ)<br>
<br>
We know that Verant hates working more than it needs to, so instead of retuning mobs and encounters that trivialize the Risk Vs. Reward of CoD, more than likely they will nerf CoD itseld.<br>
<br>
Hate to see it go that way, but I betcha it will go down like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1546<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 7:57:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=134>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.sebminas.com/eq/baby.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: However...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>There you go again..

-you admit that charm pets are being used as mas.<br>
-you understand that this has the side affect of elminating several pc characters main roles.<br>
-you fail to recognize (admit) charm is broken.<br>
<br>
That is an illogical, irrational conclusion you are drawing and i think you know it. <br>
<br>
Now if you admit that the conlusion reached from your observations is this spell line is broken, and that the enchanters charm tool <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>must</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be changed, you would not be saying something irrational.<br>
<br>
What you are saying is equivilant of this:<br>
-My friend stole a car.<br>
-My friends actions have the side effect of hurting the feelings of the family who owns the car. However, admitting he should do whats right and probably give the car back and turn himself into the police hurts my friends feelings, too.<br>
-My conclusion about this situation is that my friend should keep what he stole, even though the strangers have <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>rightful claim</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the car.  <br>
My friends feelings are more important to me than whats right, and how other people feel. Therefore i think this situation should be remedied by the family buying a new car, or them accepting that they no longer will have a car, despite the fact that is grossly inconvienant and illogical. It is not an acceptable solution for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anything</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> bad to happen to my friend and &quot;his&quot; car, even though he is the problematic party.<br>
<br>
Do you see the parity between your pov, and the ficticious example? Just like the guy stole the car, so are enchanters in essence stealing roles they have no right to claim. Enchanters arent mas, they arent damage dealers, yet they are stealing these roles from other players with their broken charm tool, and you are supporting this theft because someone you like plays an enchanter. You expect verant to nerf pop, nerf everything else, just dont nerf charm. Its completely ridiculous.<br>
You are making an illogical, irrational conclusion by not supporting the appropriating of charm, despite the fact you admit to recognizing the potential it has to ruin the game for so many other classes, all <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>because</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of your personal feelings. If you cant see that as illogical and irrational i cant help you.<br>
<br>
Now if you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>support</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> changes being made to the charm line, what im saying isnt relevant. However, judging from your tone in previous posts, it seems apparent to me at least that you ...<br>
a) fully understand charm is currently trivializing several classes, and has the potential to ruin the game for many players<br>
b) still do not want it changed because your wife plays an enchanter and that would hurt her feelings.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now correct me if im wrong, but this is your position on this issue as i can see it, and it is irrational. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 1/9/03 8:00:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izelin>Izelin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 7:58:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=135>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: .</span><hr size=1> In all honesty I expect a nerf.

Then why Didn't you charm mobs at the time and go solo them? Because it wasn't worth it at the time with pets that only hit for 150. Because it wasn't worth the risk of dying if you died there., trying to get your corpse back.

<br>
Hmm, I'm going to have to say yes to this, that it was balanced. Remember when SoE was going to nerf slay undead? Remember the resounding cry from multiple class boards saying that it wasn't unbalanced and that SoE was stupid in even thinking of nerfing it? Doesn't sound like many others share your view on this subject.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the DPS issue of pets:<br>
<br>
Just look at the thread on the monk board about mage pets. People cry for them to be nerfed when they're dealing 75dps. Do you Honestly think that people won't be complaining, that people will see your way when your pets are doing 7-12 times that damage? trust me, it's not just mages that find CoD unblanaced. It seems enchanters are the only class that doesn't see it that way.<br>
<br>
Comparing CoD to Manaburn which some enchanter did earlier.<br>
<br>
Zero risk? what if one of them is off time? what if one of them lags, Oh no, a mean dragon is comming to beat them in within an inch of there life and wallah, they die. I know many wizards that died Manaburning these Kunark Dragons. While the risk was very minimal, it was there, just as the risk is very minimal with CoD.<br>
<br>
How many classes whines for Manaburn to be nerfed? Alot, all except wizards. Was manaburn a great ability? undoubtably so. Did people cry for a nerf when the ability first came out? no. But when the wizards abused manaburn, killing kunark dragons with it, people from all around norrath called for a nerf and were outraged by it.<br>
<br>
The same holds true for CoD almost completely, only guess what? I addition to being able to farm mobs that groups/raids were suppossed to do, you can use this for xping also. Of course people are going to call for a nerf for this. It's more powerful than manaburn ever was and we all know how many threads on every board was started over manaburn being overpowered.<br>
<br>
Abuse your power and people will want it taken away.<br>
<br>
My guess is that if enchanters would have never solo'd those BoT named, no one would have called for a nerf. You have those enchanters that abused the spell to blame for people wanting it nerfed.<br>

I'll quote from my first post today where I think you are missing the point completely. I'll even restate it in more obvious words in case I'm being unclear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>With that said.. I like the ideas some people have had of reducing the effectiveness of a charmed mob. Lower it’s regen. Lower its damage output. Heck, lower its health. (Although I could see that being used to soften up a mob, then break charm and get an easy kill.)<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
These are the words of someone that thinks something should be done about Charm. Did you miss that? You are acting like you did.<br>
<br>
I'll restate it in simpler terms (Not that I think I need to, you seem fairly smart.)<br>
<br>
- I'm against Nerfing or making Charm unviable.<br>
<br>
- I'm against MANY of the uneducated opinions and knee jerk reactions of people that scream &quot;Nerf it&quot; without any basis for their complaints.<br>
<br>
- I agree Command of Druzzil is overpowering in it's current form. (Perhaps that's the part you didn't understand in my first post today.)<br>
<br>
- I think the ideas of lowering the overall power of charmed mobs is the best all around solution.<br>
<br>
You are STILL trying to paint a clouded picture here:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>-you admit that charm pets are being used as mas.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There's nothing to &quot;Admit&quot; here... I shared an experience I had last night with you good folks. I'm one to admit when I'm wrong or misinformed, for sure... I think that's a good quality in people. But you are insinuating that I knew all along or something.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>-you understand that this has the side affect of elminating several pc characters main roles.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This statement is true.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>-you fail to recognize (admit) charm is broken.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This statement is again, misleading and false.<br>
<br>
- I'm not trying to:<br>
<br>
A: Lie to anyone.<br>
B: Convince anyone of anything misleading or otherwise false.<br>
C: Act irrationaly.<br>
<br>
I'm getting rather offended that you keep insinuating that I'm doing any of these.<br>

<br>
However almost every post before that pretty much gave the impression that you were firmly against nerfing enchanters (directly appropriating the charm skill) and that you believed its balanced. Here are a few more direct statements you made: <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I’m so furious at the very IDEA that anyone would use the “N” word for Enchanters about this that it makes me want to puke. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Here's my view on things:<br>
- Nerfing is the worst thing you can ask to do to a class.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><br>
At level 64 an Enchanter can charm something that allows them to do MASSIVE damage. Cool.<br>
<br>
There's risk involved, and she can't outdamage 3 of ANY class. In burst output you can find Wizards and Mages do just fine. Charm doesn't eclipse those by any means.<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Charm isn't going to make anyone obsolete.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Surely you would see where one would get confused. Before you said you were:<br>
-against nerfs<br>
-believed risk keeps charm balanced, and <br>
-that enchanters are not making any classes obsolete <br>
<br>
However in your post just now you claim that you have seen the opposite in action, and that you even support ways to nerf the charm ability so that this wouldnt happen. Since you never really openly aknowledge you changed your view point that youve had through out the rest of this thread except for that 1 recent post, i hope you could understand where i would get confused. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=noonievioletskies>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 1/9/03 8:26:30 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=lordgojirax>LordGojirax</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#333333>(1/9/03 8:28:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=443.topic&index=140>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojhead.jpg width=98 height=126></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Enchanters Overpowered ?</span><hr size=1> I'm still against nerfing. Perhaps it's the word itself. I consider nerfs to be the removal or obsolescence of a spell or item.<br>
<br>
Tuning is what (Since day one) I'm in favor of.<br>
<br>
Nerf to me means to make something harmless. (Such as turn something into a Nerf ball.. harmless and fluffy.)<br>
<br>
To tune something means to bring it more in line with &quot;The Vision&quot; of game merchanics.<br>
<br>
I've always stated that I want things tuned. And I still wanna puke when I hear someone say &quot;Nerf&quot;.<br>
<br>
I also agree that I didn't understand the magnitude of the harm that CoD does to PoP encounters in general.<br>
<br>
The other argument I don't find too compelling is the &quot;They get an AA every 20 minutes!&quot;... there are so many classes that can Quad/AE and do special things. (I can't go mow down Fungus grove free of risk for instance.) I don't complain about those things, so I'm not gonna complain about Chanters getting fast exp.<br>
<br>
It does sound like some difference of opinion (But less than we started with for sure.) and some misunderstanding. The written word is a horrible form of communication, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
No worries. Take care,<br>
