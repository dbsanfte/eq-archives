  We have focus items but then again so did other items in the game and now those are sought out to buy and the mage now has another self only buff &lt;so to speak&gt;. <br>
  What can be done to mage a mage better? I am level 35 and right now my pet cant hold his own on my side, still need to nuke alot and lots of down time medding back up. I know the pets do get better but what about the midlevel mage when are pet dies and we already beat the mob past the half way point shouldn't we have something to help us out in that part?<br>
    Here is a thought. all casters but us have some form of surviving a mob if thier pet dies. ie necro fear,root, fiegn death. others have the same mez, charm ect. point is what does the mage have? I would like to see something like this but instead of just a spell why not put it in a summoned item that all could use. We are the masters of summoning and of all the items we can summon nobody wants them, but if we could sommon a ring that has say 1 or two charges of fiegn death or snare &lt;something useful to survival&gt;. I don't think that would be too out balanced.<br>
   well thats just one mage's view is this askin to much  I figure seeing they started with focus items lets go all the way and  try new things.<br>

1)You ran OOM. In this case other spells would be meaningless anyway, as you wouldn't be able to use them.<br>
<br>
2)You are fighting a mob far to tough for you. You should have gated or ran immediately.<br>
<br>
3)You were chain-casting pets. In this case, the pet dieing is more-or-less expected and desired (unless it died prematurely due to lag or other timing issues).<br>
<br>
4)You weren't paying attention to your pet. It is dead because you screwed up. You should have either healed it or started summoning a new one to replace it before it died.<br>

Is that caster balance? You say I screwed up? should have healed pet &lt;did and do&gt; chain casting pets &lt; not a big fan of it yet&gt; gate/run to zone? that is my point WHY!!!  What you are saying is mages are only to be dependent on are pets? why is it wrong for a mage to want to be challenged on a good fight? At my level the DD nukes are about 8 levels old &lt;not complaining&gt;  but this is about balance. when a necro's pet dies he still has an option to: a) fiegn death then cast new pet<br>
 b) fear it and nuke/ cast new pet<br>
c) run to zone<br>
same with other classes they all have options. as you put it, the mage should run/gate when pet dies. Pet dies mage dies no option here. This is my point we have only one option and thats to run like a little school girl getting picked on by the bully. I understand we are not a fighting class but we should be able to have  some kind of defence to help us out if pet dies. Not always are we oom and have to run if that was the case then yes run but when you still have half manna and you have the mob down to 3/4 health and pet dies the fight shouldn't be over  a nice root/ snare would be great at that point just enough time to get out another pet or maybe that one last nuke to send him running is all I am saying. Options let us have more options.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimaginos9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Imaginos9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 587<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/02 5:20:00 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: has anything realy been balanced for the mage?</span><hr size=1> You have a very good point there I think. ALL other casters have more then one escape method except mages....well 2 if you count run for zone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Its a long and tired list but others can mez, fear, root, stun, harmshield, divine aura, feign death, darkness, blind, charm, shadowstep, rune, gate, etc..and of course run<br>
<br>
Mages gate or run. Thats it. Our pets really should be able to take a little more damage then they currently can. They were fine in the old world but don't scale up with mobs post kunark.<br>
<br>
What that means to you is you will nuke harder, have more downtime or chaincast and have more downtime because you will need more pets.  You will not get ANY mana regen till level 56.<br>
<br>
That is the mage life.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

10 seconds to cast a pet is just inappropriate. <p><img src=http://a5.cpimg.com/image/AD/05/10888365-0078-00E1011E-.jpg"border=0"<br>

   I do like the idea of a  faster casting pet time. Should be a 3 second cast for any pet not 10 seconds. Even useing the ring its still 8.5 seconds and you can take a major beatin in that time and will still be interupted.If they think a faster casting time is not fair what about having it that you never get interupted while casting a pet? Can still be the slow 10 second casting but if you survive the beatin you will have a pet to help out and we didn't have to not run/gate to zone.<br>
    You say pets at 39 can duel wield without weapons? does this mean that weapons have no more effect on max damage at 39? or if I do give a 39 and up pet weapons he will hit harder still?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uimaginos9.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Imaginos9</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 588<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/02 7:57:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=267.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Just wait</span><hr size=1> if I recall correctly the regen is 30 hp a tick.

<br>
They need more HP. They used to take less damage but with the change over to &quot;pet&quot; the stats were lowered on the pets, hence they don't dodge as much nor do they proc weapons as much.  Verant at one time stated they would look into it and then did nothing, as was their policy back then.<br>
<br>
A faster cast time would help. Mages have also been asking for a &quot;travel pet&quot; for some time now.  Kind of like the decoy at various levels. Trying to channel a 10 second spell while having the stuffing beat out of you is a losing proposition. Better to try and get gate off.<br>
<br>
The problem with the decoy pet is that it doesn't taunt worth crap, its aoe taunt is broken, it takes way too long to refresh and cast this pet.<br>
<br>
At 39 you will like your pet better. At 49 you will be king of the old world and a few other places...then its kinda down hill from there  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

But the question is, how do they scale the pets to a HP level where the pets can keep up with the expansion mobs, without allowing mages to completely own the old world?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
This is a non issue. 50+ spells and expansion gear totally obliterate anything in the Old World already. And since Manaburn with which wizzies can annihilate any kunark era mob we can safely assume Verant doesn't give a crap either.<br>
<br>
Try walking around in LGuk with a lvl 57 earth or epic pet. You can pretty much wipe the zone solo without too much hassle. And we're not the only ones, any self-respecting knight, monk, shammie, necro or even warrior could do the same (not with a pet, but you know what I mean <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>

As it is I can find very few areas at level 57 in the Old World where mobs are actually dark blue.  Even the dark blue mobs are easy to take down (well not counting mobs in KK and such).  Increasing the hp/strength etc. of pets wouldn't change much if anything in the Old World but is a necessity in the new zones IMHO. <p><img src=http://a5.cpimg.com/image/AD/05/10888365-0078-00E1011E-.jpg"border=0"<br>
