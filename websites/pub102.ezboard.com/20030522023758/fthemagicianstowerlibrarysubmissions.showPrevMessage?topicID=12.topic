go to south karana and join the treant group if u want cash or go join a spire group outside splitpaw if u dont want bad faction with druids P<br>
lvl 29 to 34<br>
stay in sk and solo tesch mas gnolls all the way till 34, these guys will occasionally drop a gnoll hide lariat which u should keep for your pet the stun proc will really help at later lvls. if u think the xp is too slow try going inside paw and join the safe room group just dont pull the caster gnolls behind the double doors.<br>
lvl 34 to 39 (bad faction)<br>
go to the barbarian village in west karana and solo ulrich or get another caster partner and alternate between ulrich and einhorst who spawns in the hut near the river. Warning this should only be done at around lvl 37 or else u will need 1 more person.<br>
lvl 39 to 44 (bad faction)<br>
stay in wk and solo einhorst<br>
lvl 34 to 46+ (good faction)<br>
go to the corrupt guard tower beside the barb village and hunt guard donlan and mccluskey. at 34 u will need to be in a group of 3 or 4, at 39 u will need a partner and at 44 just solo both. these guys drop guard bracers which u should give to the captain at the top of the stone bridge in north karana. at 44 i think, both guards wont give anymore xp but doing the guard bracer quest still will. when i say 46+, it all depends on your patience some ppl can reach 50 just by doing this quest.<br>
lvl 49+<br>
solo seafuries in OOT i think until they stop giving xp or just go on plane raids ) theres a chance where u might get the awesome apothic armour and elemental staff of masterery earth <br>

I can solo them but for a long time I needed help breaking the spawn. I was told that a level 40 mage can't break the spawn because we have no snare or mez or whatever. If both guards are up wehn you get there and you try to pull one you're going to get them both. Well being told I CAN'T do something kinda piqued my interest. I've been successful breaking teh spawn now like 3 or 4 times. It's a pain but you can do it with JBoots. Here's how:<br>
<br>
Med full, water pet up and armed, Burnout pet, and flameshield him. Med full is important. Target Donlan (he stands closest to the door while McCluskey spawns more towards the rear of the chamber). Back off really far while keeping Donlan LoS. Fire a Cinder Bolt at Donlan at the MAX range of Cinder bolt. Fire one more as he's running at you and then tell pet to attack. Your pet is gonna die. If both guards are on him hit Donlan with a Blaze. If either guard is running at you, take off EAST so you have a lot of room to run. (I run along the water cause I know where the zone line to NK is.) Donlan should die but if not then it's only gonna take one Blaze to kill him. Run for about 20 RL seconds then stop and hit Blaze. It SHOULD say &quot;Target out of range...&quot; so keep hitting it till it goes off. It will land as the guard gets to within mellee range so be ready to run again INSTANTLY. Finish Donlan if necessary then run McCluskey really far... head back towards Donlan so you can loot him (yeah I'm greedy). Loot and run... McCluskey will kill you and you are petless. Run all the way back to Barbarian village. You should now have time to either cast another pet or med just a little... watch for that guard. Using the entire length of this zone you can kill both guards. Yes, I discovered precisely how pathetic I am at kiting. Because we can't slow them down we have to run them for awful distances. You have to run really long with JBoots to get enough distance to get a cast off. 20 to 25 seconds RL time to get out of range. I don't even bother to turn around to face them... just hammer Blaze till it goes off. Then run again right away. You practically have to run the guards from one end of the zone to the other to have enough time to recast a pet. It's a nasty, lengthy, clunky process, but next time someone says a level 40 Mage can't break this spawn, I'll show them it CAN be done. It just ain't pretty. Oh... this usually has the added benefit of spacing out the guard spawn nicely so you can med up to kill Donlan (this is why I kill him FIRST) cause he's pretty easy to kill. Now you should have time to med to full for McCluskey. (You'll need it. He's tough)<br>

Never tried to do it that way.  I killed corrupt guards for a bit and found it was quite good exp.  There are two additional ways to break the spawn as well.<br>
<br>
1.  If you are patient just sit at the tower and every so often McClusky will take a walk.  He is gone for about 5 minutes and then will return.  When he leaves wait a bit and kill Donolan.<br>
<br>
2.  If you are not patient just bribe a druid to harmonize them for you and you are all set.<br>

Turning around to face somethign while kiting is just novice.  THE way to kite is to have a quick casting spell up.  As you run continue to hit this spell until it finally says you are Out of Range.  Then stop, count to 1 (sometimes you aren't truely stopped) and then keep hitting your DD until the Mob runs into range.  As soon as the MoB is hit you begin running again.  Start with Blaze as your main DD but some MoBs are fast enough to run up to you before this spell gets off -- if so just repeat using the 176 dmg Shock spell.  <br>
<br>
Using a quick casting spell to figure out when you have gone past the maximum DD range will minimize the time it takes to kite something.   <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Another nice feature of Kiting...  (Not sure how well this works without a snared target because I've never tried it and don't usually need it these days)... killing something even when you run out of mana.   If you run out of mana and still need a blast or two to kill something you can try this: You will need to have some damage done to you to time it right.   Pull up your inventory screen and wait until you see your HP go up. Immediately start counting and when you hit 5 sit down.  When you see your mana bar go up stand up, run and count to 5 again.   I've been able to meditate a full bubble of mana with my druid using this method.  With a magician you might have to count to 11 (skip a tick) to make sure you have enough distance to do this.   <p> <br>

<br>
But watch out. He is one tough mob, and unless you can hit him with a malise, he's going to resist everything you throw at him. <br>
<br>
I used to use earth pet + flame shield, and cast malise/heal till a malise stuck, then nuke away. Half the time I finished him easily with pet at 50% health. The other half I got my a** kicked so badly it was funny. He varies a lot, so now I take the safer route by chain healing (level 8 and level 20 spells alternating). I survive a lot better, though sometimes he gets my pet dangerously low. <p><html>
