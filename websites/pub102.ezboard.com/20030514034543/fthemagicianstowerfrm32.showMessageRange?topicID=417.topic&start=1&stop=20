Especially after having visited the Safehouse a few times, I thought I'd like hear the opinions of the other classes who rightly or not feel they should be the masters of damage.<br>
<br>
First, I guess I should clarify who exactly I feel is a damage class.  I see there being 2 ranks of damage dealer, those who specialize in damage, and a less damaging, though more utilitarian rank behind the heavy hitters.  I see each rank as being 3 classes, as there are 6 spots in a group, and to be equal, there needs to be 2 to 3 viable possibilities for each spot.  I see the following as the spots in a well constructed group, and believe that each should be balanced with the others in their position:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Heavy Hitters:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Wizards<br>
Magicians<br>
Rogues<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Healers:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Clerics<br>
Shaman<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Second String Damage/Utility:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Monks<br>
Beastlords<br>
Rangers<br>
Necromancers<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Tanks:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Warriors<br>
Paladins<br>
Shadowknights<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Crowd Control:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Bards<br>
Enchanters<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Buffs/Debuffs:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Many of the classes fall back on this, and more probably should.  All of the second string damage classes should have a significant contribution here, with the probable exception of monks, who provide their second role as pullers and secondary tanks, though that has changed since the recent downgrades of monk defense—they are kind of hard to place now.  I don’t feel that any class should primarily be a buffing class however, as it’s generally not much fun in and of itself.  Some classes are too powerful here, considering their power in another primary grouping role.  Debuffs I fit in here too, as they should improve the performance by allowing spells to land better, making the mob easier to hit, etc.  <br>
<br>
Now on to my ideas of Damage Balance.<br>
<br>
It’s my belief that the top 3 damage classes should do the same DPS when equally leveled and equipped.  This means that when a group says ‘we need a damage dealer’ they look for these classes first, with the second rank being considered if one of their utility roles are also lacking or would help the party function.<br>
<br>
As this relates to Rogues, Wizards and Mages, I have this vision.  Fights that favor neither Spell Damage, nor melee damage should see them on equal footing.  Fights that favor melee damage, either through extreme hitpoints, spell immunities, extreme resists, or spells/effects that prevent casting should favor rogues somewhat, with Mages being reduced, and Wizards lagging behind.  Obviously, the reverse situation is true if the mob favors casting damage through low Hitpoints, High AC, very low resists, or effects that hamper melee such as Slow or Attack Debuffs.  Mages, as they do both melee through pets, and cast spells should rarely find themselves completely disadvantaged, though in many cases they will find they are not optimal either, except in cases where elementals are the preferred tanks due to the nature of the mob, the mob hits extremely fast or can’t be slowed bringing the DS to the fore, etc...<br>
<br>
To balance this, there needs to be a balance of both the extreme damage capability of the classes, and their somewhat limited utility to a group.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Rogues.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Even if you equally balance the damage a rogue can do with a  wizard or a magician, there is no question they will, as all melee, lag in utility—and be less desireable in a group than virtually anyone because of it.<br>
Poisons and their Skills are the answer.<br>
<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Sneak/Hide</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- this could be made more valuable if there was a short term, fairly reusable AA to allow the user to be undetected by even see-invis mobs.  Thus, their scouting ability is improved<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Detect Traps</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- This ability should be constant once in use like Sneak, slowing the movement rate of the rogue, and giving Tracking style updates with each tick, possibly even causing a small particle effect to highlight any detected traps.<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Disarm Traps</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- this should come in 3 stages.  Early on, it acts similar to hide, so that a detected trap is off so long as a rogue is near and unmoving, holding the trap deactivated till the party passes, and a few seconds after he lets go (think trap only mez, based on the skill, with skill dependant memblur).  As a later upgrade, the rogue should himself be immune to detected traps, passing them freely, enhancing his scouting role. As the final upgrade, the immunity should be granted to all nearby groupmates, allowing skilled parties to bypass the traps all together.<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Poisons</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- The problem with poisons is that they are extreme effort to little reward propositions.  Offering a small selection of poisons on vendors at decent prices would help.  Secondly, not all poisons should be on weapons.  I could suggest a narcotic, which acts as a harmony on a right click potion style item, to aid the rogue in pulling- this would be more worth the effort involved in most poisons.  I’d also suggest poisons that emphasize the rogues stealth skills, like a Mob equipable item that has 30% slow or snare that forces the rogue to sneak up behind the mob and give it to him, or an item that is –200hp equipable only by mobs, with stronger versions being usable in more slots with a cap of say 1000hp for multiple ‘doses’.  Again, think of the time, money, and effort required to master this rogue unique skill, and find a way to implement it so that it reinforces the idea of stealthy guy instead of walking flechette cannon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Mages</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
While dealing damage is great, certain utility is demanded of a casting class, and I feel, Mages seriously lack in this department, while being slightly overpowered in damage output—relatively.  While I believe that Firebolt of Tallon should properly be about a 1600 damage spell with a 4’ish damage ratio to be properly balanced against the high level wizard spells, there are many schools of thought on the damage issue.<br>
<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Summons</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- For a class based on their ability to summon items, mages sure got the shaft.  No summoned items, in general, are worth the time it takes to memorize the spell.  The Weightless bags, and Focus items being the exceptions.  Other than these, anything else the mage can summon is generally available at vendors all over norrath, reducing the utility value from what could have been tremendous, to nearly nil.  And then there’s the pets, which do rock, but a few other classes’ pets come very close to the power, if not the variety of the elementals, which I think could be tolerated a bit more if the other summonses weren’t so useless.  <br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Bane Weapons</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- it would be nice if a spell could be quested for at least the high level Seru/Shissar bane weapons only equipable by pets.  Also, melee equippable weapons with Vampyre bane, elemental bane, and possibly humanoid bane with decent level appropriate ratios could also be quested spells—not the ratio of fine steel for our post Luclin casters please.<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Ranged Weapons</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- one of the few items actually requested of mages, and while a low level conjure might be a throwing knife or shuriken, High level mages should be able to summon:Frisbee(stack of long range, low damage pulling tool),and Summon:Mage Bolt (Short Range, Good Damage arrows), possibly with +range skill % to improve accuracy over store bought items, perhaps the extra damage could work as + magic/fire bane style damage, so it could be resisted.<br>
<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Summoned Items as Buffs</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->- Summoned cloth armor with flowing thought values equivalent to the clarity line (equivalent in function, if not value), Summoned Fungus item with fungal regrowth on it, Summoned items with ATTK buffs on it, items with +75 to selected resists to match the buffs of other classes.  Things that people will ask for if grouped with a mage, the days where cold stones, water stones and rings of flight are the only useful summons should have been dead in Kunark.<br>
Some ideas could be new spells, others would probably be best if the appropriate spells were simply upgraded, but the mage summoned items need serious reconsideration.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Wizards</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I believe that wizards are the most balanced of the Heavy Hitters at the moment, since with Evac, Stun and Snare they suffer less from lack of utility than either Rogues or Magicians.  What they do lack, that EVERY other class has, is infinitely sustainable damage of some kind, unless you count Xuzl.  Perhaps the greatest lack the wizard has is of the EQ’s community opinion that wizards make poor groupies because of a lack of contribution to a group effort.  I offer 2 suggestions to correct this situation:<br>
<br>
--<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Recharge Nukes</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->-A large inefficient nuke, that over 30 seconds returns the mana spent on it as a recourse effect.  The DPS on this nuke should be 75% of the low-end damage that the pets provide to the Mages, with critical blasts bringing it in line with the 75% DPS of the high end pets on average.  This would give us our sustainable damage, with the ability to bring our burst damage to bear as needed.  Since it’s magical damage and limited by resists and magic immune mobs, Mages remain on the Melee/Magic edge, Rogues rule melee, and Wizards rule pure magic.<br>
-- <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>A Group usable buff</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> that adds Elemental Procs and Bane damage to the melee.  Also, in line with Wizard abilities it would be nice if Wizards could cast a ‘critical buff’  that would add/increase the chances of critical strikes and blast—preferably a high enough amount to be easily noticeable by those under it’s effects, around 15 to 20%.<br>
<br>
<br>
As an end note on my views of the balance of damage output.  Necromancers should probably replace Wizards or Mages on some fights in the ranks of the heavy hitters, especially those fights that last a long time, or where Fire/Magic resist is high, and Disease/Poison is not. <br>
<br>
Also, I have no problem with AM3 rangers outdamaging everyone for a short time based on their skills, though I do take a slight bit offense at this being without danger or cost to the ranger.  Having very low agro on archery is the reason it was made useless for most levels in the first place, as it was non-mana limited, ranged damage, and thus deemed too low a risk for it to be a viable damage tool.  I would suggest that the extreme damage arrows that make the huge DPS numbers possible be flagged as Magic Items, and that Endless Quiver work only on Non-magic arrows, thus they don’t stick a single ICBM on the bow, outdamage god and everyone else with it at low/no risk, then put It away till the next time.  This is a bit exaggerated, I know, but there should be more cost to being on top of the damage heap.<br>

Game balance as it stands is fine. Some classes are whining about one thing or another, but the fact of the matter is that all classes have their niche and are expected to fill it. Complaining about your niche just makes you look bad. <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>

<br>
My question is did you take into account the way PoP affected classes within this area?  For example, Necromancer.  We lost alot of the secondary utility that we once possed before PoP due to lack of upgrades, level limitations upon spells and the intensity of mobs in PoP.<br>
<br>
The days of Necromancers using ST (necro mez) as CC or acting as a healing (pact line) are over in PoP.  The level cap upon ST is too low for PoP and mobs hit in one attack for more damage then I can heal in 24 seconds.<br>
<br>
Our ability to debuff the mob is well below that of either of the real debuffing classes (Shamans, Chanters) and our ability to lower resistance is limited to Fire, Poison and Disease and is below that which Mages and Shaman can low all resists (but disease for Mages).<br>
<br>
What utility I do have left can generally be replaced by just about any other class.  Shamans and Chanters can slow better.  Chanters can CC or charm better.  All healers, and in some situations even Hybrid melees, are vastly superior healers.<br>
<br>
In PoP I am not sought after for my utility abilities, instead I have become one that can sustain pretty high damage output.  With a Rogue pet, Toxin, Lich and a some fast acting DoTs I have become a very good sustained damage dealer.<br>
<br>
Plus I think your bulking types of damage up into one category and neglecting that there are different types of damage.  Wizards have always been strong as &quot;burst&quot; types of damage, while weak at sustained damage.  Necromancers have been weak at &quot;burst&quot; damage but much stronger at sustained damage.<br>

<br>
I have reams of ideas about Necromancers, and where they should stand on that ladder.  I originally put them in with crowd controllers, but I realize that for that to happen, tons of upgrades would need to be implemented.  In the original document I wrote these up in, I had alot of notes about changes to necromancers to make them fit a Damage/utility role much better than they do, but I took them back out as my intention was to address my thoughts on the heavy hitters, not necromancers.<br>
<br>
1. I feel that the spells Boon of the Garou and the new Scarecrow illusion are clearly necromancer themed spells, and should be at least shared, if not unique to the necromancer class.<br>
<br>
2. I feel that the Necromancer should rate as a viable back up healer.  Coral Empathy should have it's mana cost reduced to no more than 15 to be in line with the other Necromancer healing spells, and that upgrades that do up to 1000 points of transfer should be available for instant healing, and large heal-over-time spells that require the use of the lifetap drains to survive should exist.<br>
<br>
3. I believe that the Screaming Terror line of spells should be expanded into a full mez line of spells based on fear.  I believe it should effect mobs that are immune to mez, but be useless against mobs that are immune to fear-- with appropriate re-tuneing of some zones so that this would make sence.  This would create a choice based on situation on who you want doing your crowd control.<br>
<br>
4. I believe that at the very least, a series of Lifetap Proc buffs should be implemented for Necromancers to cast on their groupmates, it's sick that enchanters can do this and necromancers cannot.  I further believe that spells like Mark of Karn, and Mark of Retribution fall squarely within the Necromancers concept, and should be at least shared, if not unique to the necromancer.  Lastly, why  are Necromancers the only Int caster with self-only damage sheilds--while Banshee aura and any possible upgrades should not challenge Mage or Druid DS, it should be an option for those groups without another DS caster.<br>
<br>

<br>
I didnt forget about the different types of damage Burst /vs Sustained, I just dont feel that necromancers need to be on the top rung, unless the mob has exceptionally high hitpoints, with decent pet hittable AC so that the necromancer strengths, like the rogue strengths are highlighted.  With lower DPS pets, Necromancers should not be matching a mage in a heavy damaging catagory like this, unless mana becomes an issue like them 1 million hp mobs in vellious.  <br>
<br>
It's my view that the strength of the Necromancer class is it's flexability, similar to the Druid class in that respect.  The difference is that while druids were able to help a group, necromancers got nothing till Luclin that we could share in an otherwise social game.  Many of the spells we got before level 20 would have been great for a melee, but they were never upgraded and are useless once a Necromancer stops meleeing.  I am sure the Shadowknights enjoyed the self only DS, lifetaps, Lifetap proc buff, and melee debuff dots, but of those, only the dots were of assistance to a group, and people see them as slow damage, not a debuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
As to soloing--I can't help that Rogues can't solo, but in no way should that mean that they need to completely outdamage everyone all of the time.  Being able to solo is an effect of a simple game mechanic--be able to do significant damage to the enemy while taking minimal damage to yourself.  This is what casters are all about- tremendous damage at range.  Rogues are tremendous melee damage, and they made that choice at character creation.  Possibly the only thing that could help them solo would be if poisons for snare and fear were implemented, or one that allowed them to proc a long lasting stun--but if you can solo melee a mob solo without taking damage, something is dreadfully wrong.  A second way to balance this factor would be to make caster mobs weak in melee and strong on range damage, then a rogue that could theoreticaly keep the mob from casting could solo it, but this would require game and AI changes that would be alot of work.  As such, it's probably not going to happen.  For a look at good AI on ranged mobs, look at Blizzard games-- get close to an archer or caster, and they will try to fight for a few seconds at close range, maybe, but then they try to get some distance before resuming their ranged attacks, which are as powerfull if not more so than any melee attack.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Why not just put in &quot;Summon: Vex Thall Key&quot; and throw it on a vendor for 25pp?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Now here's a statement that was un-called for.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps this was in reference to the summon pet only Seru/Shissar bane weapons.  How would this instantly get everyone into Vex-Thall?  If the quest is as hard as getting the weapons themselves, and only usable by pets, most guilds arn't going to bother with it... and certainly it's not going to short circut the Emp and Seru kills in such a way as to allow one mage to do get this spell and jump his guild through massive pet zerging to Vex Thall.  If it's reference to actual usefull summons that people will want....<br>
<br>
If you feel that any summons that a mage gets except for pets should be trivial junk not worth the time it takes to memorize, I'd guess that is a valid oppinion, though it wouldn't be mine.  With the resist changes recently, it's hard, unless you have extremely good gear, to get your resists to a point where you can reliably resist mob spells, and your casters should be able to help with this--VI feels the same, elsewise every other casting class would not get spells to enhance resists.  I've always felt that the weapon summons should have been upgraded with the expansions to match the new ratio's of weapons that drop commonly, and I find it tragic that mages summon armor for every class but their own by level 40.  I feel that cloth armor with caster usefull effects like flowing thought would make up for the personal mana regen lost by the t-rod nerf, would benefit all by stacking with Clarity, the Spiritual line, and bards, and it's the rare very rare caster with higher than FT8--there's the boots and Shawl for 6?  I'm sure your above average guys could sqeeze another 2 from somewhere.  I also find it silly that a Post 50 summoner looks foward to finally conjuring Beer.  Store bought items are fine for low level summons, but the high ones should be special and unique to the mage class-- as in something people are actually going to ask for.  As I said, the days of the only usefull mage summonings being coldstone, Ring of Flight, and Waterstone should have died in Kunark.<br>

<br>
That was not what I meant by sustained damage.  &quot;Sustained damage&quot; is not limited to mobs with a zillion HPs, it is the ability to achieve a constant damage output for extended periods of time.  Wether that is against some boss mob or a four hour xp grind in CoD makes no difference.<br>

<br>
SoE would have to do some serious work to actually make Necromancers really a support/utility class again.  Personally I doubt they ever will, unless it is aimed directly at undead.  I think SoE has finally accepted that being a third rate healer/mez'er is not going to work and has changed our direction once again back to damage dealing.<br>
<br>
Well enough of the Necromancer chat.<br>

The fact is we are all different classes and we have different purposes.

Not nitpicking, just pointing out they already have this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  it's called Shroud of stealth, level 63 PoP AA and is a perminant upgrade to hide/invis.

<br>
anyway, I like most of the ideas, but I only like summoning stuff if they make it targetable. otherwise, it's just a huge pain if they give us too many good summons.<br>
<br>
But I don't feel it's unbalanced for us to have a few levels of summon FT ring or something, especially if that ring has no stats, or just AC.<br>
<br>
Target summoning and new summons would be an awesome improvement to our class and would be a nice utility to have to define our role a bit more, as long as it doesn't take away our damage potential. (Ie, nothing to summon mid fight, and no nuke/pet power tradeoffs.)<br>

<br>
Most Necromancers are pretty happy about our new Roles as Damage dealers.<br>
<br>
- A level 60 pet was a God send.<br>
<br>
- Neurotoxin is nice (Hits 1512 max with damage Focus IV.), but the mana is a bit high on that sucker. Crittable though, so I'm happy.<br>
<br>
- Our undead slow was upgaded to 70% slow. We can take the place of a Shaman for slowing versus undead.<br>
<br>
- I don't have our undead single target mez, but it supposedly works up to level 59.. I can't wait.<br>
<br>
- I run a 61 Necro and a 59 Cleric 2box setup. When fighting Undead Vassals in Plane of Valor I can use Zevfeers Theft of Vitae in conjunction with Celestial heal on our 61+ tank and resort to clicky pants for heals otherwise once I slow them. That heal tap works wonders. (Its our only viable heal though, I'd like to see an upgrade.)<br>
<br>
- Wake the dead seems to be a real show stopper as well, can't wait for that one.<br>
<br>
Things I would add:<br>
<br>
- Lower the mana cost on Neurotoxin.<br>
- AE Undead mez.<br>
- We have group taps for Str, Stamina, AC, ATK, Health.. give us a stackable group tap that acts as a 10-15% slow on the mob and gives 10-15% haste to our group. Let it stack with Shaman slow and chanter haste.<br>
- Targetable Banshee Aura, stackable with other DS's.<br>
- Targetable Lich (YOU lose the health for mana mister!)<br>
- Let lich stack with C3/4.<br>
- Upgraded group health taps.<br>
- Let the stat taps hit pets too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<br>
I have no problem at all with archery being casting class damage, so long as they suffer similar penalties.  Rangers do suffer low hitpoints, though not as low as ours.  They do suffer from lack of AC, though not as low as ours.  If not for Endless Quiver, those 14 damage arrows would be pretty dang limited in supply.<br>
<br>
To do the damage that outdamages high level casters with all of their spells however takes a High End bow, High End fletched arrows, and at least archery mastery.  Endless quiver helps greatly as they don't burn up the arrows required to sustain this damage---but this is the flaw in that setup.  If they had to pay the pp for the arrows, and used them up, it would be a whole new ball game, and a trick reserved for big fights and Wowing the crowd.<br>
<br>
<br>
And Bril, back to Necro talk.<br>
<br>
Necromancers, nor any pet class, have ever had a problem with sustaining damage output.  The difficulty lies in sustaining an exceptional damage output.  If you look at my second string/utility classes, they all excell at putting out good damage over any length of time you care to measure.  In the case of the necromancer, due to the efficency and high damage of dots over long periods of time on one target, they actually start to eclipse those classes that do Large damage.  Of course, this ability is negated in most fights that don't last longer than 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
Due to the Flexability of Necromancers other abilities, I don't believe they should be on that top rung all the time.  I do believe that their utility abilities need to be brought back into line, and expanded a significant amount to make them group friendly at all levels, in a variety of situations.  I see the cornerstone of that utility being crowd control, if only they would expand what they have already given necromancers to be more universally usable.  Back up healing is also powerfull, though with the way a Necromancer's spells work, too dangerous in hazardous areas to use to the degree I propose.<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry, but classes must be grouped in some way.  There are only 6 spots in a group.  There are 15 classes.  Each class has a primary ability, and it needs to be a group function, which means some grouping must occur.  I choose to do this in 5 main catagories, as it's easiest to divide the classes evenly that way, and BuffBot isn't something I want anyone to have to do ALL the time.  Nearly all classes have some fall back ability they can use, for many buffs is it.  The only class I have a really hard time putting somewhere is monks.  If I it Truely was up to me to design the classes, rogues would drop to that Secondary Damage area, and Monks would move up, but that would assume there are many locked doors, traps, and need for pickpockets in the game world-- as in the utility they have would be meaningful.  So, until 15 man grouping is implemented in game with content to match, I'm afraid we are all going to have to fit into a 6 slot box.  Wanting Rogues to wear silk and have Fewer HP would be kinda like saying casters can wear chain, have a few hundred extra HP, but have to be in melee range to cast...have fun with that.<br>
<br>
Nothing I have suggested is wholesale revamping of EQ.  Somethings, like Rogue skills and some bard songs, have been broken since release, either through poor implementation, design, or coding. Other things just never scaled with the expansions, like caster spells, for instance, mage summons.  Somethings, until recently didn't scale with levels in proportion to others with the same jobs, like the Healers.  All I propose is a simple scheme of where each class belongs in an average, functioning xp group, and such changes as to make them good choices for that spot, as well as making the back up option also attractive to a group.  Done correctly, this will translate to raids, as a raid need the same basic things a group needs, only to a much greater degree.  So long as the back up abilities are varied and usefull, all will have a role when it comes time to squish the big winged lizard of choice. <p><br>

<br>
Myself, I love it and so do most the Necromancers I know but then I am in a primary raiding guild.  I would much rather be a steady high sustained damage dealer then a third rate utility class.  There just is not call for such a class, espically in PoP.  You are not really going to do much without a serious healer or Mez'ing class.<br>
<br>
The change is kind of like what Mages have gone thru.  SoE steped up the temp of the game with PoP, along with some classes that were starting to fall behind.  We lose some utility and some solo options but in return we gained alot of damage output in groups.  <br>
<br>
Lets face it, unless SoE was willing to upgrade Necromancer healing to near Druid/Shaman level and seriously improve our mez ability (heck, we only had ONE mez spell to begin with...) then that utility was going to become extinct anyways.  It was already starting to towards the later end of Luclin.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>- Let the stat taps hit pets too.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Actually I wish all group and AE buffs worked upon pets.  They are after all affected by all adverse AE attacks, so it is only fair that pets should get the benefit of AE buffs aswell.  SoE once mentioned that they were looking into this but it appears to have fallen to the side.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Let's not fall prey to the illusion that VI is listening and cares.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I think that is a pretty closeminded opinion.  SoE has made some very drastic changes to the game based purily upon player input.  Considering they continue to claim that EQ I will remain as long as there is a player base for it and the rumors of yet another expansion, I am pretty sure that SoE is listening they just may not answer or not give an answer you wish to hear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Necromancers, nor any pet class, have ever had a problem with sustaining damage output.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Your forgetting that Necromancers until very recently had very weak DD ability (below that of Chanters and Clerics) and your average group made DoTs mana ineffectient because they would hardly reach their full duration.    <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Of course, this ability is negated in most fights that don't last longer than 2 minutes.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Correct. Unless the fight was long enough to allow for DoT stacking, DD has always been a better means of damage.  A lack of DD has always been a weakness in the Necromancer class until recently.  Not to mention the imbalanced power between DD and DoTs.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Due to the Flexability of Necromancers other abilities, I don't believe they should be on that top rung all the time.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I am not saying they belong in your top rung either, what I am saying is you can not group classes like that because they excel at different types of damage.  A Wizard excels at burst damage but are pretty weak are sustained damage.  <br>
<br>
Your attempting to draw parallels that can not be made.  Wizards should be the undisputed masters of quick damage but not the masters of all types of damage.  Your trying to mix types into one category.<br>

<br>
You can't group classes.  We are NOT the same.  Blind grouping of classes like you suggested is how things get out of balance in the first place.<br>
<br>
Those underpowered but with more utility getting brought up would make the equal damage with no drawback for having other abilities.<br>
<br>
Those Overpowered and brought down that have no utility suddenly have no tradeoff for having no abilities.<br>
<br>
YOU HAVE to look at the big picture.  Sorry, don't group people.  Verant/Sony has spent like 3 years figuring that out. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

<br>
I really think different &quot;Nuking&quot; classes should excel at their type of fight.<br>
<br>
Necromancers should do Wizard level nuking damage against undead. (Banish undead line should eclipse other forms of nukes.)<br>
<br>
Mages should do Wizard level nuking damage against elemental/summoned. (Banish summoned should eclipse all Mage nukes.)<br>
<br>
Wizards should do massive damage against Dragon/Giant based. (Their bane spells should eclipse their other nukes.)<br>
<br>
Each class though should have one area where they are masters. It would balance out if the content was more geared that way.<br>
<br>
As it stands.. Banish summoned sucks, Dragon's/Giant's Bane sucks (Or at least it's so rare that I don't see Wizards using it.) and Banish undead sucks.<br>
<br>
I don't mean banishment either.. that's not a real nuke <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.jackntracie.com/images/gojirax.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wezloc@themagicianstower>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1349<br> <font color=#333333>(12/17/02 10:10:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=417.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   hmmmmmmm</span><hr size=1> Just a small thing on archery. The aa that they gave to rangers was very horribly thought out. Rangers should not be able to do greater then rogue damage with a bow with zero aggro. To me that is a problem when a ranger is out damaging me with a bow and arrow for no mana cost and with no aggro. It is very unfair, and I am not afraid at all to say it needs to be nerfed. If the damage isn't nerfed the aggro issue needs to be fixed. <br>
<br>
As far as rangers having few hps that is more bs. Top end rangers are hitting 5k unbuffed hps just like all the other top end melee. Also they can get higher then that with self buffs.<br>

People will always whine about other people...greed/envy, gotta love it.<br>
<br>
On to the issue though. Guys, you're  comparing a ranger's bow damage with our nukes...but using TS as your base. The reuse on that is an 1+hours. Added into that equation is the LOS issues, the same issues we thought &quot;were severely limiting FoT&quot; when wizards were complaining are simply tossed aside when we yell at another class. Arrows don't hit there marks often on raids. Xp groups they do, yes, but how many classes use there dics regularly in XP groups? Most I know save them for emergencies (if they come up)<br>
<br>
When doing class comparisons, it's imperitive you look at everything. Ask a ranger how often his/her arrows hit and for how much, WITHOUT trueshot. Yes, they might outdamage you sometimes, but we outdamage them sometimes too. <br>
<br>
Classes will be balanced in the mind of verant (except for druids, because well...yea) What good is inviting an interclass flame war going to do besides get everyone angry and calling for more nerfs. just drop it =P <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=25288">Hobie Wan</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Perhaps you want to go back to LFG for hours because the group wants a rogue for damage, but I certainly don't.  I never got a group based on being able to stun, once for evac, never for snare, never for Teleports and never because I could drop a few K damage in a few seconds.  I don't recall ever having invited a Mage into a group based on his 'leet summonses either.  In both cases, just as with the rogue, We were invited for damage.  In the days when there was only one true Damage King, the prince need not apply for pick-up groups, except in uncommon situations--especially right after kunark was released and everyone+their brother made rogue twinks, at least those not working on their Iksar Monks.  Vellious and the billion HP mobs didn't help much either.  I suggest you go back and read some of the old threads on this very board discussing those issues back then.<br>
<br>
Hobie wan, I'm with you.  There's nothing inherently wrong with the improved ranger damage, certainly I have no problem with it's performance under the Trueshot dicipline, as that is an extremly limited use.  My single problem is with the effect of endless quiver combined with High end archery--making it nearly aggro free, cost free damage.  With Spellcasting Mastery and full Specialization, that's what? 20% mana savings?  I'd be fine if endless quiver had a 20% chance to not use the arrow.  Those High End arrows are expensive to produce, take a high fletching skill and hunted components.  If they had to constantly replenish this supply, that would be fine. <p><br>
