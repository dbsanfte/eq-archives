<br>
Unbuffed Normal Pet=100% (meaning 100% of normal speed)<br>
<br>
BOIV+MM=65% haste(?, all I know is cast on pet every 15 minutes)<br>
<br>
FBO=99% haste<br>
<br>
Which would result in 264% (100% normal speed, 164% haste).<br>
<br>
Even at that assume a 50dps unbuffed normal pet, adding in BOIV+FBO you'd end up with 132 dps for 36 seconds or 4752 total pet dmg in that 36 seconds (which is still low for the time investment of the aaxp's).  Only a little more than than 1/3 (1/3 would be 88% haste, and I really don't feel like crunching numbers) of the total pet dmg in that 36 seconds would be attributed to FBO, which would still be less than 1700dmg attributed to FBO.  Least that would make it useable.<br>
<br>
Of course if your using a normal pet (gvoc) then your pet probably won't be at 50dps?  Which would lower all the numbers.  They could even let epics haste stack and it would be close to worth the effort.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be tooo much to ask them to let BO and FBO to stack, since FBO is not much of a haste improvement over ABOV+mm. (assuming ABOV&gt;BOIV, can't speak from experience there).<br>
<br>
Again putting an AoE explosion at the end could result in massive agro towards the mage, is that really what you want?<br>
<br>
Putting a single target explotion (while a much safer idea) can have the same result.  Any adds that have not been mez'ed (beit unmezzable or lack of chanter) will see you doing that dmg to the target and will have a huge tendency to jump off the MA and onto a petless mage (see the effects of CH with adds, then add in that your ac cannot compare to that of a cleric, we don't have root, stun, etc,).  Even if there were no adds to potentially jump all over you, you would still be taking a huge risk of gaining too much agro.  You would be losing your ONLY defence, the explotion is uneeded and unwanted IMO.  If pet xplodes you have to resummon another one, which means FBO costs you mana, and as such should do ALOT more dmg then it does, however if it did that dmg through an explotion the agro goes to you and your gonna be FM right after your finished loading.<br>
<br>
I'll agree that on paper FBO looks like crap, but why address VI with an unfinished thought?  Your pushing them away.  We should however discuss our thoughts on how VI could improve FBO to make it a worthwhile skill, then have either Ronaldo or a board moderator send the results of that discussion to VI.  Any fix anyone can come up with is incomplete without discussion, it needs hashed, rehashed and hashed again with input from the community and obviously a reasonable solution could be formed for &quot;the better of the mage class&quot; not the better of any particular mage.  Then and only then would it be a complete thought, worthy enough to demand the attention of VI staff.  <br>
<br>
If we (as a class) want it fix'ed, we need to come to a single solution which is comparable yet modest for the amount of time invested in aaxp.  If theres 20-30 different view points on what would really be &quot;cool&quot; it would take VI staff alot longer to work out the best solution.  Also VI staff cannot take one voice as the thought of an entire class.  I admit I like the thought behind the initial poster, but I really think it needs refined, as that would still leave FBO lacking-vs-time invested, before it is addressed to VI staff. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uathao.showPublicProfile?language=EN>athao</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 81<br> <font color=#333333>(9/9/02 5:50:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FB math - numbers speculation - Also for don't address V</span><hr size=1> FBO needs to be fixed.  It is an AA skill that was given to us many months ago with the release of SoL...and it is STILL broken.<br>
<br>
It has NEVER worked as intended.  It is absolutely NOT worth the AA points....<br>
<br>
There is no need to compare our AA's to other classes.  Look at it on its own.  It is one of the few class defining AA's we were given and it is useless.  IT should do something noticeable at least to make it worth the AA points people have earned to get it.<br>
<br>
Stuff like this, that VI will not talk about, is really frustrating.  They could at least acknowledge it is not working and let us know if they are working on it or not.  Or if they don't want us to have a higher damage AA skill they should remove it as an option and give people back the AA points they wasted on it.... <p><font color=Green><b><a

<br>
I'd do it this way though:<br>
<br>
Base pet=100% haste<br>
Base pet + muzzle + BO4 = 100+9+65= 174% haste<br>
<br>
Then have FBO modify that current haste with 99% haste<br>
<br>
174 *1.99= 346% haste<br>
<br>
Let's say on the average ubermob epic DPS is around 45-50dps with muzzle and BO4. In a normal 6 ticks (36 seconds), that would be 1,800 damage on the high end. If FBO stacked, you'd essentially double the damage just due to doubling the effective haste. That would  about 3,600 damage with 1,800 approximately attributable to FBO.<br>
<br>
I forget whether FBO has an ATK buff as well (I seem to recall it does). If so, you might be closer to 4,000 damage over that 36 second period with about 2,200 attributable to FBO then. <br>
<br>
Add in flurry (forget that damn rampage component) and you could get to the 3K incremental damage mark for FBO and NEAR 5K overall for pet damage output in that same period. I'd say that's acceptable, useful and worthwhile in my eyes.<br>
<br>
If by some miracle you had ancient: BO5, in this scenario you'd get around another 10% lift on top of that (376% haste vs. 346% with BO4). Heh, but no one on my server has BO5 or probably will for several months. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><table width=100%><tr><td width=33%><font color=blue><i><b>Master Svenuce Summonstuff</b></i></font><br>

<br>
The current haste cap is 100% at level 60.  The only way to get past this is with the monk discipline 100 fist, and bard song haste that stacks with all and goes beyond the haste cap.<br>
<br>
So theoretically, if they made the buff frenzied burnout act like a bard song it could stack the haste on top of the currents haste... but that may be complicated because the masters haste wouldnt be so high.  Maybe they can work around that by making FB effect the owner too /shrug.<br>
<br>
And Goladus, I understand entirely what you mean.  However, this is unfortunately a game of balance.  If what you say were true, there would have never been class balancing of any kind.  That is why it is suitable to compare class abilities to each other.  Luckily not all games will be like this, such as star wars galaxies where you can be a bar tender for your class =P. <p><A HREF="http://shade.austin2600.org"><img src="http://shade.austin2600.org/gtt2aow.jpg"> </a><p>

An extra 1500 damage every 90 mins is an increase in average dps of 0.27. Regen 1 will still give an increase in dps of 4*0.33 = 1.32. To have a class ability that is worse than a general 1 point ability means, that it is very irrational to take the Frenzied Burnout.<br>
<br>
Suggestion is still that it could take a large chunk of mana, and should increase avrg dps with a few percent.<br>
<br>
instead of a fixed duration, it could cost 50 mana a second (300 a tic), and could be renamed: Manabournout =).<br>
<br>
The cost of mana should be multiplied with aprox 4, and added to the pets increased dam output.<br>
<br>
The alternative to this is that it is smarter not to take it, and spend points/save them for later expansions.<br>

<br>
700 extra damage over 36 seconds is not class defining (Remember this is a class AAXP skill), and requires a lot of work to acquire.<br>
<br>
The amount of extra damage is not worth it.<br>
<br>
As I stated earlier Spell Casting Mastery allows a critical hit of OVER 700 extra damage.<br>
<br>
Our focus item allows our Shock of Firery Blades to go from 1005 to 1200. 200 extra damage if it maxes. Stack that bracer with SCF 3 and 2200 hit are possible.<br>
<br>
1200 extra damage, and it is easier to get that much more damage for far few AAXP points than Frenzied Burnout. Also wizards and even Druids can get Spell Casting Fury.<br>
<br>
As class skills are ahrder to reach, and should be what you strive for, it makes no sense that the damage output from the top skill/spell you can add to our pet is only 700 additional damage over 36 seconds.<br>
<br>
I am sure Verant would agree with this, and will fix this,but we as a community have got to get behind the push to get it fixed.<br>
<br>
I posted in another thread and will post the question here.<br>
<br>
I feel that Frenzied Burnout should do 3500-4000 more damage over 36 seconds than a regular pet should do.<br>
<br>
That damage range s less than ManaBurn, and about the same as Lifeburn.<br>
<br>
What do you think it should do?<br>

The skill obvsiously has problems, we do not need to create fake ones to illustrate that point.  Right off the bat you already have that it simply does not do some of what it says.  Then you also have that it may not be as useful as you hoped, but there is no need to make foolish comparisons and such.  <br>

FB is one of the few things to help in the short term damage increase.  I agree with him too that it still pretty much sucks.   A 72 min reuse really doesn't help too much for XPing, and for bosses it really doesn't even dent them.<br>
<br>
But it is effective for that short term boost.  And I do often try to help my group get the kill, and honestly 700 damage at the end of the fight does often mean the difference between getting it or not for that fight.<br>
<br>
Does this make it useful though?  No.   <br>
<br>
The idea of FB stacking on a pet is a good one though.  If we could cast FB every 20 mins or so and it lasted for 15 mins and added 20% haste on the pet no matter what other haste he had on already that wouldn't be too bad.   The strength and AC and rest of the stats are just icing.  But really 72 mins doesn't make sense for this. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 2223<br> <font color=#333333>(9/11/02 5:11:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://doug.feldmann.com/Sigurd.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FB math - numbers speculation - Also for Rick Waters</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> With a reliable 36-second expiration date, I'm clicking my new orb after sixteen seconds, or starting the new spell at twenty-six seconds.<br>

Additionally, if you are soloing, there is a short period of great risk when the pet is dead.  It's easy to get summoned mid-chain and lose your pet and shortly after, the fight.<br>

If all we are doing is comparing abilities, it pretty much boils down to a question of whether or not players will want to spend points on the ability.  <br>
<br>
If we are talking about class <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> balance</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, then it's very important to look at how the ability will affect the big picture.  If the argument is simply that Manaburn deals 4k-20k in 6 seconds therefore FB needs to be better then you are not seeing the whole picture.  Again, the original poster had a good idea using mana as the basis for comparison and his conclusions aren't necessarily bad, the problem is that his justification (the initial comparison to mental clarity) lacks perspective.<br>

That would directly improve the dps of any pet, and depending on the amount and frequency of the proc, possibly by quite a bit.<br>

Or, they could replace the ability alltogether with an uber pet weapons summons like that new cleric hammer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/atl/d/a/dastorys/Pictures/AntrySig.jpg>

<br>
I am honestly complexed why anyone would argue when people point to manaburn and say LOOK WHAT IT DOES, and than point to Frenzied Burnout and says LOOK WHAT IT DOESN'T DO.<br>
<br>
That is the point of all these posts, FB does nothing but cause frustration to those who have it. In Silvers test it was 300 or so extra damage not the 700 others have seen.<br>
<br>
In either case it is pathetic.<br>
<br>
SoL has been out 10-11 months, and this skill is NOT WORKING.<br>
<br>
To those that say, well it ups damage by 300 (as seen here) or 700 and says see it works, can't be serious if they think the majority of the people playing a magician class will be happy with that.<br>
<br>
How anyone playing a magician can even think to defend this AAXP skill as being ok in the present form amazes me.<br>
<br>
With PoP coming out, Frenzied Burnout will be needed to help us and our groups in a tough fight to prevail. 700 (being generous, and using the max number I have seen) will not do it. This skill for the AAXP points required to get it is still broken. <br>
<br>
In fact if that AAXP was a skill called FREE Cast of Shock of Firery Blades (which does 1005 base damage), we would have laughed as a class, but in actualitythat would be over 300 more damage than the best showing of Frenzied Burnout ever posted.<br>
<br>
Maybe that puts it in perspective.<br>
<br>
Frenzied Burnout is less than a free cast of Sock of Steel, and just 100 more damage than Shock of Swords.<br>
<br>
Now think about it along those lines. Replace Frenzied Burnout with a free 700 point nuke, with the same refresh timer and reqired 24 AAXP points to activate once ever 72 minutes, and do you honestly think anyone would do anything but look at that and say anything less than you have to be joking.<br>
<br>
Well it is no joke, that is what we got at the moment. Think about it like that, because that is how we should all look at it.<br>
