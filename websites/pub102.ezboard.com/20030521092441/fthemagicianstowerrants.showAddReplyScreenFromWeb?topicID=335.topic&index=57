<br>
From the start, I made a pretty decent income selling summoned bandages, fangs, swords, daggers, etc. just going to EC and calling them out to the zone.  This was low-level stuff, but when your idea of a good weapon was a Giant Snake Fang (go kill a few asps in EC, you'll find one) and no one could kill a griffon, it was also pretty uber.<br>
<br>
Swords were always welcome in Lavastorm (though by the time you could cast them you were too high for the zone) - both for their proc and because they could hit critters that required magic weapons.  <br>
<br>
As time went by (I'd say probably by December '99), players got past the early levels, and our gear stopped being so useful.  The market started sporting stuff that was just better than our summons, and for a fair price a player could get a permanent item.  For players starting then, they never saw our summonings as being very useful.  Bags still vanished on LD or camp, taking stuff with them - which of course made people shun them outright, who wants to lose a Yak to a linkdeath?  Other equipment, aside from coldstones, were never really needed.  <br>
<br>
Druids discovered quad-kiting in SK somewhere in here, and Mages discovered we could debuff them and their mobs as they passed.  This at least gave us some fun things to do while /ooc'ing for a group.<br>
<br>
So for about a year, we became nothing but our nukes and our pets, and the occasional debuff.  Because of pathing in dungeons, pets weren't welcome, reducing us to our nukes for those times.  Not group-friendly.  Half of our nukes were line-of-sight bolts.  Not group-friendly.  Somewhere in this time, we also got Waterstones, and we felt at least a little better since we could solo the entry room in Kedge indefinitely without buying a pricey fishbone earring.<br>
<br>
Sol Ro temple zone appears, and we get focus items - which help a lot in our soloing careers, and at least give our pets some extra &quot;oomph.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Through this, Necros still wanted our level 1 daggers, because while dual-wielding them their pet could become an insanely low-delay DPS machine.  They wouldn't group with us, or with anyone, since they could solo xps far more efficiently.  Somewhere along the line this got fixed, and to appease the necros their pets are given a minor lifetap proc.<br>
<br>
Kunark arrives.  With levels 51-60.  We get some neat spells (among them Gift of Xev and Muzzle of Mardu).  Our pets acquire some interesting traits - some are monks, some are wizards, some are rogues.  This flavor change is pretty nifty.  Epic quest is introduced, and an Epic-equipped magician is actually a freaking badass!  However, since Inny only drops six or seven staves a year, and PoA is a VERY tough raid, Epic magicians are few and far between.<br>
<br>
For the average magician, this time, to put it mildly, rather sucked.  There were moments of absolute glory, when in outdoor zones groups of 4-6 pet necros/mages would hunt Overthere and similar zones, with six pets all wielding Swords of Runes.  The procs would be going off like popcorn and the pets simply ginsu'd mobs like no tomorrow.  Bolts would occasionally land for double.  The times when this wasn't happening, we were just another class that happened to do damage with a pet and a few nukes rather than with a sword or directly with a spell.<br>
<br>
Then, SoR was fixed.  Procs went away, the page was turned in our spellbook, and for the most part, we never summoned them.  This was about seven to ten months into Kunark, I think Velious was still some few months away.  We had a dry spell here where we were kinda having a crappy time of it.  Still did decent damage, simply just not a &quot;must-have&quot; class for groups, and there were plenty of &quot;must-haves&quot; wandering around that made it difficult to get a spot.<br>
<br>
However, in this time, something happened.  Call of the Hero arrived.  Suddenly, raiding a dragon no longer required a massive breakin and a huge effort, a magician could sneak in and call the whole group over.  People started thinking &quot;Hey, that's kinda neat, let's figure out what we can bypass with it.&quot;<br>
<br>
The mod-rod was present here, but because bosses still had &quot;minimal&quot; hps, the fight was generally over quickly one way or the other.  TRods were good for CR mana recovery, but they really didn't get used a lot - primarily because at best we'd have Clarity to regen our own mana.  The spell was also so extremely uncommon that it really didn't make a difference.<br>
<br>
So Velious comes out, and with it a few new spells.  We get monster summonings, and a couple of DoTs (I'm still wondering why we got those).  Kinda cool, not much changed.  Lotta cold mobs meant at least our fire-based spells had a good time.  We had a few more places where CoH could help folks get places.<br>
<br>
&quot;Class Balance&quot; becomes a hot topic for VI.  <br>
<br>
Hate and Fear got revamped near here, minibosses arrived that drop formerly god-gear (including earth staff), and Inny and CT became major ass-whuppin machines.  Being an Epic magician doesn't seem to unattainable to folks any more.<br>
<br>
Not long after V, Luclin comes out.  <br>
<br>
And with it, bosses with fantastical hps.<br>
<br>
And the TRod.  <br>
<br>
KEI, a few FT items, and lots of medding helps us discover that we could regen some mana and hand it out to clerics.  Bosses had HUGE hps, and without additional sources of mana regen, clerics couldn't keep a main tank alive - so we became a source of mana for those clerics.  <br>
<br>
We started getting popular, but with a rather myopic view of raids.  Pets still were doom to a raiding party, as most zones and dungeons that got raided had terrible pathing, and pets would catch agro and bring the whole zone down on the magician.  <br>
<br>
Summoned bags stop vanishing immediately upon LD or camp - directly as a result of a player suggestion that the vanish check take place at login rather than disconnect, and gives us thirty minutes to recover our materials.  Players take a long time to notice this, but folks are starting to warm up to our bags.<br>
<br>
Our soloing life expands a bit, since we now have a pet heal and some armor we can summon for them.  Transon's Protection also is good for us here, with additional regen and mana recovery, and we also scored an Improved Invis.  <br>
<br>
Throughout this, low-level magicians don't see many changes, aside from having a few more zones to experiment with.  Also note that our pets haven't changed.  At all.<br>
<br>
Six or so months ago, partly for the &quot;Class Balance&quot; and partly for testing the new &quot;focus&quot; idea out, we get a bracket of new spells across all levels that introduce focus item summons - and suddenly we're a hot ticket!  Prior to raids, in groups, just wandering around, people want our focuses.  Despite some folks today having permanent items, I still get requests all the time for items.  <br>
<br>
About six weeks ago, VI turns the spotlight on the magician pet...and Epic Gonad can now quad for 81 (a four-point enhancement), and has a very large hp buff.  Other pets across all levels also get bonuses to damage output and hps.  Resist rates for pets become the higher of their owner's or their own.  Pets take no xps from any fight as long as the mob registers damage from any other source.  Pets become non-agro critters when not fighting, removing the &quot;pathing trains&quot; in raid situations.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly, magicians vault from a ho-hum spellcaster to a genuine DPS machine.  Wizards can still outdo us in the short-term (and boy howdy can they!  Rock on, wizzies!), but for overall long-term damage output, we suddenly are the bomb.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Sooooooo, long story short, we're a heck of a lot better now than we were before.  Where a lot of folks are complaining about nerfs, I'm not sure where that's coming from.  Seems the nerf bat recently got pulled out of our collective rectum.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I'm pretty happy with where we've been put.  Sure a druid can do higher damage with his or her nuke - big deal.  Have you seen the mana ratio on that spell?  Have you considered what that druid's mana pool looks like?  Think that druid could put something toe-to-toe in melee with a mob (with a reasonable expectation of survival, Teddy doesn't count here), PLUS nuke it, and walk away?  <br>
<br>
We are a powerhouse, guys.  Whether you like the way we are or not, we rock.  We can outdamage almost anyone in the game, and we have a pocket tank that can do most mobs that are of interest.<br>
<br>
I still chuckle at the thought of those folks ages ago begging for a root spell &quot;We need an escape hatch!&quot;  Pfft.  Gate is our escape hatch.  When Gonad is at 20% health, you should already know whether you're going to click the Gate button or not.  That's a personal peeve of mine, pay no mind, just had to write it.  <br>
<br>
Later, all - <br>
