I really do think that cancelling accounts is the only way to get their attention. I really don't plan on coming back to the game, but maybe if a percentage of the player base leaves the game and (this part is key) STOP PAYING THEM things will change. Even if they delete my feedback and do nothing at least I won't be supporting a company that doesn't listen to it's customers. Give it a read and see what you think.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have recently cancelled my long running (june 99) account. I have over 250 days played total on that account, as well as some time on 2 other accounts that are also now cancelled. I enjoyed much of my time playing EQ, especially the first 6 months or so. I really believe that EQ was a breakthrough and became one of the most fun games ever. Thanks for a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Now, for the reasons why I will no longer be supporting EQ in the future. First, customer service. To be honest if the game had been a little less addictive, this alone would have driven me from the game on several occasions. I have never supported a company that had representatives less likely to listen or help in my life. I have had some good results occasionally in dealing with guides but those times are in the minority. My suggestion here is to instruct your people if a decision has to be made, err on the side of the player. I am not saying be a pushover without ever saying no. I am saying when things go wrong in your game: zone crashing, server lag, known game bugs etc. Provide GM rezs, give back quest items, whatever it takes. I have talked to several of your guides who treated me as if I was trying to somehow &quot;rip off&quot; the game. The ill will generated by one such incident is huge. I routinely warn people that EQ is a good game, but the CS is so bad that they should avoid it and other Verant offerings. I myself do not plan to try any of your new games for this reason alone. I have perhaps 15 RL friends who play/played and only one really defends CS to any degree. Of all those friends who played there are 4 left who still play the game regularly. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the game has become seriously unbalanced in melee/caster power since Kunark and it became far worse with Velious. Luclin has not helped. I agree that melee were very underpowered before the expansions. I play a Mage as my main and a warrior at the time could not compare to my pet. It was good to see those players receive some attention. Now the incredible weapons, armor, and disciplines, have turned the situation completely around. This comes from someone who leveled to 50 before Kunark and has been a level 60 epic mage with &quot;UBER&quot; gear for a long time. I cannot compare to the damage output of our guild melee. Feel free to look over my account at any time to check my equipment or time played. In fact, even though we are supposed to be able to solo, I cannot solo as well as paladins in our guild now. This is a class that is not supposed to be able to solo. There are too many suggestions for balancing to list but I have one main idea. 55+ melee with NTOV/Velious Kings gear does far more damage than a same class player with less advanced gear. A 55+ caster with NTOV/Velious Kings gear will have a bit more mana and cast an extra spell. No drop spells that do more damage at less mana cost would be a fair comparision to higer damage/lower delay no drop weapons.<br>
<br>
My third and last point is the time waste involved in the game. I realize that Verant is in business to make money. The longer we stay and play the better for you. Fine, I really don't mind paying to play, and the new alt exp skills if constantly expanded could keep us playing for a long time. The time waste I refer are things like the nexus activation times. Great idea, poor execution. Buses come around every 10 minutes, no reason the nexus can't fire off more often. No binding at the firepots in Timorous Deep? Very few port zones in new expansions, slow boats etc?100+ plat for alchemic gates?  The people playing druids and wizards are not interested in roleplaying taxi drivers. Oh, and one thing that I believe will seriously hurt you in the future is the &quot;Vision&quot;. You make the game and people pay to play in it. Clinging to the &quot;Vision&quot; when the majority of people dislike any part of it is similar to running a restaurant and insisting that patrons eat a certain meal. Sure, it works if you are the only good restaurant in town, but I have noticed several new restaurants lately. Guess we will find out in the next year who is right.Try loosening up a little and you may find yourself building up some goodwill with your customer base.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned at the beginning you have a great game, the entertainment value for the cost is incredible. I really would probably let my account run and play occasionally if I felt that your company was responsive to the issues listed above. However, I believe that as long as everyone keeps paying the monthly fee, things will not be improved at a rate that is reasonable.<br>
<br>
Good Luck, <br>
Osgiliath <br>

<br>
I guess that's what we get for $10/month though.<br>
<br>
The idea of using volunteer support for your company's CS is mind-bogglingly stupid.  Can you imagine if another company did that?  My company handles data storage, I can just imagine volunteer &quot;guides&quot; hired to do our CS.<br>
<br>
Customer: &quot;Your program screwed up and I lost a lot of data!&quot;<br>
Guide: &quot;Is your data still being lost?&quot;<br>
Customer: &quot;WTF does that matter!  I need my data back!&quot;<br>
Guide: &quot;I'm sorry, I can't verify that you've lost data.  Let me know if it happens again.&quot;<br>
Customer: &quot;And then you'll restore it?&quot;<br>
Guide: &quot;No, but I'll make a note of it in my report.&quot;<br>
Customer: &quot;And then someone else will restore my data?&quot;<br>
Guide: &quot;No, but the bug might get fixed eventually.&quot;<br>
<br>
I still crash sometimes when zoning from OOT to EFP on the boat.  By the time I get back on, I'm zoning back to OOT.  Horribly frustrating, but the guides just blow me off.  One time I asked if they would just do &quot;who all grumples&quot; a few times as I zone, and if I crash again, would they please teleport me to EFP.  The answer was &quot;no&quot;.  Nothing like a 90 minute boat ride to get a fellow's dander up.<br>

I strive to improve my living conditions by hoarding gold, food, and sometimes keys and potions. I love adventure, fighting, and particularly winning - especially when there's a prize at stake.

I'm sure lots of druids/wizzies would yell about it if they let people bind at firepots, but I do also agree that most of the druids/wizzies I know cringe when people ask for ports.<br>
<br>
In another thread Galadriel stated what I feel may be the real reason nothing has happened to our class.  Because the complaining other paying customers playing their classes would make.  If they fixed pet melee, mage nukes, etc we would have large numbers of melee and casters crying foul.<br>
<br>
So I'm sure verant looks at the situation and says &quot;why should we spend time/money fixing something that will please 2% of our player base and anger 30%?  Even if we are right, there are alot more paying customers that would not want us restored to our pre-expansion power.<br>
<br>
Sadly, canceling accounts may indeed be the only way to get their attention.  I have often thought that if all mages on all servers stood together and canceled accounts until it was fixed, we might get something done.  But on every rant/flame/discussion about broken mechanics on these boards there is always somebody that is either A. Unwilling to see the negative side of mages, or B. totally ignorant of what so many of us are talking about.  Those people always argue we are not broken and label the rest whiners.<br>
<br>
If we were going to cancel accounts and stand together, it would have to be all of us, or at least enough that nearly no high level mages exist on any server.<br>
<br>
Many of you know me from my posts, I have been active on this site for a very long time.  I have loved my mage for over 2 years now, but I will cancel my account with the rest of you if it will make verant finally take notice and fix us.  Even if it means losing my mage forever, it's a cause I believe in.<br>
<br>
Which of you would also be willing to make this sacrifice? <p><B><font color=green>Eandori Raintree 59th Conjurer (Blood of Ro)<br>Nitefal 29th Necromancer (Blades of Light)<br>
