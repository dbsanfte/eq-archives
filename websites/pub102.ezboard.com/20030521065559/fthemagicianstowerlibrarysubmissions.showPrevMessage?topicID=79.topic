<br>
I've edited it to bring it up to date and fix previous errors.  Still missing info on the Hand/Eye of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
Spells in PoA: <br>
These spells may not be cast in PoA:<br>
-Call of the Hero<br>
-All gate/teleport spells<br>
-Any spell that has an effect of levitate<br>
-Harmony<br>
-Memory Blurs<br>
-Bind<br>
-Magician Fire, Water and Earth pets (Epic pet, Monster pets, and Air pets work)<br>
Spells that work differently:<br>
-Air pets appear as female djinns, otherwise they are the same. (Epic pets and monster pets look the same)<br>
-Necro pets appear as wisps, and are severally cut in power.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
General Info:<br>
PoA is set up on a key system.  On each isle there is a teleport pad (more than 1 on the first isle).  When the proper key is ued on the pad, the user is teleported to the next isle.  To get the keys for the next isle you kill the mobs on the current isle and get an item, varies for each isle.  Every isle has a boss, when the boss is slain a halfling by the name of Sirran the Lunatic spawns.  You hand him the key item and get the key in return.  I would advise you to not speak to him, except on the bee isle.  There are approximately 24 keys per isle.  Anyone without a key will have to be killed, and have a necro summon their corpse across and get ressed.  <br>
<br>
All spawns are static, not aggro, do not wander, do not despawn, and do not enrage unless otherwise noted. Also, no mobs see invs.  Expect normal HP, AC, and resists unless otherwise noted. All mobs have a chance to drop rare items (such as Melee Belts, Caster Bracers, Weight of the Gods, etc). All boss mobs starting at Pegusus isle death touch.<br>
<br>
If the servers go down, the zone has to be repoped by a GM.  When the GM repops the zone, any specially spawned mobs, usually bosses, can NOT be spawned by the GM.  This includes the Overseer of Air, the Hand of Veeshan, the Sister of the Spire, etc.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Key Master Isle: <br>
<br>
Thunder Spirits (8 of them on Key Master Isle, level 50) Look like Faeries, they hit for up to 160 and will proc 'Choke' on their target, which takes 10 strength off of their target and does a small DoT. These are the easiest mobs you will find in Sky. They randomly drop all types of Tesseras, three Mini-Swords and three Rabbits Feet. Hand the Mini-Swords and Rabbits Feet to Sirran the Lunatic to receive a Key of Swords and a Key of the Misplaced, respectively. <br>
<br>
Thunder Spirit Princess (Boss on Key Master Isle, level 53) Looks like a Faerie, she hits for mid 200s and will proc 'Choke' on her target. Usually empty, but will rarely have a piece of rare loot (Hast Belt, etc). Her death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Mini-Sword or Rabbits Foot, will hand you a Key of Swords or a Key of the Misplaced, respectively.<br>
<br>
Other info:  Don't use AE spells on this island. The quest hall is directly below the isle and you will agro the quest gvers.  <br>
<br>
Spawn Time: about 4-6 hours.<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Noble Isle: <br>
<br>
Bladestorm (2 on Noble Isle, Wander, level 59-60) Looks like a cloud of swords, hit for low to mid 300s and proc a spell that saps their targets Stamina. High HP, AC, and Resists. Usually empty, but will rarely have an item (Haste Belt, etc). They guard Noble Dojorn. Enrages toward the end of fight. <br>
<br>
Noble Dojorn (Efreeti Boss of Noble Isle, level 63) Looks like an Efreeti, hits for 300s, casts an AoE DD spell, and has a DD random proc. Extremely high HP, AC, and Resists. Drops Efreeti quest items, and Efreeti armor. His death triggers the spawn of the Overseer of Air, on the Pegasus Isle.<br>
<br>
Other info: This isle is optional.  You can go from the Key Master Isle to the Azarack Isle, or go from the Key Master to here to the Azaracks.  Also, on this isle is a mob for the monk epic.  Its called a presence, and when given items from the monk quest, Gwan spawns.  Fairly easy kill just make sure to fight him, and all the other mobs, in the windmill.<br>
<br>
Spawn Time: about 2-3 hours for the bladestorms, and the prescence.  The Noble respawns when the zone repops, or possibly with the death of the Hand of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Azarack Isle: <br>
<br>
Azarack (9 on Azarack Isle, Aggro, Wander, level 53) Looks like an Imp/Scareling, they hit for up to 190 and proc Whirlbolt (Levitate, Root, 400 dmg DoT) on their target. Relatively low HP but strange spell resists (one half of the Azaracks are resistant to cold, the other half to fire). They can be mezzed. They randomly drop all types of Disc quest items, and 1-3 Broken Mirrors. Killing the Place-Holder on this island (distinguishable by the fact that it hits for 220 instead of 190) will spawn the Protector of Sky, the boss of the island. <br>
<br>
Protector of Sky (Boss of Azarack Isle, Aggro, level 55) A giant version of his Azarack counterpart, he hits for 300s and procs Whirlbolt (Levi, 400 dmg DoT) on his target. Drops one rare item (Haste Belt, etc.), one rare quest item, and 4 Broken Mirrors. His death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, upon giving him a Broken Mirror, will give you a Key that will enable access to Gorgalosk Isle. He has a despawn time of about 80 minutes.<br>
<br>
Other Info:  Be prepared to fight as soon as you land on this isle.  Pats are a bad idea since you'll be in the thick of it pretty quick.  The place holder can be distinguished another way as well.  All the azaracks fly around, except the PH.  The PH is a static spawn and can be seen to the left, when facing the rest of the isle from the teleport in area.<br>
<br>
Spawn time: 6ish hours.<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Gorgalosk Isle: <br>
<br>
Gorgalask (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, Wander, level 54-56) Looks like a Gorgon (tentacles coming off the head), they hit for low 300s, and will proc a long stun spell on their target. Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>
<br>
Sprited Harpie (~ 4 on Gorgalosk Isle, Wander, level 54-56) Looks similar to a Gorgon/Gorgalask (but has no tentacles on its head), they hit for low 300s, have a low level necro pet, a 5-minute charge of Harm Touch, and will cast/proc Screaming Terror and Cascading Darkness on their target. Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item.<br>
<br>
Watchful Guard (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, Wander, level 55-56) Looks similar to an Evil Eye, hit for low 300s, has an Enchanter pet, cast Enchanter DD, an AoE mass dispell, and an AoE Gravity Flux (seems to cast this off and on; some raids they will Grav Flux, others they won't). Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item. <br>
<br>
Gusts of Wind/Crystalline Cloud (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 53) Looks similar to an Air Elemental, hit for 200s, casts AirElemental Attack (Stun). Drops one Animal Figurine, and globes as its main quest item.<br>
<br>
Shimmering Meteors (5 on Gorgalosk Isle, level 55) Looks similar to will o' wisps, but red in color, they hit for low to mid 300s, and cast the spell Knockback (target gets thrown backwards, away from the Meteor; always fight inside the temple, or you will get thrown off the Isle). Drops one globe item and possibly research materials. <br>
<br>
Avenging Gazer (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 59) Similar to Watchful Guards, hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Watchful Guard. Very high HP AC Resists. Drops one Animal Figurine.<br>
<br>
Heart Harpie (Mini-Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Similar to Sprited Harpies, hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Sprited Harpie. Very high HP AC Resists. Drops one Animal Figurine.<br>
<br>
Gorgalosk (Boss of Gorgalosk Isle, level 60) Looks like a Gorgalask, hits for mid to high 300s, and casts the same spells as a Gorgalask. Very high HP AC Resists. Drops 4 Animal Figurines, one rare item (Haste Belt, etc), and one rare quest item. Her death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given an Animal Figurine, will give you a key to the Pegasus Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>
<br>
No additional info. <br>
<br>
Spawn Time: about 8-10 hours <br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Pegasus Isle: <br>
<br>
Soul/Essence Harvester (6 on Pegasus Isle, Wander, level 52)  Looks similar to a Griffon or Pegasus, respectively, hits for high 200s and casts Whirl-till-you-Hurl (stun that spins you in place). All Griffons are particularly vulnerable to fire-based spells, and all Pegasi are vulnerable to magic-based spells. Drops statuettes as its main quest item, and up to 4 Bird Whistles.  The death of the Harvesters trigger the spawn of TWO Soul/Essence Carriers: <br>
<br>
Soul/Essence Carrier (Two to each Soul/Essence Harvester,Aggro, level 54) Exactly like the Soul/Essence Harvester, except they have higher HP AC Resists and hit harder. It will despawn after about 80 minutes. These can be mezzed.  Drops statuettes as its main quest item. Its death triggers the spawn of ONE Soul/Essence Tamer: <br>
<br>
Soul/Essence Tamer (One to each Soul/Essence Carrier, Aggro, level 56) Exactly like the Soul/Essence Carrier, except they have even higher HP AC Resists and hit for around 300. Drops statuettes as its main quest item. It will despawn after about 80 minutes. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>
<br>
Keeper of Souls (Boss of Pegasus Isle, Aggro, level 58+) Looks like a giant Pegasus (the size of a dragon, in fact), hits for 400+, casts Whirl-till-you-Hurl, and Death Touches. Drops one rare item (Haste belt, etc.), one rare quest item, and 4 Bird Whistles. Its death triggers the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Bird Whistle, will give you a Key enabling access to the Spiroc Isle. It has a despawn time of about 80 minutes. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>
<br>
Overseer of Air (Efreeti Boss of Pegasus Isle, level 63)  Spawns when Noble Dojorn dies. Looks like an Efreeti, he can hit for up to 750, casts an AoE DD, randomly procs a DD, and Death Touches. He also dual wields daggers, which need to be disarmed at the beginning of the fight or he'll be able to quad attack. Extremely high HP, AC, Resists. Drops Efreeti quest items and Efreeti armor. His death triggers the spawn of the Hand of Veeshan on the Butterfly Isle.  We fought him where he spawns and his pathing was crazy.  I would suggest you pull him into the windmill.<br>
<br>
Other info: As soon as the first Soul/Essence Harvester is killed, Ekim Nottap spawns (you see him on track).  An hour after he spawns, the Keeper of Souls spawns.  This gives you 2 hours and 20 mins to kill all the spawns and the Keeper before you have to redo the isle.  The Overseer's despawn time is either very long (as in days), or non-existant.<br>
<br>
Spawn Time: about 12 hours<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Spiroc Isle: <br>
<br>
Spiroc Arbiter, Banisher, Caller, Walker, Expulser, and Revolter: <br>
(6 on Spiroc Isle, Aggro, Wander, level 52) Look like colorful Aviaks, they hit for 200, cast Lightning, an unresistable AoE, Blind, and Root. Drops Spiroc feathers as its main quest item. Each of these Rooks are tied together in pairs (Arbiter &amp; Banisher, Caller &amp; Walker, Expulser &amp; Revolter), and these pairs are in turn associated with the Vanquisher that roams around them (they roam around their individual 'houses' in these pairs). The associated Vanquisher must be killed before the pairs of Rooks can be killed, otherwise the Rooks will respawn. The Rooks can be mezzed quite easily.<br>
<br>
Spiroc Vanquisher (3 on Spiroc Isle, Aggro, Wander, level 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  A bit tougher than the Rooks, Spiroc Vanquishers wander near to its associated Rook pairs.  These can be mezzed, but it is difficult. These must be killed before the Rook pairs can be killed. They drop 8 Noise Makers that enable access to Bzzazzt Isle. Enrages towards the end of fight. <br>
<br>
Spiroc Guardian (Mini-Boss of Spiroc Isle, Aggro, level 60) A larger version of his Spiroc counterparts, casts similar spells, and drops two quest components. It hits for up to 250.  Acts as a rook to the boss.  If the Guardian is not killed before the Spiroc Lord, the Lord will respawn instantly.<br>
<br>
Spiroc Lord (Boss of Spiroc Isle, Aggro, level 63) An even larger version of the Spirocs, this is the boss of Spiroc Isle. It hits for 350+, DTs, casts an unresistable AoE spell, StoneSpiderStuns, Roots, and Blinds enemies. Drops one rare item and one rare quest component. Its death will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Noise Maker, will give you a Key that will enable access to the Bzzazzt Isle.<br>
<br>
Other Info:  While they are aggro, the aggro radius is VERY small.  They can walk right by you and not attack.  However, their help radius is HUGE.  When you pull you will most likely get all 9 little birds.  Keep your enchanters alive, and kill off the Vanquishers.  Do not use pets until the Lord.  If a pet is blinded, it acts as if it is feared and the pathing causes it to charge the Lord.  However, nukes land fairly well, and malosing the birds, the vanquishers especially, will help the enchanters.  Go left after landing, along the edge of the island.  About half way between the houses, at the edge, is where you should pull to.  Otherwise you're likely to get the guardian or Lord as an add.  Because the Lord will instantly respawn if the guardian isn't killed, you can pharm his rare quest items, and more importantly, the wingblade for the warrior epic.<br>
<br>
Spawn time: about 12 hours<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Bzzazzt Isle: <br>
<br>
Bzzazzt (3 on Bzzazzt Isle, Aggro, level 50) Look like Wasps from newbie zones, hit for 390, and cast Deadly Poison (1200 DoT) spell on target. Not very magic resistant, and can be mezzed easily (and charmed too with some work). Huge aggro radius, and only safe spot on the island is behind the big gear at the teleport pad. Each Bzzazzt drops 8 Dull Dragon Scales, which enable access to Drake Isle. Main quest items for this island are 'Honey'-type items. <br>
<br>
(Note: All other spawns after the initial Bzzazzt seem to be completely magic resistant except for Lure-type spells.  This isn't totally accurate, the first splits, Bazzzazzts, can be charmed by a level 60 enchater using dictate, but it is hard.  ALL of the other spawns Enrage towards the end of the fight, which sucks especially since they all hit for 500+ heh. They have a huge aggro radius, but you can still do CR on the island with the splits spawned to get another try at them if you have a wipe-out. Beware though, the splits (including the final boss) have a despawn timer of 80 minutes, so be quick) <br>
<br>
Left Bzzazzt (when facing them from behind), when killed, spawns 2 level 55 Bazzzazzts (hit for 500s), and each of their deaths will spawn a level 57 Bizazzt (hit for 700s) (Note: this is just like the spawn cycle for Pegasi/Griffons from Pegasus Isle). <br>
<br>
Right Bzzazzt, when killed, spawns 3 level 55 Bazzzazzts at once.  This is the most common spawn.  However, there is a random spawn too, about 1 in 12 chance.  If you get this spawn you're in bad luck.  The rare spawn is 3 bzzzts, or bazzts (the fight was too fast to recall acurately).  Also, the levels and resists on these are currently unknown.  They have VERY few hp, the melees will kill them before you can cast on them.  However, all 3 hit for 1200 and hit fast.  If they spawn excpect several people dead very suddenly.<br>
<br>
Middle Bzzazzt, when killed, spawns 1 level 55 Bazzzazzt, who's death triggers the spawn of the level 60 Bzzt (a bixie, hits for 700s), who's death triggers the spawn of the final boss, the level 63 Bazzt Zzzt (another bixie, hits for 850, DTs, has an island-covering AoE *disease* spell), for a grand total of 2 Wasps, 2 Bixies for the Middle Bzzazzt. The death of the Bazzt Zzt will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Dull Dragon Scale, will give you a Key that will enable access to the Drake Isle. **VERY** important: This instance of Sirran the Lunatic, when given the proper phrase, will spawn the Sister of the Spire on Drake Isle. You *must* give this phrase, or your progress in the Plane of Sky will be halted at the next island.  The phrase is &quot;Llaw eht htiw eno I ma&quot; or &quot;Am I one with the wall&quot; backwards.<br>
<br>
Other info:  Bazzt Zzt is very hard, but you have 80 mins to kill her.  You should be able to get 2-3 tries at her.  This island is more difficult than the next.  <br>
<br>
Spawn Time: 12 or more hours<br>
<br>
***** <br>
<br>
Drake Isle:<br>
<br>
Heartsbane Drake (~5 on Drake Isle, Wander, level 56) Look like black drakes; they are the weakest of the Drakes on this Isle. They hit for high 400s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Very low HPs and low resists. Each Drake drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
<br>
Fatestealer Drakes (~5 on Drake Isle, Wander, level 5<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Look like green drakes; they should be pulled first, before the other 2 sets of Drakes. They hit for low 400s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Significantly more HP than the Heartsbane Drakes.  Each Drake drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
<br>
Windrider Drake (~5 on Drake Isle, Wander, level 60) Look like pretty blue drakes; they are the most powerful of the mobs on Drake Isle and should be pulled last (and due to their roaming paths around the temple, some are bugged and next to un-pullable). They hit for high 500s, proc a spell similar to Whirlbolt (Levitate, Whirl-till-you-Hurl, possible DD or DoT), and cast Wizard spells. Very high HP and Resists. Each Drake drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
<br>
Greater Sphinx (7 on Drake Isle, level 54) Look like giant sphinxes, they are assembled in pairs around the temple. They hit for high 300s, cast Enchanter spells, and Death Touch. They have an extremely small yell-for-help range, thus they won't aggro the other Sphinxes when you pull one. Each Sphinx drops a Replica of the Wurm Queen, which enable access to Butterfly Isle. Drop final item to Efreeti Quests as their main quest drop. <br>
<br>
Undine Spirit (8 on Drake Isle, level 53) Cleric wisp, found inside the ceiling of the temple, above the Sister spawn point. These have few hp, and hit for about 250 if I remember right.  Pulling them is easy and killing them is easy as well.  They are easy to interrupt.  To pull them, we used ESP, Enchanter Suicide Pulling.  Our enchanter would agro them and drag all of them out to the ramp of the temple.  She'd then mezz one and die.  The others would go back to temple, and we'd kill the remaining one.  They were easy to kill with only 9-12 people.  The enchanter was level 60.<br>
<br>
Sister of the Spire (Boss of Drake Isle, Aggro, level 63) A spawn triggered by Sirran from Bzzazzt Isle, she looks like the female Efreeti Mage pets. She can be found inside the temple, and is aggro (but very small aggro range). She hits for 200s, casts an AoE stun spell, and Death Touches. Very high HP AC and Resists. Her death will trigger the spawn of Sirran the Lunatic, who, when given a Replica of the Wurm Queen, will give you Veeshan's Key that will enable access to the Butterfly Isle (this key seems to be the exact same one you can buy from the Key Master for 1cp that enables access to the Quest Room, however it isn't the same and won't work here). Enrages towards the end of fight.<br>
<br>
Other info:  The pathing on this isle is horrid, and I suggest not using pets.  Every mob, except the boss, on the isle can drop the mage crown, so if that's what you're after kill everything.  You need to be in melee range to cast on the mobs here.  Our level 60 enchanter said she was able to dictate one of the colors of drakes the first time we came here, but was unable to do it the most recent time.<br>
<br>
Spawn time: 24 hours<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
Butterfly Isle:<br>
<br>
Eye of Veeshan (1 on Butterfly Isle, level 63) Looks like a cute butterfly, supposed boss of the entire Plane of Sky.  Hits for 173 max, procs the Efreeti DD on almost every hit (&quot;You feel your soul being consumed&quot;), and Death Touches. Not yet engaged in a real fight.<br>
<br>
Hand of Veeshan (1 on Butterfly Isle, Aggro, level 63) Triggered by the death of the Overseer of Air, he's the final step in the line of Efreetis. Not yet engaged.<br>
<br>
Other info: The Hand's aggro radius is huge, and will sometimes DT people on the drake isle.  The Eye of Veeshan assists the Hand.  Like the Overseer, the Hand's despawn time is either very long, or non-exsistant.  He seems to only despawn when the zone repops, or when killed.<br>
<br>
Spawn Time: Unknown<br>

My suggestion is everyone that doesn't have a key should attack Sirran.  We've had people get their corpses summoned over, and then find that the ress timer is up and they're on one isle, and their equipment is on another.  Also, you tend to lose people as you fight, if they're not gonna be getting a key, and its near the end of the isle they can just keep the corpse to use later. <p>~~
