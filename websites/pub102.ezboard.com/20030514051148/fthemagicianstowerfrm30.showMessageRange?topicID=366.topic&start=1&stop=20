<br>
1 point of mental clarity will give a level 60 mage an increase in dps of 0.66 (assuming mana dam ratio of 4:1. This is for the non-SCM and non-SCF mage. These will have better ratios).<br>
<br>
FB is 0.13 increase in dps. So mental clarity I is 5 times better than FB.<br>
<br>
To compare, regen 1 is for a self-rodder aprox 0.33 FT. Or 1/3 of mental clarity. So regen 1 is still better than FB.<br>
<br>
As it is now, I suspect that they cannot increase mage dps with a singe AA with more than a few  percent. (SCM being the best of these, raising it 10 percent or so). Lets assume that VI will accept a raise in dps of 3% for this AA. lets (conservatively) assume that an epic mage has a dps of 120.<br>
<br>
3% of 120 is 3.6. (Which is around the strength of SCF III I believe). 90 mins is 5400 ekstra dammage. Divided over 36 secs that is 150 extra dps. So this is the number that should be aimed for if the FB is free of manacost, and if VI accept that an increase in dps should be part of the equation. (If it is not, I cannot see why mages should waste energy on it). <br>
<br>
This will probably get the pet killed, but hey, that would be fun =).<br>
<br>
An alternative to this is to let FB cost a lot of mana. for example 2k mana.<br>
<br>
if it costs 2k mana, they can allow it to increase its effectiveness, without disturbing the mages dps to much. For 2k mana, you can have at least 8k dammage done nuking. And it can be delivered in less than 1 min. So if you transfer it to the pet, the pet should be doing more than 8k extra dammage in the FB period, to be competitive. The above increase of 5400 damage was assuming an increase in dps of 3.6. So these two should be added if the dps increase holds. 13400 damage in 36 secs is 377 more dps per second. I doubt the pet will be unnoticed by the mob for long =). So most likely, the mob will turn around and remove the pet before the period is over. But hey, it will be great fun!<br>
<br>
Basically, the FB must either increase the dps of the mage, or give the ability to deliver a single hard blow. <br>
<br>
if it increases dps, it can either cost mana, or be manafree. <br>
<br>
The equation for the manafree overall dps increase version is as follows:<br>
<br>
  dpsIncFB = ( dpsIncPercentIntended * avgMageDps * 90 (mins) * 60 (sec) ) / durationOfFB.<br>
<br>
The manaconsuming version would be:<br>
<br>
  dpsIncFB2 = dpsIncFB + manacost * (manaDamRatioMage) / durationOfFB.<br>
<br>
<br>
The version that does not increase dps for mages is not interesting for mages I believe, so I will not bother with it.<br>
<br>
The current version of FB has dpsIncFB = 20. To small by hundreds I believe.<br>
<br>
The thing that I like about having a manacosting FB is that we can do damage with Jabober. That is what mages are about =).<br>
<br>
Iblis<br>
<br>
PS: Most AA can be converted to dps increases, I wonder why it hasn't been done on the board. Perhaps I should spend the sunday on that =). <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uiblisthemage.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IblisTheMage</A> at: 9/8/02 12:27:04 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ujazzen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Jazzen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 182<br> <font color=#333333>(9/8/02 12:31:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: FB math - numbers speculation - Also for Rick Waters</span><hr size=1> Very good post and some pretty good numbers.

<br>
If you want to get them to listen make it simple and to the point so that a retarded monkey could understand it.  Or summarize it first and put the numbers at the end.  <br>
<br>
The simple fact of the matter is that the explosion never worked and their idea of fixing it was to remove the explosion altogether.  They need to bring the explosion back and make it work this time, and maybe make it single target dd.  Other then that is anything really wrong with the skill?  All your numbers really show is some aa skills are better then others, that can be said for any class' aa's. <br>
<br>
Don't mean to sound negative just realistic.<br>

Increased mana regen does not.<br>
<br>
Lets say I can cast 4 shock of fiery blades in 36 seconds for 115 dps.  My pet also contributes 50 dps normally.  This puts my 36 second burn dps at 165.  The only ways I can increase this are:<br>
<br>
Spellcasting Fury (Random)<br>
Spellcasting Subtlety to a limited extent.<br>
Frenzied Burnout.<br>
<br>
Not only is it one of only a few skills(of which mental clarity is not included) that can increase my max burn damage, but it stacks with all of the others.  If I had this skill now, I would actually use it.  In an xp group, it would be the skill to use when you got a bunch of unexpected adds or when you were fighting the big boss.  It might let me solo things I could not do before, and certian mobs would become easier.  <br>
<br>
I'm not saying that it couldn't be a bit more useful..  personally I would like to see either the damage output upped or have some other effect added, but despite possible wishes to the contrary Frenzied Burnout does <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> not</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> appear to ever have been intended as a long term damage boost(which mages really didn't need anyway).  Therefore it really doesn't help to analyze it as such. <br>

<br>
I do believe that Frenzied Burnout was intended to make the pet do a lot of damage for 36 seonds than add more damage with the explosion.<br>
<br>
I never and I doubt 99% of anyone who reads these boards thought that a class ability that takes 24 aaxp points to get would only raise pet damage by 700 total damage before fading.<br>
<br>
The name alone proves that much in my opinoin.<br>
<br>
Each of out burnout lines were designed to make the pet hit faster, and do a lot more damage. The pet delay goes way down under burnout, and damage per second soars.<br>
<br>
SCF3 (Spell Casting Fury) by it self allows your nukes to crit for more than 700 extra damage, and you can get that before you get frenzied burnout, also note that Wizards and Druids both get SCF as an ability if they wish to get it, and I know a lot of wizards try for this as soon as they have manaburn. My point in bringing this up is to point out, that increasing damage via AAXP points is something Verant has in mind and is implimenting. ManaBurn/LifeBurn/DC all are aaxp skills to let players do more damage on mobs than previously possible.<br>
<br>
PLEASE DO NOT get side tracked, I mention them to show that improving damage output is part of what AAXP does, and not just for Wizards the premier nuking class but for druids and the magician class as well. This skill allows nukes to hit for more than 700 more damage on certain spells.<br>
<br>
To think that frenzied burnout was a skill added to only add less than a nuke worth of extra damage can't be right. It makes no  sense at all. 700 damage for that many aaxp points, and useable every 90 minutes doesn't make any sense.<br>
<br>
I still feel it was meant to turn out pet into a shredding machine for 36 seconds, and do a ton more damage.<br>
<br>
The way it is now, it is broken, and I think the poster of this thread is trying to show what he feels may have been what was intended but never happened. <br>
<br>
I don't know if he is right, but I hope so, because if it was intended to only do 700 more damage before wearing off than I see no point in this skill at all, it would be put in the same catergory as Mass Group Buff, not something at all useful to get.<br>

<br>
I believe they may have had flawed thinking with the current set up by this:  Maybe they compared the damage an FB pet does to the damage an *unbuffed* pet does, instead of the increase &gt; burnout 4 + muzzle.  In that case, the 36 seconds makes the pet do a large amount more, dont have the numbers handy but i would assume a FB pet does like 2-4k damage more than an *UNBUFFED* pet over 36 seconds.  If this is the case, its flawed.  The damage fb does needs to be compared to bo4+muzzle, because quite frankly, anyone with fb is going to have bo4+muzzle as standard on the pet, and therefore any increase FB does in dps needs to be compared to that as its base, not an unbuffed pet. <p><A HREF="http://shade.austin2600.org"><img src="http://shade.austin2600.org/gtt2aow.jpg"> </a><p>

Do you realize how SMALL 700 extra damage is over 36secs? Also there are reports that DPS went down while FB was in use. So the 700 extra damage really is up for debate.  I mean if you would waste time getting a skill that does 700 extra damage over 36 secs for experience groups when the mobs verant wants us to hunt at lvl 60 have 15 to 20k hps all I have to ask is HOW IS THAT GOING TO HELP WITH ADDS! Your &quot;Everything Is Right In Mage World&quot; logic is flawed and what you said is so insane that I can't even believe you said it. <br>

<br>
I don't think that talking about the sustained DPS boost FB can provide is the right approach. SCM, SCF, MC and so on are the increases to long term DPS. FB is the increase to short term DPS, and it needs to be balanced as such. Good comparisons for what FB should do are Manaburn and melee offensive disciplines. <p><center>

Manaburn drains the wizard of all mana.  Lifeburn drops the caster to one hit point.<br>
<br>
When Frenzied Burnout killed the pet it might have been reasonable to say that it should cause an additional 5k in damage (roughly what you get from lifeburn or manaburn) but now that the pet no long poofs such a proposition does not seem reasonable.<br>
<br>
At 108 seconds it would be about 2100 points of damage.  This seems to me to be a reasonable amount.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Shadex,</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
 I understand that.  People do like to compare aas class to class.  Unfortunately, your point made me think of something else which I'm gonna write about instead of going to bed heh..<br>
<br>
Class aa abilities do not exist in isolation of each other, the player, and others.  When you look at an AA you need to look at what it does for that class.  What advantages and disadvantages does a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>wizard</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> with manaburn have over a <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>wizard</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> without manaburn?  Note that except for Xuzl(Rage of Zomm Clone), everything a wizard does requires mana in rather large amounts.  Losing all of your mana is a much bigger deal for a wizard than for a magician.  Also realize that using manburn to deal those huge damage numbers requires a full bar of mana.  That means you can't be using any of your mana reserves before you manaburn.  <br>
<br>
If a wizard, mid fight, suddenly saw the need to manaburn and only had 1500 mana, he'd be a lot better off casting sunstrike or draughts.  If he knew he'd be called on to manaburn, then he'd be unable to contribute much early in the fight, to say nothing about his contribution afterwards.  These sorts of things are easily forgotten when you look at the manaburn ability in isolation from the actual wizard class and how it is really played in everquest.<br>
<br>
Dire Charm is a great tool but rather difficult to use in many situations.  A dire pet can also die or be dispelled, last I knew.  A great solo ability to be sure, but it carries the old and hated pet XP penalty..<br>
<br>
Chaotic Stab I'm not too familiar with..  but the one rogue I know with the ability is rather disappointed with it.  It doesn't help damage much at all when the rogue is getting mostly full backstabs anyway.  Also remember that it is the rogue's lot in life to deal damage.  Unlike a magician, a rogue usually has little else to do.   As a rogue I would expect to have a class ability that would directly increase my damage output.  Chaotic Stab is nice, but it's really only abating the negative effects of a mob facing you.  You'll never see big improvements in max damage ability from Chaotic Stab.  <br>
<br>
Compare those to Frenzied Burnout, which can be activated at will whenever you are using a pet and immediately starts doing extra damage.  The only drawback being that BO is overwritten(which does suck imo).  Unlike Dire Charm it is not dependant on many factors to be able to use.  Unlike Manaburn there are few serious drawbacks to using it.  Unlike Chaotic Stab it raises your maximum damage potential(and C.S. is also situational like Dire Charm).<br>
<br>
When you put Frenzied Burnout next to a more detailed comparison of the other class abilities, it doesn't seem quite so horrible anymore.  I'm not saying this is a perfect comparison, nor am I trying to justify leaving FB as it is.  I do think trying to be as fair as possible in our comparisions, however, will benefit us more in the long run.<br>
<br>
I think ihe original poster had a good idea in comparing the mana values of each ability.  Since mana use is a common trait between many classes, it would seem to be a fair basis for comparison, and in some ways this comparison is certianly quite useful.  Unfortunately, mana regen doesn't determine all class abilities or all in-game actions, which was what I addressed before. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A> at: 9/9/02 8:39:09 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showMessageRange?topicID=366.topic&start=41&stop=47>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showPrevMessage?topicID=366.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showNextMessage?topicID=366.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=366.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.threadControl?topicID=366.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=366.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm30>Magician Skills</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
