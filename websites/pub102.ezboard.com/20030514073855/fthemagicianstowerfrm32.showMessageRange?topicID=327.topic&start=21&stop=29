The ones I like (no, the ones I WANT)<br>
-Pets being affected by group/AE spells<br>
-Pets being the level of the caster---i don't even care if it upgrades performance against higher level mobs. I only want this for agro purposes. I hate having to zone because an exp mob gates. The way to avoid it is to not use a pet, but we're one of the few classes without that option &gt;&lt; Even worse is when pathing sends the mob near another social mob. Since the pet can not level pull... add &gt;&lt;<br>
-Pets being unfearable. I'd like some way to attain this, since EoT is innately unfearable (!!!) Valiant companion is nice, but about half it's uses are against something which will just dispel valiant companion &gt;&lt; an AA, somehow coding valiant companion to be undispellable, granting one of our pets fear immunity, letting us scribe EoT, all workx for me.<br>
-I've heard pet immunities are messed up. I haven't had much opportunity to test, but if it's true, I'd like them back in some form.<br>
<br>
I disagree with pets taking less dmg from AEs. I really think it's just part of playing a pet caster. We have pet heals and stuff to counter it.<br>
<br>
Also disagree with pets proccing instead of casting, with the exception of the water pet and pre-50 fire in which case i don't care. However, allowing spells to not reset weapon delay, a la hybrids, sounds good to me.<br>
<br>
========<br>
Their constant whining and complaining that there should be no droppable pet spells that are better then the epic has cause alot of the problems that many mages now face. I still believe that Jaytee who fights in VT all the time should have a more powerful pet then me who fights in ToV.<br>
=========<br>
<br>
Actually, we sorta have that now. Actually, VI has the beginnings of something even better: an extended line of burnout spells. I actually feel more comfortable knowing that the epic is the last pet I'll ever need, but I agree that, as you say, Jaytee's pets should be be doing more dmg than say, mine. I think burnout is the answer. That's not to say they've implemented it well. Some say Bo5 is too small an increase. I'm not talking about that... merely the concept of better pet buffs instead of whole new pets.<br>
<br>
=============<br>
A DEFENSIVE SPELL PLEASE. If they could give clerics the abilitie to solo after 3 1/2 years of not being able to do so they can give mages root for christ sake.<br>
==============<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, I AGREE WITH BOTH YOUR ARGUMENT AND YOUR REASONING BEHIND IT, in fact, because of the reasoning behind it, as I used to be one of the mages who encouraged people to be cool about not having root. -=But=- we need to make the idea it's own *discussion/brainstorming/whatnot/<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> whining/<!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>not</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> directed at VI or their employees* thread.

Doubt this would actually be possible, pets act has npcs when checked for group buffs, making any change to this could result in some weird bugs... beside you can still target him and have him single buffed...<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>   think it would be fair if pets only took 33% damage... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That wont happen. Epic pet has roughly 3500hps unbuffed? With them now using the magicians resist to check against AE, it will not change. Comparing them to the cleric/wizard pets like someone did is just dumb. Those 2 pets have roughly ~150hps. Even while calculating the masters resists, the pets would more than likely die after 1 AE.<br>
<br>
Dont forget that you can also command your pet. A wizard or cleric cannot even /pet get lost or invis to kill it. Has to camp. And yes, a pet that wont listen can be BAD for positioning.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> given a series of pets targeted specificly for raid use<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Those are called Water Pet (imune to cold), fire pet (imune to fire) etc... and with a little positioning, theyll be 100% imune to riposte.<br>

Pet not suiciding at the end of this skill now is a major boost. Lower the re-use time to 24mins and I think its good. 72mins seems pretty long even to me.<br>

You can put a cross on that, it wont happen. It was supposed to happen a long time agro when Swords of Runes were nerfed and wouldnt proc on every monsters anymore. New spells that would proc on different were supposed to be put in, but the idea made the trash bin. Too bad.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I want some new bolts that are cold based... <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I want you to get all your magic based spells removed from your book and changed for cold based. You are masters of elements, thus cold/fire. As for the bigger nuke, it wont happen... Not until PoP at least and even there, will only be another small upgrade. Has it is, magicians in my guild can kill solo 4 mobs, often time 2-3 at once with no diffuculty while Im killing 1.<br>
<br>
With new pet haste, he alone meleeing can pull close to what? 70 dps? Thats not including his built in damage shield and the fact that you can nuke. Get a shield of auras and you have no downtime to soloing.<br>

Best comment so far. Nothing more annoying than a MT bitching because the mob hes trying to position gets moved around by pets. Pets should have no push back effects.<br>

Impossible in the current game mechanics simply because pets atk, ac etc scale with their levels like every npcs. There are some exceptions in some zones, ala the deep where mobs hit way harder than needed for their lvls.<br>
<br>
To put it simply, a level 60 pet would be unhitable by any mobs under level 55.. or barely hittable and would tear down any npcs unless they were ~10 levels higher than him. Remember, they do not use the same codings has players do.<br>

Are pets even viable in VT other than on bosses? I have yet to see a mage with one. That zone is extremely buggy, for one, you do not want to use a horse... And during a boss fight, Jaytee has to be a nice mage and summon rods... so doesnt really matter if his pet is really stronger... he wont use him 1/2 of his time online <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Verant said along time it was impossible to add pets health so group members could see it ... No we have, I am sure pets could be treated like a normal groupmember if they really worked on it.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Its called /pet hold and positioning, dont know what you want more.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Pet hold is an exelent tool for raiding, that is true, but what about all the mages that want to raid before L59?<br>
And if you so clueless that you think /pet hold will fix every issues with pets on a raid you need to pay ore attention.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Those are called Water Pet (imune to cold), fire pet (imune to fire) etc... and with a little positioning, theyll be 100% imune to riposte.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And if you payed attention you would know that this aint true anymore, they are not immune anymore, infact only firepet only been imune. <br>
The thing he talking about is more special pets, exactly like wizards Bane spells. Hey, even pets that acctaully can hurt Emperor.<br>

<br>
And once again...  If you payed attention you would notice that in best cases you acctaully can see pet do more dmg, often you can't. This is the truly unique pet skill we have, it should have our version of DC or Manaburn, instead it is a broken skill that hardly do any extra dmg at all. Increase the duration to 72mins and it still would been alot worse than DC.<br>

So just because Verant totaly forget about it it doesn't mean mages have. We kinda used to be ignore for a few years. And why on earth should we put a corss over it then we talking about stuff we would like to see added.<br>

You kinda just described whats the major issues we have with pets on raids. <br>
Ask yourself instead, why don't you think any mage use his/hers pet in VT? <br>
So why shouldn't a mage be able to use a pet in those zones, why should a mage be forced to only make modrods.<br>

Using the new UI you will see if a groupmember is using a pet (little green bar below the owners health bar). This means it is very possible to make pets part of group buffs.<br>
<br>
1) check if pets are present in the group<br>
2) if pets are present get their names and treat them like a PC for the spell you´re casting<br>

If you opened your eyes for 2 minutes, you might notice that not long ago, VI introduced something called a New User Interface. Revert to the old one and youll also notice that you cannot see Pet's Health now.<br>
<br>
Here is not a question of what VI can and cannot do if they work toward it, but rather of game mechanics. Theyd have to flag pets has not npcs, but not players either, had this new group to the codings where as they will get healed by AEs... Knowing VI, Im far more confident theyd &quot;accidently&quot; make it so everytime you hit group complete heal, not only the pets, but the monsters also get healed.<br>

<br>
Were talking about pet hold and eventually FB. Im sorry to everyone under 60, but by 3 expensions and 3 years, if youre not 60, theres nothing we can do for you. If you just started the game not long, well you dont really have any rights to complain since you didnt have to go thru 3 years of nerfs and tweaks. Might sound elitist, but dont talk about class balance if youre not 60.<br>

<br>
My job is to pay attention on raids, clueless is as far from my personallity has your brain seems to be from the inside of your head. <br>
<br>
/Pet hold has made our mages much more efficient solo/raid wise. It might not fix every little problems, but then nothing is perfect, every classes have their own little problems that will never get solved.<br>

<br>
Ill give you the point here for having made me learn something here, but once again, the point is still moot with pets now using their masters resistance against AE spells and any other spells for what its worth.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Hey, even pets that acctaully can hurt Emperor <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
100% agreed and if they do not want pets being able to do melee dmg, at least make it so that the procs lands relatively often. Mages on Emp raids are stuck summoning rods, let them contribute a little way to the damage done.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  And once again... If you payed attention you would notice that in best cases you acctaully can see pet do more dmg, often you can't. This is the truly unique pet skill we have, it should have our version of DC or Manaburn, instead it is a broken skill that hardly do any extra dmg at all. Increase the duration to 72mins and it still would been alot worse than DC. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
And once again... if you payed more attention, you might not make so many typos.<br>
<br>
I dont exactly understand what you tried to write there. I suggested lowering re-use time to 24mins. I dont think 12mins would be bad either. What is re-use time on rampage for warriors? 10mins?<br>
<br>
Could also leave it at 72 minutes, but make it so that for the duration on the discipline, pet gains a temporary level boost. Insteed of being level 49, make him become level 59.<br>
<br>
Will dramatically increase his damage output on uber mobs by having him connect way more often, but ala manaburn, will not be much efficient while soloing/exping due to the long re-use.<br>
<br>

<br>
Wizards havent forgotten about the anti-gate spells we were supposed to get either, yet they never made it past test. VI does not forget about something, they are pretty much very aware of what theyre doing, maybe not always how or why they do it, but they still know when theyre doing something or not.<br>
<br>
After what? a year and a half now that they were supposed to go and they havent. I would just forget about it.<br>
<br>
If you want proc items, just hit the bazaar and buy a few Ykeshan War Clubs for 50pp each.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  Well, this is basicly the same issue we have, our pets suck aginst raidlevel mobs, their spells do not really hit (well they can after this last patch).

<br>
Just stated a possible fix to this by fixing frenzied burnout at the same time. No offense here, but your main way of doing damage is by providing rods for a wizard on a raid <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Good job at trying to take me out of context, learn to read please. Its not your pets they need to fix, its VT, the zone in itself.<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  forced to only make modrods <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
No one forces any mages to make mod rods. They just happen to make or break raids using one of the most powerful spell in game. Intelligent mages make rods because they know then that clerics (prime healers) and wizards (prime damage dealers) will then have an unlimited amount of mana.<br>

Its an inside joke about two friends of mine. They will understand it once they read it.<br>

If I told peoples that smoking is bad for their healths while having a cigarette hanging from the corner of my mouth, do you think I would be taken seriously?<br>
<br>
Do not preach what you, yourself, cannot uphold. I came here to have an intelligent discussion with intelligent peoples. Not to be told by the first comer that since I am a wizard, I have no room to speak about the problems of another class.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, pretty much all classes are broken at every level. A class only eventually balance itself out once youve attained a certain statue in wealth in the game. In the magician's case, its comes in the forms of:<br>
<br>
-Shield of Auras<br>
-Spell: Rod of Mystical Transvergeance.<br>
-Ability to summon the Epic Pet.<br>
<br>
Once youve acquire those 3, most if not all your complains will fly away. This is so easilly proven once peoples finally attain their epic pet, you already hear a lot less complaints from them.<br>

<br>
This argument is stupid in the first place, why would a class be balanced around just three must have items?  Items that basicly is impossible to get for probaly 99% of all mages. It may come to a shock for you, but the majority of the people that play this game can't kill AL. The epic is an other thing, most can't get it, especially if you never got the Earth Staff then your guild was lower level.<br>
<br>
Then even if you get those items it fix nothing about our pet on a raid, and this was what this thread was all about.<br>
<br>
VT might have problem with diffrent things, but thats not the real issue, the issue is that in a bunch of places you simply can't use pets on a raid. It have nothing to do with VT. What we simply ask for is tools to make it possible for us to use pets in those places. /pet hold helps alot, but it really just cover a part of what we need.<br>
<br>
Resist is an other issue with pets, it simply still not working, pets still get hit alot easier then a PC.<br>
Was fighting Sontalak, I resist his Fear easy, pet on the other hand didn't resist a single  (well hard to tell since after first Fear wore of he was on the other end of the canyon). There still alot of bugs connect with resist vs a pet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then we have FB, alot of test have showed in its current form is more or less useless, lower the recycle to 24, 12, 6 would still make it useless.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Most of the suggestions I read here been very good and in some cases required little to no work and wouldn't really add much power to a mage, it simply would make his pet more usefull. So why don't you instead add comments what the thread was all about, &quot;what would you like to see changed about pets&quot;. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=archangelranari>Archangel Ranari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#333333>(9/13/02 9:05:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=29>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsup.gif" align=absmiddle>  Changes I Would Like To See</span><hr size=1> HTML Comments are not allowed <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=327.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=327.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=327.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=327.topic&index=29><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=327.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=327.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=327.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> -
