People are having a bit of memory loss when it came to Magicians Pre-Kunark we were the damage class but it came at the price of very little in the way of utility and defense. Post-Kunark we didnt scale corectly and the subsequent expansions offered nothing in the way of upgrading us as casters, while every other caster continued to increase in relative power.<br>
<br>
Monks offer pulling and cr expertise to groups as well as decent damage and can work as a tank in a pinch even though they instituted the ac cap. <br>
<br>
Wizards have ports can ghetto mez with root, snare to prevent runner, and also has low resist and big boom nukes with various different resist checks. Also can solo quad quite well in the planes.<br>
<br>
Magician have Pets DSand Nukes everything else can easily be taken care of by that Mages who has been lfg at zone in for 3 hours if you really think about it.Trods have become more of a convenience item and all our summons are permanent for the most part. <br>
<br>
The bolt isnt the incredible nuke that wizards are claiming it is. The bolt has severe limitations. No matter how many wizards claim that magicians hit the bolt np in groups, thats an out and out falicy. I cant tell you how many times ive had the bolt miss the target for seemingly no reason or get blocked by someone who moved into my los at the last second. Also if the mob is fire resistant we have to go down to SoS a 825 pt nuke if that will even land. Wizards dont have this problem because they have nukes for all occasions. Wizards arent all about damage they are all about the variety of ways they can do damage they can do nuke damage no matter the mobs resists.<br>
<br>
This whole problem is this one stupid spell with wizards I say let them have it too and the make the spell conjuration and you will see them running back to Sunstrike quick fast and in a hurry. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wezloc@themagicianstower>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1234<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 11:08:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: It Begins</span><hr size=1> Lol this is shocking. I been saying this about the mage epic for the last week yet the ubers say &quot;WAAAAAAA I am sick of my epic I want better&quot;. They don't care that alot of mages didn't have to work for that better then epic pet. They just got it by hitting lvl 61 which is wrong IMO. The epic mage that worked for his epic should be stronger then the mage without. <br>
<br>
That aside all I can do is be happy with the new spells. As it stands I am only missing one spell to complete my offensive dominance and that is black steel. I know it will be at least 6 months before I see one level 65 spell but I would like black steel. I have the level 64 pet heal and the level 61/62 pets, Bo5, procing swords, Girdle of Magi'kot, Talisman of Return ect......<br>
<br>
Also lets be real please. A mage that has shield of auras, FT15, right click dd, 2600hps (self buffed), Ancient Shock of the Sun,  Gloves of Dark Summoning.......is far more powerful then the mage that doesn't have those things. I am very surprised though that verant gave us such a powerful offensive pet at level 62 and held the tank pet till 65. I can only hope it is a beast of a tank. The new rogue pet is truly a rogue if buffed properly. The new pets really gain from buffs and without them won't hit top end numbers. However i parsed my pet doing 88dps, and i just read the post of a mage saying that they parsed 95dps from their water pet. That is very impressive indeed.<br>

Proper positioning, the chance of someone moving at the last second to block it, and other crappy ways this spells can bite the big one, which includes out and out resists... overall unless you are pretty damn sure that you'll hit the mob, then it's not all that good. Heck, even in the Exe trials in PoJ, I stopped using FoT because it was getting resisted. Started using Scars of Sigil, used less mana and I'd do about 1500+ damage for about 450 mana, give or take.<br>
<br>
Yeah, the Big Band of a good FoT crit will make people ooh and aah. Hell I did it when my good buddy Conjem got his crits in. But overall it's a situational spell.<br>
<br>
Speaking of situations, I felt like a wizard the other day when my guild took out Telk in WToV. I got about 25k Worth of spell damage on the bugger, not to include the 4 different pets I sent at him (Epic would have lasted, but no bards = no resists). Half the fight I was running on fumes, medding up to 20% or so then running in to do a FoT. Hit for about 2k, then run back out and med some more... I loved it!!!

That is a problem across the board with most casters. Once you have your spells, there isn't much else to go for. There are a few items that stil seperate the ubermage from the johnny come lately though, but as guild creep occurs they become more and more common.<br>
<br>
Is the solution to nerf the pets that every mage in the game - since Kunark - has been waiting for? I may not be able to hammer Ssra, but as a Magician I consider pets and nukes a basic part of my arsenal. I should not have to dedicate entire weeks of my life to get these.<br>
<br>
The UberMage needs more definining and enhancing equipment like the Gloves of Dark Summoning. These spells are the basis of the class, having good pets is something that every single mage in the game shouldbe able to take for granted, with a certain amount of difficulty (the parchment turn-in system seems adequate for this).<br>
<br>
The problem with ubers is that the stuff you get from raids is not high enough quality to seperate the bleeding edge raiders from the average joe on the street in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>real terms</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. More mana, hp stats and resists is nice, an extra few points of FT is nice, not having to wear gimp summoned focus items is nice ... but a case can be made that its not really seperating the furious raider from a guy like me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=cyricusbloodbane>Cyricus Bloodbane</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1222<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 11:48:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=106>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://520013139003-001.bei.t-online.de/IWD_Human_Male_Wizard3.gif height=58 width=36></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: It Begins</span><hr size=1> Spells are our weapons and those should - like all melee weapons - from raid like encounters.

<br>
Melees <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>have to</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to do exactly what you described. Their new shiny armor doesn´t drop from  #a_Crystalline_Golem_01. <br>
<br>
What i would propose is an upgrade system. Let me explain: You can still get the basic scroll (Water pet_01, although less powerful than it is atm) but if you raid you can upgrade it / customize it to your needs. Much like the Vengeance I-XII line on melee items or maybe FT. <br>
<br>
It will offer all mages a base pet which they can upgrade the more they raid (or i should say the harder the raid mobs get).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As a sidenote: I would change FoT to have a range from 1300 dam (at lvl 61) to 2000 dam (at lvl 65). No way shoud a lvl 61 mage nuke for nearly the same amount of damage as a lvl 65 mage. <p><DIV *****"position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=0000CC, strength=4)"><center><a *****"font-family:Verdana; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none; font-size:14pt" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3300>Sage Cyricus Bloodbane</a></center></div>

Obtainable even by very small guilds now, FT 15? Well, i consider FT rather useless as i seldom run oom with C4 / C3 and a Bard, HP? I would go with better resists than with HP now after the Mod Rod fix... <p><DIV *****"position:relative; width=80%; filter:glow(color=0000CC, strength=4)"><center><a *****"font-family:Verdana; color:#FFFFFF; text-decoration: none; font-size:14pt" href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=3300>Sage Cyricus Bloodbane</a></center></div>

The melees you group with simply don´t know how to play their classes if the mob is running around like mad and they have to reposition.

<br>
You are starting to sound like a snob. Why is it ok for a mage to ding 61 and get a pet better then epic but it isn't ok for them to ding 61, and get close to VT equiped mages. Why is it ok to step on the face of epic mages but not those in VT+ guilds. Gimme a break. I can't even believe you are spouting off dare I say it nerfs to your own class.<br>
<br>
Mages finally get some power, and members of the class want to nerf that power to make yourself feel better then other people.  This entire argument is crap because I know, you know, that a VT equiped caster is stronger then one that is not. That extra 700hps, FT13, right click dd, Ancient spells, Various other Right clicks, runes, mana regen right click buffs ect...make you vastly superior to a mage that has none of that. Gloves of Dark Summoning alone make a VT mage stronger then one that isn't in VT. Also there are various focus items in VT that focus fire and mage damage by 26% with uber stats.<br>
<br>
Give me a break man. Why do you want to see mages nerfed when you know as well as I do that mages improve from gear probably better then any other casting class. Ya the new water pet can do 85dps against experience mobs. So freaking what. The Epic pet was able to do 75dps against experience mobs. For god sake two epic pets tanked Zel in UP to death! So we gain 10dps from this water pet, at the cost of major tanking ability. Sounds like a fair trade off to me.<br>
<br>
Parchment is rare, and I have not gotten a new spell in a week. I still don't have black steel. A level 65 mage with Sun Vortex, lvl 65 pet and spells, VT and PoP loot is much stronger then the mages in a bone caster robe with FoT. If a mage in VT gear and above can't own a non-raiding mage by a good 30dps that is because the person behind the mage sucks.<br>

Black Steel has higher dps but has a worse ratio. As a matter of fact Ancient Shock of the Sun still has a superior ratio to all the new mage nukes, even Sun Vortex. Also having Shock of Sun to use along with Black Steel and Fire Bolt of Tallon is a very nice edge to have.<br>

Since the game began spells have been easier to come by than weapons. Weapons and armour you went out and adventured for, spells for the most part were available from vendors or through research of varying difficulty.<br>
<br>
In RoK spells become a bit harder to get, with some being rather rare drops. However a mage was still able to get by with his pets, they were available en masse, a few were quite rare but at level 60 you were rewarded with the easier to get version of the water pet.<br>
<br>
In Velious a mage could expect to get all of their spells through the course of normal adventuring. The hardest to get spells dropped from dragons in Western Wastes that are doable with single groups. Other spells were more common.<br>
<br>
In SoL many spells dropped from named mobs of varying dificulty, and quickly became available to the average joe mage for a few thousand plat. Prices were more expensive if you wanted them <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>now</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> but trickle was very, very fast.<br>
<br>
Why should the basic underlying principle of the game that spells are in general easier to come by than weapons change because these spells happen to be quite good?<br>
<br>
I'm sorry Cyricus, you are a good guy, but if you think I should walk around with my <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>pets</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, the very core of my class, being gimped just because I don't play the raiding game you know where you can shove that idea.<br>

If you have issues with the fact that the standard of loot you are getting from raids is not good enough, then make a thread about that.

<br>
Try and keep the average guy down and he will spit in your eye and tread on your face mate.

BS and i am not here to make friends at all. Fact is parchments are much too easy to come by and therefore all spells are much too easy to come by compared to melee loot. <br>
<br>
Risk vs Reward is gone with PoP (at least for Casters). Melee loot is worse than everything from Vex Thal or Emperor.. Hell, i would even say whole Ssra.<br>
<br>
Yet we gain power by simply picking up a parchment which drops in a exp group- fair you say?<br>

Rofl...<br>
<br>
Well Cyrius you said it, your in  an Uber guild and parchments aren't rare for you, but they sure are rare as hell to me, and 98% of the people I know, and those posting here.<br>
<br>
So you want to know the rewards for being in those type guilds.  Your in places that they drop commonly, while the majority of the people can't get there yet. One reward you are obviously over looking.<br>
<br>
Your in level 3 or higher tiers, without needing those new spells to make it, unlike some of us that will need them to pass, because:<br>
<br>
1: Our mana pool is less than yours by a lot<br>
<br>
2: You can take a lot more hits than a mage because of your  gear.<br>
<br>
3: Your have a lot more FT and if your tyring to do a trial, that extra mana and FT may let you get off the finishing spell that many may not be able too.<br>
<br>
4: You have VT focus items, and they work on your level 61 spells, and as I have none of the new focus item, my old focus items do not effect any new spells.<br>
<br>
So tell me again how your equipement doesn't make a difference? <br>
<br>
That's right, your so use to your FT rate, the huge mana pool, all those extra hit points and resists, that you don't realize the difference they make. <br>
<br>
Those without it, though have a lot harder time than you will in the same encounters BECAUSE of those items you claim don't make you better. If they don't I would if possible gladly swap my ToV gear for yours. After all spells and pets matter, the gear makes little difference.<br>
<br>
We both know you wouldn't because they DO MATTER. I gather being in a top end guild makes you jaded and wear blinders to those without those items you take for granted.<br>
<br>
Though let me ask you one very serious question, when you got some of those nice drops from the Emperorer and in VT, did you tell anyone? Did you send a link to anyone outside of your guild. Did  you say WOW this is nice and am glad to have it?<br>
<br>
If yes? WHY if they don't make you better playing your class than before? The gloves of dark summoning alone gives that magician a better pet than one without. ISN'T that enough? You get a drop in a hard dungeon, a huge time sink, and the reward is you NOW HAVE THE BEST PET in the game BAR NONE. No other magician unless they also do what you did to get them will ever have a pet as good, and you say well you know it isn't good enough.<br>
<br>
That is a holier than thou attitude and I really never expected to hear it from you. That gear gave you a better pet than anyone else, but it is not good enough for you, and the stats as excellent as they are, mean nothing? The effect not worth it? Why wear it or even bother going if there is NO reward you feel justifed, if the average magician is as good as you.<br>
<br>
The truth is, your gear does make you better. We all know it, and I am sure Jaytee with some of the best gear in the game will agree, that the gear he wears makes him a lot better than the average magician, if for nothing else his mana pool, regen rate, hit points and the ability to survive longer than the average magican do to all those items.<br>

I cannot in all conscience understand how you could wish for your fellow Mages to be nerfed. The only conclusion I can draw is that in your Ivory Tower you consider the rest of us unworthy of these new pets and spells.<br>

If this is what the moderators have come to here, if this is what the Tower stands for, keeping the average joe mage down, then I want nothing of it. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A> at: 11/8/02 2:11:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=vhailordarsithanon@themagicianstower>Vhailor Darsithanon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 2:29:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=119>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: It Begins</span><hr size=1>      I am so SICK of the snobbish attitudes that come to the forefront in this game. In my time here at the tower I have had the likes of Noonie tell me I have no right to bitch about the DPS and mitigation abilities of the GV pets. In a nutshell I was told by Noonie &quot;I used to feel the way you do when I was your level...but now I don't...get over it.&quot; Followed by,&quot;Maybe you should try parsing the damage sometime before you leap to these judgements.&quot; I have and do parse...I simply had my opinions disregarded and belittled because I was not &quot;Important&quot; enough to have a valid concern and thusly it was assumed that I was too stupid to have done research or have amassed any data. What prompted this? A &quot;It was ok for me to bitch when I was your level but now I am level 60 and MY pets got upgraded so bugger off.&quot; attitude.<br>
<br>
     I have been told on the serverwide channel that I would be laughed out of PoP if I tried to get a group there with my current gear by Myrradin. (sp?) Granted it was my fault for asking if I could survive grouped there in my gimptastic gear...but still would a bit of compassion for &quot;Joe Average&quot; be too much to ask. Perhaps some positive reinforcement or advice instead of mockery and laughter?<br>
<br>
     Now a new attitude rears its ugly head...61 plus spells should only be available from raid mobs??? Cyricus let me ask you...if all that raid loot doesn't clearly enough separate you (a raider) from me (a gimp) then why do better equipped people spend so much time laughing at and mocking people with a similar gear loadout to mine? Why are people in my gear/guild situation relegated to watching from the sidelines as noncontributers?<br>
<br>
     The only conclusion that I can draw is that obviously its not enough to have one piece of gear that nets the stats of any four pieces of gear possessed by &quot;Joe Average&quot;. Obviously all those right clickies some of us will never see are not enough. I suppose the only way some people will be happy is if &quot;Joe Average&quot; doesn't sully the Planes with our presence unless we are willing to ass kiss our way into Uber Guild_001....at least until the &quot;Upper Crust&quot; is far enough into the planes that we will not get in the way. Oh yeah and until the &quot;Upper Crust&quot; has managed to farm enough droppable loot and spells to rape and pillage &quot;Joe Average&quot; out of cash he doesn't have...all the while laughing at how gimp the stuff they are charging 100k for is compared to the gear they are wearing.<br>
<br>
     I will not deny the accomplishments of the above Mages nor will I dispute their contributions to our class as a whole...especially not Cyricus who for a long time I have believed to be our number one contributor. That being said...the above attitude not just in the framework of a single class but in the framework of the game as a whole, is utter and complete garbage.<br>
<br>
     Anyone who feels that only the upper 10% of the population of a game with a patronage of over 400,000 should be allowed to progress and have fun needs the jaws of life to pull their head out of their ass.<br>

P.S. And before any flames start shooting in...no I am not a disgruntled ex or wannabe Uberguilder. I am precisely where I want to be and doing what I want to do. I do not &quot;Hate on&quot; Uberguilders as a rule and I could care less about all the &quot;Mine is bigger&quot; piece waving. When I do get pissed is when it is being insinuated that people like me do not deserve to play this game,enjoy this game or advance in this game because some of the &quot;Upper Crust&quot; do not believe we have &quot;Earned&quot; it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calebe>Calebe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 2:32:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=120>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: It Begins</span><hr size=1> Strong words Hogfeather, but I agree it sounds like Cyruis wants not only better equipement, better effects, better pets (hello gloves of dark summoning), but wants to ensure that no magician but people that raid in the top guilds should ever get anything without them SELLING it to you.<br>
<br>
I notice you said their guild sold spells, so they are not against magician's and others getting those spells, but they want us to pay homage, and beg them to take our plat, so we can get our spells?<br>
<br>
What is wrong with this picture, and if the answer make the spells no drop, and that would be the end of the game as far as I am concerned.<br>
<br>
Casters play to get their new spells, it is what makes the game fun. Now we raid to get those great new robe, the clicky effects, the stats and hit points of those uber drop, just as melee do, but spells are our bread and butter.<br>
<br>
Could you imagine being in PoP without the new nuke Talons?<br>
<br>
Hell I lost a fight to a grizzled Treeant in PoN, even with Talons hitting for full, without it, it would have been pathetic, at least I had it down to 20%.<br>
<br>
I am forced to group, the new pets (wish I had them), but I do have epic can't last long, as hard as these mobs hit. So my epic pet and Talons and I am a damage dealing class, but lost the ability to solo. A fair trade in my book.<br>
<br>
Take away my spells, and make them off boss mobs, I can't kill because that is where the spells are, and I need them to kill it. Ohh that's right the uber ZERG raid force of 60+ in the top tier guild will rush in and kill the mob, than those mages will have the spell, but no one else till they rape you over the coals for 50,000pp plus.<br>
<br>
Bull I say, you get the Uber Robe01, the Uber02 clicky item, you wear your gloves of Dark Summoning, and out pops a pet better than mine, and you want to take away our spells, because they are worthless. Please don't even go there. it is a lie, and you know it, or destroy them if they do nothing. Of course they do something.<br>
<br>
Sorry Cyrius your wrong on this, very wrong.<br>
<br>
You get your rewards for being in the top tier guild. LOOK at your equipement, and tell me it doesn't make a difference, and if you say it, than don't loot another thing, because it won't matter. IT DOES, you know it, I know it, and everyone on this board knows it. Get off the soap box of trying to deny your fellow magician their spells, because your guild can't make another MILLION PLAT.<br>
