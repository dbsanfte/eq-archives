Quote:<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
I'm making a definitive post on the matter... Whoeve the brainiac at Verant was that said &quot;Hey, what a good idea, lets make it so SEQ has to use the EQ machine to get the key!&quot; was just signed their own termination papers... or if that persons boss is smart, that's what would happen.<br>
<br>
The fact is, with the lid blown off of the Linux version, forcing us to use a leech on the Windows machine, there is absolutely, positively no reason not to have a WinSEQ... and it is now inevitable anyway. If we don't do it, someone else will... because the port really is trivial.<br>
<br>
The social contract that we've enjoyed for so long has been broken by some idiot brain (hows that for an oxymoron?) and the corporate suit who agreed with it (who obviously had absolutely no concept of the implications of his or her actions)... and since it's been broken... as I say on the main page... Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war!<br>
<br>
I hope Verant is prepared to ban $100,000's in revenue... because the download staticsics on the new libEQ.a were startling, even to me. I had no idea so many *UNIQUE* people were using libEQ.a.<br>
<br>
In one way, it's sad... it's the end of an era. In another way, it's funny... the absolute hell and damnation they have just brought down upon themselves is staggering. Prepare for an onslaught of thounds upon thousands of users using SEQ ... prepare for mass bannings. Prepare for chaos and stupdity... but in the end, SEQ will still exist and Verant will be out HUGE monetary sums from the bannings.<br>
<br>
Welcome to your own little corner of Hell, SOE... you have no one to blame but yourselves for this. I hope the millions of dollars per year of lost revenue will make up for banning the *mostly* responsible SEQ users out there.<br>
<br>
SOE can't stop SEQ... that's what at the root of the humor. It will always be there, in one form or another. They had a nice little deal going here, keep it contained and as responsible as reasonably possibe, for ZERO development and operational costs. Now, not only are they going to have to expend resources to find and detect SEQ users, but they will ALSO lose revenue with the banned accounts. This is a NO WIN situation for Verant. There is no possible financial benefit to this move, ALL POSSIBLE outcomes are detrimental to the profitablity of EQ as a commercial entity.<br>
<br>
Instead, they've chosen the path of chaos, and not even Sony can tame chaos in any meaningful and lasting way. So let them reap the chaos whirlwind they have sown. I will not hold it in check any longer. Let the Windows versions flow! Let the commercial products SELL. LET THEM RUIN THEIR OWN GAME with the thoundsands of moronic idiots using SEQ.<br>
<br>
The bar has been broken, there will be NO barrier to entry now, and there WILL be a bannings aplenty, make no mistake. I expects hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of bannings. I expect utter horror and chaos, ridiculous actions by SOE and othe opposition. But in the end, this will only harm us, the players, because the game will be ruined in new and imaginitive ways... because Verant can't stop them all... and they will keep coming, and coming... and coming. But by harming us, they harm themselves, because they slowly erode their player base.<br>
<br>
I wish good luck to the Verant programmers, because I know their life just turned into a living hell... most just don't know it yet.<br>
<br>
I liken the new order to Echo Star hacking. The smartcards DTV and Echostar use for encryption are INFINITELY more secure than the joke crap that Verant could use (because the smart cards are ASICs designed SPECIFICALLY AND SOLEY TO do FAST, SECURE decryption)... but Dish and DTV can't stop the signal theft? Why? Because you CAN'T STOP the dedicated hordes of people that work for free. You CAN'T thrown enough money at a problem to overcome thoundands of people, working together and seperately for a common goal... all for free.<br>
<br>
If Huges Networks, and Echostar can't defeat the problem with sophisticated smart cards and tens of millions of dollars spent per year to prevent people from intercepting HEAVILY encrypted signals, do you think the piddly little budget of EQ can even get close? Haha, not a chance.<br>
<br>
Anyway... it was a good show the whole time and very enjoyable. I'm sad that it has come to this. The rushing flood waters are already speeding towards the little EQ village... what will remain standing after the wave crashes over the town limits is anyones guess. I feel I played fair and did my part in the whole EQ deal and there was nothing more I could have done, so I am comfortable. Now it's SOE's job to pick up the pieces in the aftermath. I don't envy anyone that job, and I feel bad for some of you that are going to get washed away (banned) by the flood. The only advice I can offer you is DON'T BE STUPID. Think about what you are doing before you do it. If you don't feel comfortable with your conclusions, ASK... and then weigh the risks. I also suggest you pick up a good C++ or VB book and figure out how to write your own key sniffer.<br>
<br>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a war to fight. Oh wait... no I don't... I can just let the waves of inevitibility wash over our opponents and crush them far quicker and easier than I could ever manage with my meager resources. Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war indeed...<br>

<br>
vi fiddles with stuff so that seq no longer works the way it &quot;traditionally&quot; did, meaning indetectibly from a second box running linux. <br>
you now need direct access for the key, so you have to run the packet sniffer from the same machine as the one running eq. this means you will have to make a windows port if you still want seq. <br>
the guy at seq is obviously upset his proggy is messed up so hes predicting hell and damnation for all at verant.<br>
<br>
heres where im confused. why is it bad that there is a windows port? why will that result in bannings as the linux version never did? i have come up with 2 theories:<br>
1) i may be wrong here but i believe the primary reason this is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>bad</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is because it is more readily detectable, which will result in being banned or warned. <br>
2) a windows version which you can use with only 1 comp means that it will just be more common to the average player, and the havoc that results from players using it will cause bannings.<br>
<br>
well i look at it this way. less than 1% of the eq population probably uses seq, with only slightly more than that even possessing the know how or equipment to set it up. maybe  little more than 1% on the red servers, since tracking is such a huge advantage.<br>
<br>
if reason #1 is why this change will &quot;destroy vi&quot;, well all 30 existing seq users per server will be banned, and anyone else who tries to use it (which will be bound to happen as it is easier to run) will also be banned. eventually the player base will be conditioned to understand just like other hacks, seq = a ban.<br>
<br>
if reason #2 is why mr. seq thinks vi will be destroyed, what he has to understand is just because something exists, is beneficial, and within a persons grasp <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>doesnt</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> mean everyone will use it.<br>
i am completely sure that more people will start using seq. will <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>most players</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> use it? no. does everyone use eqwindows?  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=useseq>useSEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 4:19:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7687.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: SEQ Declares War on VI - Show EQ for Windows availible</span><hr size=1> Hrmm...<br>

<br>
now that the code library is open-sourced, nothing can stop it.  nothing except shutting down the game.  even though they could try to...<br>
- change the encryption.  doesn't matter, they key to the encryption is on your computer (otherwise you couldn't decrypt and play).  the key is simply ripped from memory and now SEQ works.<br>
- scan your HD for the program.  sure, they could do that and face up to life imprisonment.  it is illegal to scan your hard drive and transmit data back.<br>
- have EQ not run if they detect a leech program in your task manager.  there are many ways to 'hide' the leech program...not really an issue (think, how do viruses do it?).<br>
<br>
bottom line, the biggest impact (and believe me, I really hope this doesn't impact us) is that every n3wb starts running SEQ.  somehow SOE detects and bans the players using it.  number of players online decrease, servers shut down, prices go up to cover costs.<br>
<br>
to me, this is similar to what happened with client hook and OGC for counter-strike.  damn near ruined the game for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=useseq>useSEQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 4:36:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7687.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: This isn't good...</span><hr size=1> Noonie,<br>

If EQ developers make Key reader (simple to make) for Windows box running EQ, VI may scan the computer for it.  If they DO scan memory and processes, they are going against On line Privacy Act or whatever they call it.  VI should not be scanning our computer's memory or processes.  If they do, they can be in BIG trouble for it.  <br>

LOL!<br>
<br>
What SEQ is supposed to do, from what I understand, is basically give you godlike (zone wide) tracking.  With maps!  VI doesnt include what the mob is holding in the packets anymore, so a SEQ user doesnt know all.    A packet sniffer can only see whats actually IN the packet! <br>
<br>
Sounds to me like a quick, easy way to check spawns.  Ban users?  How do they (legally) know your using it?   If I am using ANY kind of packet sniffer on my machine, how is it VI's biz?<br>
<br>
Will I use it?  Doubt it seeing how I haven't even got around to loading a new UI &amp; dont use WinEQ.  Heck I havnt even been able to log on in a week.  Sure hope some smart guy in my guild uses it to save time &amp; find targets.  =)<br>

so then, you think that the game will be ruined because everyone will be using seq?<br>
mm nah i dont think so. definately <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> people will be using it, but most people still wont. people like us who read the message boards and keep up to date on the games happenings are a minority. <br>
the &quot;average newb&quot; you speak of doesnt even know what seq is, much less how to set it up. he still wont know even after it becomes available for windows.<br>
<br>
ironically enough, by throwing this fit in public mr. seq is only helping the &quot;newbs&quot; find out about it, since all the casual graffes/monkly business/safe house readers will see it :/<br>

Really not that hard, A contract that you CLICK is binding, And it can allow them to search for this proggy. Wich is why I supsect they changed the port to make it usable only from the main comp. In a bit they will probably get thier lawyers to add a line like above, Then they will start legaly banning SEQ users. <br>
<br>
This is not a stupid move by VI, They are luring SEQ users into the open and getting ready to nail them. Watch yourself guys, And watch that conract I have a feeling its gonna change soon!.<br>

Btw, In the past sony has scaned hard drives, The admited to it and apologized, However I have no doubt they will do it again once they change the contract. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=solovey>Solovey</A> at: 11/1/02 5:29:06 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kylere>Kylere</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 337<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 5:33:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7687.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I mean</span><hr size=1> Man this SEQ guy is a bloody loser.<br>

They held off on this change for a loong time, I have a feeling that have been developing a dynamic key or a special way to track for the sniffer.The nerf  from the second box was probably so they could nail them easier.<br>

<br>
Show EQ is undetectable by VI through any &quot;legal&quot; means?<br>
<br>
WinEQ is undetectable by VI through any &quot;legal&quot; means?<br>
<br>
Therefore I could find dino's camp without having to log off load allakazam write down /loc and log back onto EQ?<br>
<br>
Where would I download both? (wineq stopped working on my machine after luclins install, and I can't remember where I DL'ed it)<br>
<br>
I like having the ability to be able to check my email, etc while playing EQ.  Everyone knows theres only 3 good reliable ways to get ahold of me (email, icq, eq), and I hate not being able to see if someone wants something without having to completely log out of EQ (I mean character select should at least allow me access to my progs).<br>
<br>
I remember UO had &quot;approved&quot; 3rd party software that you could use with their game, heck UO even decided not to develop their messaging system since it was easier for them to let people use icq.  The simple thought that we can play a game and have no ingame ability to map it out is horrible in itself, I mean having to write down /loc's or subject them to memory is a pretty lame setup.<br>
<br>
The more I think about it, the less sence it makes for VI to keep these progs down, we can all pen and paper every zone if we wanted to, whats it matter if we map it electronically?  Sure tracking mobs might be a bit much and make rangers/druids/bards tracking completely obsolete but that doesn't justify VI having the right to completely lock me out of my progs while I am running their application.<br>
<br>
I won't put in the other 3 pages I typed about how fun mage taming and fishing thunting was in UO, and how 3rd party software made both a little easier, they didn't make it game breaking.  Since it is moot, UO actually made somethings check vs items in possession as opposed to sending packets with that information in them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7687.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7687.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7687.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7687.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showMessageRange?topicID=7687.topic&start=101&stop=109>6</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showPrevMessage?topicID=7687.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showNextMessage?topicID=7687.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7687.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.threadControl?topicID=7687.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7687.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=7687.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral>General</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.101<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.<br>Accelerated By <a href="http://www.wbs.com/ezboard.html">JXEL</a></center></body></html>
