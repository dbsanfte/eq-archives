&gt;How do I tell when a pet is &quot;mezzed&quot; and when it is <br>
&gt;not?<br>
<br>
   I assume you mean a monster.  Your pet won't be getting mezzed by the enchanter.<br>
<br>
   If the mob is mezzed, it'll just be standing around doing nothing.  If it's not pounding on someone, leave it alone.  An enchanter will generally take all but one out.  Good pullers will pull the one main target a bit to the side after a mez, to seperate it from the big pile of mezzed ones, making it easier for everyone to target.<br>
<br>
&gt;And I also played with a Bard to stated when a battle <br>
&gt;started an 'auto message' that the mob was 'snared'. <br>
&gt;What do I do? How do I know that this is done and <br>
&gt;will my pet break both of these?<br>
<br>
   Your pet will not break snare.  The earth pet root spell used to replace (overwrite) snare, which made them unpopular in groups.<br>
<br>
   The &quot;auto messages&quot; can be confusing, simply because spells get resisted.  I'm not fond of people that put such a message in a hotkey with a &quot;cast&quot; button, because then when you see &quot;a %t has been snared/malised/whatevered&quot;, you still don't know if it's true.  It's better to only send such a comment after a successful command.  I know you're going to _try_ to snare/malise/whatever, and I can see the spell effects.  The only thing I don't know is whether or not it was resisted.  That's the thing to tell party members, not the fact that you're casting.<br>
<br>
&gt; From the above good remarks I can see that I should <br>
&gt; sit with my pet in the BACK of our group and wait to <br>
&gt; send my pet in AFTER the battle starts and ONLY to <br>
&gt; the mob that the main tank is fighting. Am I correct? <br>
<br>
   That's more or less the idea, yes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Keeping the pet in the back of the group can help keep incoming critters from beating on it.  Staying in the back of the group yourself helps keep them from beating on you.<br>
<br>
    The /assist command has various quirks and bugs, and depending on your puller's technique may not be that reliable until you're actually in the fight.  Any group (with enchanters or not) should have a designated &quot;assistee&quot; whose job it is to pick targets.  That's usually the puller, or a secondary tank.  The most efficient way to fight almost any battle is to take down one target at a time, as quickly as possible, rather than spread your attacks around.  Consider that wounded creatures still do full damage; the way to reduce the damage your party takes is to kill them, while hurting them does nothing.  One dead and one full health critter hurts less than two half-health critter.  Generally, people prefer to take down the spellcasters before the melee-type mobs.  (Sometimes, groups will prefer a different order, say if they can keep a caster mezzed easier than the warrior, so they attack the warrior first.)  Good communication is important.  But generally, as a mage, you'll just be following the main assist's choices.<br>
<br>
   The various forms of &quot;crowd control&quot; (mez, root parking, one kind of kiting, or sometimes even using the pet to occupy a second target) are all just ways of getting one or more creatures out of the battle without killing it, while you work on one of them.  If you have to kill two things, you'd rather do it one right after the other.  If you fight both, one hits you for the amount of time to kill it, while the other hits you for twice the amount of time to kill it, for 3x damage.  If you mez or park one, the first one hits you, then you let mez wear off, then the second one hits you, for 2x damage.  Keeping the monsters from hitting you is the flip side of you hitting them.<br>
<br>
&gt;Also, what does the /pet as you were....statement <br>
&gt;make my pet do? <br>
<br>
   It just wipes your pet's memory, returning him to<br>
a nice neutral state as though you had just summoned it.  It will forget all about anything it had been ordered to attack, anything that hit it, where you last told it to guard, etc.  It's useful in pet control situations to clear the pet's &quot;hate list&quot; of things that have taken a swing at it, so the pet won't automatically move on to the next thing on its list.<br>

<br>
I have had enchanters make hot keys annocing what mobs they have mezzed and have the message in Caps and spam it a couple of times to make sure the group sees it.<br>
<br>
But as one of the other mages pointed out the best key to pet control is paying attention. <p><p><font color="#0000FF">Crispinskyhawke<br>

If the my pet is on the wrong mob, I assist the main tank, and make sure I have it targeted.  Then I hit back off a couple times, then start alternating back off and attack so that once its agro list is cleared by back off, the mob I want it on is put on its list.  This usually gives the enchanter time to mez the mob.<br>

<br>
First thing about pet control:  Group early in your character's life...  Soloing can be fun and better, but you won't learn the first thing about pet control if you do.  I will usually try to get a group and solo until I get one...<br>
<br>
I saw it mentioned (not sure by who) that they don't use the assist command and rather they use the pointer to target.  I will use the assist command, but I won't send in the pet until I see the mob's hps go down to at least 80%.<br>
This has saved me a lot of trouble.<br>
<br>
The only other thing that I feel is good for pet control besides what was mentioned in other posts, is if you make a mistake, own up to it.  A lot of people that complain about this mage or that mage, have been in a group with a mage who had poor pet control and wouldn't own up to their mistakes.  I would rather own up to my mistakes and learn from them, then sit there and not take the blame...   Because of this, I don't have a bad name on my server.  When I say, &quot;It wasn't my fault this time,  I was assisting the main tank, and it wasn't my pet that broke the mez&quot;, my groups will tell the chanter to listen to me because I will own up for my mistakes.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion on things.  <br>

<br>
Earthen boots (or DE /hide ability)<br>
Focus item (if u have to get rid of pet might as well get mana for it)<br>
The ability to type /pet get lost fast (if your casting u cant use above)<br>
<br>
If you dont have all the above dont group.<br>
<br>
There is allot more to pet control but ive seen here or in other threads..just thought i would add these things.<br>
<br>
Yes paying attention is an important aspect..but also knowing when to cast spells like nukes etc is as well.  U cant use pet control buttons, EB or Focus if your nuking or casting.<br>
<br>
Also if sometimes u may get hit by a mob u dont see or your trained or something pops right on top of u...if the mob isnt single its probably best to focus the pet away really fast so the chanter can mez and the tank can chose the mob he wants to kill instead of you pet dictating the fight.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
So many subtle aspects of pet control its hard not to wright a book on it.  Just keep in mind even if you group from 1 to 50..u still can learn more.  Also at the 50+ level when if you mess up the chanter dies and if this happens we all die, its easy to learn some new tricks.<br>
<br>
btw doesnt matter how bad pathing is you can always use a pet...the question is..is it worth it?  Ie u can use a pet in hate however u will be constantly watching pet..sometimes not sending it in, you cant cast anything (ie u cant use buttons yada yada yada) and you will go thru like a hundred pets before u know it.  Not to mention a mage in hate gives people a heart attack when they summon pets(if they dont know u that is).  However, if u dont use pets in hate...it still should be memmed since its a great spell to cast during potential wipeouts and clerics are camping.  Earth pet can tank mobs for a bit giving time for cleric to camp...however air pet is best for those clerics of innoruk who want to heal everything.<br>

<br>
If you're malising mobs (as I was doing last night in a CC Queen group) you sometimes get resists.  Make a hotkey like this:<br>
<br>
/g MALISE LANDED - %T resists decreased<br>
<br>
Press this if you get the 'your target looks uncomfortable' message because,<br>
<br>
1) Its easy for group members to lose this in battle spam<br>
2) Everyone but magicians and shamen (who also have the same line of spells) will not know what this means.  Adding the description really helps the group. <p>Edano<br>

But to answer the original question. I dont brag that I have good pet control. I more or less feel that I dont have BAD pet control. Like a nuke for a wizzy, a sword for a warrior -- pets are our weapons. The big difference is that if we dont know how to use it we can get entire parties killed. If a wizzy cant control his burning he just gets himself killed. <br>

I just learned not to be so darn eager to send Jobn in. If your dealing with Chanters/Multiple Pulls then be patient. #1 rule -- Wait for the MOBs to get mezzed before you do ANYTHING. Once they are mezzd target tank -- throw a DS on your him(since he has waiting line for his loving now). Now hit /assist and Mala the MOB. Mala doesnt break Mez so you can VISUALLY see that you hit the right MOB. Now send in Jobn. In this case you have gotten DS and Mala out of the way and have given the Tank plenty of time to aquire the target and get a good assist off of him.<br>
<br>
And when it comes to indoor grouping... I tell my pet to back off when MOB gets down to about 25 - 30% health -- back it off before it turns and runs. Let the tanks go chasing. Due to pathing and such your &quot;command distance&quot; can be SEVERLY handicapped indoors. <br>

OOC: Sorry, I mostly do all posts in character no matter where I post. I have a 47 mage, which I usually solo.  I went to the Hole as my mage as my first dungeon expierence. Knowing what bothered me as a warrior allowed me to control my pet and always stay on target when sending it in. My pet and I survived until the end. *smiles* I find my mage very challenging tatically, and will continue to play her after my warrior gets to 60 (in a bout three levels). <br>

<br>
Using /assist <br>
<br>
You hit /pet attack<br>
<br>
Nothing happens. . .<br>
<br>
Because the point at which you hit the /assist the puller had switched targets to con some other mob, not the one incoming.<br>
<br>
The very next thing you need to hit is the /pet back off, /pet as you were.  You want to clear the aggro of the pet from that target.<br>
If you don't, the pet will still have that target on the hate list, and it will run to attack it as soon as the mob comes within range of you.  Can get very ugly if your pet suddenly takes off out the door, down the hall, etc. to go attack that mob.<br>

<br>
1.Make sure u have a /pet attack and /pet back off command<br>
<br>
2.Before u send pet,make sure u assist several times<br>
<br>
3.Pay attention to which mob ur pet is on,and keep hitting /pet back when he is on wrong target<br>
<br>
4.Every time u get hit from mobs,hit /pet back off and re-send pet<br>
<br>
BTW,making hot keys for malise serious spells doesnt help with pet control =)<br>

<br>
1. Pay attention<br>
2. Avoid getting any mob aggro on you.<br>
3. Making sure pet stays on the proper mob with proper use of /pet back off and /assist.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of other things that can help. Such as knowing pathing, timing /pet back off with mez/stuns, using /pet guard here and so forth. However those top three are in my opinion the most important. <p>Zurrin Zypher <BR>

This will kill your pet AND clear your aggro. Using earthen boots after your pet has engaged something far from the group may be suicide (although steping away from the group and letting the resulting train just kill you is a good idea too... or gate if you can get back to the group quickly).<br>
<br>
Never use /assist until you see the mob life bar go down.<br>
<br>
Not sure if this was said, but when a add mob hits you while your pet is attacking something, say /g add, wait patiently for the chanter to mez it, then hit /pet back off. In that order. If you hit back off too soon the mob will hit you again and your pet will attack the add.<br>
<br>
Except for the above case, when in doubt tap /pet back off every once in awhile.<br>
<br>
Just before a mob dies, tap /pet back off just in case. Pet may have some aggro on a mezzed mob while you weren't looking and will switch targets right when the current one dies.<br>
<br>
If you are really feeling like a super man and the pet is on the wrong target, you can hit /pet back off between monster swings while the chanter is casting mez. Only do this if your chanter can't or won't stun though, and if you are really with it and have no lag. Quite frankly I just spam /back off and hope the chanter stuns first or I back it off with enough time to get the mez on. <br>
<br>
Finally, if you have your epic pet or a very strong pet relative to the mobs, sometimes you just say &quot;%$$% it&quot; and let the pet solo an add its stuck on. Make sure you tell your chanter that you might do this before the group starts, and say /g pet mezzing %t whenever you give up controlling the epic. A healthy buffed epic can easily solo a mob below level 51. If you don't have an epic and the pet is stubborn, click your earthen boots.<br>

<br>
1) Target the puller using F#, then assist once or<br>
2) make a hotkey everytime you get into another group for /assist &lt;puller's name&gt;<br>
<br>
The second one, you can tap tap tap away on so this is what I would reccomend. 15 seconds building a new hotkey when you first join the group is well worth the time compared to having to fork out the time and money for a group wide rezz. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 123<br> <font color=#333333>(8/5/01 5:38:24 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=38>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mages who brag about controling their pet</span><hr size=1> Just a note, msot of you probably know, but Verant nerfed Call of the Hero so that it doesn't clear you own agro anymore <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showMessageRange?topicID=35.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showPrevMessage?topicID=35.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showNextMessage?topicID=35.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=38><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.threadControl?topicID=35.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=35.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> -
