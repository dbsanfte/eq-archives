Just set up camp right near the center is someone is camping the eyes and pick off gorge minotuars as they tromp by.  Exp and cash are rather free flowing, and there's little competition for minos(unless a large low level group [<20] is camping the eyes, in which case they will most likely be kiling minos as well.  The lord eye's charm spells often clears groups like that out, though...) If you can break the spawn at the entrance then you should be able to pull continously as soon as your ready(not nessarly FM, depends on your elementals level/type a bit).   <BR>  <BR>   Chasam minotuars will still be yellow, so don't try them without full mana, if they have an axe you had best have at least a 16th+ pet if you hope to win without chain-casting(Personlay I'll hold back enugh mana for one more earth elemental+fire shield [200 or so, 45% about assuming you have around 125int] until I'm certian that I can win with shock of flame agenst thoes things.)  If you've never chain cast before the key is to start casting just as the pet's getting ready to die, but not to late(remember, 9 sec cast time on your summoning spell), then issue the /pet get lost (from the keyboard, hotkeys won't worrk while casting) command just as the casting meater hits the last bubble.  <BR>  <BR>   If the eyes arn't campted you had best give up on this zone.  You can pull to the zone borders, but you'll have 2-3 mudites with every mino for the most part.  Usualy I just head over to NK in this event(I'm usualy bound on the beholder maze/NK border, NK side). <p>Destil Shadesk, Mage of Torpid arm, Turbid Soul, and Zommic Eye.

What I found was a gold mine of experience! <BR>  <BR> From lvl 16-20, you can base yourself at the bridge and solo elephant calfs, then move up to elephants, then some of the lower centaurs. This works best with an earth pet, but will also work fine with a water one.  <BR>  <BR> There has always been plenty of people that hang at the bridge that would be willing to sell you a SoW. Be prepared to pay them...it is well worth it. <BR>  <BR> If you get into trouble, you can zone at the bridge. You can also sell at the merchat at the second floor of the bridge. <BR>  <BR> I solo'd from this bridge from lvl 16-24. I mixed a little of the aviaks in for some fun, but soloing is where the exp is at. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwiizbang.showPublicProfile>Wiizbang</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(2/8/00 1:47:05 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   East Karanas</span><hr size=1> Personally my favorite is East Karanas.

This place is great xp but very crowded.  As such it can get very annoying as there are only so many spawns and too many people.  U can usualy get in a group of one or two people and do well.  The best solo spot is at the bottom of the lake in a little cove.  The deranged Hermit spawns about every 6 minutes gives good xp but lousy loot, although he drops words and all the water u will ever want.  Many people do not know of his existence.  Most do not hunt him because he does not drop the gold like the birdies do which makes them so popular. <BR>  <BR> After fighting the crowds in Lake rathe I and my friends were looking for places a little less crowded.  We headed to the Ocean of Tears and hunted on Aviak Island...once you clear the greenies it was pretty good xp. <BR>  <BR> If u have a good group you can hunt the goblins on the oracle island, but you have to have a good group and especialy a good puller and someone that can do crowd control.  A tough challenge but if your are good u can make good cash and great xp. <BR>  <BR> Lastly Beholder is pretty good, pet pathing is a little weird but you should be fine...just keep a lookout for the eyes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukinzix.showPublicProfile>Kinzix</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Global user</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(2/15/00 3:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.monstermart.com/mmstore/assets/product_images/DK02311lg.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Red Gargoyles in OOT</span><hr size=1> This is not for the faint of heart. <BR>  <BR> The Gargoyles are soloable in OOT at 16. <BR>  <BR> I did it for a while and made some great exp. <BR>  <BR> Deaths: 0 <BR>  <BR> Here's my tactics to help out anyone that wants to try it: <BR>  <BR> Rule #1: Get a GOOD pet.

I used bolt to give me extra running room because I was without a SoW or JBoots. <BR>  <BR> Run back to your pet. <BR>  <BR> Tell him to Kill the Gargoyle. <BR>  <BR> Target pet and fireshield him. <BR>  <BR> Enter melee with the garg. <BR> The garg will then start beating on you, this is the sqweemish part since they hit sometimes in the 40's. Allow the garg to beat on you til you get around 40-50% health. <BR>  <BR> Back off and nuke the hell out of it with your lvl 16 DD spell. <BR>  <BR> The garg will be aggro on your pet the rest of the battle and not come after you while you nuke it from a safe spot. <BR>  <BR> I would end the fight with 40% health and mana, my pet would be anywhere from 40-60% health depending on the redness of the gargoyle. <BR>  <BR> It is risky but worth it if you like living on the edge. <BR>  <BR> Kinzix <p>"Those who fear the darkness have never seen what the light can do."

1) Go to South Karanas and bind urself at the bridge in either north or south karanas.<br>
2) Find a necro freind.<br>
3) ESSENTIAL: GET SOW<br>
4) Summon pets(level 16's work but 12's r better because they don't attract the monsters attention as much, altho they died more)<br>
5) Find a red conning elephant or a yellow conning centuar.<br>
6) You, the mage, pull to the pets which should be guarding at bridge, use firebolt for headstart.<br>
7) Send pets on it and have necro cast all DOT's on it and u nuke it as much as u can.<br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON STOP-->  Elephant SHOULD get pissed at u first and chase u.<br>
9) Run around while necro finishes casting DOT's and pets beat on its back.<br>
10) Once DOT's do enuf damage the elephant gets pissed at necro and begins to chase him/her.<br>
11) You nuke, pets whack, and DOT's eat at the elephant until its dead.<br>

I think it's great.<br>
<br>
Unfortunatly I am running out of Death Beetle, Greater Skeletons, Jack-O-Lanterns and Tormented Dead that are Blue.  they are nearly all Green now.  i suppose that means I need to start on the GHOULS.<br>
<br>
Oooooh. *shivers*<br>
<br>
At least I have a magical weapon.<br>
<br>
Phew.<br>
<br>
I suggest other people take a look at Unrest.  I was surprised how good it was for me a such a low level. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umilcheax.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Milcheax</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_bluespot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#333333>(11/11/01 9:48:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Level 16-20</span><hr size=1> I'm working my mage at 16 in Stonebrunt.<br>
Had him right outside the Warrens zone for 20 minutes, killed 8 spawns, made 4.5 blues with barely breaking a sweat.<br>
I'll eventually be trio-ing with a 16 Necro and a 15 Shaman here as well, and the exp just rocks!<br>
The only problem is, for my mage follower of Erollisi and the shaman follower of Tribunal, it's a long run to Erudin for bankage and spells.<br>
Now that TLC has been removed, the quests are a lot more viable to do, as well! <p><center><table border="1" width=87% bordercolor="0000FF"><tr><td>Mileron</td><td>Singer of the 42th</td><td>Crusaders of the High Plains</td><td>Xegony</td></tr><tr><td>Miradorn</td><td>Summoner of the 16th</td><td>Crusaders of the High Plains</td><td>Xegony</td></tr><tr><td>Milcheax</td><td>Solitus Trader, 15th level</td><td>The Aardwolf Rebels</td><td>Rubi-Ka 1</td></tr></table></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uquinean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quinean</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/02 2:13:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm41.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   OOT</span><hr size=1> I did 17 and 18 on the Alluring Sirens in OOT. They turned light blue at 19. You could easily do 16 there as well. <br>
<br>
There are 2 islands at -1000, 2000. There are 2 Sirens on the southwest corner of the northern island, and a 3rd Siren on the south edge of the southern island. The 2 on the northern island did NOT help each other out. There are aqua gobs on the southern isle that were green to me at 17... they may present problems for lower levels.<br>
<br>
All 3 are about a 6 minute spawn. Doing the set netted me about a blue bubble in both 17 and 18.<br>
<br>
Consider doing the gargoyles after the Sirens light out on you.<br>
