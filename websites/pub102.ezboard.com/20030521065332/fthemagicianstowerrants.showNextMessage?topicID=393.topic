In my experiance it didnt seem that mages could solo too effeciantly in the planes, but it sickened me when I saw a Druid, Bard, and Wizard (on different days mind you) all able to solo quite easely in the Plane of Nightmares. The Bard was doing singles while the druid and wizard were doing quads. And from the little bit that I soloed in the planes, I got 3-4% per kill of alternate with 100% going into it. I dont dare solo there now just because of the downtime and the risk I run by bumping into other mobs, but these people can do 4 at a time?! Sorry, but quad kiting was already broken, now it's really broken. It's absolutley rediculace. SoE, do your job and do some balancing... Please.<br>

I don't mind the loss in soloing ability so much. What I do mind is that it's taken over 3 years to get Mages back to their pre-Kunark days. /rude SOE and VI. <p>- Ignitz Gemcaller<br>

And I see nothing wrong with that...<br>
<br>
What I am asking is why should druids, wizards, and bards be allowed to solo so much more effeciantly when they can be just as usefull to a group as mages are?<br>
<br>
Btw, I wansnt asking for druids, wizards, and bards to be nerfed, and thats the last thing I want to happen to those classes becuase I know when they bring to any group. But maybe they should do something to the spells they use that maybe it would have some other kind of check so they would have to look for groups like the rest of the world has to instead of soloing and then complaining that they aren't powerfull enough to do anything solo and have no groupablity.<br>

At level 65, it's nearly impossible from what I hear. I have a few level 57+ druid and wizard friends who quad kite there and get insane xp. Anyway, I know how you feel, and it is very annoying, but Magicians are much more useful in PoP groups then lots of the classes out there that spend most of their time quad kiting in the planes. When I group in PoP, the mob goes down maybe 25% faster and easier than it did before I joined. And yes, I too believe quad kiting is totally ridiculous, but Magicians have one of the best roles in groups IMHO.<br>

<br>
That changes somewhat if you go way out of your way to get the epic, but I have no plans to do so based on the strength of the 61+ pets.<br>
<br>
Sadly they neglected to balance the magician class as a whole, and simply made minor improvements in the 61+ class abilities, while at the same time, balancing the environment so these improvements are useless by themselves (aka solo).<br>
<br>
I've said many times before, this is partially about the class, and mostly about the environment. Magicians have always solo'd best against static spawns that are 1-4 levels away from going light blue.  VI stated that they did not like this a few patches ago, and nerfed our most viable form of xp. They brought it back in the next patch, but took the road of setting up an environment in which we no longer have large quantities of low blue mobs that we can solo against.<br>
<br>
Our lack of defensive capabilities prevent us from effectively soloing in the 1st tier planes, due to the large #'s of wandering yard trash. The only way soloing is feasible would be with constant chaining, and theres way too much risk to do so in most places.<br>
<br>
VI needs to consider some more zone revamps and allow a few solo-type places where people can drop by and xp without the hassle of going LFG when they only have an hour or so to play.<br>
<br>
Rthen is making some similar points in the main section of the board, and by and large, he is correct. It is very difficult for casual players to acquire all of the spells necessary to be powerful, and even if you manage to do so, you don't have the same options for casual soloing once you're done. <br>
<br>
When I hit level 61, and can only play for a few hours, what are my options?<br>
<br>
1) Parchment farming. 1 drop in 5 hours, you must group to get one. If I'm playing for 3 hours what are my odds? <br>
<br>
2) Hill giant farming: I can go make lots of plat so I can buy spells off of people who have the time to pharm them. Hmmmm, the gap between the haves and have nots gets larger, as while I'm farming plat, I'm not gaining xp. Whereas, the people farming parchments are gaining xp, spells, and gaining lots of cash while selling off the extra spells.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I fail to see why someone should be able to get 4x + the exp of a normal group in the plains just because they have snare and some targeted ae's, while all the other classes have to be forced to go LFG because of the class they play.

A class that can fight without the mob touching them can always do well compared to a class that uses tankage as defense. Warriors/rogues are best examples with being close to the worst solo class around.<br>
<br>
Mages by who we are do not avoid damage but transfer it to our pets. This will never be the bast way unless we get a super good heal that out does any cleric heals.  So in a way it is a weakness to the mage class much like mob control is, but we make up for it in other ways with our ability to have close to wiz DD ability with nonstop pet DoT.  Necros are much better then mages at soloing for the same reasons.  Who cares if your pet has low HP if they never get hit. As long as they put out good damage then low hp pet will do great for them, so it really doesn't matter to them if the mob hits for 50 for 650 it's all about HP of the mob and can they kill it with their mana.  Mages like other tankage classes care alot about what the damage of the mob is and can they kill fast enough to effectivly solo it. <br>
<br>
Now in group or raid environments the mage out shines these guys being a class that blends much better with other classes. I work 3 times as hard as a wizard does during a raid and in may cases raids will not go on without the mage support.<br>
