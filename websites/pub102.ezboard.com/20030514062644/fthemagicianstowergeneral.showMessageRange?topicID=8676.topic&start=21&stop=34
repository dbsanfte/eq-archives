Yes, it's good for you that you are having xp income while others still looking for a shaman instead of taking a BL. <br>
<br>
I was merely asking questions that I don't understand about BL. Since I am not a BL. I never said that BL can't be use in a pet group. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I can slow 65% and on top of that<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> add on DPS between and monk and rogue</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.

 <br>
A little correction on my previous post, the bolded part sounded as if a BL can do damage over a monk and less than a rog. While it can/may also meant it can add on dps on top of having the monk and the rog. If it's latter, my bad on mis-understanding it. <br>
<br>
And the 2nd bolded statement, is like saying a pally can buff better than cleric(which we know is not true).<br>
<br>
If BL can do that, I would want to know how or if that was a mistake made by that poster. <br>

True but if for BL to keep up with the *other* buffs on the group, he'll probably need to sit out a fight or 2 in a while to med back.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ylaine76>Ylaine76</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1221<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/03 1:28:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..?</span><hr size=1> There is 1 bst total on my server with the 65 spell (even if that) so I dont think at this point we can really say BSTs have a 65% slow since thats just not realistic<br>

I have even had an extra copy offered to me for sell hehe.  Thing is we only have 2 65 spells so it doesnt' take much to get em much less have extras to sell off to other beasts.<br>
<br>
As for DPS, I meant greater than a monk in most cases.  I am talking BST + Pet mind you.<br>
<br>
As for slowing, it is only 150 mana and a 1.8 cast time(if I remember right, it might have been 1.9 seconds... we get innate hybrid spell casting haste on our slows).  Believe me, before anyone even engages I normally have the mob slowed and then can tack on my dps without a beat.  Mana can be an issue but normally is not much of a problem for me in a well balanced XP group.  It helps that I have FT4 (working on upping to FT7 if I can find some ornate boots hehe).  <br>
<br>
As for stat buffs, I forgot one key thing, shaman CAN get Infusion of Spirit (level 49 for them, 61 for us) if they do some parchment turn-ins to a BST spell quester.  I just haven't heard any do it and doubt they ever will being Focus of Soul is the better choice (One buff verses the 6 I will have to cast to beat it).  Also note I normally only fully buff the tank (partial buffs to other melees).  Doing everyone is indeed a huge manasink then.  But, I have found in a good xp group that is the only one who needs them.  <br>

<br>
When PoP first came out and mages were having a hard time finding groups in PoP because no one understood the damage they could do, I retired my 60 mage.<br>
<br>
I started a twinked shammy. Hes 57 now. Thus let me lend my insight.<br>
<br>
Shammies and Mages are both similar and yet totally different. Let me break it down into Solo, group, and raid situations. Its impossible to compare one to another without first putting them into one of these frames.<br>
<br>
Solo: Here is where the shammy is most like the mage (at higher levels). At lower levels the shammy tanks for his pet and lets the pet act like a dot. At higher levels a shammy gets good bufs, and its more manna effecient (at least for me right now) to buf the hell out of the pet, let it get agro, then start casting on the mob. The damage we do to the mob via casting is different. Shammies use dots because they are more manna effecient than DD or resummoning a pet. Its cheaper to heal the pet when its hurt, and to keep a regen on the pet. Shammy heals are much more efficient than mages. Mages on the other hand either strictly chain summon pets for damage, or go the pet/nuke route. Or a bit of both. Either way, the shammy and mage both use pets to do a considerable amount of damage. Yes mage pet does way more, but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
The shaman can use his root stop a runner or to get agro off him much like the earth pet helps a mage. Shaman dont get Damage shields, but they get slow which decreases the damage. So, lets talk about this a bit.<br>
<br>
While soloing mages do a bunch of damage really fast both by the mob killing itself on a pets DS and by the pet meleeing and the mage nuking. Shaman take the slow and steady route. They slow the mob, the pet doesnt get hit as much, it doesnt have a DS so thats not a biggie. Shammy pet doesnt do nearlyas much damage as mage pet, but thats ok because it does damage over a longer period of time (mob lives longer, but doesnt swing as much) and the shaman is either Doting it, or tanking it in the face (doing damage).<br>
<br>
The shammy also has insane mana regeneration, but he needs it because his spells cost way more than a mages. Its a crappy way to balance a shammy, but thats how they did it.<br>
<br>
Now real life experiences using a shammy vs a mage lvl 50 +. The zones: Scarlet Des. low 50's, Jaggedpine mid 50's, Katta high 50's. I did all these zones alot with both shammy and mage. First let me describe my gear. The mage was typical ghetto. 1FT at 58+ and typical int gear. The shammy was also ghetto, with the exception that i started him with a fungi tunic. This is an advantage at lower levels for teh tanking regen, and at the higher levels for increased mana regen via cani.<br>
<br>
At low 50's mage was more powerful solo. The shammy pet at that level (even hasted with the shammy hastes) could not hold agro so the shammy ended up having to tank the mob which meant less mana regen for spells because I couldnt cani as much. Shammy melee without an uber weapon is much worse DPS than a shammy DOTing. The mage 51 earth pet ate these mobs with a DS chaining. The shammy cant chain, had to dot and tank. Mage was superior.<br>
<br>
When the shammy got his 50's pet (55 i think) Things changed. I moved to JP. The pet does enough damage to hold agro. (by holding agro i mean holding agro through a shammy DoT). In JP at 55 both the mage and shammy did about the same amount of damage. I'd call it even. At 56 I bought teh shammy a horse. 56 my shaman did more exp/hour than my mage, but its not a fair comparison because my mage never had a horse. I'd fullty expect that my mage would do as much damage as the shammy if he had a horse.<br>
<br>
At 57 I moved to katta with both. Here it gets a bit tricky. The mage and shaman both are not able to single pull at 57. (I think it was 58 before i could reliable do this). They are able to single pull Nathans. When doing Nathans the shammy kills about as fast as the mage did, however my shammy has a horse. The 57 Mage pet is a monster. Without a horse (and definately without a fungi) the mage is far an away teh better Nathan's kller. It's different at bank or twilight though. Since the mage cant get single pulls, he has to try and do 2 at once which is manna inefficent. The shaman can root pull. Root one and the other comes. This makes the shaman better at splitting.<br>
<br>
The other thing to consider is that the shaman has way more utility, and a generally doesnt die solo. Shaman can root if things get out of hand, always has sow up and can run away. Shaman has a ton of ac and hp and can take a beating. They can heal them selves. That said, I think the skilled mage has a slight to medium advantage soloing in the 50's.<br>
<br>
At 60 from what i understand a shaman can match a Mage exping in areas such as fungus Grove IF they have torpor. The solo tactic for a shaman changes. The shaman tanks and keeps the mob on him. The pet stays at the mobs back. The shaman doesnt worry about dieing because with Torpor and Cani 4 you can generate huge amounts of manna to re-heal yourself or do more damage. Its common to tank 2 or 3 shrooms at once and keep them dotted. Shaman kills alot slower than a mage per shroom, but you are killing 2 or 3 at once so it evens out.<br>
<br>
There is a problem with this. Torpor is a 80k-100k spell. I'm not likely to see it any time soon unless i hapen to luck out and win a roll on it on a VERY rare drop.<br>
<br>
At 61+ solo shifts to the shamans favor. Why? Its not slow. Its root. Shaman cant tank pop mobs. all that extra hp and ac basicly lets them live a coupla more seconds than a mage. The reason they can solo is simply root. Slap on some dots, cast some DD, sit your butt down. End of story. Its innefecient, but it is possible.<br>
<br>
So, to recap, Slow solo in the 50's doesnt lend an advantage to a shaman. The only place where it does is the 60+ shaman who is trying to solo a uber old world/kunark/vel mob... and thats not for exp.. thats for loot as it can sometimes take upwards of an hour.<br>
<br>
Now for: Groups: Here the shaman and mage go thier seperate ways. A mage in a group is all about DAMAGE. CotH some, rods a little, and a buttload of DAMAGE. People still dont realize how much pure, raw damage a mage and his 60+ pet can do. Its a shame. The shaman is all about mitigating damage. Shamans do this by thier large line of hp/ac/stat buffs, Regenerates, and slows. Shamans will also haste if there is no chanter around. Shamans typically in exp groups will also have thier pet up for a little extra damage. Shamans are so busy casting thugh that sometimes they forget to send pet in. Dont laugh. A exp fight for a shaman is hectic. shamans Malosini a pull before it gets to camp (esp in pop) so when a slow fails we dont get beat down. We cast slow 1+ times till it sticks. We then refresh regen/haste. we then chain cast cani to get the god awful amounts of mana back we jsut dumped. Byt that time its either time to pull again, or refresh another buff. Its hectic.<br>
<br>
Mage by comparison is easy in a group. Send pet in once mob ingages with tank. Wait a few seconds. Nuke. Sit but down. Wait till mana coms back up. Stand. Nuke. Repeat. Summon focus items for people who did not respond the 10 times you asked them before if they wanted any. That type of thing.<br>
<br>
Practical advantages/disadvantages in PoP exp groups: PoP needs a slower or a very specialized group. An all mage group with a cleric or 58+ druid works jsut as well, if not better than a traditional tank/slower/CH'er. Getting 4 or 5 mages together is a pain though. You either have to have insane damage output or you hve to somehow slow the mob to give you enough time to do the damage.<br>
<br>
Ok. So how do you slow it? Here is teh kicker... the worse/slower the damage output,the more you need a shammy. Shammies are the best slowers at 75%. Thats 10% above a 65 Beastlords, and 25% above beastloeds/bards, 5% above chanters. You can get along with any of these slower. You just need more Dam/min if you have a lower level slow. Thats it. Its not rocket science. Also, if you have less damage output than means its gonna take longer for the tank to pul lthe mob off the slower. Shammies typically have the highest HP's of all slowers, so the shammy has a better chance of living longer. This is crucial in a smaller group.<br>
<br>
Because if this, the BEST duo in pop is the Mage/Shammy. Mage for damage/CotH on a bad pull, shammy for the pull, slow, heal, and buffage of the pet.<br>
<br>
As was stated before, slow does not stack. Damage does. The best PoP full exp groups are a SK/pally, a shammy or a chanter, a cleric, and 3 mages/rogues. The chater doesnt slow as good but has better crowd control. However, if you have mages that isnt an issue as teh pets offtank the add.... and typically kill it before the tank kills his.<br>
<br>
So is the shaman more powerful in exp group? Yes. Slow is nice. However there are a flood of shaman coming into PoP now. Ive sat LF group for 30 to 60 mins before ive gone off and soloed because there were 5-10 shaman lf group in pop. Each group only needs 1 shaman. Full groups, as they become more educated, will take more than 1 mage. Its currently easier to get a group as a shaman, but it IS changing.. I think it will eventually balance out with the shaman slightly more able to get a group.<br>
<br>
Raids: The last of the categories. slows dont stack. That said, you need 1 good shaman for a raid to happen. You dont need any mages for a raid to happen. And its always nice to have more than 1 shammy to buff other groups. Typicall raids have 3 shamans, sometims more. They are essential to raids. Mages are not. They nerfed us hard when they took away the rods. They made up for it in single group exp situations, but were are fubared in raids. No one cares ina  raid that a mage does lots of damage. Its even debateably that they do alot of damage ina raid where the raid level mobs have gobs of ac (lowering damage on pet) and gobs of resists (lowering damage on nukes). This doesnt matter for a shamn. Shamn slow and buff. Extra mana might toss in a ice nuke or two, but never a dot cause we dotn want the agro. Slow and buff is the important part.. light healing on group members or spamming heals ont anks so CH ring doesnt get agro in teh beginning are plusses also.<br>
<br>
Mages do damage on raids. Who cares. Everyone does damage on raids.<br>
<br>
Shaman have the advantage over Mages on raids hands down. That said, raids are typically guild events and a guild is not likely to turn down mages on a raid. That would be plain silly. So maybe the raid category is a moot point anyways.<br>
<br>
Anyways, thats how I see it.

DPS vs Slow<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the only way for a group to exist effectively vs unslowed mobs is with an enchanter charmed pet.  With pets doing easily 200-400dps, it's usually enough to make up for a non slowed mob.  However, enchanters can slow just as easily as they can charm, so the balance of power shifts two fold to the group's favor.<br>
<br>
Gotta love charmed pets!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=thedwellerindarkness@themagicianstower>thedwellerindarkness</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 441<br> <font color=#333333>(2/5/03 8:17:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..?</span><hr size=1> Further advantage of charmed pets is that they can absorb lots of damage, put out lots of damage, and when they get low on health you can simply kill them for full xp. Charmed pets ARE a fine alternative to using slows, but that des nothing to help the majority of players as I see few groups using charmed pets. It's usually soloers or duos using this technique for amazing xp. Of course it hurts even more that the people going off to solo with charm are the ones that now are most NEEDED for groups for slows. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=balanzsonofanz>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 2845<br> <font color=#333333>(2/6/03 2:28:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>In my opinion, the only way for a group to exist effectively vs unslowed mobs is with an enchanter charmed pet.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I do pet groups <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">all</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the time with <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">no</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> slower.

at ~62 mage is most powerful in terms of pet power in relative terms. Mage just get new pet and still a lot of lower tier mobs are blue (PoI/PoN?).<br>
<br>
Since at level 65 you will need to be fighting higher lvl mobs for xp, the ones you can get xp before is now green. (PoI entrance is green at 65 and so it PoD/PoN)<br>
<br>
so to the mobs that is blue to lvl 65, pets seemed to die too fast .. in another word, a balanced group tend to work better at 65.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jochangaladar>Jochan Galadar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 908<br> <font color=#333333>(2/6/03 4:59:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=33>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>so to the mobs that is blue to lvl 65, pets seemed to die too fast .. in another word, a balanced group tend to work better at 65.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>

If a mob enrages, it is probably at least level 58 (and blue to a 65), and that being said most of the mobs in Valor and Storms enrage.  I have done magician duos and trios in both Storms and Valor with NO slower, and NO downtime.  Excellent experience (short of charm soloing, of course.)<br>
<br>
The answer to having alternatives to slow is having extremely mana efficient damage/tanking.  Reclaim chaining accomplishes that, and remarkably well.  Even regular chaining (supplemented with KEI or similar) will also do quite well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tenner>tenner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(2/6/03 9:55:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   no down time? </span><hr size=1> no downtime with a mage duo in valor? <br>
