The spectre hits pretty hard and casts a necro drain spell on you or your pet. Approx 1 out of every 3 fights u will come close to death or your pet will come close to death becuase of aggro. I only had Fire and Air pet but I think Earth pet would be really nice in this situation because of root (to keep spectre off of u) and massive health. Fire pet just couldn't maintain aggro very well. If u could get off 2 blazes then the spectre will run but getting those off is tough becuase your so busy running through your pet so it can reestablish aggro for you to blaze again. The spawn time is fairly quick and nothing else in the area can hurt u. your pet can easily solo anything else in the area in case u get aggro'd while medding. Be carefull fighting the spectre but its really cool when u do it for the first time. Never thought I'd be hunting spectres. And my fire pet did die once or twice but luckily it died at the moment where the spectre turned to run away. Phew. The normal scythe it drops sells for 10pp but the others scythes it drops sell for about 3pp. u can make a lot of money selling the scythes and gems the spectre drops. Just have your dimensional holes ready. And your pet will be at 30 percent health and be full health before u go Full mana. The pet regen is just insane.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 1.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Be careful of how close to the spectre you are when you sit to med. If a skeleton agros on you the spec will assist it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I came back at my bind point wondering what the hell happened.?! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
On top of the ridge closest to the zone wall is a fairly safe spot (baring a train out of fear, but in that case no place near the entrance is safe).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 2.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Be careful if there is someone pulling from the inside if they pull from the inside, the solo will add to their pull, and sometimes vice-versa. Plus sometimes if the specs go back in after a bad pull they can't make it back to their spawn points. This makes it so they can agro sometimes when you fight the solo if you happen to get too close to the cave.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 3.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Specs are weird in their agro. You can run by like 10 feet in front of them and they will not agro, but attack another spec from max bolt range away and the fraggers will jump right in to help out (exaggerated, but you get my point).<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 4.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Keeping all the previous things in mind, it is sometimes possible to get a single pull from the cave if you are really careful...<br>
<br>
-Kill the solo spec as normal.<br>
<br>
-Park your pet in the ditch between solo spec spawn point and the cave entrance.<br>
<br>
-Then slowly walk into the cave until you can see the first spec. Target him and come back out to the same ditch.<br>
<br>
-Try to cast malise (ONLY malise type spells, DD WILL agro the others all the time). You should be out of range if not, back up until you know you're out of range, then slowly edge closer until you can cast but are at max range. From my experience max range is about where the green moss turns to stone.<br>
<br>
-Malise the spec and back up past your pet to where the solo spec spawns.<br>
<br>
-Wait til the spec comes out and gets to where your pet is then tell the pet to attack. You have to wait for the spec to get to the ditch, any closer and you will agro from the cave.<br>
<br>
Wait a few secs before you nuke to make sure you only got one spec. Keep close to your pet because if you pulled a second one it will warp out right on top of you. If it does warp out on top of you then you can usually make it stick to your pet my training your pet.<br>
<br>
After you're sure you have only one, kill as normal.<br>
<br>
As for pulling the rest out, it's all pretty hit and miss there. Sometimes I was very successful at pulling the roamer (especially when he was close to the entrance) but most of the time it would pull the third spec out with it.<br>
<br>
With J-Boots or SoW it's pretty easy to experiment since the specs are slow as maple syrup in winter time. Just make ABSOLUTELY sure to have your AC/HP gear on and keep shielding/phantom armor on AT ALL TIMES. Every single death I've ever had here I didn't have these up. Probably 80% of those deaths would have been prevented if I had.<br>
<br>
Good luck, and have fun farming and exping at the same time!<br>

Noe this is a subject i have plenty of experience on: <br>
<br>
1. Use Earth pet. Some will tell you fire but i found a high lvl earth will not only have the HP to go toe-to-toe with the spec but the root will keep you alive. <br>
<br>
2. BOII your pet and DS him. <br>
<br>
3. Sit and park you pet on top of the hill in front of the solo spec. Keep that short leash otherwise pet may pull something you are not ready for.<br>
<br>
4. /pet attack<br>
<br>
5. While pet is running down hill, Malase (sp) the spec. This reduces MR and allows you to hit for more. <br>
<br>
6. Cinder Bolt 3 times. This may cause aggro but your pet's roto should hold him. If not back up as he comes toward you until pet roots him again. You may take a hit or 2 but not enough to cause any real damage. If you are lucky, being above the target may cause 1 bilt to hit twice doing double damage. This is a great tactic which will save you mana. <br>
<br>
7. Sit and med<br>
<br>
8. IN 5.5 to 6 mins get up and try again. <br>
<br>
9. Make sure you have 2 dimentional holes. Specs drop Scythes, Bronze Scythes and rusty scythes. Keep the Scythes (11p) and the bronze Scythes(3p) but destroy the rusties. Once you have filled all slots, go collect your paycheck.<br>
<br>
WOOT its that simple. I have been there since 39 and I am now 43 and climbing. When there were hell lvls I got through 40 in 10 hours. I have ben screwing around a lot lately so i have not lvl'd but i always know that if i need to BANG..go kill a few specs...<br>
<br>
Hope this helps, <br>

<br>
I have an air pet equipped with 2 summoned daggers, 1 defender, 2 coldstones and a suit of phantom plate.<br>
<br>
I burnout pet, DS him and then pull spec with malise. 7/10 the malise sticks. if it doesn't, I dont' bother to reapply. I sick pet whiel I med up and Blaze the thing intermittently. After the 2nd Blaze it usually aggros on me, but Air soon re-establishes aggro. and I nuke again. if the pet is low on health, I alternate Renew Summoning with Blaze.<br>
<br>
EVentually pet flees. I would have used 40-60% manna which is easily meditated back before the new spec spawns.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER!!! Not all the Level 39 pets have the uber regen. I ahd an air pet who, liek the level 34 pets, onyl regenned 1% per tick, not 4% like the previous one.<br>
<br>
DON'T LET YOUR PETS DIE!!! If the Specs frenzy on your pet when it's low on health, step into melee range. The spec will target you and then begin to flee without even hitting you! This is due to health %ages and you should still be at near full! I've rarely lost more than 2 bubbles of HP to a spec, even then I quickly slap on Phantom Chain to regen it all.<br>
<br>
My way is fairly manna intensive and pet-leaniant which is nice because it means less downtime for me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uiwanthewicca.showPublicProfile?language=EN>IwanTheWicca</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#333333>(7/11/02 12:07:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=41.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Ammendments</span><hr size=1> Okay, just dinged Level 40!

<br>
First equip your pet with...<br>
3 Daggers of Symbols<br>
1 Elemental Defender<br>
2 Rings of Flight<br>
1 Coldstone<br>
1 Satchel of Phantom Plate Armour<br>
<br>
Med up to full, Burnout pet and DS with Barrier of Combustion.<br>
<br>
Pull Spectre with Malise and sic pet straight away. Cast Blaze 3 times, running aroudn as necessary. By the time you've done roughly 1100 damage (3 blaze and 1 shock of spikes) the spec should be fleeing. Med as pet finishes off, then poke your ehad into entrance of spectre cave. target 1st spec, run out to max range and pull. Spec should eb single pull. Do the same as with other spec, but wait until ti gets close before sicking pet.<br>
<br>
I've foudn that occasionally a single extra spec will loom up on me while medding. Due to most pets insane regen, ti shoudl be 100% when engaged, but it may not be. You'll need 2 bubble of manna and 3 good un-resisted blasts of Blaze to kill it, using your own HP bar as well.<br>
