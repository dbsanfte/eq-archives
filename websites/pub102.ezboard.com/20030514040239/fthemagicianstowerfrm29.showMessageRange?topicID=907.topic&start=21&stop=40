This will sometimes make kinda funny effects, pets often have higher agro when the melee standing close, so it is not totaly uncommen mobs summon pets instead of lowagro melee even if both fighting them.<br>
<br>
DS itself add no extra agro, the only agro you get from a DS is if the mage try to cast it on someone already agroed on a mob (this can be yourself just inside proximity of a kos mob). But this is true for every buffs, test this, go to N Tov, wait until someone pull a drake (must be kos), get close to the drake, invis yourself (or any other targeted buff) and you will get a factionhit, selfonly buffs not counting. This is way giving a modrod during a fight will sometimes give you a factionhit, and if you want to avoid factionhits in Tov, always DS before the pull.<br>
<br>
There also a huge between mobs when they will be able to summon. IV is a good example, archers can acctaully take of 3-4% of him before he be able to start summon, snakes in Ssra on the other hand will start summon after they hit a DS once (always pull with malise, I got summoned once with a cast of Burst of flame).<br>
<br>
An other thing to prove that DS add 0 agro, DS yourself, go to Commons, sit down in an Orc camp, watch the whole camp kill themself on your DS (do not hit back, have pet or nuke) every single orc will just depop give no faction, no corpse, this happens because no dmg was done that could count toward a specific player.<br>
<br>
There also other aspects to gaining agro, if a mob agro you, but it can't reach you for some reason (rooted or pathing issues) it still will keep track of what you doing and you will gain tons of agro. <br>
One example to test this, have a druid kite around something in GD giants wars, and kite to close to spearmens, that druid will not think anything about it, he will heal, buff and whatever, the moment someone hurt that spearman, guess who it will summon ..  the druid, and in many cases that spearman wont stop summon the poor druid until either one of them is dead. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drokaten>drokaten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(12/24/02 9:06:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PoP pets VS Epic and agro on multiple mobs</span><hr size=1> o i see what you meant.. if you weren't so hot to flame.. you'd realize that i had started to say 'i never said' then realized i had IN FACT said that.. so modified my 5th post to say 'on a pull'<br>
<br>
but its perty obvious you don't want to do anything constructive in this topic (zephyrr) .. you just want to be argumentative..<br>
<br>
tell you what.. heres how you get your pet to hold agro better on a multi mob pull..<br>
<br>
its called invest in /pet hold..<br>
<br>
send your pet in.. let him get intial agro.. then hit pet hold and run back to camp..<br>
<br>
mobs won't even bat an eye at you..<br>
<br>
i will MAINTAIN however that a ds'd pet will retain more focus than a non ds'd pet during the initial stages of combat.<br>
<br>
and for god sakes will you guys quit trying to explain to me bout the dmg meter being 86'd on ds and attributed to the server .. THAT is something everyone knows... <br>
<br>
the reason you dont get that faction hit.. is cause the server Wipes the mob.. not because you didn't have agro silly goose.. you don't get a faction hit when a pull on tunare goes wrong and she poofs either..<br>
<br>
you don't get xp/faction etc when servant of ro inadvertanly ks's your mob and it poofs..<br>
<br>
its exactly the same as banishment.. that doesnt have Jack to do with agro..<br>
<br>
<br>
OF COURSE YOU HAD AGRO THEY WERE ATTACKING YOU  LOL!  listen to what your saying..  at the VERY least you had the pull agro..<br>

In this case, yes, casting the DS does generate aggro, but it creates the aggro of any other buffs being casted on someone with aggro. The Damage DS's do are not accredited to the caster of the DS.<br>
<br>
Mobs start summoning when a certain amount of HP has been taken from it, thus any mob (unless otherwise coded) can be debuffed to wazoo on INC or before inc without summoning people. Once damage is done to it though, it will still summon the top people on it's aggro list, which happen to be the debuffers, aka chanter. It's also why some monks prefer to run by mobs to get aggro, as opposed to throwing a star or something at the mob...so they don't get summoned trying to pull mobs and instead can outrun the mob, then FD.<br>
<br>
And as to the first poster, it could be because epic is lower level and has low level aggro attached to it. I don't think they coded the pets themselves any differently. Epic, as stated before, also has more procs to keep aggro, which coincidently happen to have a stun component with them (aggro city). It's no suprise to me that the epic holds aggro better than PoP pets.<br>

<br>
yes.. we've Proven time and again the damage meter is environmental.<br>
<br>
that does not mean that it did not have hate <br>
<br>
the mere fact that a mob was even engaged on you gives you hate.. and as someone pointed out.. just standing close and casting a benficial spell..  gets you hate..  <br>
<br>
chain snare on that mob 1000 times in commons  before he poofs.. you STILL won't get a faction hit.. but tell me you didn't have hate.. thats a silly argument everyone knows that snare generates (some would argue) Excessive amounts of hate.<br>
<br>
damage and hate are NOT the same thing.  however.. damage can create hate.. <br>
<br>
but you can create hate without damage..<br>
<br>
picture a mob as having multiple flags that you can set off..  the hate list is NOT the dmg list<br>
<br>
ie a cleric gets clobbered cause he ch'd the MT.. <br>
<br>
again.. your guy's argument is the hate is not counted because the mobs poof.. but from a logic standpoint  folks - he coulda had a billion points of hate on him before he poofed cause you never tripped the DAMAGE METER to lean towards a player causing it.<br>
<br>
you merely assume that the dmg shield wasn't creating agro and call poofage the proof. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=drokaten>drokaten</A> at: 12/24/02 10:11:13 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=freyalinia>Freyalinia</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 41<br> <font color=#333333>(12/24/02 12:14:35 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: PoP pets VS Epic and agro on multiple mobs</span><hr size=1> ok this is too weird to read<br>

you do not have to do any damage whatsoever to get summoned. Proof of this is when we wiped to the Boss of Akheva, i was playing my shaman, at the time, i Mala'd then Malosini'ed him, then i had killer lag and couldn't do much else (bad ISP at the time)<br>
<br>
When everyone went down, he was at 50 or so percent, he summoned me and killed me, i had not done 1 inch of dot or nuke or even sent a pet at him.<br>

&quot;Lilmagus, drokaten is saying that only a person who did damage to the mob will get summoned by it.<br>

<br>
<br>
To put both posts together for you so you can comprehend:<br>
<br>
The only time a mob will ever summon you is if you get on his agro list, and the mob has been injured.  It doesn't matter who does the injuring.  A DS, while at times does enough damage on it's own to start a mob summoning, does not itself cause the pc or npc with the shield to maintain a higher agro status than a person standing 2 feet away with no DS. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eandori>Eandori</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 454<br> <font color=#333333>(12/24/02 5:49:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=28>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: short term memory, get some.</span><hr size=1> Yes, Hate and Damage are two separate things.

Corpse poofing is attributed to damage, not hate.  Damage ownership claims a mob.  I can root a mob, a ranger can snare it 1000000 times and be #1 on the hate list.  But if I kill it, I get exp.<br>
<br>
Mobs will start summoning once damage has been done, damage shields will do that damage.  Then it's just a game of whoever is on the mobs hate list.  I have never tested this, but I'm sure there are those who have.  If you DS a huge warrior, then let a non aggro summoning mob faction-aggro and beat itself down on DS, I bet the mob will start summoning. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center">Master Eandori Raintree<br>

<br>
Test Conditions:<br>
PC 1 = Level 22 Magician using Sheild of Flame (8 point DS)<br>
PC 2 = Level 22 Enchanter using summoned Throwing Daggers<br>
<br>
Location = Paludal Caverns<br>
Server = Test<br>
<br>
Test Mobs = Plerg fiends<br>
<br>
Test Method = Magician walks near fiend with the DS on. After mob has hit the DS, enchanter throws daggers until fiend switches targets. After mob switches, we kill it off.<br>
<br>
Test was performed 4 times.<br>
<br>
Test 1 = 4 Hits on DS (32 damage), 2 dagger throws (miss, 3 points) before fiend switches.<br>
Test 2 = 3 Hits on DS (24 damage), 1 throw (2 points)<br>
Test 3 = 6 Hits on DS (64 damage), 3 throws (miss,miss, 4 points)<br>
Test 4 = 4 Hits on DS (24 damage), 1 throw (5 points)<br>
<br>
<br>
Conclusion : If the damage from a DS generates any agro at all, it is so low as to be unmeasurable.<br>
<br>
<br>
We would have done more tests, but those characters are essentially naked (we stopped playing them after the Great Test Server Equipment Wipe and returned to playing our production server characters) which really slowed us down. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-size:medium;">Zyphyr Runnersbane</span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

test will consist of:<br>
epic pet.. post aura of elemental mastery cast<br>
suitably high hp mob that won't usually object to scars of sigil.<br>
<br>
/pet no taunt<br>
/pet attack to obtain initial agro<br>
/pet hold<br>
<br>
let mob beat himself to 50% on DS<br>
<br>
fire scars of sigil.. <br>
<br>
i think this will be more accurate to the topic of discussion as were talking about the post 50's environment.<br>
<br>
dont get me wrong.. but i'm a coder.. from a coding perspective and wrapping head around discovering the Source of damage.. you can't target the environment.  therefore the environment can't strike you.<br>
<br>
falling damage.. ya ok.. thats one thing heh.. you didn't Hit anyone to recieve it or have to target it.  thats measured by a sudden change in z plane.<br>
<br>
i also don't have a problem with being wrong.. i do have a problem with not being proven wrong tho <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

A mob can summon if it is damaged beyond a certain percent of it's hp. It does not matter how it took that damage.<br>
<br>
Damage shields do not generate agro.<br>
<br>
The casting of a damage shield can generate a bit of agro toward the caster, just as any buff will.<br>

There is no reason to believe that the epic pet taunts any better than the new pets.<br>

Also mob summoning has only to do with damage. Once damage has been done to a mob it can summon anyone on it's hate list. So yes a damage shield could cause a mob to summon a player if it hits them while they have a damage shield on. Not because of hate but because of the damage. I have been summon by other people's trains while having cast no spells on the mobs. Once a mob has been damage it has free reign to summon anyone on it's hate list. As far as the aggro I really don't know.  I have heard so many warriors tell me they can hold aggro better with it that there must be some truth to it.

<br>
I power level players using this tactic all day long, and i know it works.<br>
<br>
the epic pet generates agro through excessive procing and casting. casting while on a hate list does in fact generate tempory agro, the same way sitting does.  this is why on rare occasions you can be attacked when you start casting.<br>
<br>
the epics proc rate is the same as the pre nerf cleric hammer proc rate.  if they added this level of proc to the new summoned weapons, a epic pet would be better than all the new pets simply because of the proc damage output.  remember procs land on a miss, so level is irrelavent.<br>

<br>
1) Rampage IS NOT determined by how high you are on the hate list, so casting a DS on the tank and getting rampage doesn't prove it is super high aggro.<br>
<br>
2) The monk is summoned because the mob is damaged.  The mob is damaged because of the DS.  Take this for example.<br>
<br>
Scenario 1<br>
<br>
Monk pulls mob with prox aggro.<br>
Top of the hate list: Monk<br>
Summons: Nobody<br>
<br>
Monk gets hit on the way back and the mob loses X amount of health and starts summoning.<br>
Top of the hate list: Monk<br>
Summons: Monk<br>
<br>
Scenario 2<br>
<br>
Monk pulls mob with prox aggro.<br>
Top of the hate list: Monk<br>
Summons: Nobody<br>
<br>
Monk gets to camp without being hit and Warrior starts attacking the mob, and reaches the top of the hate list.<br>
Top of the hate list: WARRIOR<br>
Summons: WARRIOR<br>
<br>
So, the reason that monks sometimes do not want DS on a pull isn't because of aggro, it's because if they get hit enough the mob will start to summon.<br>
<br>
Now, if I had pet hold I'd log in right now and put this silly argument to an end (since you should usually DS your pet and the tank anyways).  Since I don't, I'll rely on someone else. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=8548" target="top">Gamrok Lazyarse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Absolutely correct.  Epic pet does hold agro over every other pet because of the procs.  Epic pet proc's a stun, and often.  Same reason a Paladin can hold agro on a mob and never do any damage to it, stun stun stun.<br>
<br>
This is why agro kiting with an epic pet is a bad idea.  They almost always take agro. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showMessageRange?topicID=907.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showMessageRange?topicID=907.topic&start=41&stop=51>3</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showPrevMessage?topicID=907.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showNextMessage?topicID=907.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=907.topic&index=40><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.threadControl?topicID=907.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=907.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=907.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29>Magician Pets</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
