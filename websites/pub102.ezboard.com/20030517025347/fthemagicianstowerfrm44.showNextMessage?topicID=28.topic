I camped her yesterday for 4 straight hours and went from 35+4 yellows to 36+1.5 yellows. (no deads, no breaks, no nothing)<br>
<br>
Well this post is quite some time old, so maybe she has a longer spawn time now (7 minutes) or just gives less xp or I don't know. and I think I certainly do over 50% damage, because I do at least 600-650 dmg in every battle (2 Blazes)<br>
<br>
All I know is that at the current rate I need about 9 hours of camping her for 1 lvl.<br>
<br>
Well, I think I will take the time to get through lvl 36 with her still. after all the loot is pretty nice for me. About 5pp every 7 minutes is the best loot I have found so far personally. (sometimes she drops up to 10pp in coins and items).<br>
<br>
Now xp is worse than expected, loot is nice. But what I definately like and why I will stay is:<br>
30 seconds fight - 7 minutes break - 30 seconds fight - ...<br>
Finally gives me the time to chat a lot with my guild because I don't have to care about aggro, of getting jumped or whatever ;-)<br>

It seems not many classes can take her at this lvl with the same ease ;-)<br>
<br>
I had a lvl 35 Enc there yesterday who wanted to try her. He managed to get out with about 5% health. I guess he won't try it again.<br>
<br>
Then I had a lvl 35 druid there who also wanted to try her. Not sure if he would have managed it because he accepted my offer and called for help early (after 2 Nukes for each 240 dmg from her ;-) ).<br>
<br>
Ok, so I had some break...lost about 14 minutes for allowing those 2 people to try her ;-) <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#333333>(5/8/02 9:31:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Poor Cynthia</span><hr size=1> Oh wanted to add something. ;-)<br>
If somebody goes there not just for xp, but also for loot (like me ;-) ) you can increase your outcome a bit.<br>
After you killed Cynthia and you and your Pet are ok just run a bit towards the haunted tower and there are usually a few Giant skeletons around which can also drop up to 1pp. and some even con light blue to you at lvl 35 ;-)<br>
Or you could simply kill some of the Lizardmen who wander around everywhere there. They are all green but also drop a few gp's.<br>
<br>
By this I can usually make additional 1-2pp between the times Cynthia spawns. Usually killing her takes not more than 1-2 mana bubbles. So after the first kill I wander around and kill some stuff. Then I kill her again and med afterwards (I think 3 kills should be possible, but I like it safe ;-) ) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#333333>(5/13/02 11:09:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Poor Cynthia</span><hr size=1> Well, since I did hit lvl 39 there now, I will leave the area soon after I got some &quot;safety xp&quot; ;-)<br>
first of all, people can tell me what they want, lvl 35 and 36 are still some kind of &quot;hell level&quot;. I gained xp *much* faster at 37 and 38 than I did at 36 for example. (I was there only for the last yellow bubble of lvl 35, but still I think even then I gained xp much slower as at 37 for example)<br>
<br>
Now, since lvl 36 I also hunted the Cyclopse regulary during the Cynthia breaks. Usually I could do 1 cyclops after 3 Cynthia kills (for the reason that I had FM shortly after i killed Cynthia then)<br>
<br>
It went pretty nice, never ever died there (even I was one time VERY close ...lost Pet to Cyclops, was OOM and had to run to lake zone...got out with 21 HPs ;-) )<br>
<br>
Now, killing Cynthia is really easy, but here's my take on the Cyclopse:<br>
<br>
- Casted Inferno shield on Pet (air)<br>
- Pulled Cyclops with Malise, sent Pet to intercept it.<br>
If Malise failed I tried again one more time, always worked latest at 2nd try, except for Tarsuk whom I once fought without malise.<br>
- Rain of Spikes<br>
- Shock of Flame (about 100dmg with Focus bracelet)<br>
- Renew summoning (Pet usually at 60-70% health now)<br>
- Rain of Spikes.<br>
- Blaze<br>
- check on Pet health....if over 50% health I simply would have casted Blaze until Cyclops started to run, then SoF to finish it.<br>
<br>
I don't have a very high intelligence, so I usually came out of the cyclops-fights with 10-20m<br>
<br>
Cynthia wouldn't have respawned yet but still I always &quot;lost&quot; 1 or 2 minutes because I wasn't at 40m and Pets till pretty hurt at the time she spawned.<br>
But since the cyclopse give better xp than cynthia the small loss of time is well worth it.<br>
Anyway...I think I got through the levels 37/38 in 5-6 hours each.<br>
And the outcome of all that cynthia killing was probably well over 1k pp. Nice combination of xp and loot I think.<br>
(gave me finally the ressources to buy some nice stuff I couldn't afford before: Stein of Moggok (200pp), crystalline Robe (100pp...pretty cheap, but got it from a guild member), 10-shot-SOW-Potion (100pp). <br>
Now I'm looking forward to do some spell-purchasing runs with the knowledge that buying the spells won't ruin me for the fist time in my Mage-career :-)<br>
<br>
Thank you Cynthia!<br>
May the next to hunt you be as merciful as me, who always tried to make it as painless as possible for you by killing you in just a  few seconds ;-) <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uzhkronik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>zH KroNiK</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(5/16/02 6:31:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Poor Cynthia</span><hr size=1> LoL man your crazy, 1kpp in 2 whole levels? are you insane? =) i'm not trying to be an ass or anything but thats what, 13 hours that you out there.

<br>
Please think about the *possibility* that there might be people out there who don't have a lvl 60 char yet. also think about the possibility that there are people out there who are still in raw silk for some parts.<br>
<br>
Unbelievable for you? well for me it's not. That's my daily life ;-)<br>
so no, I cannot go out and kill some uber MOBs which will give me a few k in no time. Maybe you never had to really earn your coins (no offense, but I know enough people who started the game and got stuffed by RL friends with uber gear and a few k pp)<br>
<br>
Now until lvl 34 I *always* was completely broke after I bought my new set of spells. (ok wouldn't have been broke at 34, but buying the Gems for the focus items still did the trick ;-) )<br>
<br>
So yes, for me it *IS* the first time where I have more money than I needed for my new spells.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to flame you, but still thanks for laughing at me. sorry but that lvl 39 Mage is all I got (except for that lvl 24 druid which I have just for fun). But from your answers I take that you never really did build up a char from crap without help at all times. Otherwise I think there should have been a time for you as well, where you couldn't go out and camp a few k pp easily. <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unaladini.showPublicProfile?language=EN>naladini</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 3:51:21 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm44.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=47.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   main char mage</span><hr size=1> I too have a 35 mage, this is my main, and I recently 'upgraded' my raw silk items to Damask drops from Najena so I didn't look like such a n00b <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Though I have been 'gifted' with some fairly nice items as well from friendly group mates, half of my clothing is still of Damask variety.....<br>

/cast shock<br>

1 bubble of mana at 35 with 175 int.<br>
<br>
Very easy once i stopped using blaze..<br>
Blaze has WAY to long of a cast time. I am not twinked at all so i dun have a focus that lowerd that spell cast time. I believe i have out grown the one we summon. <br>
<br>
Anyway that is the way I do it and it takes 20 sec and 1 bubble of mana. <br>
