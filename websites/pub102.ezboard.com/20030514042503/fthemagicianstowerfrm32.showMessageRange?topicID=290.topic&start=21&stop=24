Emp and VT aren't the only things to raid any more. Just because 2% of the guilds are uber and maybe one or two per server are doing those encounters doesn't mean it's a yardstick for everyone else.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->This was really close to the point I was trying to make.  It looks as if you're basing your claims about being mod rod ho's on a fairly narrow range of raids.  I'm not in a teir 1 or 2 guild, but I've found that I can use pets when it matters.  A lot of times, it really doesn't matter and pets are dangerous..   If you're farming halls of testing with a big raid then yeah, get /pet hold or summon a new pet every damn fight.  But when we killed Dozekar I used a pet.  When we killed the other HoT names I used a pet if I wanted to.  For the rest of the raid I made rods, debuffed, and nuked.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  At 55 in ToV, even with Tash and Malo I have a difficult time landing Fire nukes on the cold AoE mobs (for the most part I can hit the non-AoE mobs fine), and I have nothing that hits the Firey Guardians at all. Basically I can burn half my mana trying to get a nuke to stick, or I can make sure all the Clerics stay at FM so we can chain pull.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I'm sorry, but a level 55 mage will be less powerful than a level 60 mage.  It is a very unfair comparison to make.  If you look at all the other level 55 people on your raid, what do you see them doing well?  A level 55 warrior has defensive, but probably will have tons of trouble holding aggro and he'll get decimated by the stronger AEs, and you can only use defensive so often.  A level 55 wizard won't have quite as bad resist issues, as they have fire/cold/magic nukes, but he'll still get resisted a lot or he'll have to waste mana and time using Lures.  A 55 wiz will also get hurt by AEs.  So you can't nuke like a wizzy, but you're not supposed to and quite often rods make a huge difference in how fast you can pull HoT.  <br>
<br>
A 55 rogue/monk/ranger/shadowknight/paladin will be loaded down with bad resist gear(like elemental blankets) and will require lots of healing during every AE fight.  When you summon resist stuff at the start of the raid, pay attention to the people who are asking for stuff..  I bet it you'll only rarely get requests from level 60s.  This is really a big deal..  If you've ever played a healer or watched them during HoT raids, the groups with the lower level people in them tend to require far more healing than the groups with the level 60s.  Heck, you should be able to see that as a mage making rods.  After a big AE fight, which healers need mana the most?  I'm willing to bet it's the clerics with the pre-60 melees.<br>
<br>
A level 55 enchanter does what?  If your guild is really hurting for chanters he might have to do clarity/haste and tash.  I don't know that I would want to rely on a level 55 slower for HoT unless the rest of my force was really uber.  After that, chanters are almost worse off than mages even.  The only cool stackable thing they get other than nukes is Sieve, which is important but not much more important than rods, and a 55 enc will have the same resist issues you do.<br>
<br>
A level 55 druid?  Nuking.. same deal except that they can use cold instead of magic on the fiery guardians.  Healing?  Yeah it's useful for a caster group.  Chloroblast will be a bit risky for a melee group.<br>
<br>
I think you get the idea..<br>
<br>
At level 55 you should feel honored to be able to even be in the Halls of Testing, and don't expect to get the most exciting job there is.  Expect your nukes to get resisted(though they won't be 100%).  Expect your pet to be worthless(Though it won't always be).  Expect to make a lot of rods(But find the time to nuke if you can).  Be happy that you're even there.  If you aren't having fun in HoT at level 55, maybe you'd be better off raiding Kael/Hate or levelling up.<br>

Level 55 meeles were liabilities since they just got shredded by AoEs. At least as a mage you could cower behind a corner and make rods and do CoH.<br>
<br>
My old guild used to have a level 56 minimum level requirement for ToV; just wasn't worth the hassle of healing people under 56.<br>
<br>
ToV is a place I would strongly recomend pet hold. Yes, if you are smart and paying constant attention you could get along without it, but just using /back off was a serious hassle and risk.<br>
<br>
With the new resist changes and pet heals, a high level mage should be able to keep their pet alive for awhile. If you have improved reclaim you could just suck up pets between fights and not lose any mana.  <p>Sage Cydmab Promethean <BR>

<br>
I don't have the logs but I was able to only have to have 2 Epic Fights the entire fight Against Telk in ToV.  In fact my epic pet got the killshot. :d<br>
<br>
With the new resist changes on pets, and the non aggro issues, pets are much more welcomed at raids.  And IMO they can deal some dmg, next raid I plan on logging its dmg to see how well it does in ToV. <p><p><div align=left><table width="270" border="1" bgcolor="000000" cellpadding="5"><tr><td><DIV style="FILTER: glow(color=FFFF00); WIDTH: 100%; POSITION: relative" align=center><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5" color="#000000"><I><a style="font-weight:bold; color:#FFFF00; text-decoration: none"href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=43987 >Dolekin Soothesayer</a></DIV></FONT></B></I><DIV style="FILTER:  Blur(Add = 1,Direction=225, Strength=20); WIDTH: 100%; POSITION: relative" align=center><font size="1" color="CCCCCC">Gnomish Conjurer of the 58th Season</font></DIV></tr></td></table></div></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left>

The other Mage and the solitary Necro agreed and we all summoned pets.  I made Voc: Air for cold immunity, other Mage had epic, Necro had EoT.  None of us have /pet hold (only the Necro is 60 and he doesn't have that much AA yet).<br>
<br>
For reasons known only to Solusek Ro, our pets would agro every time I mob would AoE, regardless of whether they were behind a corner or not.  The pet owners were safely around a corner, and didn't get a resist messge, let alone get damage.  The pets were right beside their owners and didn't seem to take damage, but would agro without fail.<br>
<br>
We did the best we could to back the pets off before they could get an attack in (if assist hadn't been called) and back them off on enrage.  My pet didn't hit a single mob before assist, the other pets jumped the gun a couple of times, but no where close to every fight.  After 45 minutes we were all ordered to lose our pets.  The MA said they were screwing up mob positioning =(<br>
<br>
After that I just used RoZ on the non-AoE mobs.  /sigh<br>
<br>
It's really f*cked up of VI to require a lvl 60 AA just to be able to use pets.<br>
<br>
P.S.  My Voc: Air pet took little to no damage from anything other than fire AoE mobs, on those it lost maybe 35-50% of HP during the duration of the fight.  Most times it's regen was sufficient to heal it before the next pull.  My buffed MR/FR/CR was something like 179/219/194 (w/o Bard songs).<br>
<br>
P.P.S. (I just reread the thread) I can actually resist most of the AoEs with my resist gear on + CoS + Resist Cold.  If we have a Bard than that's even better.  Also, I can land nukes on just about anything <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  other</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> than the fire mobs and the highest lvl cold mobs. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uusrbinperldashw.showPublicProfile?language=EN>usrbinperl dashw</A> at: 8/1/02 8:42:42 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showMessageRange?topicID=290.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showPrevMessage?topicID=290.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showNextMessage?topicID=290.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=290.topic&index=24><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.threadControl?topicID=290.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=290.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=290.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32>Class Balance</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
