Fighting in an arena is also makes it alot easier;  No room to be kited.  Basicly ya gotta kill the necro before the dots kill you, not too hard with good MR.  Or stay alive long enough for your pet to tear through the necro pet and go beat the necro (assuming ya pet isnt feared).  Also good to leave first few buff slots open so ya can dispell any effects ya get.  Also if ya can get good DR or PR resistance to go along with good MR, that should help. <p><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">

I don't think it's possible to beat him.   I really dont.<br>
<br>
My pet is feared, so it's a non-factor.  Even if the Fear wears off, my pet still has to chew through his pet before it can be usefull.<br>
<br>
My resists are high enough that he doesnt bother trying to fear or dot me, just dfluxs over and over.  <br>
<br>
How can I beat a 2.5 sec cast time, 300 point un-resistable life tap?   I can't burn him down fast enough to overcome both his damaging me, and healing himself.<br>

Key to beating a necromancer:<br>
1) Have annull/nullify magic memorized and have your first two buff spots open.  Most of the necromancer dots are magic based but are unresistable.  The heat blood, darkness, BoD/Vexing lines can be dispelled.  If the necro casts BoD or Vexing, make sure you dispell it off them as well.  Golem wands are extremely helpful.<br>
<br>
2) Know where your pet is at all times.  If the necromancer starts fearing your pet, a) interrupt it with your level 8 nuke, OR b) target your pet and annull it right away.<br>
<br>
3) If the necromancer is busy with your pet, he is not busy with you.. Make use of this.<br>
<br>
4) Magician pets &gt; Necromancer pets.  If the necro does not know how to PvP, he will let the two pets fight.  Buy your time by interrupting his spells.<br>
<br>
5) If the necromancer has a pet of his own, use your sow potion or jboots to run around until your pet is no longer feared and is occupied with the necro pet or the necromancer himself.  You will never channell through the necro pet spam.  So make sure you use the fact that necros don't have expedience.<br>
<br>
6) Deflux is nasty and most likely will be the spell a necromancer is using against you.  Do not stand in range for it, otherwise you will not survive.  Go out of it's range, cast Scars or Char while he is running.  If he is running close to you, run out of deflux range again.<br>
<br>
7) Remember, against a necromancer, time is your best friend.  With time, the necromancer's Fear spell on your pet will wear off. <p>"So you think your kung-fu's pretty good, huh?

I had my 49 earth pet, 44 pets of all sorts. He had a level 44 necro pet, no 49 pet. 5 battles, he won all of the, but I learned a few things.<br>
<br>
1) Don't forget how to armor your pet. Boost his MR by 15 by giving him *3* Daggers of Symbols. (One is a range slot, hopefully it's equipped). Can also give him 2 Coldstones (There's an AC component on there), such as it's help would be used.<br>
<br>
2) Have Shock of Swords memmed (whichever is the fast cast, low level shock spell). Use it often to attempt to disrupt him.<br>
<br>
3) Don't forget your Staff of Cancel Magic <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I did, and I figure it might've actually been usefull to me.<br>
<br>
4) I went in with a few different kinds of pets. Earth, and Air (44). I wager the low level of the air pet caused it to suffer in resists, it did seem to me that I did best with my air pet. For some reason, the air pet broke the fear far earlier than the earth pet did.<br>
<br>
5) Layer your self buffs such that your MR shielding is LAST, preceeded by the Ele Armor, Phatom Armor, and as many other self-buffs as you can get (see invis, levi, etc). This will aid in you resisting his spells. Here, +MR gear doesn't hurt at all.<br>
<br>
6) Have a DD Vs Summoned spell memmed, as fast a cast as you think you can handle. I did manage to lay waste to one necro pet while it was attacking me using a DS on myself + the DD Vs Summoned line. Unfortunately, by that time, I had been debuffed, and owned.<br>
<br>
Had I had more MR gear, I know at least one fight would've gone better for me. I got chewed on ONLY because my last shielding spell (Arch Shield) got dispelled, and my MR dropped too low. I had the Necro well hampered and near dead.<br>
<br>
I have, as of yet, not won against a Necro, but then, I'm still hunting for +MR gear to boost my chances next time I try. Feel free to take my lessons or not, they're simple tactics that I tried that SEEM to have done fairly well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrezark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trezark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 44<br> <font color=#333333>(1/24/02 3:59:14 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/ezhmage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mage VS Necro duel</span><hr size=1> I came in here intending to find a good thread regarding the Mage vs. Necro duel and found, to my surprise, a post referencing me <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I was the 45 mage Solistus was talking about that got beat down by my level 45 guild leader time and time again.  Feared Pet + Skelly on me + Lifetaps = mean.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to make a go of it again though...  I'm now level 52 and the necro in question is 54.  Hopefully the level difference won't be that big of an issue if I play my cards right.  My biggest problem though is that my resistances aren't too hot (probably need to work on that) but here's something I was considering:  Would the level 52 Fire Pet be a good choice in this situation?  My plan is to use Ensnaring Roots (via a stockpile of Crystalline Silk Nets I got from CC) on his pet as soon as the battle starts, and send the fire pet after him.  What I'm <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HOPING</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is that the fire pet coupled with my DD will interrupt him enough to keep him from getting fear on my pet and keep him from being able to put too much hurt on me.<br>
<br>
So the real question here is, will a Vocerate Fire be able to interrupt a 54 Necromancer often enough to make a difference?   <p><BR><CENTER><hr size=1 WIDTH=75%>

I hear a lot of mixed reviews.  Some people say it's the best thing since sliced bread when it comes to PvP.  Others say how they like to solo Sirens with their firepet because they resist 95% of the pet's spells when it gets charmed.<br>
<br>
Fighting necros is a matter of time and space.<br>
The longer you live the harder it gets on the necro, and you need space to run around and avoid getting cast on.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't suggest trying to interrupt him too much.  At this level, Shock of Blades really doesn't interrupt worth poop unless you're fighting someone in water.  He'll just deflux you death even with the pet beating on him.<br>
<br>
Basically try to stay out of range, make sure your pet beats his pet as fast as possible and run him OOM from casting Fear spells.  If you want to be clever you can start nullifying your pet when you see him start doing a fear effect.  Bring Crystallized Pumice and your dispells are free.<br>
<br>
The art of fighting with a mage is the art of running away.<br>

Of course you have to be level 59, but it really screws with SKs and Necros. Always takes em a minute or two to figure out why they just got resisted and they almost always try a recast. Eventually they'll figure it out and go for a darkness, but by that time you've landed a Mala and two nukes.<br>
<br>
The longer you live, the sooner you'll neutralize his pet and have yours up. Manage your distance and stay out of his casting range until pet becomes unfeared, then reengage him when he has to deal with the pet.<br>
<br>
Life taps are the biggest bitch about necros. Just when you think you have em with one more scars, they land some ghey 500 point lifetap on ya. <p><table width=100%><tr><td width=33%><font color=blue><i><b>Svenuce Summonstuff</b></i></font><br>

DS yourself and your pet.  Mem Scintillation and Scars, as well as Nullify.  These are the only three spells you need.  Don't worry about equipping your pet, burnout will do.  When the duel starts, you should be casting Sirocco if you have it, his pet is the target.  This is because he is (probably) standing next to his pet, and his pet is going to be what kills you if you blow it.  Since in PVP pets do not count as a target for rains, this works out nicely...Necros don't expect rains in PVP, at least not in duels.  They just don't make sense, until you see what happens.  Back to our fight...Send your pet at his pet, sirocco is almost done by the time they engage.  If the necro is casting fear, he probably hasn't sent his pet in yet...WOOT.  If not, your pet will meet his pet out of rain range, most likely.  On the upside, no matter what, his pet will eat 1890 damage.  They have practically negative resists.  That's most of a necro pet, one way or another, and also most of a necro unless his fire resistance is 150+ or he was out of range.  Now is when you forget about your pet and RUN.  He's already casting Deflux to eat you alive 205 HP at a time.  When you're 150-200 feet away, stop and cast Scars at him.  If your pet is feared and his is backed off, his pet will jump you shortly.  It will also beat itsself to death on your DS in seconds, don't worry about it.  At this point you have already won the fight...He has 300 damage streaking towards him, and you're out of his spell range.  Stand your ground until you see him stop to cast, then you should be moving again.  The idea behind this method is that you don't ever get anything cast on you.  Your pet is your time buffer, the necro can't do jack until he takes care of your pet because his pet is already dead by the time he blinks.<br>
<br>
Why do you have Scintillation up?  Just in case that pet bashes you, or the necro lands a snare and happens to get in range...Scint is a 1 foot knockback, did you know that?  Interrupts handily at times, 3 seconds, 450 damage or so in PVP.  <br>
<br>
<br>
See how it works...after I came up with this (fairly obvious) technique, I never lost to a necro again.<br>

Dont need much MR...just enough to resist darkness and fear cause you AINT gonna resist deflux...PERIOD.  Using superior range on spells is a great strategy...until you run across a necro how knows what he is doing.  A necro who is aware of the differences in casting range will wait till you stop and shadowstep...you may or may not have an idea as to where he is after that.  Chances are..he is now in your casting range but he is in his range as well, or has shadowstepped in a different direction and neither of you can cast..but he knows where you are and you dont know where he is.  CANCEL FEAR ON PET AND GET HIM BACK INTO THE FIGHT.  I am telling you, some of the other strategies may work against most necros but if you are fighting a necro that knows what he is doing, you simply must have your pet in the fight ASAP.  And if you are fighting a necro that does not fear your pet...look for someone more challenging cause he is an absolute idiot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utrezark.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Trezark</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#333333>(2/21/02 1:02:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm27.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=35.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://shadowblazer.armageddongames.com/images/Trezark/ezhmage.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hehe</span><hr size=1> Hmm, lots of good suggestions here...  gonna need to face off against my guild leader again sometime <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Something that I was contemplating the other day...  would any level Necro even stand a chance against a Level 60 Magician?  With Valiant Companion, he's not going to be able to land fear, and since his pet is considered &quot;summoned,&quot; all it takes is a single Banishment to take it out of the equation.  So basically he's got your pet beating on him the whole time with no way to fear it (I would assume Valiant Companion would be the last buff on the pet, let him waste his time trying to cancel it) and he's got no pet of his own to counteract yours or even try to interrupt your casting.<br>
<br>
Am I missing anything though?  Heh, that 1100hp lifetap would certainly be damaging to the Magician, though I don't know if any Necro would be willing to sacrifice an Essense Emerald just to win a duel <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR><CENTER><hr size=1 WIDTH=75%>

<br>
<br>
I'd suggest this.... <br>
<br>
Golem wand off all  his/her buffs <br>
Mala<br>
If your pet hasn't finshed his , finsh it off. <br>
Dispell any thing off yourself<br>
And use Sirocco<br>
By this time your pet is on him/her so start nuking hard and fast.<br>
<br>
STILLs a hard fight. An xp'd necro will dispell/golem wand off your pets Valient companion. Good thing the epics have nice MR.  I don't think there one plan thats going work. Just takes practice on when to use what spell . <br>
<br>
<br>
Never thought about the dagger of symbol , going try it out. Thanks for the pointer.<br>

I was only lvl 51 remember.<br>
<br>
Here is what I did.<br>
<br>
Arch Shielding, Cancel Magic Staff, Vocarate Earth (BO3, SOL), (2) Daggers with +5 resists<br>
<br>
now when fight beings have pet attack his pet and start casting banish summoned<br>
<br>
then run a little bit so the nec can't target you, pet should have killed nec pet by now<br>
<br>
pet is now on necro, cast malosi until it sticks<br>
<br>
cast Shock of Swords and Blaze until you are oom<br>
<br>
if you do it in that order then necro shouldn't be able to target you so that he focuses on pet while you kill his pet.  Then he is forced to focus on your pet while you are taking him down.  Just my thought on the matter.  Might not work all the time, this necro didnt cast fear once, just 500dmg lifetap.<br>
