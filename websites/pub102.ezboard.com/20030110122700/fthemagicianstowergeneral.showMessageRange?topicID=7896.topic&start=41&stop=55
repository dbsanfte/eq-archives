You buy a case of pop you want a case of pop, not half, even if it is the best testing pop you have ever had...thats not what they promised.

<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>they said, &quot; we have changed the text to reflect how the skill is&quot; <br>
<br>
which can mean <br>
1) they are too lazy to fix the skill and rather change the text. <br>
and/or <br>
2) they think the skill is good enough and no need to put it back at 60 seconds. <br>
<br>
now how do u know which one it is? </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Changing 30 to 60 in a database is just as trivial as changing 60 to 30 in the EQ executable. As such neither fix is more &quot;lazy&quot; that the other. So by deduction it must be the second.<br>
<br>
You've also got to remember this is NOT like FB. With FB, the skill description was right, but they couldn't get the explosion to work so they took a lazy way out and changed the description. With HoE the skill itself is working as intended. The description was just a little wrong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>They should at least give players the OPTION to re-think if they want the skill as it is. <br>
(namely re-fund the skill)<br>
<br>
may be people will choose Fury of magic, MC, lightning reflxes, per hold....etc... over it. <br>
<br>
Which again some of you ASSUMED that people will immeidately train the skill back with the points refunded. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I can think of a few skills I wouldn't mind buying something else with. But that's not how AA skills work. You buy them and that's it. Get over it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Can it have been more damage? <br>
Again, some people ASSUMED it's doing the damage it should right now. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
There's a big difference between &quot;assumed&quot; and &quot;educated guess&quot;. Look at the parses.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>also the person said he could careless about the description. <br>
now if VI decide to give mana burn to mages and tell them .. it will do 4 times of what mana you have. <br>
<br>
But people test it and they found out it's only 1:2 on mana to damage ratio. <br>
<br>
people can say, &quot;hey it's doing damage and that's all i care&quot; .... </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Can't compare these cases. In your hypothetical situation, you again bought the skill for the damage, but were not given it. In HoE's case you bought the skill for the damage, and actually got the damage. Now a better comparision would be:<br>
<br>
Lets say mages got Mage Manaburn, and it stated a cast time of 10 seconds, and it actually turned out to be 5.

Says who? When did Verant give you this information? The truth is you have no idea what was behind the thinking that went into changing the description. However we have pass events that have shown instead of fixing a skill Verant will just nerf it down or take the lazy way out like FB. The people that feel HoE should be 60secs have just as valid points as those that don't care that it is 30secs now. Also remember other classes pets con higher in level, have a faster reuse timer.<br>

Lol this is about the weakest point in your post which isn't saying much. However you are totally choosing to overlook the fact that those skills that you purchased that you don't care for now had the correct descriptions, and even though they don't deliver like you expected they do indeed do what they said they would. HoE never did that and people purchased it under the guise that it would last 60secs. Now it doesn't and a refund is in order for those that feel cheated.<br>
<br>
Personally it doesn't matter to me one way or the other. I don't have the skill, and there are a number of other skills I feel is move valuable then this one. Maybe if the pets didn't look like mini pets I would. All the other classes got pets that are the same size as there normal pets, I don't see why they couldn't have done the same thing for us. However I hear the skill is good and I don't doubt that. That still doesn't change the fact that a refund should have been offered for there screw up. <br>
<br>
If you go to a restaraunt and you order the number 4 special with 9 chicken nuggets for $5.00, and when you get it the meal it only has 6 chicken nuggets, you don't just say oh well. You go and let them know they gave you the wrong order. If they say &quot;Sorry the 9 piece chicken nugget dinner is $6.00, our sign is wrong we need to change it&quot;, normally if they have any class they will give you the other 3 chicken nuggets for the mistake they made for free. If not that then they will offer you a refund because you paid for something and you didn't get what was advertised. It is the basic ways that customer service works. If you wouldn't take it from your local McDonalds then why should we have to take it from Verant.<br>

<br>
At best Cyrius it does 4800 points of damage.  Thats assuming level 3, going 160 DPS for 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
Thats not better than manaburn.  Thats not better than manaburn for a level 59 caster.  I've already spouted all the ways this can be countered and manaburn can't.<br>
<br>
Manaburn also scales, it's roughly double the damage for a 65th level caster with 355 int, and some nice gear, as compared to the old maximums in luclin.<br>
<br>
4800 damage is one good extra crit nuke with focus items.   Or two normal bolts of tallon.  So its not that impressive.  Added to very short term DPS its at best a little extra boost.<br>
<br>
So if the game ended right now and all classes were frozen with the gear they have, it would be almost reasonable.<br>
<br>
Its not though, everyone is comparing this to damage we did at 60th level with Vex Thal items.  All that stuff is old news.  Hell my DPS more than doubled just going from 60th to 61st.  It's a whole new ballgame up in the planes and 4800 points is nothing too major.  <br>
<br>
9600 damage would be decent, solid.  Likely all the way til the end of PoP.<br>
<br>
As for servant of Ro, if VI is worried about stacking make it so host and servant of ro can't be stacked.  Then give servant of Ro a decent DPS, say 60 dps firebased DD.   And make the servant itself 65th level.  Nukes can still be resisted, but it would be a solid ability for 9 AA.<br>
<br>

Why?!<br>

We are the only class that have lost alot in solo ability.  We have had so many things changed/nerfed.  Yet when something can be on par with other class AA skills then it is overpowered.<br>

You have freaking Enchanters mezing high level mobs soloing the butts off.  Is that overpowered?  Hell yeah.  But oh, we have to think about what other classes would think while other classes dont give a flying @$# about us having a option taking away from us.<br>

Lets see, Manaburn was overpowered, Direcharm was overpowered...so what.  Hell can you solo a lvl 65 Mob as a Mage?  NO!!  But a enchanter can,,,is that overpowered?  Hell even clerics can solo a little better then us 61+.  Lets not forget about Wiz, Druid, Necro, Bard,,,etc.<br>
<br>
So tell me, why would this skill with the same DPS for 60 sec over power Magicians when so much have been taking away?<br>
<br>
One more thing, our pets are green and Shamans have higher level pets...which could make a difference on higher level mobs.  Have you thought about that?<br>

*sigh* This is always the case though isn't it?  Is this due to the nature of greed, or because we too compare ourselves to other classes constantly?  Maybe we need to take a step back and look at ourselves in our own light instead of by the light of others?<br>

may be.... but let's say now VI gives mages 2x nuking ability as now. and 2x mana regen. <br>
<br>
will you think it's totally awesome? <br>
<br>
Or... you will compare mage to the 4x nuking ability and 4x mana regen of ALL the casters and begin to complain? <br>
<br>
I will be very much the latter. <br>

People are right we do have pets that do good damage, nukes that are extreme and make us feel like actual nukers again.  And some really decent spells.<br>
<br>
And as much as people complain about parchments we don't have the problem of only certain spells being availible on very select mobs that are either over camped or hard for most to kill.<br>
<br>
All in all its an awesome expansion for mages.  When I speak some of my displeasure with host of the elements, it's because its been watered down a bit too much for a 12 AA point (for complete version) skill.<br>
<br>
It's cute and it helps push things, but beyond that I really can't give it too much in regards for damage.   I should explain that I'm not mad the ability sucks.  Because it doesn't suck.  But it had all the potential in the world to be a beautiful solid core ability of mages and it was watered down.<br>
<br>
The pets can't tank at all and although thats fair given the rest of the scope of the ability it's one of those things that looks really bad when you compare it to the shamans.<br>
<br>
The micropets are a little too small, but thats personal taste.  Would have liked them all at least dwarf sized.  I'm figuring this was done as to not block line of sight.   I can't see that as a major problem though as most mobs you'd use this against are higher than dwarves and certainly a lot bigger.<br>
<br>
The duration and total damage seems like the worst bit.  Overall higher recast time and higher duration for when it's used I would perfer again.  Using this every 45 mins for 60 seconds worth of pummeling sounds more reasonable than 30 seconds worth every 22 seconds.<br>
<br>
Maybe thats just me too..<br>
<br>
On the lighter side.. Thank god for Firebolt of Tallon..  Its nice to see people actually wanting to choose between using a bolt or a DD spell now.   And it's damn nice to be able to do enough damage with the spell to see the mobs health move than a couple percent.   In other words, its nice to have a NUKE that feels like a NUKE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wezloc@themagicianstower>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 1302<br> <font color=#333333>(11/25/02 10:02:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7896.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Host of the Elements -Description on Test</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>All in all its an awesome expansion for mages.

I really agree with this. The skill is just way to limited IMO. 30secs every 22mins isn't that great. I am not saying the skill isn't useful but it isn't the end all be all. That is why I am getting all my other aa skill first before I invest points in this skill. After the Servant of Ro ass rape I refuse to spend any more points in pet skills till I have all that I want in regards to aa. Servant of Ro  and Frenzy Burnout are useless pet aa abilities/skills, and i just don't want to risk blowing more hard earned aa on skills that don't deliver.<br>
