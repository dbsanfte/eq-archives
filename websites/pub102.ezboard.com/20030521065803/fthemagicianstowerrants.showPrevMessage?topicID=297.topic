I understand that.<br>
<br>
But, EQ's response to bugs seems to be that they are either somehow our fault or that that the consequences of these bugs are not worth their trouble to remedy even if they erase hours of online playing effort.<br>
<br>
In my brief time playing the game I have had the following incidents:<br>
<br>
1. Wrist pack with malachite disappeared after corpse rez.  /petitioned, but no way I'm going to sit around waiting forever for this so I zone to buy new bag &amp; reagents...got to vendor and opened trade window and the missing inventory was back(!)... it came back when I zoned.  Sent a /bug message (no autoresponse to this...why not?...are there too many? probably lock up server with autoresponses to all the bug reports....lol) and played a couple more hours..../petition was never responded to.  <br>
<br>
2. Lost multiple items from inventory zoning in/out of one particular area (Najena) and after deaths there.    Some /petitions were answered and the &quot;guide&quot; sent problem up the chain of command and ultimately resolved after a WEEK(!) or so.  Some /petitions just never answered.  Disappearance of a Fire Emerald and Fire Giant Toes was never  reimbursed (&quot;Sorry, we can't help you&quot;).  These reimbursements take so long that I frequently just go and buy the item again rather than wait.  (I pointed out to one GM that providing me with an item that I no longer need because it was faster to just replace it cost me plat since I have a hard time selling the replaced item for what I paid to replace it.  His basic response was &quot;tough luck for you&quot;.)<br>
<br>
3. Corpse stuck in wall after death one night.  Unlootable and unsummonable.  So, I /petition...and wait... and wait... and wait.  No response after almost two hours so I log off and send an email through EQ support.  Log on the next day... no help yet....so I try /petition again... and after about 30mins I get a GM who unbugs corpse from wall.  &quot;Great!&quot; I think....but I have no time to keep playing so I don't loot the corpse and I log off with plans to log back on and get xp rez.  I log on later and...CORPSE IS GONE!... WTF???  So, I /petition.... after an hour or so, a GM responds and says he located corpse and asks me where I want it.  I tell him where and go to get a rez but, crap.... time has run out and I can't get a rez.  /petiton but no response after an hour so I log off.  I then find an email message from a GM who says he moved my corpse....seems he didn't realize it had been unbugged already and thought he was helping me by moving it.  Ok, honest mistake.  So, I tell him, these delays (corpse stuck in wall then second GM accidently moving corpse after it had been unbugged by first GM) resulted in me being unable to get xp rez.  &quot;Too bad&quot; he says, &quot;after thorough investigation I can't help you&quot;.  Well, thank  you very much, JERK.   I lost my XP due to EQ's bug and HIS mistake and he &quot;can't help me&quot;?  So I let loose with /petitions &amp; emails to multiple support addresses and I get a response from a higher GM who says &quot;The second GM was correct according to policy&quot; (to screw me out of my xp...lol), &quot;but I will return your xp&quot;.  Whatever.  So, I log back on... find myself rezzed..... to the WRONG corpse &amp; /loc.... and set BACKWARD in xp.  Jeesh... forget it.  I move on with life.    <br>
  <br>
4. Oh, and missing 10 hit SOW potion from inventory after the above mess.  /petitioned, emailed... no response to either. <br>
<br>
5. Reported multiple spell bugs and misc screwups... never fixed as far as I can tell and, of course, they never tell you the status of your reports. <br>
<br>
I cannot believe that SONY let's it's name be attached to this debacle.  This is the largest collection of bungling, incompetnet Keystone Cops stumblebums I have ever seen.  Is this game run out of someone's garage, or what?<br>
<br>
Fine,there's bugs... but take some of the MILLIONS of dollars they earn and HELP us resolve problems created by THEIR screwups quickly and WITHOUT THE ATTITUDE.<br>

/petition<br>
After 6 hours ~ no response<br>
Next day /petition<br>
6 hours ~ no response<br>
Did this for 8 days straight. Finally a GM answered:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  I will excalate your petition to a GM of rank who can help you<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
9 days and 9 petitions later a GM of &quot;rank&quot; logs on to remove it, he does, and im finally happy. I log on the next day, and my FIRST name is now my surname.<br>
/petition<br>
A week later a GM finally fixes it. Log off. Log back on ~ all my items are gone. <br>
/petition, /bug<br>
Within a few hours (8 approx.) I get a tell from a GM that he has no record of my items ever existing. It broke it, and I started bitching at him. His response ~ I could give you your items back, but you dont deserve them. WTF! I emailed customer support everyday for TWO WEEKS (where I played an alt) before I got a response. Another GM says &quot;Ill get your your items back. Log off, log back on, items are back. After about a month.<br>

Petition, petition, petition.  E-mailed GM.  About a week later tried it a second time with a second tear, we successfully killed the mob and it didn't drop his piece.  Petitioned some more.  E-mailed again.  Petitioned again.<br>
<br>
That was in July.<br>
<br>
No response.  EVER.  Finally said F waiting anymore because a guildmate had a tear to multiquest.<br>
<br>
Three Fear raids later and two Iksar Child tears flushed down the toilet.

Are they gonna fix this stuff ? well from their pass record the answer is no. It comes down to this they know that the peeps that play EQ are hooked and they will get their $13 bucks a month rather bugs are fixed or not so why fix anything as long as they get paid each month.<br>
<br>
The only way to get things done is to stop playing EQ cancel the funds going to VI when they see their montly desposits getting low, then just may be they will fix some  stuff. But this will never happen peeps will continue to play and complain and they (VI) will laugh all the way to the bank.<br>
