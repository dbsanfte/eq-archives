Are we remotely on par with Wizards in terms of nuking?<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
PoP spells damage/mana for magicians:<br>
Black Steel 3.64 (best magic DD)<br>
Sun Vortex 3.25 (best fire DD)<br>
Firebolt of Tallon 3.75 (best fire bolt)<br>
<br>
PoP spells damage/mana for wizards:<br>
Agnarr's Thunder 3.64 (best magic DD)<br>
Draught of Ec'I 3.64 (best cold DD)<br>

<br>
So if PoP beastlords pets compare similiarily to magician PoP pets then they are fine as not being remotely on par? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upyroniousflare.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Pyronious Flare</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 5:22:49 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh god, not again...</span><hr size=1> I think getting enflamed about the Beastlord pets even coming close to mage pets is on track.  Maybe then for the sake of sensitivity VI will go back and try to fix the BL melee skills instead of the easy route of increasing a number for their pets.  I am not personally upset that Beastlords DPS will go up...more the merrier.  I just consider pets to be our only source of good raw damage, and giving us better melee is just silly and doesnt fit into my concept of a mage.  A monk/shammy hybrid on the other hand would seem melee skills a little more up their alley.  But then upgrading their melee skills may make the monk community angry...and if VI has to choose between upsetting monks or upsetting mages....I think we all know which way that one will go.<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Krilen, are you saying that for every elemental of roughly the same level as a warder, that the elemental should be better than the warder in some important way, but that the warder pet can be better in some other way? Yes?<br>
<br>
In other words, the warder pet, which is necessarily a generalist pet and must be fairly well rounded, should not be better than any comparable specialist elemental in its specialty.<br>
<br>
Further, post-50, a warder should be inferior in some way to our air elemental, which is our well rounded pet.<br>
<br>
Have I stated it correctly?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Hm, i dunnno... too long of an explanation.<br>
<br>
Best, shortest way I can state my opinion(though stated as fact or definition or something) is:<br>
<br>
There should never be a situation where a mage would rather be able to summon a beastlord pet than one of his own pets.<br>
<br>
I do not like the idea of BL pets coming close to our pets. I feel that the EoT pet is way too close as it is.<br>
<br>
However, if the BL pet were to be upgraded close to our pets, it would probably be something I'd deal with. I guess ever since they made our pets neutral to mobs, it's been really easy to roll with the punches of class balancing ^_^<br>
<br>
What I would never be able to deal with, is if I'm fighting a certain mob, and I find myself thinking 'i wish i had a warder instead of my 3 slightly specialized pets'<br>
<br>
I'd probably just start a SK and loot uber loot from FD in the corner, or quit entirely. More likely, I predict I'd quit entirely. There's some primal instinct in man, equally prevalent on all levels of thought not exluding relaxing things like video games, that causes him to react extremely violently to the breaking of principles pre-established in his mind... such as waking one day waking up and finding that mage pets are not the best. The breakage of principle! Ahh! violent psychological reaction! quit EQ !.... In the matrix, they did not free a mind after a certain age. That's all I'll say.<br>
<br>
Yeah, perhaps that creative argument got a bit absurd, but something to chew on :p <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~Krilen</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zyrexxshadowfyre>Zyrexx Shadowfyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 6:21:43 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=24>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh god, not again...</span><hr size=1> ****Beastlord without pet outdamaging a mage without pet?****<br>
<br>
I sure as hell would not mind this.<br>
<br>
Say your teamed with a Beast Lord, some how both your pets die would you rather:<br>
<br>
A) be the bigger damage dealer getting the agro and getting yourself shredded to tiny little bits<br>
<br>
 or<br>
<br>
B) let the Beast Lord with his better HP, AC and Defence abilities get the attention allowing you to stager your nukes so you both will survive<br>
<br>
But then we would have to know how would the Beast Lord out damage us ? <br>
<br>
In a short fight with a resonably tough apponent with out mega hit points a nuker will almost allways come out on top (Not taking into account Haste items, Spells or Abilities). A melee doing nuke damage in a short ammount of time, with out a special ability like Back Stab or Mega Archery AAs, would be over powered.<br>
<br>
In a long fight, with an apponent with alot more hit points the melee should out damage a nuker as the nuker will have spent most of their mana before the fight end (Not taking into account Mana regen spells / abilities). Long term damage by magic is the realm of DoTers (Yes we have some DoTs but their not like a Necro or Shammies).<br>
<br>
If right now we out damage a Beast Lord in both Short and Long fights with out a pet then there is really somthing wrong.  <p><center><TABLE><TR>

Well, I'll try to keep this short.<br>
<br>
Mages nuke, their pets tank.<br>
<br>
Beastlords melee, they tank.<br>
<br>
Therefore mage pet defense &gt; beastlord pet defense.<br>
<br>
But beastlord pet offense &gt;= mage pet offense(more than Gvoc pet, near or at epic damage).  <br>
<br>
Mages retain the best overall pets, beastlords become something other than a bad joke.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, none of this matters because VI doesn't care a whit about what a bunch of whiners on a messageboard think. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wezloc>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 867<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 10:08:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  hehe</span><hr size=1> Mages pet tank because mages do not have root so there is no other options but to let the pet tank. BL have a option mages do not. Also I do not use my nukes to kill mobs. That isn't the way that I play and most mages do not play that way either. If a GV Earth needs say 130% health to solo kill a mob I will normally nuke enough to ensure that pet finishes with 40% life. I do not chain cast and I invest items and gear in my pets so it isn't worthwhile for me to recast. I have epic now and for most things that I solo it does 70% of the damage to most of the things I kill. In a group it is near half my total damage.<br>
<br>
What alot of people miss is Verant is against soloing. Alot of the beastlord concerns are based on solo encounters. In a experience group where tanks are present all pets revert to living damage dots. Now under those conditions you are saying that mages should have a weaker damage pet then a hybrid class?<br>
<br>
Beastlords have skipped right over necros and are going after what belongs to the mage.<br>
<br>
GV Earth = Mage Version or Root. It has low ac so that it will get hit alot causing mobs to take more damage via a damage shield. To offset this they gave this pet the most hps.<br>
<br>
GVFire = A joke<br>
<br>
GV Water = Best damage pet in the game. In a group setting it gives the mage the option to go offensive since VI realizes even tho BLs do not that tanking means nothing in a normal experience group where a tank is present. This is the second worse tank pet that we have however I used this pet at 60 to solo until i got epic. With summoned armor ect....it tanks ok and the damage it does from nukes and melee while having the added benefit to get in some backstabs while the mob is running away helps alot.  Also it regens the fastest of all pets so the lower hps are offset somewhat by recovering from a encounter faster.<br>
<br>
GV Air = The all around pet. It is good against caster mobs because of the stun. It is good against melee mobs because of the stun. It tanks the best but has far less hps then GVE. It has damage equal to GV Earth but fewer hps with better damage mitigation.<br>
<br>
This shows clearly that we are a specialized pet class. We move more into that area as we lvl up. A beastlord pet being on par with any one of these pets isn't ok. The reason is the pets are specialized and take into account what enviornment a mage would use them in. Beastlords were suppose to have pets on par with lvl 49 necros.  Necros are suppose to be a better pet class then them. <br>
<br>
60% of what mages offer comes through their pet. Mod Rods, Summoned focus items, throwing daggers, and summoned food are secondary skills to help round the class out, however the main ability that a mage brings to the table the ability to summon a pet for all occasions and it will never be out done in it's specialized field.<br>
<br>
Beastlords have a TON of utility to offer along with their pet.  50% slow from that mega easy epic as well as 50% slow from the lvl 60 spell is a great benefit.  You think the lvl 60 slow is rare well talk to some mages about the lvl 60 pet heal. You have a ton of utility to offer a group where as a mage offers for the most part damage with limited utility. So why would it be fair for a class like BST which have extremely high utility to have a pet that is on par with mage pets in damage considering how limited we are on utility?<br>

<br>
Your comparison is very weak. The reason is because mages are FAR behind wizards in nuking. I will explain it out for ya since you don't understand....<br>
<br>
Wizards have......<br>
<br>
Lower resist checks when casting nukes<br>
Wizard nukes have a lower resist rate overall<br>
Wizards have unresistable lure nukes <br>
Wizards have bane nukes<br>
Wizards have nukes that cover all resistances<br>
Wizards can nuke quick for small but good damage or<br>
Wizards can nuke a little slower for large amounts of damage and they can do it with fire/cold/magic.<br>
There is NOT ONE MOB in the game that a wizard can not land a nuke on due to the change to lures<br>
Wizard nukes OVERALL are superior to mage nukes in damage, cast time, ratio, mana cost.<br>
Wizard can crit without the need of AA<br>
Wizards have manaburn<br>
<br>
<br>
This is what makes wizards far superior to mages in nuking. Yes Fire Bolt of Tallon is 3.75 but has line of sight issues and is still weaker then Ice Spear which has no line of sight issues, cost less mana, does the same damage in less then half the time and I might add it is soon to be two expansions old. Also a wizard is going to land Ice Spear more consistantly for full damage and with less resist then a mage with Fire Bolt. So looking at the ratio on nukes doesn't tell the entire story. Mages should dominate pets like wizards dominate nuking. If anyone believes wizards are not far and away the most dominate nuking class in the game they should go back to AO.<br>
<br>
It is like saying well the new beastlord pet hits for 69 at 60 (which it does) so it is on par with the lvl 60 mage GV Water pet which only hits for 68. See how flawed your logic is?<br>

That's why it is important to give CLEAR, well balanced ideas (see about druid's petition ... things came live in order of their claiming ...). But of course Verant won't read things like: &quot;I want this &amp; this &amp; this&quot; ... there must be behind something strong and well thought. <br>
<br>
Now about my opinion between BL and magicians ...I wouldn't mind having a pet as good as BL's one ... but I would be really sad if they had better one than ours. We don't have hp/mana spell line thing, sow, heals (and damn good for pets), and we can't tank (we aren't many to have SoA...). If there is an add...that's a pain for a magician since we can't root ... at least BL will survive for sure ... he will have time to run hehe<br>

Wizard nukes OVERALL are superior to mage nukes in damage, cast time, ratio, mana cost.<br>

The ratio's can you see by my comparison of the PoP spells that its not that large.<br>

Yes Fire Bolt of Tallon is 3.75 but has line of sight issues and is still weaker then Ice Spear which has no line of sight issues, cost less mana, does the same damage in less then half the time and I might add it is soon to be two expansions old.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Icespear also have 13 seconds recast time, while Firebolt of Tallon have 0. You can cast 2.75 times as many firebolts during the same time as icespears.<br>
That icespear is two expansions old does matter in what way exactly if later expansions doesnt include upgrades?<br>
<br>
<br>
Quote by Wezloc:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Also a wizard is going to land Ice Spear more consistantly for full damage and with less resist then a mage with Fire Bolt.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Icespear got a -10 to resists, compare this with the -35 from mala if you want.<br>

------------------------------------------------------------<br>
If right now we out damage a Beast Lord in both Short and Long fights with out a pet then there is really somthing wrong. <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Beastlord melee damage is in the area of 30% of the pure melee classes of monk/rogue, while magician damage is much closer to wizard damage (See above). Due to the mana regen options for longer fights so are magicians ahead of wizards (that do not have outside support) for extended fights. The problem here is for beastlords melee to outdamage a magicians spell damage so will their melee have to be upgraded by alot. Far too much for it to actualy happen. The only easy way for this to happen is to reduce magician spell damage, and that wont make anyone happier. <br>
Beastlord pets getting upgraded in some aspect (offence or defence) to be similar quality as mage pets is far more doable. Personaly I think making beastlord pets into the defensive pets of EQ holds some interesting possibilities. This would probobly require beastlord pets to actualy be better tanks then mage pets thou. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufarslayer77.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Farslayer77</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 205<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 1:30:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: lol mages are on par with wizards?

Though VI could give BL's our V and GV fire pets, and it wouldn't bother me.<br>
<br>
BL's warders need some improvements, yes.  Yet if BL at 60 had a warder that was = dps of GVE, then our usefulness would go down for their benefit.  If it could tank = GVW, well I was under the &quot;impression&quot; that BL's were &quot;melee&quot; highbrids *cough*.<br>
<br>
To even suggest throwing BL warder as a semi mix highbrid of GVE's dps and GVW's tankability, shows lack of thought.<br>
<br>
GVF-melee's worst, tanks like crap, stuns get resisted frequently.  Usefulness: Limited Instances.<br>
GVA-Melee's = earth, tanks a little worse than earth, stuns get resisted semi frequently.  Usefulness: Again Limited<br>
GVE-Pets melee standard, pets tank standard.  Usefulness: All around general solo.<br>
GVW-Melee's = earth, tanks a little worse than earth, can backstab if in group or mob is flee'ing.  Usefulness: Group pet<br>
<br>
To suggest the BL's ask for upgrades to put their warders on par with GVE and GVW and using the example of GVE's dps being sooooo far less than GVW's &quot;situational, group fleeing mob only dps&quot; shows little understanding compassion to the class. <br>
<br>
If this thread is locked, it shows 1 thing:<br>
<br>
That moderators of this board &quot;think&quot; they are the voice for the mage community, and as such &quot;only&quot; their voice matters.<br>
<br>
If that is the case, it's no wonder it took so long to get pet upgrades.  As such it's no wonder pathing was &quot;fix'ed&quot; with neutral pets, which in turn added immensly to the pet &lt;poof&gt;'ings.  <br>

Generalization, druids often say their stinging swarm DoT series is unresistable, but yeah it resists once in a while.  One could argue that melee dmg is unresistable, but yet melee's still miss once in awhile.  Neither of which changes the fact that wizzards have lure's, as they should.<br>

Ohh since it's only 2 types of mobs then it doesn't count.

I seem to remember seeing 14 crits and 6 crips from my warrior in a small 1 minute if fight.  Guess those 214ish crits and the 430ish crips mean nothing to you.  Again 2% w/ VI's random munber generator and it's tendency to stutter, it is plausible to have 1/2 chance of a crit with a wizzard, also it is plausible that you might not see one for several hours.  Yet still the inate &quot;chance&quot; of the wizzard crit ensures that they stay on top, as they should be.  <br>

<br>
The agenda, displayed was to discredit wezloc because the poster didn't agree with him.  Where in any of that did the poster achieve his/her goal?  NOWHERE!!!!!  <br>
<br>
Upon poster &quot;feeling&quot; that his/her agenda had been met, they decided to show their complete ignorance by stating BL's pets should become the &quot;defensive pets of EQ&quot;.  What sence does that make?  BL's melee=pet won't be getting hit.  Any melee in melee range and on agro list=BL's pet won't be getting hit.  BL's pet being defensively adept = NOTHING.  Thus in essence poster only suceeded in reinforcing Wezloc's credibility.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am NOT opposed to them being = voc air, voc fire, gvoc fire.  However I am opposed at the rational displayed for why they should be = gvoc earth/water.  Any rational that uses waters potential dps as a measurement is flawed, since that potential dps is &quot;situational&quot; at best.  Using GVE's dps as a scale, is equally flawed, BL's pets were designed to be worse, yes they need an upgrade, but NOT be made equal to mage pets.  <br>
<br>
I am 100% with wezloc on this.  Moderators should NOT be posting on other class's boards making statements like what was made.  We come here and voice our concerns here, for us.  If a BL wants to know where &quot;we&quot; stand, then they can come here and read &quot;our&quot; opinions, which are varied.  It is not in good faith, for a mage (moderator or otherwise), carrying an easily recognizable name (one such as would be readily remembered), with ties to a community (of which can lead to misconceptions) to go posting on other boards that &quot;we&quot; are/will be behind them.  NO &quot;YOU&quot;, may be behind them getting GVE, I, am NOT, Many of us are NOT, it cannot be said that the mage community is/will be behind them.  There is at least 50% that would disagree with them having equal pets.  It is &quot;my&quot; opinion, that the Raz broke a line of trust.  He is an intelligent, respected, well informed, mage, community leader, moderator, but that doesn't justify his statements.  Please Raz, just don't throw comments out there that &quot;we&quot; as a &quot;whole&quot; would support something, when it can be plainly seen that this community is split on BL's pets at current, Not alone making them equal to our gv's.  You speak for you not the community as a whole.   As I speak for me and me alone. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubalanzsonofanz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Balanz son of Anz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Abuser of EZCodes</span><br>  Posts: 1989<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 5:52:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=34>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_thumbsdown.gif" align=absmiddle>  Enough with the inflammatory language!</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If this thread is locked, it shows 1 thing:<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->If I lock this thread, it will be for exactly one reason: the flaming spiral of death.

What the beast community has been asking for has been a dps upgrade with the pet or with themselves. A lot of the beast community would rather see the increase in dps come from them and not the pet. However vi seems to be taking the pet route most likely because that is easier than messing with the beastlords themselves. The reason  so many beasts would rather see themselves upgraded over their pet is because of so many non pet friendly encounters. In a raid we can help out by casting spiritual purity which if we do not cast it no one will usually miss it. We are usualy relegated to being extra dmg on the raid which is fine by me if we are doing any kind of decent dmg. As it stands now we do not unless you are in an &quot;uber guild&quot; and have &quot;uber loot&quot;(which a lot of them say they only want 1 beastlord). Even with great gear our dmg still kinda sucks minus a pet since the pet is the main dmg dealer for a beast. Point of all this is I would rather have some kind of low capped double attack or something instead of the pet upgrades as they stand now. I am not trying to step on the mage community toes, but we have to take a dps improvement when we can even if it is not the way we wanted it.<br>
<br>
   Hell maybe vi could implement some kind of double attack that only occurs when we do not have the pet up. From what I have read it is pretty much agreed up on that beast pets need upgrading, how much though is the problem. If we did get double attack that would negate the need for a really good pet and we would get our dps upgrade without stepping on mages toes. I do not really know, other than double attack any other way to raise our dps without the pet being raised enough to bother mages. Or vi could add in something totally unique which I doubt vi will do no doubt due to extra coding they do not want to do.<br>

See WHAT? Back your statements up, SHOW WHERE THE WIZZARD NUKE ABILITY SUCKS!!!!! Sure it's NOT sustained dps, but if something needs to die fast, they will make it happen NOT us.<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
The thing you may not realise is that wizards use nukes for sustained damage as well as for fast kills.<br>

The agenda, displayed was to discredit wezloc because the poster didn't agree with him. Where in any of that did the poster achieve his/her goal? NOWHERE!!!!! <br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
None of the agendas you imagined up was what was intended. The only point was that Wezloc was as ignorant of the workings of wizards as yourself and that using wizards as example of superiority proves exactly noting.<br>

The Bst pet is a better *general* pet than any of ours. However, ours are better in their generalized roles, and that continues onto PoP. <p>"History is just a set of lies agreed upon" - Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte

<br>
Because some of the more vocal and annoying of the Beast Lord class think they should have a better pet, normally with the excuse that the class has &quot;Beast&quot; or &quot;Lord&quot; in their name meaning they should be best.<br>
<br>
The more level headed Beast Lords (You, Bengali, Kraggen, ect...) are not asking for a better pet but their voice amount the flaming morons is minor. Wich post would you notice first &quot;WHO CARES WHAT MAGES THINK!&quot; or &quot; Mages &amp; Beastlords... what is the best pet? &quot;. <br>
<br>
Posts were a Mage is yelled at in caps will get read long before a more thought out thread about the differences between our pet.<br>
<br>
Its the flaming idiots that get the most attention (unfortunatly) most of the time and we really should try and ignore them. And I don't just mean that for Beast Lord flamers but also Mage, Monk, SK, ect.... as we all have our extream flaming freeks in our comunities.<br>

<br>
I think thats the point, I am trying to get across to you, &quot;YOUR OPINION&quot;, not you &quot;speaking for the comunity as a whole&quot; as it can easily be viewed as such by various onlookers.<br>
<br>
The repercussions of you claiming the mage comunity &quot;as a whole&quot; would be behind such a change could effectivly nulify any advantage we hold over any other class.  The only way I can see the majority of the comunity being behind such a change would be if the 65 BL pet was what you propose.  Definately not the 60 BL pet.<br>
<br>
Raz look at the threads, it's split nearly HALF of the community recognizes that BL pets need upgrades.  The other half think upgrades are not needed at all.<br>
<br>
So your starting with about 50%, how many of those who recognize BL pet improvements are needed, would actually go along with their pets being = GVE dps, GVW tankability?  At best your dealing with 50% of the community, and some of us who recognise the BL's need improvements will not agree with BL pets being comparativly equal to our best 2 (minus epic), which would lessen the % of the total community support puting you at UNDER 50%.<br>
<br>
You having an opinion is not under attack, you posting with the preconception that the mage community &quot;as a whole&quot; would be behind it is.  SoE/VI reads it, they could easily &quot;think&quot; based on the respect we have for you, that the mage community really thought it was fine.  BL's could fall into the same mental trap on that, and as such use your post as a &quot;look here's a well respected mage that says the entire mage community would support it&quot;.  Not to mention what it makes some mages think.<br>
<br>
If BL's did get a pet as you propose, you cannot see that as overpowering with their slow?  If we as mages could cast a slow, think of how much better our pets would be (tankwise), You could effectivly take lvl 51 mobs on 1 GVE, with no heals and no nukes SOLO.  BL's pet's cannot be equal to ours, cause slow would make them greater than by far.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Everything wrong with calling people moron's and impugning their motives.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I think your saying I should have been nicer in my last post to the poster that was trying to debunk Wezloc, and say that &quot;wizards aren't masters of DD&quot;?  What proof was offered?  Does it really make sence to make BL's pets into a &quot;defensive pet of EQ&quot;?  Wouldn't it make more sence to give their pets better atk, and give the BL better defence?  What good is thier pets defence when in most cases their pets not going to be getting hit?  That's about as useful as throwing 2k ac onto trod'ing mage.  If the BL pet isn't getting hit, then upping defences of pet is pointless, BL's are melee based highbrids, unless you want to see a bunch of BL's playing warder cleric (only using 1/2 of their accumulative skill).<br>
<br>
Did you read the comments I was responding to?  Where the poster offered nothing to back up WHY poster FELT Wizards weren't TOP at NUKING?  Look down a few quotes, you'll see I called it precisely as poster meant it.  I fail to see where speaking truth is flaming, yet speaking misinformity is defended.  Or is it the enemy of my enemy is my friend?  Since I disagree with you stating the community &quot;as a whole&quot; wouldn't oppose BL's getting pets = GVE DPS and GVW tankability, then anyone who disagrees with me in the same thread MUST be BLINDLY defended?  No matter that the person was stating wizards aren't the best NUKERS?  <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> The thing you may not realise is that wizards use nukes for sustained damage as well as for fast kills.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Only way they are sustaining dps in a 5+ minute fight, is if they are eating trods and getting healed.  Their ability to sustain dps is based SOLELY on their manapool, ours is primarily on our manapools + pets.  Again Wezloc was saying wizards are Nuke Supreme, we are Pet Supreme, BL's should not cross a certain line with their pets, as we should not cross a certain line with our nukes. Why are you soo insistant on making this about wizards?  Next I suppose you'll say clerics aren't the best healers. (of course most mana efficient healer is the bard since it's 0 mana, but that's pointless when a tank needs alot of hp's healed fast).<br>
<br>

<br>
So your saying a Wizard can't nuke???????  Back it up!!  Wezloc said wizards are the best NUKERS, nothingelse.  Yet obviously you think he's wrong, ok I guess your opinion doesn't have to corespond with any facts.  So you think Wizards aren't the best Nukers, Go you, Guess everyonelse is wrong.<br>

Honestly, with the way it was worded, I couldn't Tell when I quoted it, if you were making a statement, or asking a question.  Hence my statement about gramar, I saw no defined sentance structure in that paragraph, and had to guess at what that paragraph was trying to say. (I think your mind was ahead of your fingers and you missed a word or two, or perhaps misplaced a few?)<br>

<br>
Don't leak info, so far as what is NOT considered GENERAL KNOWLEDGE.  That said, your comment is misleading.......................Would love to say why, but decided not to.<br>
<br>
That doesn't change how I view Raz's statement that the mage community was behind him.  How many mages in game have NEVER been to magecompendium?  Is he speaking for them as well?  What gives ANY of us the right to speak for the community as a whole?  Our Views are OUR OWN.<br>
<br>
As such if it had been discussed, hashed and rehashed, showing that the majority of the class supported such a proposed change then there would be no problem with him stating the class &quot;as a whole&quot; was behind him.<br>
<br>
Do I make sence to anyone?  Or am I alone in thinking we should speak for OURSELVES, and not the class AS A WHOLE?  <br>
<br>
@anyrate I am off this thread, I have said what I wanted to say, I see no need to further a discussion w/ those who would presume to speak for the entire class, or those who state wizards aren't the best nukers.  Obviously we are playing 2 very different games, and I took a wrong turn somewhere thinking this board had anything to do with EQ and mages in general. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufmm2101.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fmm2101</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(10/1/02 9:23:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=363.topic&index=40>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ....</span><hr size=1> Shenker, thank you. I made a post earlier in an attempt to avoid the road of flame I saw coming but it came anyway...Your post was thoughtful enough that I hope it will lead us out of flame-land. Heh. Everyone, listen to Shenker! He lists what *most* beastlords want. We just know that we *need* a DPS upgrade and don't want to wait another year before it comes in (Like our AA abilities). What *form* that DPS upgrade takes, I don't think is very important as *long* as this DPS increase is seen on raid mobs. Now, here are some facts (in my opinion).<br>
<br>
This is for lvl 60:<br>
1) We need a DPS upgrade.<br>
2) To get this upgrade we either raise pet DPS or lord DPS<br>
3) Current lord DPS is less than mage/necro DPS in short AND long term fights. PLUS we need to be within melee range to do dmg while we are *Very* poor tanks. The worst tank among all hybrids/melees. Our defensive skills are capped LOW, we are a leather class, our hp isn't *that* high (lower than SK, etc).<br>
4) If your pet is to be better than ours, then our lord DPS has to be better than your mage DPS (nuking). Not for short term fights (of course) but definitely for middle/long fights. In fact, to maintain balance (not counting your epic *or* our 50% slow since they are both hard-hard-hard to get) your mage damage + mage-pet DPS has to be very close to lord + warder DPS. On *average* (over short/middle/long fights).  Can you all agree to this?<br>
5) If *our* pet is to have higher DPS than yours (I am *NOT* advocating this, just listing it as one of the POSSIBLE solutions to the DPS upgrade) then our lord DPS can be BELOW mage (nuking) DPS.<br>
<br>
Thats my view of the current situation and possible solution paths. I would prefer #4. In all likelihood they will implement a *combination* of #4 and #5. Upgrade our pets BELOW mage pets but ABOVE necromancer pets (I mean, COMMON, beastlords are *SO* much more dependent on pets than necromancers). Then they can upgrade our lord DPS to move us into balance with mages/etc. This is what I expect them to do.<br>
<br>
Now to attempt to defuse some counter-arguments:<br>
1) Argument: BST shouldn't do so much DPS, they have so much utility!<br>
Answer: As a hybrid, SK/Paladin are DEFENSIVE and BST/RNG are OFFENSIVE. Let us look at utility though: Druids/wizards can port, druids can sow/heal/dot/DD/evac, magicians can summon/mod-rod/DS/gate (heh)/etc, necromancers I won't even get STARTED on, etc. I think BST do *not* fall into the top 3 utility classes on everquest, not even close.<br>
<br>
2) Argument: BST can tank so much better than mages, so your class DPS shouldn't be as high!<br>
Answer: Your right =). We should be below the mage class in DPS. How much lower is the question that needs answering. We are the worst non-caster tanks in the game. Heck, clerics/Shamans can likely tank almost as well as we can..ESPECIALLY with their huge heals. (We have really low CAPs on our defensive skills...) Because of all this I think our DPS shouldn't be far below mage DPS...Shrug...My opinion.<br>
<br>
Those are the two relevant arguments I came up with, different arguments apply when considering balance vs other classes (ie: Monks, etc).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, I hope this post was clear and that it won't illicit any flames as I tried to be most reasonable and to RESPECT your concerns as mages. Good day my fellow pet owners =).<br>
