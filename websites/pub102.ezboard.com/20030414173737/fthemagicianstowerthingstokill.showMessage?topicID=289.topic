<br>
Worked fine, good control until we moved to the church.  It worked well until one was pulled from upstairs and was fought on the other side of the forge.  WHen a mob got pushed into the back corner, all 3 pets went running out the door.  I saw it and caught mine with a back off but the other 2 didnt see it.  Fortunately, the mob died very soon after that and the pets sauntered back in to the forge.<br>
<br>
So, in short, always know where your pet is and back him off if something is pushed into the corner or near the ramp in that place.  That or have them pull the mobs from upstairs past the forge.<br>

P.S.  8th Magi in a row with no staff and of course it is my last peice. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uonyxrosevalsharess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OnyxroseValSharess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#333333>(8/2/01 7:52:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pets in hate</span><hr size=1> Ramps, Ledges, etc are notoriously bad....<br>

I was in the Hole, pulling Warriors at the pool-entrance; group was at the end of the path by the water, while the Shadowknight puller was breaking the spawns.<br>
<br>
Well, the SK must have backed up a bit too far while trying to Feign Death, and she ended up on the ramp, then over the edge.  She claims she was knocked back into the water, though it could have just been unfamiliarity with how to break in tight quarters.<br>

The same thing happens if an enemy is attacking a player that is pushed against the wall...very bad.<br>
<br>
Besides that, 90% of the bad pathing in the game comes from circular pathing.  You know what Im talking about...  Floor 5 of Tower of Frozen Shadow is a circle, theres a circle around the well near the Soothsayer in Droga, there is circular pathing around each house in Hate.<br>
<br>
The way its coded is, rather than take the path with the closest distance, circular pathing is one way...like blocks in New York City.  Pets and mobs only go one way around the circle.  Most of the zone in wipeouts in hate are caused by the fact that an enemy notices you from behind the nearby wall where you enter.  They cant just run to the doorway to enter the entry building by taking the shortest route...instead they go all the way around multiple buildings and back (around a one way circle), causing more enemies to come as well.  In Plane of Hate when you tell your pet to attack something and see your pet spastically take off down away from you and then back around in a circle towards the enemy, it's because of the same phenomenon. One way circular pathing.  For some reason, this pathing is placed all over in Hate in places it does not belong.<br>
<br>
So anyways, thats how you can predict bad pathing. Look for places with circles. If you see one, dont summon a pet unless the entire circle is safe for the pet to move about in.<br>
<br>
As to the other 10%, it usually takes place in areas where pathing is missing.  Pets will hop skip and jump around because they cant find the right path to their master or the enemy they want to fight.  For example, in skyshrine, if you summon a pet in the area after you step  on the first teleporter pad (at wyverns), and walk up the ramp walkway, the pet will ridiculously warp down to the courtyard. Fun. <p><img src="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dsf3/EQ/rhionsligo.jpg" align="center">

<br>
Our puller was very adamant not to let ANYTHING touch the walls, the reason given is that the mob will pop up to the upper ledge... at that point it gets fuzzy, it either paths its way WAY to the other end of the zone, training everything, OR, it gets stuck up there, you can't hit it, and you get no loot.<br>
<br>
I took a robotics path planning course at college (for fun), and it explained a lot about how AI code is written to get from Point A to Point B.  <br>
<br>
One method is the Gradient Descent method, or what I like to call &quot;Warcraft pathing&quot;.  Rule: Always move in a direction such that your distance to the target is decreased.  This rule, though simple, can handle 90% of your games, and works best in Square maps with few obstacles.  The drawback is a &quot;well&quot; effect, where the AI is in a spot where moving towards the target hits a U shaped wall -- the penalty for moving back out of the hole is greater than the desire to move towards the target.  This is why in Warcraft, you'd see where your enemy over-built and trapped dozens of grunts in a U shape of the forest...<br>
<br>
Another method is a top-down Collision Map, where you define every point on the map that the AI can move to, and the AI has free movement within those collision free zones.  This method is very computationally intensive, though you can always create a valid path to any Target using a Traveling Salesman solution moving along edges of the collision free paths.  You end up defining &quot;waypoints&quot; that make up the shortest paths...<br>
<br>
Near as evidence shows, Verant uses a variant of both...  There are valid routes defined on every board that guarantee non-collision movement, and when the AI moves to a point on the path closest to the Target, it leaves the path and moves in a gradient descent &quot;bee-line&quot; to its Target.  <br>
<br>
When you Fear a creature, it attempts to move back to its &quot;valid path&quot;, rather than just run in any random direction...  This is how Necros discovered pathing errors that made the monsters run into the walls for safe exp... it was trying to reach a safe path on the OTHER side of the wall because that path was closest (example: Overthere, by the temple stairs to Burning Woods... when kunark first came out, people used to Fear their pulls right into the wall)<br>
<br>
The &quot;circle&quot; method to escape &quot;wells&quot; makes a lot of sense... its the &quot;if I can't get to you in a straight line, then I'll turn right and move forward.  Nope, thats not it, turn right again, move forward...&quot;  <br>
<br>
It can make for LOTS of headaches.<br>

And sometimes, through my whining, prodding, nagging, and tell spam i was able to convince the raid leaders to let us use pets. It was these time when i learned that Hate is HANDS DOWN the crappiest pathing in all of norrath. Using pets in hate requires you to pay extremely close attention to your pet at all times, and with all the crap that can occur in hate, that is sometimes overwhelming.<br>
<br>
Which is why, nowadays, i not only dont want to use a pet there myself, but for my safety and the safety of the raid, i dont want anyone else using pets except for certain situations...its honestly just not worth it with a raid force there anyway.<br>
<br>
Sometimes ill pull out a pet if we get three spitegolems or something crazy like that. but most of the time i get jittery when i see pets there.<br>

Which means, as long as those two buildings are clear, your pet doesn't agro anything as long as you're fighting in that courtyard. I agree though, outside that courtyard, I don't trust my pet to move more then about 5 feet on it's own. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  This is when I am thankfull that they did something right, and put in summon companion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showPrevMessage?topicID=289.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showNextMessage?topicID=289.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=289.topic&index=9><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.threadControl?topicID=289.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=289.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=289.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill>The Hunt</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
