Do people agree with my comments/proposals?<br>
<br>
I play a lvl 57 Magician on Tunare and am working on the magician Epic.<br>
<br>
I finally have 28 of the 30 pieces required (including sub quests and temple ro focus item quests)after over a YEAR of effort. It's really been a time sink but for the most part I've enjoyed the anticipation of finally seeing that last &quot;You've gained experience&quot; message from the Master of Elements in the Plane of Air and being able to scribe a spell long missing from my book. It's also been a great guide to the game as I've been forced to travel all over the place and learn new zones or long forgotten ones. Friends have helped and sometimes I've spent so much time camping elusive mobs with elusive drops when I could solo. The quest makes for a lot of conversation with other mages and these are mostly all good things.<br>
<br>
My only question (gripe if you will) is that there are mobs which are intensely contested over, with one in particular that is beyond reasonable (and I have a lot of patience); this one being the elusive Magi Phasta in Hate.<br>
<br>
Let me describe my personal experiences so far:<br>
<br>
1.) I've been on 14 Hate raids &amp; have all my Apothic armor. I even saw a Rainments of the Chosen drop and won the random on it.<br>
2.) I've logged over 60 hours in that zone just looking for the staff &amp; I've never once SEEN Magi Phasta (never mind thinking about the chance to loot him). I spent the last 4 consecutive days straight (Sunday all day, Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday night) on every Hate raid I could and still didn't see him.<br>
3.) I heard he spawned once while I was in the zone on a raid a while ago, but the raid had been going on for a while and it was late so we folded and we never got to see him.<br>
4.) There were a lot of minis up on one raid I went to and the Fire staff dropped. This was a semi-open raid. The server ezboard raid post said that the Earth staff was spoken for IF a particular mage showed up; since that mage wasn't there I went on the raid. After the shout from the leader of the group who got the exp from Mistress of Scorn that a mage staff dropped, the raid leader got excited and due to greed and ignorance told the group leader to loot the staff (i.e. intending to MQ it for the mage who wasn't even there) so the group leader promptly did. A No Drop fire pet focus item staff was thus burned. I would have enjoyed a random on that but I ended up very angry and frustrated.<br>
5.) The only other time I saw a fire staff drop in Hate (on a semi-open raid I went on to try to get all my Apothic on for the hope that maybe just maybe someday on some raid seniority might count for something), the raid leader gifted it to a mage in his guild who was the one slated to get the Earth staff should it drop. The reasoning there was that it was at the end of the raid and Magi wasn't up so because that mage didn't get what she came for that day she might as well get the reward of the other mage staff. I was also upset at that - so much for &quot;semi-open&quot; that day.<br>
6.) Here's a common quote from a reservation for the Plane on the Tunare server board regarding epic drops in Hate on a semi open raid, &quot;Please note: Certain epic bits may be already spoken for, such as the ranger stones and the magi epic staff depending on if guildmates/friends have already gotten them or not. If that's the only reason you are looking to attend, you may well be disappointed.&quot; A lot of raids say this and I don't bother anymore to attend them anymore. Other &quot;open&quot; raids say that the leader will decide the epic drops for whatever that means.<br>
7.) I have resources of my own (I know the counter argument to some of the points above) and could host my own raid. I have a few lvl 60 cleric friends, a high lvl enchanter friend, a high lvl monk friend that's pulled hate a bazillion times, a bunch of driud friends, a couple wizard friends who could port up, a bunch of warriors, etc and it wouldn't be too much trouble to reserve the plane a couple weeks in advance and rock the zone. The only trouble is, based on my experience, what are the odds that after being on 14 Hate raids and logging 60 hours in Hate without seeing Magi drop, that I can expect Magi to be there when I go? Do you HONESTLY expect my friends and guildmates to reserve ALL their free time on some stupid repetative task like this and go to Hate over and over and over and over again for nothing? Not one of them would be interested in that and I'm not going to bother asking them to do that.<br>
8.) There do exist large powerful guilds on the server that are capable of and have many characters that need to go to hate to get epic pieces and want to (unlike my smaller guild of people who haven't done a lot with higher level characters or are as far into their epics). The guilds have people who port to hate with a tracker or someone who can navigate the zone and see what mobs are up. If the right mob is up, they will pull it and to hell with the scheduled open raid later that day.<br>
9.) When I do go up on an open raid (there's not going to be another open or semi-open raid on my server for the next 4 days which is how I have time to write this now) and IF on the offchance Magi spawns just before or during the raid and IF there's time left to pull him, I will find myself randoming between myself and other mages I've become friends with. This hurts me emotionally either way it turns out. If I win, I'd be very happy to consider myself done with my epic and go on to other things (a lot left to do) but I'd also be distraught that a friend of mine or another mage I don't know didn't win and might be resentful or sad and frustrated.<br>
10.) It's also possible that the Earth staff can be looted for Multiquest and sold. Closed raids without mages or if the epic will just looted leave the possibility of someone making 50-150k pp on this item. I don't support that but it happens.<br>
11.) I know two mages who have been to Hate more than 50 times and still don't have the item, but on the other hand I know of two more that have been on only a dozen and were able to get the staff. That doesn't seem balanced. I also know of mages who haven't started the epic quest due to the difficulty of getting the staff.<br>
<br>
This whole situation brought about by the rarity of a mob and his drop has caused a lot of people to go to extremes and I've seen some of it up there and I've mentioned a couple examples. There's a lot of GREED and I'm very upset and unhappy about it.<br>
<br>
The situation is intolerable and unacceptable. There are other solutions that don't necessarily go against the original difficulty or intention of the epic quests. I know it's a hard quest, it's a status symbol, and it's for a very good item so it's supposed to be hard; it shouldn't, however, be a cause of contention between people or nearly impossible considering how many people want the item and what lengths they could go to to reduce the grief associated with it.<br>
<br>
Does Verant have any intentions in the future of stopping people from being able to Multiquest items for quests? This would help very very much, considering that if this was the case only people who were IN the zone of the right class could use the item. It isn't the best solution as far as I'm concerned though because there would still be lots of closed or &quot;semi-open&quot; raids where the item would be spoken for in advance before the raid even started.<br>
<br>
Consider other solutions, here's a few examples:<br>
1.) Add a mob to the Zone deep on the second floor that isn't aggro who is on some kind of anti-forsaken revenant faction that is raised only after spending so much time in Hate fighting forsaken revenants (a mob in Hate who hates other mobs imagine that LOL). There could be a quest where a mage could receive an Earth Staff that is being held by this mob after things that drop on forsaken revenants are turned in. Right now basically that's Apothic armor. This kind of quest requires 6 or 7 hate raids (or more) to accumulate a set of Apothic, some time on raids raising faction with the quest mob, and a long raid to get to clear the zone and go to the second floor where the quest is done. I actually would do this quest three times; once to get the epic staff, a second time to get back my good armor, and a third time to get back the earth staff (PLZ remember it is a useful mage item IN AND OF ITSELF and OMFG I'm not going to try to get a second one the way things are right now).<br>
2.) Make Magi more common.<br>
3.) Make Magi drop multiple copies of the staff.<br>
4.) Consider adding epic drops to Haunted Chests but make them uncommon or rare. This would ensure that ON EVERY raid there is the at least the possibility of getting a staff even if it's very slim. I'd then have at least hope with me on every raid and it'd be more exciting. That'd be better than going LFG, getting a group for Hate and committing the next 4-6 hours for the raid (because leaving a raid early on a regular basis is bad form), and then finding out from some ranger or monk that the mob you went up there for isn't there. That's a REAL DOWNER!! There's no decent exp on a Hate raid, no loot after your first ten raids; so you basically spend time for nothing in most cases. It's pretty depressing.<br>
<br>
Verant should also consider the potential that as the game matures, more and more people will be completing different parts of their epic (as I have) and will eventually be down to their last piece (usually Hate staff, Air Crown, and Quillmane cloak in that order). The bottleneck could only get worse in time.<br>
<br>
Please consider all that I've said (I really hope it's read - it at least means something to me) and maybe respond or make a change that could benefit everyone.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the good times (and I guess the bad ones too hehe).<br>

If there is a way to workaround the coding inplace and know beyond a shadow of a doubt magi is up with staff then it will be used. Ethical or not thats life and with the infuriating timesink quality and endless killing of @#%$ mobs for rare epic pieces I can see where it would be easily<br>
justafiable to some to use show eq.  i heartily concur there should be some alternative to to both the hate staff and air crown.On the bright side the mage numbers seem to be slowly<br>
dwindling thereby increasing the chances of the non epiced mage played as a main to finish up his or her epic. I would definitely load my retired mage up for a shot at finishing my epic. On the flip side playing coth/vending machine for the rest<br>
of my eq days for a guild that helped me finish it is so unappealing that I will most likely move on from eq at some point epic unfinished. Until and unless there is a need for more than 5 mages or so per high end guild it is doubtful that the mage epic will be redone. With the exception of the power of air from mistmoore in which it  took 2 epiced clerics barking at my guild at the time to move around  and get thier asses to mistmoore to get me that piece ). Every other piece has been a byproduct of someone elses raid that required more than one group. Yes our epic is hard and not easily finished and when and if you do it is a big accomplishment. Mages as a class need some spell or skill that makes a raid from runnyeye to Vex thall  faster, simpler,safer.As long as it takes only 3 mages to raid high end places our numbers will dwindle imo.<br>
For lack of a better example monkly business had 18000+ members  mage compendium has how many ? Monks bitch myself included stuff gets changed/fixed asap as compared to mages bitching numbers matter. If  a huge number of monks say NFW I am not pulling till they tone down the casters again<br>
it gets done. If every single mage said no t rods focus items for you no one gives a @#%$. Guilds would powerlevel 2 box mages and keep right on rolling thru high end encounters.Until the mage class is made appealing in some way there will be no change in the epic I am afraid we dont have the numbers and we can be effectively 2 boxed as coth t rod  machines.<br>
I wish you well on your endless quest for the ever elusive earthstaff Sir mage )<br>

Being a Magician is quite depressing actually.  The only safety and security I ever feel is when I am soloing and reading a book.  Some people say they like Mages but sometimes I wonder if it's due to pity.  To be quite frank our epic quest sucks.  It's NOT fun.  It's probably one of the worst quests in the game.  I remember the first day the epic quests were created and I got right to work.  Seeing some Rogues, Enchanters, and Clerics getting their epics within ONE WEEK... well it was depressing... and rather typical these days.  It really saddens me how I see level 51 Clerics running around with their epic.  It makes you wonder if it's because non-mages don't care about mages?  Or is it because our quest is so @#%$ difficult to finish it's almost unbearable?<br>

Once you bottom it out and hand in say, 4 peices of apothic you get an item that you turn in elsewhere to spawn a 60ish slowable mob in the same league as Ixiblat Fer. <br>

 This mob ALWAYS drops the earth staff.  Leave P`Tasa where he is with his drop rate, but add this for mages who can't dedicate thier lives to PoH. <p>[56 Conjurer] <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=64170" target=new>Allaa</a> (Dark Elf) < Amicus Primus >

Gah PLEASE put in that quest mob version I could use the bank slots filled with Apothic Armor I never wear except to ingame weddings. There is an idea a lot of unepiced mages could hopefully agree on four random apothic pieces to get a trigger item that spawns a mob in Lavastorm. Why not monks got an epic triggerable spawn in Lava? Its fiery elementalish type of place ). There is absolutely no reason why casual players should not have a shot a getting their epics they are the majority of the customer base not the people decked out<br>
in high end gear this includes my mage. PS if you have a small<br>
or midsized guild you could always ask the people raiding Naggy for hand as well ).<br>

I remember that great day for you and how you were bouncing off the wall <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  Congrats again.<br>
<br>
You were the last mage on our server to get the staff before they changed the drop rate.<br>
<br>
Sorry if you thought I meant disrepect to raid leaders who call loot beforehand on semi-open raids.  I didn't - It's actually ok with me that one of the raid leader's perogatives is to call epic drops as long as everyone knows in advance.  I just wanted to use that quote from the post as evidence in my rant in conjunction with my argument of what the obstacles are and wanted feedback from people in the rant forum.  The post was basically about multiquesting.<br>
<br>
It's not an impossible quest I know and someday I'll get mine too.  Looking forward to it actually.<br>
<br>
I was just venting that day hehe.<br>

<br>
Saturday Night - Logged off and went to look at the Tunare board post to see what time the raid was.  I found out in the edit to the original post that the raid leader couldn't make the raid and delegated the raid to a friend.  The time wasn't included in the post edit, so I made a list of people who were going to the raid and thought I'd log back on and send a tell to people which I did and someone told me they thought it was noon eastern.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 10:00 am</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Logged in early and was the first one so I created the /join Hate channel.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 11:00 am</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  A lvl 60 mage shows up in the zone and goes LFG.  A little while later a palladin shows up and goes  LFG - We all chat for a while.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 12:00 noon</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  Still no one else around and I'm getting nervous that the raid isn't going on (remember that the original leader couldn't come).<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 12:30 pm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I figured since no one was showing up I'd form a pickup raid and lead the raid myself yielding the raid back to the original posters if they ever showed up even if we had already ported.  I get 7 Hate stones and people are responding to /ooc and friends of the others that were there are coming and the word is spreading.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 1:15pm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> The guy who was delegated to lead the raid rambles in and I say in the channel that I yield the raid.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 2:00pm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Groups are started to be made and I'm summoning focus items and T Rods for people, etc.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 2:15pm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Up to group 6 is made and I wasn't listed yet but only about 15 people had signed up.  I kindly sent a tell to the leader with the list of all the people that signed up reminding him before he makes the last group.<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  Sunday 2:30pm</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Last group made and I still didn't make it (I'm lvl 57 and had signed up) but a lvl 48 mage who didn't sign up made it who wasn't even in the guild that's leading the raid.<br>
<br>
So after all this I sent a tell (angry but not really disrepectful) that I thought it was wrong of him.  I got no answer back from him but I did get a tell from someone else in his guild asking if I was the person who was trying to snipe the raid (<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  WTF!!!!! ????</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->)  I just wanted to go to Hate <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I think I didn't make the raid because the leader unjustifiably bore me a grudge.<br>
<br>
It's just a question of server politics.<br>
<br>
I like to raid Hate and exploring the zone with Eye of Zomm is kinda fun.  I also like the anticipation of maybe getting the staff.  Just not having a lot of fun doing the quest as you all can tell hehe.<br>

<br>
/cry off<br>
<br>
3 straight days Waiting for PoF to drop in SolA, not to mention the several other times I went there for hours at a time.<br>
<br>
lvl 20-35 in SK trying to get quillmanes cloak, over 2 straight days of running around killing all named.  Ended up getting it by a chance run through to grab a port.<br>
<br>
Yet you log 60 hours in an XP zone, getting Apotholic Armor and you want to cry?  WTF, I logged 40 hours there got my staff and nearly a full set of apotholic.  Even got some xp, I have no sympathy for this until quillmane and Blazing ele's are fixed.  At least with the earth staff, we can get something, have someone to talk to.  The PoH drop is one of the more pleasent ones to attempt to get.  Quillmane is a bigger bottleneck than the staff is.  Your concern only takes the high end mage into mind. What about those in smaller guilds who can't do it?  At the very least, the 2 lowby ones should be made always drop, and magi with staff should be a triggered event ala faydedar, just replace the gnome with magi p'tasa, make the trigger simple, and change the druid trigger to magi's death.  Badda bing, you would now have a reason to help that druid/ranger out, and he would know this hence stop looting the cloak or at least MQ it with you for simply helping him kill magi so faydedar could be slain.<br>
<br>
I like Faydedar, I seriously think it's a fun guy to take, small hard to see, FR out the cazu, fun to loot his drop and say oops sorry drood, didn't mean to pay ya back for that cloak J/K. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucaeadyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>caeadyen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 62<br> <font color=#333333>(7/18/02 10:43:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_lightbulb.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Oh yeah one more rant</span><hr size=1> Pissed1VI2SOE, <br>
<br>
Don't put words in my mouth bro and what kind of response was that?  I said I spent 60 hours in hate and hadn't even SEEN Magi (not to mention that he might not drop the thing, the fact that the staff may be spoken for, or the fact that there might be a random involved); I don't have the staff yet and am still looking.   Why don't you read the original post more carefully before posting such a condescending rant; I also did admit that there were mages that got their staffs after about a dozen raids or so, but at the same time I know of other mages who've put in more than 50 raids (and in one case almost 100) and still haven't gotten it - what's that 300+ hours? WTF!! so don't be loud already.  Besides - this is the rants forum anyway.<br>
<br>
I also said I've been doing this quest for over a year.<br>
<br>
And another thing, the Quillmane or Plane of Air pieces aren't even in the same league as the hate staff as far as odds of getting it go and then Power of Fire is not even worth bothering to mention about even when going there for days on end and hours here and there.  I remember that camp and can sympathize with you because I went through what you did too hehe but it's just not the same.  I also remember my Quillmane time; I did that mob solo with NO help from anyone, not even a tracker.  Don't tell me how much time it takes to wander around South Karana looking for the mob - I was there with my gaze staff peering off into the distance from the tops of hills forever and clearing green mobs before I finally got lucky.  That camp was easy - I could do it solo and had no competition at my lvl but it just took time.  <br>
<br>
My complaint with Magi is that even if I invested so much time it's a bottleneck and there's server politics involved which makes it really hard.  Plane of Air isn't in the same category because all you do is get all your friends or a guild together for a couple days and go to the 7th island and clear it - you will almost certainly get a crown (the time I went up there with some friends about 6 crowns dropped although I've heard 0-3 is more typical and 0 would suck bad) - that piece is very very very much easier than the earth staff.<br>
<br>
Ummm I'm not sure but it doesn't sound like you've been on very many Hate raids.  Hate (although the mobs are blue) is NOT an exp zone LOL (/em laughs at Pissed1VI2SOE) and apothic is easy to get and you'll have it all in no time and still probably will not see Magi.  I've been in the KS group once or twice over a dozen raids or so and one time was there for 6 hours.  I got 1 and 1 half blue bubs of experience but that was more than compensated by the exp I lost due to deaths on break ins or unlucky pulls (not to mention the time I wasn't able to get a rez in less than 3 hours because of a 5 hour CR that took place - GM was there worried about the Hate server crashing because of all the corpses that piled up - 70 people eventually were there total from the original raid and all the rescue attemps and a lot of people died 2 or 3 times - maybe 100 corpses or more at the gate house - that was kind of fun hehe).<br>
<br>
Come back when you know what you're talking about Pissed1VI2SOE ok.  I think you were just lucky on your staff but congrats anyway.<br>
<br>
I'm more than willing to do the time but I don't take kindly to having to put up with BS from other people ok (here OR in the game).<br>

P.S.  Contrary to what you implied, my post was not directed with respect to mages in larger guilds.  In fact, I'm in a guild of about 6 regular people with a few who show up from time to time just to have fun.  None of us have their epic, besides my mage at 57 everyone else is lower than 55 and we're nowhere near uber. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucaeadyen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>caeadyen</A> at: 7/19/02 4:22:01 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uuprisingtorment.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uprising Torment</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(7/19/02 8:22:46 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hate Staff</span><hr size=1> I agree that ANY epic should have a risk vs. reward factor, or in the case that I will use a difficuly vs. reward factor.<br>
<br>
In this case the Rogue epic quest Vs. Ragebringer is a good example. Not to horrible to complete compared to other epics, and the uber guilds make the rogue epic an afternoon project. (least on TM anyway). There are far more weapons and gear that easily replace Ragebringer and all it will do for the rogue is just sit in the bank and collect dust.<br>
<br>
In the example of Magician epic quest Vs. Orb of master/mega pet. It is not too unreasonable that it should be greatly more difficult to get the mage epic because it will not be replaced and I think (imo) that it adds the most benifits and power to mages who do get the epic done.<br>
<br>
On there otherhand, there is difficult, and just plain impossible.<br>
<br>
The PoA crown takes at least a 3 day (average) raid to complete just to even get to the 7th isle let alone clear it. If there are roughly 0-3 drops per run on the isle then it should take no more than 2 runs to get crowns for all the mages there (I would think that there should be no more than 5, Just me tho), when I went to the PoA to get my crown we ended up clearing the isle 2 times and managed to get 4 crowns total, myself being the last one merited. (I was garanteed a crown so my patience paid off). Didnt seem to be extremly difficult but I got lucky imo. For some it might take one day to get there and clear the isle and for others it might take 5-6 raids to PoA just before getting to the isle the very first time. There are always 2 sides to the spectrum.<br>
<br>
The staff from Hate is the last peice I need. It is also the last peice that almost all the other mages in the game need. Maybe it's just a popular peice im not certain. And altho (personally) I have only gone to hate 4 times, I have only seen Magic Pasta up once and we didnt get a chance to grab him that time because our enchanters were leaving. *raises hand at sky**Damn you!!!* anyways. I see all of these posts by people always telling me about there sad stories and how they have been to hate 50+ times almost 100 times and never seen him, and the other side of people that are short and sweet. &quot;went to hate for the first time ever today at 49 and got the stik, was a great day. Oh yeah, anyone know what DS I should get at 49?&quot;<br>
<br>
/Sarcasim off<br>
<br>
Those make it painfull for me to see. Both sides that is.<br>
<br>
Too be honest, I think that people are exaderating when they tell me they went to hate 50+ times, just imo so dont flame me :P<br>
<br>
But nevertheless, there still should be something done because it does seem absolutly rediculace.(i cant spell btw)<br>
<br>
Now this is just me and my schedulle, but I currently work from 3:30 to 11:00 at night, play till about 3 or 4am (If I can) then sleep till about 10 or 11am. I will soon be starting school again and will have to cut my playtime short maybe 1 or 2 hours every day of the week.<br>
<br>
So if you figure I can get in 3 hours of play time each weekday, and the average raid to hate takes about 4-5 hours, then I will not be able to EVER attend any of these raids during the weekdays. On the weekend I am more open but I do prefer to spend time with family and friends when I can so most of my weekend is shot and im lucky if I can get in 2 hours a day each weekend.<br>
<br>
This combined with a spawn in hate that is already a rare spawn with PH's and the staff being a rare drop, I am looking at about 1-2 years before I can even start playing EQ about 6 hours a day. 1-2 years because I am a full time student at college and go year-round.<br>
<br>
So 1.5 years pass and im back to playing EQ more and more. Say im going to hate at least once a week and always on the same day at the same time. To my information Magic boy seems to be on a 3day +/- 12 hours (60-84 hour spawn) Since there are not enough spawn places for all of the mini's in hate, he in a sense has PH's. So lets say when all mini's are up he is up half the time. If there are 3 hate raids every day all the time and you play during the same times, then eventually you will run into Magic prissy pants. Lets say he spawns every 60 hours therfor always allowing the maximum of mhunki pasta's to spawn. And him having the staff as a rare drop is about a 20% drop rate, but we'll push it up to 50% just for this &quot;special scinareo.&quot;<br>
<br>
Raid time say is always on a thursday from 6pm-12 midnight. (6 hour raid)<br>
<br>
60 spawn timer starting at 12 midnight<br>
<br>
50% chance of dropping the staff.<br>
<br>
SO!! spawn starts - sunday noon he's up and killed during second raid for the day.<br>
<br>
Spawn starts - Tuesday midnight he's up and killed during third raid (not yours)<br>
<br>
Spawn starts - Friday noon he's up and killed during second raid.<br>
<br>
blah blah blah blah blah... The first time you even have a chance at seeing magi is on your 11th time being at the end of the raid at midnght. Being at 50% drop rate (thats the extreme mind you) you would have to go to hate a MINIMUM of 22 times before you are sure to get the staff IF you are the only mage there. For the casual player there is NO ONE who wants to invest that amount of time into a stick wich turns out to be anywhere from 66 hours to 132 hours raid hate. How would you like to know that your maget has  an added 5 days 12 hours to his/her play time because of this one single drop...<br>
<br>
Long story short (and im already too late) Something needs to be done about the drops in the epic, and not just our epic but all epics with long camps or mobs that just cant be reached without sacraficing your entire life, so that the casual player or players with strict schedulles can acually acheive there epic. I dont have any ideas at this time, but maybe if there is enough disturbance in the mage comunity then we can make a difference.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long post.<br>

OK So tell me again why I have to ditch my friends to get my Mage epic?<br>
<br>
After 28 raids (25 real ones plus 3 all night CRs) and more than 160 hours invested in trying to get just ONE piece of my mage epic, I know now what I have to do to increase my chances to the point where I probably will finish it; but for me that's not a valid option - I'd have to leave my small guild of friends behind and join a larger guild.<br>
<br>
1.) At first I didn't know what I was doing and just attended open raids, but I was happy because I got all my mage class armor - that took 7 raids.<br>
<br>
2.) A couple raids later we finally made it to the 2nd floor and I was amazed to see the zone outside of the port up room or gatehouse. It was fun.<br>
<br>
3.) I had a few bad expereinces around raid 10 with the mage Fire staff (not for epic). A Mini dropped the fire staff and the raid leader awarded it to the mage in his guild as a consolation prize for not seeing Magi P'Tasa and his staff - I guess it wasn't an open raid after all. Another raid I went on, a fire staff dropped and the raid leader (who was ignorant of our quest) got excited and had the leader of the KS group loot the staff for MQ for a mage in his guild who wasn't even there, but that item is no drop and it got burned - I guess that raid wasn't open either (contrary to posted info).<br>
<br>
4.) After 15 raids and still yet to have seen Magi P'Tasa I kept trying. By this time I was lvl 58 and could use Eye of Tallon (thank you for the aggro changes to that spell that were made!). I started sending the eye out on every raid over and over again looking around and got a map. I learned the layout of the first floor and some of the 2nd floor. This took a few raids because I sent eye during down times.<br>
<br>
5.) After a few more raids I decided to try camping at the zone and logging in to see if I could start tracking the zone. I lucked out a few times and didn't die, but eventually learned that the zone in isn't a safe spot becuase the Spite Golem WILL come if he's nearby and you are not invis.<br>
<br>
6.) A few more raids later I decided to camp out near the ramp on the way back down to the port in room and check the zone later. I found this to be in general a pretty safe place - I did die there once after leaving the computer logged in but usually it doesn't happen. I spent from Thursday night (the night before the day before I thought the Minis were due to spawn again) until Tuesday morning either camped in Hate or on a Hate raid. I took account of that zone at least every three hours for 4 and 1/2 days. I learned things about the zone most people don't know (like what a reasonable estimate of the Mini spawn time is - and I went back and measured this this same way accounting for each individual spawn spot for a couple more cycles - and the crazy antics of the mobs on patrol near the zone in) and know the zone layout better than quite a few monks. It was during one of these EXHAUSTING camping session that I learned about the 10 Mini spawn spots and how I saw more than one of the same Mini in the same cycle (which means by the way assuming that if two of the same Mini can't be up at the same time and if each mini can spawn at each of the 10 spots with equal probability that there is only a 65% chance Magi P'Tasa will show up that cycle if a raid or an uber guild takes down the Minis as they spawn - I know basic probability theory well enough to do that simple calculation). It was during one of these camping session that I finally saw Magi P'Tasa - because of how I was checking the zone I was able to catch him within a few hours of his spawning in the middle of the night. He didn't have the staff  The only time I saw him in all my time and he didn't have the staff.<br>
<br>
8.) By this time, I am recognizing and chatting with a quite few people I see on different Hate raid I go on. I remember who the leaders were, who were the enchanters, who the pullers and main assists were, and people I've been in groups with. I know at least 8 people now on each raid and not everyone makes it to every raid. Some of the people are the mages I might have to random the staff with later someday (this is the part that is most gut wrenching)<br>
<br>
7.) I happened to be able to log in today the day of the patch. I logged in S Ro and not to my surprise another mage I know is LFG on the wizard platform waiting for a Hate raid and watching for snipers - since the Minis should spawn later today there will inevitably be some. An hour later an enchanter I know pops in and after talking to her I found out that her guild and guild alliance is going up to do the zone. I asked her if I could join but there were already three mages from that guild going up to try to get the staff today. That's just from one guild alliance.<br>
<br>
8.) Last nights raid got steamrolled by an uber guild - They even had the audacity to say that they would sell a MQ of the earth staff if it dropped. This was the same guild that snipped three of the Hate raids I went on last month.<br>
<br>
That's just not right. The whole thing is #%@!ing usless!!!!<br>
<br>
This isn't fun anymore. It's work! You log in, you put your time in, hope for some recognition, and then go home tired.<br>
<br>
I know now what I have to do to get my last epic piece. I need to leave my small band of 5 or 6 friends who are usually on in my guild and join an uber guild that has the ability to instantly call forth a raid force as soon as Magi P'Tasa spawns faster than anyone else on the server and then go camp a &quot;safe spot&quot; for a couple weeks. I don't want to do that. WTF!!! The other option is to make a lot of cash to buy stones, dots, shrink potions, and try to line up MAs, Monks, Clerics, and enchanters and host my own raids for 3 or 4 days in a row. Besides that, the only thing to do is get lucky and hope he spawns while the raid is on.<br>
<br>
I can understand some items in the game are uber and there is the concept that there is prestige associated with that (OMG nice job by the way on the spoken links thing but after looking at some spoken links to some items from the Mob boss in Vex Thal I'm just depressed - here I am and I can't even get my epic). But there are a lot of epics out there now and I did put in over a year of work to this quest and am almost done - it comes down to now if I get the Earth staff I get my epic. It's not like an uber item from an uber mob that I can't do. I've seen 22 Minis go down so far (1 was Magi P'Tasa and he was being sniped as we ported in the same one without the staff I saw the day before - and what does that say for the how wanted the Magi P'Tasa is in Hate - guilds snipe that mob but not the others). I can assemble a raid force of 25+ good people to do the fight with enought advance notice (just not over and over and over again for the same thing with nothing to show for it). A lot of people have epics - I'm almost lvl 59 and think it would be nice to have - I have put in the time. <br>
<br>
This - our mage class quest - is totally FUBAR!!!! I'm quite turned off to all other quests and tradeskills and my goal is now to get lvl 60, get aa points, get /pet hold (screw the raid leader when he says I can't have a pet), and go for the record number of Hate raids. I know a few people over 60 so far and have heard of certain Hate raid leaders at 150. OMFG, I hope I get my staff by then.<br>
<br>
My whole focus is changed - I'm going to have done more Hate raids than anyone else has ever done and maybe I might get lucky and get the staff - either that or I'll be burned out and not play this game anymore. I just don't want to ditch my friends and join an &quot;uber&quot; guild. C'mon WTF!!<br>

Guilds are always wanted to progress and take tougher mobs and as mine believes, it can't be done when you continue to do mobs and epics that are trivial or that don't benefit the guild (whatever that means). They need to make the epic mobs harder and spawnable in easy in the non-planar zones plain and simple but VI feels it necessary to make a FICTIONAL game have a realistic edge by showing you can't get what you want unless you wait long enough (in otherwords pay them enought money per month) or stay up an insane amount of hours to get an ultra-rare mob to spawn just to find out he dropped his common drop or was ks'ed.<br>
<br>
Got a tad off topic but my basic thoughts are eliminate the need to go to planes for epic pieces. Make planes essentially for gear like HoT or Kael. It's so sad I have pretty much decided what I will be doing is parking one of my characters I play a lot up in hate and leaving his ass up there until I get the staff.<br>
<br>
What I find is funny is if the other epics were that comparable to the mage epic there is NO WAY the Everquest community would allow VI to bend them over like this.<br>
<br>
If anything make the Magi more common, been to hate and checked on mobs in hate enough to know he should have been on.<br>
<br>
Last thought: With a proposed idea of a 2nd epic coming out with the release of PoP, how do you feel about your guildies getting their 2nd part of their epic before you even have your FIRST.<br>
<br>
Things that make you go hmmmm. <p><center><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=274600" target="_blank">

Sure I would love to complete it someday but the rarity of the mobs makes mage epic one of the, if not the toughest epics to complete. Now that they made Cleric epic now easier to complete, i hope Verant wise up and made our epic piece dropping mobs less rare. I've been to countless Hate raids, never seen Magi'Ptasa up too. It probably just me having bad luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showPrevMessage?topicID=263.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showNextMessage?topicID=263.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=263.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.threadControl?topicID=263.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=263.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=263.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants>Rants !</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
