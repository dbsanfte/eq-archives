This would mean I spent anywhere from a minute to a minute and a half casting.  40% of a mob with approximately 200k HP is still 80k HP.  I guess we're inadequate, but I'm pretty sure as a guild we don't produce a dmg output of 80k HP/ min....so yeah, there was plenty of time to get off these casts.<br>

Oh and on the enchanter thing....you're right....I was wrong.  An enchanter with the 857289347529348075 AA points it takes to get Dire Charm probably could outsolo a lvl 58 mage.

I agree.  HOWEVER, have you EVER watched an epic or post-epic melee with others' hits on?  I cannot believe that you have, if you think our pets are even a FRACTION of their power.  Let me give one example, a rather uber SK on Tarew Marr zoned into Chardok once when I was the only one in the zone.  When I was the only one there (at level 57) I could keep the hall clear down to the fort by myself.  By the time I had the last part of the left hall killed, there was respawn up top.  Reasonable, no?  All right, so this 59 SK shows up with his primal 2hander and spiffy black armor.  He pulls a couple mobs from the zonein while I am medding, and kills them in about 30 seconds each.  It takes me well over that much time to kill a chardok mob solo, and then I have down time...He didn't have any.  Snare, fear, double for 300+ about once a second....That's damage, not doubling for 60 with the occasional tripple or quad...come ON.  He proceeded to clear the entire zoneout and, with a click of his pegasus cloak, lev'ed up into the left tunnel...He popped out of the empty fort about half an hour later, and we were still the only two in the zone.  /boggle.  So, YOU tell ME...are melee's overpowered, in that they can rip through a 50+ zone with no downtime and put out well over 100 DPS while tanking the mobs and taking hits in sub-50 range?  Or are mages overpowered, along with the rest of us poor casters, in that our PEAK output damage barely matches that of a single shadow knight in good gear, and that he can keep it up without a pause while we need to med for MUCH longer than it takes us to do the damage?  That is when I decided I wasn't too interested in playing a mage any more.  I like to feel Useful (tm).  In order to do that, I must do one of several things: I must contribute significant damage to a mob, or I must provide some uncomparable service to the group or raid.  Since on TM there is no shortage of Enlightened Dark or Clan of Shadows or Enrapture melee's and clerics, doing a group damage equivilant to 15 mages and pulling trains because the mobs pretty much just can't hurt them...Everquest has become seriously unbalanced, and Verant KNOWS that they can't nerf melee...they'd lose players.  They also KNOW that they can't bring casters up to the DPS and easy of fighting that melee have at this point, then the game would be TWICE as unbalanced.  They'd have to re-evaluate all the planes and endgame encounters, they'd have to put in new harder zones which would be ignored by groups who went back to kunark and old world zones to solo entire dungeons...Here we go, I'm doomscrying the end...Everquest isn't going to last another three years, I'd stake a fair wager on that.<br>
<br>
On that note, happy president's day!<br>

And my favorite statment is orbits about tashing, this is if nothing else shows just how much of a newb you are, ever heard of suicide tashing? never played a chanter have you? well suicide tashing is something that most end game chanters know all about, tash is a HUGE aggro(used to be more) dieing to get a tash in early is just something that a chanter does.<br>

I am a Newb thank you very much.. I think we we play different game myself.. Looks to me that your part of a zerg kill. Well some of us play this game SMART, and try to do things with the LEAST amout of ppl.. Sorry now I understand how you dont see my views..

The reason for death tash is quite simple, by death tashing the enchanter lands tash early, and goes right into the mobs face so he doesn't train the casters. You see since resistance checks are made as soon as a spell is cast in order to get the reduced resists for malo/malosini the full spell has to be cast before the start of malo and then before the start of malosini. This combined with the fact that the enchanter used is one of the enchanters on a second computer that several people in my guild have creates an effective safe system. Zerg thats very entertaining.<br>

Truthfully we do play a different game. Thats what this game is about. One thing I did failed to point out is I belong to a small guild and we will have at the most at one time 4 groups. We count on everyone to be up to stuff and on the mark. Out of a group of 18 ppl I am the only mage, I have spot here and a job to do on raids. I know my job and I know my place, No I dont put out the damage like a warrrior or a rogue. But tell me which of them can give mana to that cleric thats in need after a 10mins of fighting.. <br>
<br>
<br>
One thing I do like about this game there is always more way to &quot;skin a cat&quot; perse. And I rather try it my way and not look at others on how they do it..<br>
<br>
I am happy with my toon, yes it could &quot;stronger&quot; . But you know what I will not spent my days whinning about it. I move on and adjust to what they throw at me.<br>
<br>
And if feel I am a n00b, more power to ya, I have NOTHING to prove to you what I know about this game. I know what I can do and try to have fun.. I wish you the same.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You just dont get it do you... <br>

So what your saying is since you cant do much on 2 percent of the mobs in this game.. Things need to change in the class.. Dream on......<br>

<br>
We're *ok* right now, but we do need improvement.  Our primary role as a support class (and don't be mistaken, in the end-game environment that *is* our role) does work, albeit very constrictively (COH and only a few conjures are our valued presence, pets are not)  There are only a couple of issues that I think really *need* to be worked on, then a couple which I feel would be *nice*  In general though, I totally agree with the post's intent:  We do need to be constructive and analytical in our presentation of needed improvements and modifications, and not to come off as &quot;whining&quot;, because as someone said, you can very well just &quot;say&quot; that virtually anything is unbalanced, unfair, or in need of change - proving it as a priority over something else is the hard part.<br>
<br>
Needs:<br>
<br>
1. Pathing improvements.  Our pets are great, but the fact is that, due to pathing and command interface it's almost criminal to try using them in a very extreme number of environments (easily half the places in game are marked &quot;unsafe&quot; for pets)  The new Luclin command /pet Hold as implemented as a costly class skill I consider a slap in the face - Mages are the only ones who *need* that due to our reliance on pets and it should have been issued to us, and for free, a long long time ago - not as a 6-level Class skill cost.<br>
<br>
2. Damage relativity update.  Druids SHOULD NOT overnuke a Mage, period.  I asked bluntly the ratio on the best Druid DD vs. my best (and mind you NEW Luclin DD), and found out that the Druid one is more powerful in EVERY way (Cast speed, manacost, and dmg amount)<br>
<br>
<br>
Would be nice:<br>
<br>
1.  More conjures.  Hey, every time someone asks me why I picked being a Mage, I answer as follows:  &quot;I love to conjure up cool crap and blow things up.&quot;  Basically, as long as I'm highly capable of those 2 things I'm a happy Magi <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That being said, we sure could use a bunch more useful conjures... we have many that are useful, but as someone stated already the implementation of some of them into item right-clicks for other classes lowers their value so we should have more alternatives to compensate and keep us with a vast, not limited, variety of conjurables.<br>
<br>
2.  Pet modes.  As masters of pets, moreso than other classes, I feel it would be good if we had better control of our pet's/preferances than we do.  For instance, the fact that there is almost no functional difference between my pet being in Taunting mode versus it not being in taunting mode bothers me.  Also as stated with the /pet hold, that's an insult - that should be free, and if we had to pay exp for anything it should be an alternate combat mode entirely (like &quot;/pet guard target&quot; to provide that the pet defends another player as it would otherwise defend its Master... I've always dreamed of having that one *drool*) <p>Novin, 60 Arch Mage

<br>
I wonder if there were any rogues or monks that said that?<br>
<br>
Doesn't matter, their classes became more and more powerful with each expansion.  Your negativity about mage improvements is flying in the face of the evidence.<br>
<br>
Evidence suggests whining = mass improvements.  Just ask rangers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jaytee, you said you were the only mage on the raid.<br>
<br>
We've already established that the top mage on a raid is useful.<br>
<br>
When you're on a raid with 2-4 other mages, there's no role you play that you couldn't play better by being another class.  Damage?  Your damage is laughable compared to the melees.  Tanking?  Sorry, pets aren't tanking anything.  Utility?  The other 3 mages have that covered, thanks.  i.e., you were the only mage on the raid.  Why don't we think long and hard about that little bit of information.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your narrow input on your specific situation, though.  Do try to pay attention in the future.<br>

And in that isolated case...only 1 is needed.<br>
<br>
That is why the class needs to be looked at.  My guild has killed Vulak - Tormax, Vind, Statue, AoW - Tunare - and a host of others with NO Magician assistance period.  Lets see how far you get with no clerics, or no warriors, or no shaman, or no enchanters, ect ect. <p><hr>
