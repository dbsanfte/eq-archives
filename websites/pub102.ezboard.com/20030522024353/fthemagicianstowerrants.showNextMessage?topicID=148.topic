As such, all of what follows is based only on my studies of their spell lists and my experiences grouping with necros.  Furthermore, I am only considering levels below 50, as there doesn’t yet seem to be much concrete data for the post-50 spells.  You may make what you will out of these arguments; they are only my opinions.<br>
<br>
<br>
Combining the Best of Every Class: the Necromancer<br>
<br>
As you look down the necro’s spell list, you can’t help but wonder if this is indeed what Verant had in mind when they designed the class.  Necromancers can summon powerful pets, heal and buff the pets, regenerate mana with lich form, cast fearsome DoTs, cast decent DDs (at the levels they receive them, anyway), debuff to a limited extent, alter MOB movement (darkness, root, fear), transfer their mana or health to others, mesmerize, find and summon corpses, and feign death.  As if that weren’t enough, they have a few powers all their own, including lifetaps and the best levitate spell in the game (Dead Man Floating).  About the only things they cannot do are travel well (SoW, teleports) and summon weapons.  The only other class that can even begin to compare with this variety of abilities is the bard, who cannot solo nearly as well as a necro can.<br>
<br>
Verant’s justification for all these powers is, of course, that necros are evil and thus harder to play.  This is true, but only to a limited extent.  While it’s certainly annoying to have a lot of vendors refuse to sell or buy from you, it is exactly that – a mere annoyance.  It is not hard nor very expensive to stock up with massive quantities of food and water during a visit to your home town.  Besides, offering a modest sum of a few platinum while hunting far from home is usually more than enough to obtain some summoned or foraged food, and many players (druids come to mind) are willing to buy loot such as FS weapons from you at fair prices.  As for necromancers’ bad faction with the guards of most cities, this problem is again easy to circumvent.  A personal friend of mine started an erudite necromancer and came to hunt in Blackburrow around level 6.  By the time he was 8, the Qeynos guards conned only ‘dubious’ to him.  Thus, Verant’s alleged ‘weaknesses’ of the necro class are ones that can be worked around without much effort – certainly a small price to pay for the powers you receive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Group-Friendly Necros<br>
<br>
By using fear kiting and their powerful DoTs, necros are hands-down the best soloing class in the game.  Additionally, although I have no personal experience playing one, I imagine that it would be fiendishly difficult for them to die.  In the unlikely situation that they bite off more than they can chew, they can simply root or fear the MOB and run; or if the situation turns desperate, they can feign death.  Now I have no problem with this: Verant obviously designed them to be a solo class, and they have succeeded brilliantly (if not a bit too brilliantly).  What irks me to no end is that necromancers have decent GROUPING abilities as well.  When I was in my low 30s, I remember several groups in Cazic actually wanting a necro for Screaming Terror (since enchanters seem to be relatively rare).  Furthermore, although the necro’s DDs are few and far between, at levels 24 and 44 they do over 80% of what a magician’s can do, for the same casting time and (compute it yourself) slightly GREATER mana efficiency.  The ‘disadvantage’ is the long recast time of 12 seconds.  However, is it not a well-known strategy NEVER to chain cast nukes except under the most desperate of circumstances?  Doing so only serves to agro the MOB on you; whether in a solo or group situation, it is best to space out your DDs to keep the MOB on your tanks or pet.  So in the end, I fail to see how the necro’s recast time is much of a penalty at all.  What we have in the necro, then, is a damage caster who can contribute to a group not only with powerful DoTs and a pet, but with DDs as well.  This is not to mention that they can heal in a pinch, as well as transfer mana to others, as well as MESMERIZE, that most revered of enchanter abilities.  For comparison purposes, magicians have good DDs and great pets, but the only other things they can offer a group are damage shields and a few useful summons.  I don’t know about you, but I would rather the group have an emergency mesmerizer than save a few platinum in the form of summoned bandages, arrows, and pet weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, What to Do?<br>
<br>
As you might have guessed by now, I believe the main thing that needs to be changed about necros is their usefulness to groups.  They are clearly meant to be a soloing class; this also makes sense from a roleplaying standpoint.  With that in mind, I propose the following remedies:<br>
<br>
1) Screaming Terror: This should be removed altogether.  Necromancers can already do so much damage at relatively little risk to themselves that I can’t see the need for them to have a mesmerize spell.  For the sake of groups who cannot find a bard or an enchanter, a similar single-target mes spell should perhaps be given to one of the other casters, but it does NOT belong with the necro.  I don’t think this would have much of an impact on necro soloing tactics, as fear kiting works on only one MOB at a time anyway.<br>
<br>
2) Direct Damage Spells: I have observed several mid- to high-level necromancers soloing, and only once have I ever seen one use a DD spell (and that was simply to clear a greenie that happened to get in his way).  In my experience grouping with necros, however, every one of them has used their DDs.  So, to make the necros less group-friendly, these DDs should have their damage and/or mana efficiency drastically reduced, if not removed altogether.  Magicians and wizards can’t (and shouldn’t be able to) cast DoTs; the same should apply to necros and DDs.<br>
<br>
3) Buffs: Although Dead Man Floating and the Cancel Magic series are the only ones I can think of at the moment, necros should be allowed to cast beneficial spells on NO ONE but themselves.  This is a relatively minor issue, but I think it would serve to reinforce the notion that they are outcasts and loners who prefer to remain solitary.<br>
<br>
4) Feign Death: As I mentioned before, necros already have a number of options to use when they realize they’re in trouble.  I see FD as a spell that should be used only as a last resort.  Consequently, there should be some adverse effects on the necro after he finishes a feign – perhaps something akin to the cleric Resurrection Effects but not quite as severe.  If the MOB happens to aggro on the necro right after feigning, tough luck – it’s just another case of the ‘risk’ philosophy that Verant seems to embrace so much with the other classes.  However, changing FD would really affect the necro’s soloing ability more than anything else, so I wouldn’t mind too much if the spell were left as is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Concluding Remarks<br>
<br>
If you’re still reading this, I thank you for your time.  Looking back on what I’ve written, I suspect many people (necros in particular! =P) might construe this as just another ‘class envy’ post.  I can’t say I blame you.  But honestly, necromancers can do so many things well that I simply cannot understand how they fit into Verant’s vision of class balance and interdependence.  They are already by far the best solo class out there, and there’s nothing wrong with that.  I just want to see them not quite as group-friendly as they currently are, and that they be exposed to a bit more risk when soloing.<br>
<br>
Please take the time to respond to this post if you have strong feelings one way or another – I am curious as to what other people think, particularly any necros who might happen to be reading this.  Flame me if you want, but keep in mind that I’m trying to express myself coherently and reasonably here =)<br>

Then there are our pets.  Our pets can fit any situation.  Necros really cant.  If you cast fear in a dungeon you WILL get pimp slapped.  Oh and at higher lvls there is the mod rod!

The necromancer is better, but in truth not by much.  What makes the necromancer better is:<br>
<br>
1)  They can handle multiple mobs much better (Point in fact you can kill 3 specters at once at level 40)<br>
<br>
2)  They are much better at escaping death.  Not really due to feign death, but instead harmshield.<br>
<br>
3)  They get the wizard's entire line of defensive skins (this is totally unfair).<br>
<br>
Some points for the magi:<br>
<br>
1)  Best damage shields in the game.<br>
<br>
2)  By far the best pets (Especially from 16-44, I haven't played post fifty).<br>
<br>
3)  Less luck-factor in battles.  After the speed nerf necro pets can die relatively easily ala enchanter pets.  Fear has a recycle time and if it is resisted sometimes as little as once it can turn into you running for it.  The more mobs the more likely fear will resist and you will die.<br>
<br>
4)  The Darkness line looks good, but in truth it is very resistable and not much better than most DDs for it's damage.<br>
<br>
A couple misconceptions about necromancers:<br>
<br>
1)  Feign death is not so great, especially after 35.  The skill constantly improves the spell is always the same, and fails frequently.<br>
<br>
2)  Necros are very group friendly simply because they bring that power to the group.  However they are not group friendly in the sense that more necros means less power (since nothing stacks including the 44 DD).<br>
<br>
The highest I could ever solo a yellow was 34 (HG) sans pet.  Definately the best class over all though, but the mage is up there as well. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Nilerek</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(9/28/00 3:46:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=21.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   by the way</span><hr size=1> You also forgot necros can charm other undead (useful in lower guk), and they also have that rune type spell.

Besides you make them when sitting around medding and such - you leave them on the ground (Example in the disco room in Sebilis) And the clerics pick them up when needed...as for using them on oneself, Would only happen in OOM and hi on health - but you only get 160 mana in return...or 150 or something...cant remember <p>Afierra Lonecaster

He has a 57 mage and a 47 necro, I ave a 59 necro and a 50 mage.  You can tell which ones we like.  I like the necro more, but i do think i mage has more to bring to a group. They bring in there tank and they also have GOOD damage shields, which i find very usfull on my Gnome warrior when being PL.  Necros do have much power but when im grouping as my cleric, rouge, or warrior i want a mage there to get the thing down fast.  When you have a necro in the group it takes froever.  There dots are very helpful, but with mage they fall faster.  my friend also agrees with the mage for groups but he still thinks that mages are better soloers, cause he has J-boots.<br>

Some time last year (i believe) Verant gave them more group friendly spells- mana sharing and health sharing. This just seems to go against the basis of their class thematically.<br>

<br>
BUT I think that the mage has plenty to bring to a group.  It is just a matter of letting others know WHAT you bring.  Instruct them, teach them and they will love you forever hehe<br>
<br>
an example, I taught the group I was in to not taunt unless the mob attacked a caster/cleric.  Let my pet taunt and tank as much as possible.  With a fire pet DS and insane regen my group didnt even NEED a cleric, the druid could handle all of our healing needs.<br>
<br>
Since then when I log in (pretty much live OSK at the moment) I have people asking me to group before I even have my food summoned!<br>
<br>
Its all in how you teach your group to work with you.<br>
