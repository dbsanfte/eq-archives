<br>
(Plan for a week or two of being STUCK in Plane of Sky.)<br>
<br>
My first bit of advice about Plane of Sky is this. <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Find a bridge.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> Don’t mess with the lesser Isles as there’s nothing there for you. If it takes you months to find a bridge, it’s worth the wait and there’s lots of game to play while you wait.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Grocery list:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
1 10 slot backpack FULL of Peridots.<br>
30 Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffins<br>
5 SPARE Cloudy Stones of Veeshan (You never know.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>To form the bridge:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Get a level 57+ Necromancer (Or a 53+ one with a Velious Robe for corpse summoning and an Essence Emerald for rezzing one person up there.) He will need Tiny Jade Inlaid Coffins. (The stackable type that sell for about 68 plat with high charisma.)<br>
<br>
Get ANY other class level 46+. (If you are getting bridged up there, just follow the instructions of the person bridging you.)<br>
<br>
Once you have these two characters up there, have them group up and jump the other person off Isle 7. He will land in the water outside Freeport. Run to the West Commons Wizard spires. This is a good meeting place since Wizards can get there easily.<br>
<br>
Have the Wizard port each group of Mages up until there is enough to fit into your group. (You should have room for 4 more people besides you and the Necromancer on Isle 7.)<br>
<br>
You will need a tiny coffin for each person. (The Necromancer needs to have a few on him before he gets to Isle 7.)<br>
<br>
Invite the Wizard and the remaining Mages and port up to Isle 1.<br>
<br>
You will need two Clerics to complete the bridging process as well. (Clickers make this MUCH faster.)<br>
<br>
The first cleric (The one that will be going to Isle 7 with your force to farm the Crowns.) will need to join your group and get himself killed by attacking the Key Master. (This leaves a 3 hour corpse instead of the 9 minute corpse that dying from a duel leaves, and dueling on Isle 1 can get you all killed.)<br>
<br>
When that cleric loads at their bind point, have the other cleric cast his highest rez. (Reviviscence I hope.) When the dead cleric loads in, have the Necromancer summon the corpse to Isle 7 and rez it with an essence emerald.<br>
<br>
Kick that cleric out of the group and if you have an Enchanter, invite them next. (The people getting rezzed up on Isle 7 will need clarity to get their buffs/pets/summoned stuff back up.) Have the enchanter attack the key master, die, get rezzed back in, summoned by the Necro, rezzed by the cleric on Isle 7 and leave the group.<br>
<br>
Continue inviting/killing/rezzing people until you have done this with all of the raid. If the last cleric is going to be joining you on Isle 7, they need to die, then get ported back into Sky by the Wizard so the Necro can summon the corpse up for rez.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Congratulations, you are all on Isle 7 and ready to begin crown farming!</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There’s a flat piece of ground about 100 feet out from the base of the ramp in the front of the castle. This is your best ground to fight in for pathing, aggro and overall visibility. Don’t get too close to the edge, as the Drakes can knock you off with their spells if you aren’t careful. This is where you will setup your camp. (Nothing here aggros so you can walk around a bit and check the layout if you want, just don't go near the portal dish on the far left side of the castle or the Eye/Hand of Veeshan will death touch you from Isle 8.)<br>
<br>
Summon up pets, muzzles, belts and fists/blades etc. Summon up spares because you will be chaining pets while fighting the Drakes. I also used the level 61 cleric Heroism upgrade &quot;Faith&quot; to give the pets some more HP/AC during the break in. (Drakes are the first mobs you will clear when farming this island.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Killing the Drakes</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
There are 3 flavors of Drake, Heartsbane Drakes (Black with 6k-ish hps),  Fatestealer Drakes (Green with 11k-ish) and Windrider Drakes (Blue with 14k-ish hps). All 3 types are 100% MR and hit pretty darn hard. The toughness of these drakes goes Black (Easy) Green (Pretty tough) and Blue (Somewhat like a named drake.. tough and drops named loot.. usually a NO DROP Melee haste belt of some sort.)<br>
<br>
The Windrider (Blue) drakes will spawn, and start to slowly fly away from the Island, they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>WILL</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> leave the Island and head off into the sunset if you don’t engage them so be sure and get on those ones when they spawn.<br>
<br>
If you stand near  the base of the ramp, you will see a pattern to the flying that the Drakes do. They slowly circle the castle at 3 different levels on the “Z” axis. (Some fly high, some fly low and some fly in between.. they can aggro from any height and chain aggro from any height and pathing is AWEFUL.)<br>
<br>
You will see what we called “The Conga Line” as the drakes do a follow the leader thing. As you watch, you will notice a big break in the line. What you want to do, is tag the LAST Drake in the line just as he hits the front of the ramp. Hit with Malise or annul or something of that nature as they can summon and you don’t want that.<br>
<br>
The Greater Sphinxes that are perched around the castle death touch, but have TINY aggro ranges.. I’ve pull within 10 feet of them without them noticing me.<br>
<br>
Don’t run too far (I know.. it hurts and you will die MANY MANY times while breaking the camp here.) if you run too far they will just fly back into their formation and circle the castle while passing aggro to the other 15+ drakes up there. You will wipe shortly after that.<br>
<br>
They cast Ice Comet, and proc a “Whirl till you hurl” type stunning, spinning thing. They melee for about 450 and will kill you fast.  (You can see how getting TWO of these can be a problem.) Don’t lose heart, we’ve taken down as many as 4 at once with two groups of Mages.. it can be done.<br>
<br>
The best way to walk them back to the raid is to walk towards them until you see them moving towards you, then walk backwards.. as soon as you see them start to turn away, walk towards them again. The trick is to keep them from hovering there pelting you with Ice Comets, while keeping close enough to melee range to keep them moving towards you, while avoiding the stun proc. (If you get stunned, you will be killed before stun wears off.)<br>
<br>
My Magic Resist was 180 and at level 63 I took a LOT of nukes and rarely resisted their proc when they hit me. It’s tough… die a lot, and get a feel for what works.<br>
<br>
If you wind up with 3 or 4 Drakes on the pull.. you will likely wipe. The KEY here is to assist ONE person and have the whole team focus on ONE drake. Ignore the Mages that are dying around you. FOCUS on that ONE DRAKE! That’s one less Drake in the conga line when you rez in again. (If you get two drakes, have one Mage off tank it with his pet.. Epic pets work NICE for this.) He can tank that long enough for the other Mages to dispatch the first drake.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Write down the time of the first Drake's death.</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Once you’ve killed about 5 Drakes you can begin to “Seek and Destroy”. You will move around the right side of the castle, searching the sky for Drakes that look to be separated from the pack. If you see one that you can kill before others path near, move your Mage army to it and order the kill. Drakes are REAL simple to wipe out once you’ve gotten those first 5 or so out of the way.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Undine Spirits</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (Cleric wisps)<br>
<br>
Once you have the Drakes dead, it’s time to pull the Undine Spirits from inside the Castle. (I know.. you are going to have to walk between two Greater Sphinxes to do it.. trust me, they won’t aggro. )  Just walk up the ramp, into the center of the building and look up while clicking around. You will see big yellow Willow Wisp looking dudes, 8 of them. Target one of the front ones and walk back to the edge of the ramp. Cast annul magic on it. You will probably stand there eating cleric nukes left and right. Have your cleric heal you as you stand there. (It’s a good idea to have a camped out cleric here in case of a wipe, but we went for 7 days without one and managed.)<br>
<br>
Sometimes you will get 4 that come at once, sometimes just one at a time. (I’ve never seen all 8 come on one pull.)<br>
<br>
The good news for your Enchanter is that they can crowd control these! (Chanters hate the Drakes because there is NOTHING they can do while fighting them!)<br>
<br>
Killing the Undine spirits is really really simple. Get them down the ramp, sick pets. Rinse/repeat. You can even take 4 undines at once if you really want to. Just stick two pets on each one and you’d be fine. They spend too much time casting, have 8k in health and only hit for 250’s.  If you find yourself standing there eating nukes, and the Undine Spirits aren’t coming down, go run into the center of the little port in dish and stand there for a few seconds, they should come down at that point and you can just backup down the ramp.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Here comes the painful part. The Greater Sphinxes.</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (There are 8 of these.)<br>
<br>
(Trying to kill the Greater Sphinxes before you kill the Undine Spirits can sometimes be trouble because the Undine Spirits will complete heal the Sphinxes.. and that means you are gonna get death touched more.)<br>
<br>
Start with the one on the right side of the ramp (If you are facing the castle.) position pets on the back of the sphinx and the right side. This will keep him from being pushed into another Sphinx and save you from getting another death touch.<br>
<br>
The best way to handle the death touches is to have ONE person each day volunteer to eat all 8 death touches. (This saves time from buffing a dead person every 3 minutes.) Rez them in, let them eat another one etc. You will make enough exp to not wind up in the negative doing this.<br>
<br>
They key here is to nuke and nuke hard.. the Sphinx will death touch someone every 30 seconds if he’s allowed to live that long. From my experience, it doesn’t matter whose pet is doing what, the Mage with the Epic pet will eat the next death touch. (Yay Oober Epic pet taunt!) I even had my Cleric nuking to keep the fight under the 30 second window. (Clerics won’t be ANYWHERE on the Aggro list from nuking, so don’t worry about him eating the next death touch.. never happened once in 72 Greater Sphinx kills.<br>
<br>
The Greater Sphinxes are Enchanter mobs, so keep your Magic resist buffs up or you may find yourself Mezzed for the duration of the fight, and the loss of your DPS will more than likely mean that another person is eating a death touch soon.<br>
<br>
They have about 18k in hit points and are pretty easy to put down in under 30 seconds if you burn hard and have a few Mages 61+. (We averaged 3 level 61+ Mages on my raid… and did the Sphinxes with as few as 6 people, but you will eat a second, and sometimes a third death touch with that few people.)<br>
<br>
If you accidently aggro a second Sphinx. FOCUS. Kill the first one first. We had that happen a few times and only through assisting and focusing were we able to get through it. When the first one dies, target the second one and kill it asap. If you have Epic Mages that die from a death touch, rez them in as soon as you can. They can click their Epic stick and send another pet in to fight right away. Keeping your DPS up is KEY here.<br>
<br>
The Sister of the Spires is ONLY up if you clear Isle 6 on the way to Isle 7. Since you bridged up there, you’ll never see her. Don’t worry about it.<br>
<br>
EVERY mob up there can drop a Crown, so don’t leave any stone unturned on Isle 7.<br>
<br>
Respawn seems pretty random. It's somewhere between 22-24 hours from time of death. Try to be there an hour before the time of the first mobs death or you will wind up re-breaking the spawn every night. (It's REALLY nice when you can pick off the Drakes as they spawn the next day!)<br>
<br>
If you are on a horse, you can jump off Isle 7 and wind up under the world. The benefit of that is, you will be poofed safely onto Isle 1. I did this myself. It’s a great way to do your last turn in if you only needed the crown as your last piece.<br>
<br>
1 Real strong group can do this Island. 2 average groups can do it just fine too. To get 12 Mages their crowns, plan on about 6-7 days.<br>
<br>
Here's what our drops were, so you can get a sense of what the camp is like:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Day 1 - 2 Crowns<br>
Day 2 - 2 Crowns<br>
Day 3 - 1 Crown<br>
Day 4 - 3 Crowns<br>
Day 5 - 0 Crowns<br>
Day 6 - 1 Crown<br>
Day 7 - 0 Crowns<br>
Day 8 - 1 Crown<br>
Day 9 - 4 Crowns</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I've heard of as many as 5 crowns dropping in a night. We came close. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
