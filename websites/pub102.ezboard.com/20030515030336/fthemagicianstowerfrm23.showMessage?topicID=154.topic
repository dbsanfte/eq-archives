The Wyurms conned blue to me. We hunted the peninsular and ruled the place. We killed Wyurms faster then they could spawned.  Also, at the end of the peninsular is a tower, my partner would levitate and pulled from there after we killed all the cliff Wyurms. He would pop one then run out the tower and leap off the ramp. The Wyurms seemd to run slow so I had plenty of time to set up. He finally had to leave, but before he did he backed me up on a solo pull.<br>
<br>
I solo'd with a 51st Earth, that had dual summoned swords, BO3, and DS. The Wyurm was easy. I casted one mana storm to pull and then two Chars to finish it off and get the full experience. Pet was reduced to 70% and I had 75% mana left (but I am kinda twinked on the mana part, carry and extra 750 points due to equipment and int of 203, and I also have J boots). Later after my partner left, the only close call I had was when I had pounded a Wyurm to 10% and then he walked over to another Wyurm. As my pet got close to the second Wyurm, he aggro'd on my pet. When all the dust and snow settled, my pet had 23% health and I had 10% mana (would have done better on the mana part, but started the initial fight with only 80% and wasted mana in trying to make a quick kill as the first Wyurm walked off).<br>
<br>
Experience seems to be about normal. I have 20% going into the new skills and I still made almost a blue bubble in an hour. The platinum drop is kinda poor, but the Wyurms drop flawed or chipped gems (about 1 every 3 kills). The gems are worth about 35 plat to a vendor and about twice that to a fellow player (unknown if these are quest gems).<br>
<br>
Right in the middle of the peninsular is a big rock. I had pet guard and then I pulled to there. Almost any where in the middle of the peninsular seems to be be a very safe place to med. Saw other casters medding all over the place and were not aggro'd as long as I was there. The Wyurms don't seem to wander; they just pop and perch on the edge. <br>
<br>
The only problem I had was when a Necro aggro'd two sirens, ran right at me, then went LD. The sirens were nasty. They dispelled my partners familiar, which cost him 75% mana, and pounded my pet into mud. We had to gate out. I do believe if there had been only one it would have been no problem (they conned blue to me).<br>
<br>
This may not be the best place to hunt and level, but it is someplace different and seems to be fairly easy.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

Is there a low level spell named Manastorm?  The only Manastorm I found was a level 59 spell.<br>

The gems velious armor quest gems, although some are just to be sold to Vendors. It helps immensely to be Dubious to the Wyverns. If Dubious, then you can med anywhere with no fear of aggro. But Dubious will not prevent adds, and Drakes are nasty. If I catch a drake add and don't have the mana to chain summon at least 2 pets, I gate out. They have a vicious cold based spell and a lot of hp.<br>

Ive been here since lvl 52 and am now halway thru 54 just hunting here. Since i have 2 comps ( hehe ) it makes it REALLY easy for me to solo. I have a 49 cleric now from doing this tactic as well ( started at 44 ).  <br>
<br>
I would group up with cleric and have Cleric buff up the pet ( Symbol of Pinzarn will work more than fine ). Keep Complete heal and Sup Heals ready. I would pull with the lowest lvl Malosi to the beach( anywhere near the Othimirs is usually where I sit ) to ensure i keep enuff mana and so that pet's root will stick ( oh yeah , Earth pet is only way to go for this tactic ). I would pull one and have pet attack as normal. Then when pet has aggro run out and pull another ( you have to make sure that you run the next Wyvern accross the path of your pet that is fighting ) and it would also aggro pet. So i just keep it to a 2-3 maximum that are agro to the pet. Cleric just Heals the pet ( Complete Heals are best for mana reasons ). Went thru lvls like water. Just make sure that your cleric Knows the timing on CH or your toast.<br>
G'luck and have fun<br>

<br>
(The problem with quadders, especially druids, is they tend to take one mob and kite it without damaging it for 5 minutes while they wait for 3 more to spawn.  This slows down XP in the zone for everyone by a huge amount.)<br>
<br>
I did them just by using 51 earth with 49 DS.  The fights tended to be neck and neck.  Sometimes I'd have to nuke once to make sure the pet won, but generally not.<br>
<br>
When the wyvern got low I'd kill the pet and nuke the wyvern, using a single cast of our 44 nuke or, when you hit 52, Char to finish it off.<br>
<br>
If the quadkiters get out of hand and you can't seem to get a foot in the door, make some waterstones and go camp the haunted seachest in the sunken ship in the water.  The chest is a bit harder to kill than wyverns and the XP isn't quite as nice overall, but the spawn time is relatively fast and you can head back up to the wyverns when the quadders clear out.<br>

I prefer MS2 on the wyverns simply because they output better raw damage then any of my current pets, plus they're 200 mana, same as the 49 pets (and much better imo). Summon monster, DS, send it in and start medding. Depending what level pet you get, it will either a) solo the mob down to a sliver, in which case you cast SoS and kill the pet the split second before the nuke fires, or b) The pet gets close to dying when the wyvern has about 1/4hp left. Just start summoning another pet and kill your current one just before the new one arrives. Send in pet, it will take aggro right away (most I've been hit is 3 times) then nuke the wyvern to outdamage the new pet. <br>
<br>
Rinse and repeat, either way, I lose maybe a bub of mana per wyvern, and can med back at least 1/2 a bubble during the next fight. So after 6 or 7 I'm oom and i go do something for 10 minutes while I med. I love CS to death, but damn the quad kiters =/<br>

<br>
I got a little tried of the Hole, and went over to check CS out. <br>
<br>
Being non-kos to CoV, I didn't have much to worry about medding along the wall while afk, so what I would do is med till full, DS and BOIII a 56 hitting 53 air pet, then pull one. Burst of Flame to pull, and 2 or 3 Chars during the fight to get full exp. After the fight, I'd loot and pull again without medding. In the time it takes to find one with all the quad kiters around, and to navigate your pull so as not to aggro the named drakes, my pet as almost at full heath. I would continue pulls in this way till oom. Then I would go afk for ~7-10 min. while I medded to full.<br>
<br>
I also pulled cobalt drakes. With a 53 air they are no problem. Pull them, and sic the pet when you get near your camp. Stay out of AoE range, which happens to be pretty short - if you stand at or near max casting range, their AoE cannot hit you. 3 Chars and they're down.<br>
<br>
The exp here was fair to medium. I would say soloing the first 6 spawns in the Hole is about the same exp/hour, but CS is better loot.
