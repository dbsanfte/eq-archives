Any named in this zone that has a pet is likely to be a magician and will probably drop the pieces as well. {I don't remember all the names but if it has a pet, it is very likely to be a magician.}  Lower levels should stick to the female dark elf magicians and goblin magicains.  High levels probably should run around killing anything with magician in the name or anything that has a pet.  <br>

<br>
I went into Najena with the intent to get some focus items. I'm a 25 magician. I first tried killing tentacle terros just because I've never been there and I thought maybe I'd give my pet a tentalce whip. I got run out twice by add skeletons, and later as I went slightly deeper, add elementals.<br>
<br>
I'd never been to Najena before. My gear is horrible (this is an old magician pre-Kunark that I'm dusting off) and wonder about level suggestions or other warnings or advice from those familiar with the zone. You know, where a poorly outfitted 25 mage should avoid, or even what level to come back at!<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, I've only seen one shovel for sale in bazaar for 500pp. I have some of the other items I've kept a hold of over the last couple of years, but looking to get the torch, stein, etc.<br>
<br>

Last time I camped Najena for my final item (broom), I ended up with an extra stein and shovel, which I sold at bazaar for 10pp each. Had there been a mage there of appropriate level, I would have given them gladly. Najena is just a fat timesink.<br>
<br>
At 25 and solo, I would suggest you stick strictly to the magicians. Avoid the TT by staying in the middle of the large room when going through it. Summon an earth pet and have it at all times. If things go terribly wrong, it will buy you enough time to zone or gate.   The skeletons there are around lvl 21-24.  You can take them, just watch for adds.  <br>
<br>
There are 4 magicians that you can safely solo at 25. There are two together in the Crystal room, and 2 singles on the path to the crystal room. These can all be taken effectively at 25. Sic your pet on the other pet first, then burn the magician down as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
Stay away from the magicians in Rathyl's room and Trazdon's room. You can take them, but at 25, Trazdon, Rathyl, and Rathyl's incarnate will hand you your butt in tiny, manageable chunks. It is still a close shave at 42 to break the Rathyl room.<br>
<br>
Best advice, get some resist gear. You are going against mage and necro casters, so get your magic, fire, and poison resists pretty high. A couple of Star Ruby Encrusted Steins will help greatly.<br>
<br>
And keep checking the bazaar. I've rarely seen the focus ingredients very high. You might get lucky and get them for about 10pp. <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:Blur(Add = 1, Direction = 225, Strength = 10)">

<br>
I've spent probably 4 hours in Najena now and finally got a broom after getting a torch right away. I found a stein in bazaar for 50PP. I bought it simply because the time spent trying to get one to drop is driving me crazy. I lack the shovel now. I have some of the toes, gargoyle eye, mermaid scale, and griffon feather. I will get a drake scale easy enough. All that remains are the ice and fire giant toes, shovel, and the 4 gems.<br>

Thanks for the tips Barmodius.

I had silk armor and that was it.  <br>
<br>
At first I just hunted the two magicians in the crystal room.  I used the water pet for damage and better damage mitigation.  I fully buffed it, {Best armor, focus items, weapons, shield, etc.}  <br>
<br>
It is tough to break the room with both magicians and thier pets up, but once broken, it is easy to hold.  The magicians are on a fixed spawn time and it is safe to med in that room.  The only danger is a orge guard will come to the entrance to the room.  If you are medding near the entrance to the room,  it will attack you.  I always medded in the corner facing the entrance and stood while he was at the entrance to the room.  He can also be killed, but is often green and there is no need. <br>
<br>
After you split the magicans spawns a little, you will quickly get back to full mana in a spawn cycle or two.  I added the dark-bone skeleton that you could aggro by going out on the ledge near the hallway leading to this room.  <br>
<br>
I stayed here from 24/25th till 31st level.  There are four dark-bone skeletons you can safely pull one at a time, just have to look out for the wandering guard.  They drop good loot and are good EP for their level.  As you gain levels, you can take more of the Dark-bone skeletons in a spawn cycle and maintain the rate that you get ep.  <br>
<br>
I entered Najena a poor under-equipped magician.  I left Najena with all my focus items, all my spells {went back and bought all the ones I had to pass on because I was to poor}, the four pages for my epic, a couple of Magic items I picked up in East Commons before the bazaar killed it,  and money in the bank.  <br>

<br>
I got all 4 around 24th lvl, and noticed a big difference. I most often used focused fire at 24th. The difference was hefty. Although I do not have any parses, let me just describe it. <br>
<br>
With unfocused fire, I would camp the millers in QH, and breaking the spawn got hairy. The pet would barely make it, or sometimes didn't and had to be chained! I would often use several bubs of mana, and I have a lot. With Focused fire pets, the break was fairly simple, the pet had more hit points, and seemed to mitigate damage better. I would burn on Chandra, and then a single shock or 2 for Baoslob, and he was running like a sissy. Downtime was significantly decreased, and I found myself sitting, waiting for respawn... so much, that I went to Marus Seru for the constant pulls I could make with KEI.<br>
<br>
I had my first focus in my teens. It was the Water focus, and it made a big difference then too! <p>      <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>&quot;Love is the answer; but while you're waiting for the answer, sex raises some pretty good questions.&quot; (Woody Allen) </em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elfnom>Elfnom</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 47<br> <font color=#333333>(2/13/03 5:54 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1042.topic&index=30>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Focus Items</span><hr size=1> <br>

they work at all levels from 4 to to 49.  However you dont get a message like &quot;you torch of alna flickers&quot; or whatever (really wish they would add that).<br>
<br>
Of course, they might be broken.<br>

with the old models didn't the pet look bigger from 34 on?  never seen the new models look any different. plus it might just be my imagination; as a gnome all the pets look big.<br>
