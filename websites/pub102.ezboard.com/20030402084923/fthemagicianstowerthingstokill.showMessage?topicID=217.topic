Here's a guide my guild leader posted.  Hope it helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Generic: <br>
<br>
Each level contains at least 2 mirrors. One mirror leads to Iceclad and does not require a key. Each person must click on it individualy to exit the tower. One mirror leads to the next floor (exception, 6th floor, see below). Only the person with the key needs to click on the mirror. <br>
<br>
Pathing, by and large, is very good here. However, we have on occasion been attacked by mobs from a different floor than the one we are on. Fortunately, they don't attack through the floor, but somehow show up on the wrong floor. This leads us to speculate that going through the mirrors while mobs are still aggro is a bad idea. <br>
<br>
1st floor: <br>
<br>
Here you will fight lesser ice shades (spectres), shadowbones (skele's) and fading shadow guards (drolvargs). All mobs on this floor are undead. Nothing will aggro you as you zone in. Down the hall you come to the main room. Here the floor is very slick and there is a pit in the center of the room containing several shadowbones, so be carefull. There are 6 passages leading out of the main room. The zone out mirror is right where you zone in. The mirror leading to level 2 is down the right hand passage on the back wall of the main room. <br>
<br>
To get the key to lvl 2, kill everything you see until an enlarged shadow beast spawns. It will spawn from the corpse of a random mob. <br>
<br>
There are other minor drops on this floor, but nothing worth camping. <br>
<br>
2nd Floor: This is one of my favorite floors in ToFS. A mid 30's group can make good xp here and there are a pair of very nice drops to be had. Once again, the zone in are is a safe area, no spawns and no wandering mobs to deal with. This level resembles a library, full of ghosts. Every mob here is undead. <br>
<br>
As you zone in, you'll see a counter. Behind the counter is the Librarian and Librarian's Assitant. The Librarian is the toughest &quot;normal&quot; mob you'll fight here. Like all mobs on this lvl, these 2 are casters. <br>
<br>
To the left is a small room with a ghostly teacher and ghostly student. The teacher is probably the second toughest &quot;normal&quot; mob here. The rest of the room is full of ghostly students and ghostly scholars. The scholars are tougher than the students. <br>
<br>
There is a rare spawn on this floor named Zorgliim the undead. He's an undead dorf that has no drops that I'm aware of, but is higher lvl than most of the mobs on this lvl. He can spawn in place of any mob. <br>
<br>
The keyholder on this floor is the &quot;angry librarian&quot; who will spawn randomly from a mob right as you kill it. The angry librarian will also drop either &quot;students homework&quot;, or &quot;Teacher's Syllabus&quot;. <br>
<br>
The mirror to the next level is down a small passage straight out the back of the room. The zone out mirror is behind a secret door. Go to the back of the room and turn left. The last bookshelf on the right side is really a door. Click on it to open it, walk down the hall. There's the zone out mirror. <br>
<br>
3rd floor: <br>
In my opinion, this floor isn't worth hunting other than to get the key for the next floor. <br>
<br>
Half the mobs here are undead. Armored shadows are not. This makes movement a bit of a pain. In addition, there is an armored shadow that wanders near the zone in point. Generaly we cast regular invis before zoning in to the 3rd floor. <br>
<br>
Mobs here have WAY too many hp's for their lvl making xp hunting here just silly. The key is dropped by an enraged shadow beast, who will spawn from the death of a random mob. The enraged shadow beast will also sometimes drop a finely crafted velium ring (fairly nice for melee's). <br>
<br>
<br>
We have found no easy way to set up camp here. There are a few wandering armored shadows. Kill until you get the key, then move on. I also cannot adequately describe how to get to the mirrors and would suggest you find a map before going to this floor, unless you share my adventurous spirit. In general terms, the mirror in the zombie maid's room is the zone out mirror. The mirror to the next level is at the end of a hall with no mobs in it. <br>
<br>
4th floor: <br>
Another fun level with some nice drops. I STRONGLY reccomend you stay on the path I lay out for you, else risk falling through a secret floor into a pit. If you do fall into the pit, click the gem in the middle and you will port back to the zone in point. <br>
<br>
The zone in point here is not safe, there are at least two wandering mobs that path past here. Some are undead, some not. We normaly use regular invis to port in and then quickly move to our camp spot unless aggro'd immediately. <br>
<br>
As you zone in, there is a locked door to the right. The key to get to the fourth floor is also the key to the door. Down the end of that hall is the zone out mirror. <br>
<br>
To camp the key, don't open the locked door. Take the first right past the locked door and go down the hall. Take the first right into a small dead end passage. In this passage will either be an ancient mummy or Amanhotep. Amanhotep drops either the sparkling soul necklace or the scroll of prophecy. He also triggers Cara Omica, the keyholder for the lvl. <br>
<br>
If Amanhotep is not there, kill the mummy. Set up camp here. Have your puller go out and to the right, continuing down the hall you were in. The first mob he'll come to is &quot;a shadow&quot; (unless he finds a wanderer first). Shadow's are casters and are a pain in the ass because they are tough to target. On multiple pulls, I reccomend ALWAYS taking the shadows first, simply because your 'chanter will have trouble targeting them to remez. Have you puller continue to pull mobs from the hall, working his way down the hall. Just before the hall &quot;dead ends&quot; there are 3 more shadows. This is, in fact, not a dead end. It's a false wall. On the other side of the wall are 2 more shadows. Past that is a large room where Cara Omica spawns once the named mummy has been killed. Have your puller pull all the way to Cara's spawn point. Often times we've zoned in, set up camp, pulled this far to find that Cara is up (most likely someone prior to us killed the mummy but not Cara) <br>
<br>
In addition to dropping the key to the next floor, Cara drops the Enbalmers Skinning Knife (common) and has 2 rare drops: the Magnetic Dirk of Distraction and the Sorcerous Bowl. <br>
<br>
Past Cara there are 5 more shadow spawns and then the mirror to the 5th floor. <br>
<br>
Often we spend a little extra time on the 4th floor because the drops are kinda nice and the xp is pretty good up until 45 or so. There are two other named mobs. Narmak is a named armored shadow that drops a book for tanks (range slot) and shield for SK's. Maggot Infested Ooze drops Maggot Infested Flesh (presumably for an unsolved quest). <br>
<br>
5th Floor: <br>
All mobs here are undead. Most are lower lvl than mobs on the 4th floor. In fact, if your party is strong enough to get here, most of the mobs here will probably be green to you. The zone in point is safe. You'll be in a hall, with 8 Golem ushers in cubicles (4 on each side). They are almost the only thing that still gives xp at lvl 45. Pull them and kill them, the proceed into the main room, where the wedding is taking place. Most of the mobs here can be killed w/out aggroing any of the other mobs in the room. Everything is named, but only Daman (bride) and Nosja (groom) drop anything worhtwhile (supposedly, I've yet to see the nicer drops). They have 3 drops, a veil for enchanters and 2 rings (one for int casters, one for melee types, I've only ever seen the veil). They also drop the Ceremonial Wedding Sword and a &quot;signet ring&quot;. Both are presumably for unsolved quests. <br>
<br>
The keyholder here is an enraged relative (spectre type). Once again, he'll spawn from the body of a dead mob. He also sometimes drops the spiked velium helm. <br>
<br>
The zone out mirror is in the zone in area. The mirror to the next level is down a small tunnel around behind the wedding room, guarded by two more golem ushers. <br>
<br>
6th floor: <br>
There are 2 main types of mobs here, icy shades (spectres) and shadow guardians (drolvargs). Guardians have way too many hp's, but other than that are relatively easy to kill. Xp here can be decent with a good group chain pulling. The zone in line is mob free, so it's safe to zone in and then buff up. Taking the second right from the zone in, and turning right again will take you to the spawn point for the incoherent spirit. His death triggers the lucid spirit of Abrams. <br>
<br>
Taking the second left (instead of right) takes you to a room full of shades... be carefull, the floor itself will attack you here. If you're gonna pull this room, do it with ranged attacks from outside the room itself. <br>
<br>
Taking the first right will lead you down a corridor. On either side of the corridor are cubby holes w/ drolvargs in them. at the end of the corridor is a stair case. This leads to more doggies, and then a balcony. Stay back from the edge, if you get too close, you'll aggro the spectres in the room below. Just past the balcony is a mirror. Each party member must click this mirror seperately to go to what is commonly called floor 6b. It's where Val sherra, the key holder, spawns. <br>
<br>
Val Sherra SEEMS to be a triggered spawn, however what triggers him remains unclear. For us he popped up on track after killing one of the Drolvargs. A friend reported something similar upon killing a shade. Sound like it's fairly random. <br>
<br>
When you zone into val's room, there will be a wandering shade bat. Kill this first. Be warned that it has a spell that will drain all of your stamina. When it dies, an enraged vampire will spawn. Male vampires are melee type, females are casters. Again, WAY too many hp's for their lvl, but what can ya do. After killing the vamp, buff up. Make sure you put up your resistance buffs, Valsherra is a caster, and like many high lvl casters he draws his spells from several classes. However, his main line of spells seem to be necro spells, so expect to be poisoned and diseased. He also has a form of charm (called vampiric charm). <br>
<br>
Send your puller up the ramp. Unless he's higher than lvl 52, he will likely pull 3-4 bats along with valsherra. When we killed Valsherra, we had the chanter mez the bats while we tanked the efreeti. Be warned, Val will gate at low health, so get your stuns ready. <br>
<br>
In addition to the key, Valsherra also drops some cruddy jewelry (an earring and a talisman). In the back of the room is a mirror... clicking that mirror will port the party back to the zone in point for the 6th floor. Up the ramp into the room Valsherra spawns and through the tunnel in back you'll find a hand holding a gem. THIS is the &quot;mirror&quot; to the next lvl. I do not know where the zone out mirror is on the 6th floor. <br>
<br>
7th floor: The zone in mobs here are not undead and invis works fine. Bypass them and proceed until you come to a room with 2 drakes. These drakes see through both invis and ITU. They are not affected by undead type spells. From here out, you'll have to kill everything. Kill the drakes. Take either passage out of the room (they both go to the same place.) <br>
<br>
You'll arrive in a large room with a spiral staircase. In this room are a few more drakes and a bunch of &quot;shaded torches&quot;. The torches proc a steal strength spell and are a royal pain in the neck. Kill all the drakes and the torches. <br>
<br>
The wall in the back of the room is a false wall. It leads to a corridor with 5 rooms. In each room is a shrouded bat. Upon dying either an enraged vampire or Tserrina will spawn. <br>
<br>
Be warned that these mobs are higly magic resistant and will run. It's important to clear all the drakes and torches in the main room, then KEEP them clear or your likely to have a lot of adds on your hands, since it's so tough to stop mobs from running. <br>
<br>
I can't comment on Tserrina since when we hunted here, she never spawned for us. <br>
<br>
Up the spiral stair case is a locked door. You need Valsherra's key to open it. This leads to a room with a bunch of mirrors. Click to zone out. <br>
<br>
<br>
There ya go!<br>

I'll fill in this part <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   when you zone in, it's pretty safe.  Then you will reach this really big room with a spiriling staircase (up that is the zone out) with a buncha torches and drake looking things.  If you have wizzies/mages with you, this place is the best for AE.  Mobs have low hitpoints (about 1200) and still give exp at 52.  Once you clear that room out (about 10 torches and 10 drakes) there's a hallway straight ahead.  On each side of the hallway there are 2 rooms, 4 rooms total.  In each room there's a bat.  Rush the first room on your right (or left) and kill that bat.  There's a red pool of blood in the center of the room, make sure the bat is out of the pool because it's considered water and if he's over it you won't be able to attack him.  Make sure these are snared of course so they don't add the other bats in the other rooms.  When the bat dies, he will spawn either a vampire or tserrina.  There's a really neat trick with pets and the tserrina spawn.  If the bat is a tserrina placeholder, your pet will not attack it.  Same with necro pets.  So if that happens, tell your group to prepare for tserrina.  After tserrina/vampire dies, your puller should pull the other 3 bats into the room you are camping.  After those are dead, move down further into the hallway, there will be a final room down there with no spawns and your puller can pull to there.  This is when puller goes back to the big room with spiral staircase and pulls the torches/drakes to your group for exp.  Or if you guys feel up to it, go into the big room and start AEing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The 4 bats are on a 30 minute spawn cycle, and sometimes, they will miss a spawn.  There are also some other rooms on that floor, I think they're mostly mob free.  One room has 7 mirrors and that is the room the master key will bring you to.  And each mirror leads to the different floors.  So once you get tserrina's master key, you don't have to run through all the other floors just to get to the 7th.  And that is all of ToFS! enjoy!<br>
