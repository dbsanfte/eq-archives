By Smarmy of Veeshan on Foh Board<br>
<br>
Pre planes Era: Casters pretty much overpowered. Though that's not much of a surprise given the fact there were only two uber mobs in the game. Most encounters pre planes were in Lower Guk and Sol B fighting mobs that most wizards could solo. People debated which monster was the hardest in EQ; Nagafen or Vox. Stupid rumors of 3 necros killing both easily with Drain Soul got lifetaps universally nerfed. Best melee weapon in the game was a Ykesha. Best armor was rubicite. :-) Everyone says wizards are godly, rangers are godly (friggin brad mcquaid's pet class i'll kill him). Not enough people are playing a necro or a magician to notice that they were a little overpowered. Why be a warrior when you can be a cool hybrid with spells, wear the same armor and weild the same weapons? Why be a cleric when a druid can snare, sow, port and do good damage? Winner: All INT casters but enchanters basically. Losers: All melee classes.<br>
<br>
Planes Era: Warriors get upgraded. New armor for melee in fear plane combined with new weapons off the gods and dragons gives melee a much needed injection of power (except rogues lmao). Suddenly were fighting monsters with 12-15,000 hps that can kill casters in 4 hits. Warriors in full Russet/Indokulite with the Cazic combo of weapons are suddenly twice as better as warriors without. Casters wonder what the point is of even going to the planes since they already have 200 INT. Mortuus solos spinechiller spiders in PoF to get Cryosilk; Necro pets get nerfed. Casters #@!$ that their spells aren't sticking to Gods, Verant buffs them anyway. Verant buffs dragons. Verant buffs Gods again. Verant buffs dragons again. Wizards are doing approximately 11 damage by chain casting ice comet on Nagafen 6 times. Melee classes are starting to notice that warrior's higher skill caps are doing way more damage than hybrids. Rogues get upgraded so they aren't as embarrasing anymore. Hybrids get buffed; nobody notices. Rogues get buffed again. Wizards in really uber guilds find that they have a small use in Sky plane if there's a lot of them. No one cares because Sky plane is lame. Druids kite dorfs up and down butcherblock mountain all day. Winner: Warriors, enchanters and clerics. Losers: wizards, necros.<br>
<br>
Koonark Era: Holy #@!$! Balance! Well, not really. Pure Melee classes are pulling weapons off yard trash that make them twice as effective as they were yesterday with their weapons off Gods and dragons. Hybrids notice that their class specific weapons are cruel jokes compared to pure melee. Well, except rangers. Rangers get awesome weapons, but they are all somewhere in the neighboorhood of 4 damage 0.00000001 delay. Rangers get squashed like bugs by Kunark mobs. EVERYONE notices that pure melee are getting hybrid spells on their armor. Nobody knows why. Verant decides to use Kunark as an excuse to tweak the #@!$ out of most casters by re-defining their spell line. Some casters come off better for it. Necros wonder why they have plant only DD's, another corpse summoning spell and a line of spells that turns them into cleric mana whores. They get a cool spectre though and a pet that backstabs. This is good until they notice that their cool backstabbing pet has less hit points than Emporer Crush. Enchanters whine that they don't get illusion spectre and can't mez anything in half the Koonark zones because of artificial level restrictions on mez and mobs. Magicians wonder why their new DD's are actually worse than their old ones. Wizard clap with glee over the lure series of spells. Shamans boggle over group charisma buffs and a level 55 pet that's worse than their 49 one, but costs 3x the mana. It takes over a month of beating Abashi over the head with the Warclub of Common Sense that caster's spells aren't dropping AT ALL in Koonark. None. Abashi sits back and declares that 300,000 people are dead wrong and he's right because someone told him that they are dropping. Clerics acknowledge the fact that they're tied for the best class in the game, but silently complain that they can play EQ for over 8 hours while reading a Tolstoy novel, watching &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, and balancing their checkbook while using only their index finger on their left hand to actually play. Elderan goes on hunger strike to protest Verants cruelty to rangers after Furor beats him in a duel just by glaring at him harshly. Everyone on Whineplay calls him a whiner. When everyone catches up to him, they start to agree. Verant continues to declare hybrids balanced according to &quot;The Vision&quot;. Verant declares Nagafen and Vox off limits to players over level 52. Celestial Tomb finally leaves Sol B and Perma to hop on the boat for the big adventure in Kunark. Monks wonder why they still look the same that they did when Fear opened, but are generally placated by 40/35 staffs. Druids kite Drovargs up and down the Dreadlands. Eventually almost everyone falls into their niche somewhat, but warriors are still howling with laughter at all other classes. Every caster but Wizards and clerics begin to wonder what the point of it all is. Winner: Warriors, clerics, still enchanters kinda. Losers: Shamans, all hybrids, necros, druids.<br>
<br>
Epic Weapon Era, or the Time of Thogg: Everyone is mystified. Each of the epics all seem to have been designed by a different person, seemingly without consulting one another at all. Verant declares that each and every epic weapon has been balanced and tested thouroughly, and so have the quests pertaining to them. Everyone who actually plays the game knows that means that at least half of them are broken, as are the quests pertaining to them. Of course this proves to be true. Verant fixes/tweaks the busted ones, but Abashi remains adamant that the Necro epic is just fine, despite the fact every single necro without exception argues the opposite. Wizards wonder why the masters of magical damage have a magical defense on theirs. Rogues cackle with glee that the best weapon they could ever hope to obtain is roughly as difficult as getting blacksmithing up to a skill of around 10. Typing &quot;/who all magician 60&quot; in South Karana gives you a 2 page list of mages offering 20,000 plat and a cloak of flames to anyone who sees that stupid frigging flying horse that spawns once a year. Satan spawns Thogg to promote illiteracy and general stupidity to everyone unfortunate enough to read almost any EQ messageboard on the internet. Steven Hawking theorizes that there's actually close to 1000 Thoggs in the world all posting to various EQ BB's simultaeniously about &quot;how crapy teh war fa is&quot;. Clerics get theirs and say &quot;Oh gee.. anyone need a res?&quot; Rangers are just mollified theirs has a delay of more than 2. Monks were hoping their quest resulted in an epic tunic with more than 5AC on it. Winners: No one.<br>
<br>
Velious Era: If you aren't a warrior or a cleric, why are you still here? Go away now... just... go. Are you still here? Shoo. Winners: Verant has 300,000 subscribers all paying them $10 a month. hooray! Losers: <br>
