I love my class, don't get me wrong.  When I made my first Magician I realized that this was the class I wanted to play, and haven't created another type of character since.  But there are some spells that we should (IMHO) have, but for some reason Verant decided that we didn't deserve them.  This drives me crazy.<br>
<br>
Take our control over &quot;Summoned&quot; creatures.  Every class that has some kind of tie-in with a type of mob (Animal and Undead mostly) gets some spells to help them with that type of mob.  We get a line of damage to summoned spells.  Great.  Druids (and, to a lesser degree, Shamans and Rangers) can Charm, Mezz, Fear and be Invis to Animals.  Necros can Charm, Mezz, Fear and be Invis to Undead, and Clerics, Paladins and Shadowknights get some of these abilities as well.<br>
<br>
So why in the heck don't we get anything like this for summoned creatures?  Would it really be all that unbalancing for us to be able to Charm, Mezz, Fear or get Invis Vs. Summoned?  As a normal extension of our class's abilities, I don't understand why we haven't been given ANY of this.  It's certainly not unbalancing, especially since there is a very small number of areas in the game where you can even find &quot;Summoned&quot; mobs.<br>
<br>
Then there's the Elemental Illusions...  Can somebody PLEASE explain to me why we don't get these?  I won't even go into a long tirade about why we deserve them.  It goes without saying.  I'll just bitch and moan about it instead.  Well actually, I don't need to do that either.  You get the point.  Not giving these spells to us (When those damnable Necromancers get Skeleton illusion) is just plain idiotic.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget improved invisibility.  Umm, why are we the only caster that doesn't get this one?<br>
<br>
Mana regen...  same deal there, all the rest of the casters get it in some way.  Mod Rods are semi-useful, but basically only as a means of mana transfer and maybe as a one-shot &quot;One More Nuke To Save My Ass&quot; solution every once in awhile.  I'm not looking for clarity or even breeze, but some kinda Pet Health -&gt; My Mana deal would be not only useful but also in-character.<br>
<br>
But honestly...  I can live without root, I can live without snare, I can live without mana regen, I can live without bigass nukes and I can live without ports...  I just want to actually have as much control over the area that I'm SUPPOSED to be a master of as I should.  Most of all, I want my damn elemental illusions!<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
Oh well, at least I can summon beer <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
To me, being the &quot;Master of Elements&quot; doesn't mean that I can turn into a duplicate of my pet.  That is firmly in the realm of enchanters.  It doesn't mean that I can charm other conjured beings.  That would be the &quot;master of conjuration and conjured thingies&quot; :)(which is kind of what we are even though we don't have the title).<br>
<br>
Right now the only element we can manipulate directly is fire.  I don't know how conjuring blades qualifies as elements.  Being the &quot;Master of the Elements&quot; should give us the ability to do damage through each of the elements.  Instead of just DDs based on fire we should also have ice, wind and earth.  <br>
<br>
Or if they don't want us to have other DDs they could use thier imagination and implement other effects.  Imagine:<br>
<br>
Water - A freeze spell that operates more or less like screaming terror.  Bonus points if they can turn the Mobs transparent or make it look like it's covered in ice.<br>
Wind - Knockback and stun.  (Knocks a Mob out of the group(several feet) and stuns it for several seconds so another class can root it)<br>
Earth - creates a quagmire in a specific area that &quot;snares&quot; anything in it.  (Not sure they can do this but I imagine they can reuse code from the enchanters sentinal spell) <br>
<br>
In summary...getting illusions won't make us masters of the elements, getting spells that allow us to do things BASED on the elements will.<br>

<br>
Druids -can look like a dog<br>
rangers -can look like a dog<br>
shamans -can look like a bear<br>
necros -can look like a skeleton<br>
chanters -can look like everything and the kitchen sink<br>
mage can look like himself...<br>
<br>
Our &quot;master of elemtents&quot; title is held up....<br>
Fire pet<br>
Water pet<br>
Earth pet<br>
Air pet<br>
<br>
Mages are good at PETS, that is our main thing.  We dont have snare, root, fear, heal, rez, mez, Feign death, etc because we have our burly pets.  <br>
<br>
I will say this though, our dimiss summoned series of spells lick nutts.  Look at the damage/mana ratio of lvl 56 dismiss spell.  It blows.  lvl 52 fire-based char is better, and we can cast it on anybody.<br>
<br>
I think verant missed the whole concept on those spells...<br>
Only able to hit 1 kind of mob = a bad thing<br>
more damage, or faster cast time etc. = the good thing to balance it.<br>

<br>
I see your point about the illusions.  I haven't seen a shaman in bear form before so I didn't know about that.  I'll concede that point.<br>
<br>
I still think our spells should directly manipulate more of the elements besides fire.  True, we can indirectly access the elements through our pets, but since we can't really control when they cast, can we truely be called &quot;Master&quot;?<br>

Or the masters of summoning things, like summoning blades to stike our enemies.  So basicly we are a mix of both.  As for the stuff about the druid/ranger/shaman etc... They shapeshift, not illusions like enchanters.  I wouldn't mind it, but it doesn't really fall within either realm of our class.<br>

Especially now that SK's will be able to get skeleton illusion through their Shroud of Death spell.<br>
<br>
I guess it's just another case of class envy.  I'll fully admit that I want to be able to do as much as I can, and when other classes can do cool stuff that I think goes along with what I can do, I want it dammit!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Especially when they give our stuff away to other classes, but then refuse to do it the other way around.  It may seem petty but hey, what can I say?  I'm a devout Magician, if there is such a thing <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I take pride in being what I am, and I don't like to see my abilities being given to other classes without being &quot;compensated&quot; in some way.  Maybe that's childish, but I never did like the idea of growing up.<br>
<br>
It also seems funny that our 51 title is &quot;Elementalist.&quot;  Like somebody above me said, the only element that we really CONTROL is fire.  I understand that it's more in reference to our pets and the control we have over them.  Still, an Ice DD or some wind/earth based spells would SEEM to make sense for us.  <br>
<br>
The illusions are just something cool that I think wouldn't be unbalancing in the slightest, but also SEEM to make sense for us, in light of the fact that almost every other pet class can &quot;be&quot; their pet (in the case of Druids/Shamans, be each other's pet).<br>

anyone else agree? in a group all we can do basically apart from controlling our pets which is very limited, is DS and spit out nukes no where good as a wizards, or debuff if there isnt a shaman around. <br>
i can live with being crappy in a group... after all mages are primarily a soloing class. but as far as soloing goes we get no snare type spell... nor do we get a fear type spell... the only way to do this effectively is to let our pets tank. and i have no problem with this but they should be better at doing that imho. <br>

i dont know. the point im trying to make is i could *understand* them shafting us on the things other casting classes take for granted if they gave our pets a little more muscle. they are only a little better than a necro pet. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ufg2010.showPublicProfile?language=EN>fg2010</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 51<br> <font color=#333333>(6/18/01 9:24:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=95.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Master of the Elements my ass...</span><hr size=1> <br>

the rest are &quot;conjurer&quot;, &quot;bladecaller&quot; and so on..<br>

<br>
1. A cold based DD along the lines on Char, Sirrico, and Seeking Flame of Seukor. Not more powerful than these spells just that they check against CR rather than FR resistances. No way can see this as unbalancing to the game and would help us immensely to be able to fight in places like Kunark where mobs MR and FR are high but CR is lower.<br>
<br>
2. Make Mala our level 60 debuff stack with Malo the 60 Shaman debuff. It is a level 60 unresistable debuff but if a Shaman is present makes this spell totally useless as Mala is overwritten by Malo. Is only a 35 point decrease on top of the already 45 point reductions of Malo and against these mobs with resists in the 250-300+ range or in even some cases higher at least tolerable and increase our usefulness and motivate more Mages to reach that ultimate level 60 spell and help us get into the UBER guilds.<br>
<br>
3. Give Epic pets a different form than that of a Air elemental on steroids. In the Plane of Sky Air elementals take on the form of a awesome looking Genie so I know that the creative minds at VI can invest a little time and energy into coming up with a form that suits a &quot;EPIC&quot; pet rather than just increasing size on a already done model.<br>
<br>
4. The Anti summoned spells should definately be upgraded. Lower mana cost for higher damage plus faster casting would be a start but maybe also making it check like a Lure spell would increase its effectivness as well. And should be a quest along the lines of Wizards Giantbane and Dragonbane spells get at level 60. Make a quest for a 60 Magician spell where we can get a massive damage dd anti summoned spell along those lines. VI likes making things fun for these other classes but mages get no really neat quests like this.<br>
<br>
5. This is main pet peeve of mine when in groups or raid situations..... a mob attacks you or your pet-- pet aggros on mob and begins attacking mob with the mob returning in kind attacking pet now ya begin pounding your pet backoff hot key and still mob keeps attacking pet while Enchanter screams at you to get yer pet off mob he is trying to mez and to no avail as mob keeps attacking your pet and this of course causes him to attack back. Give us a 5 or 6 second de-aggro period where pet wont aggro on a mob when ya give command to backoff either that or give us a &quot;true neutrel&quot; command where pet wont attack even if damaged of if you are attacked. Would be welcome to any pet class can assure you and since these are &quot;pets&quot; should be able to exert that level control on a &quot;mindless&quot; being.<br>
<br>
These changes are not major or imbalancing to gameplay and would fall well within our scope and roles as Summoners and Masters of Elements and could add enjoyment to a class that I have chosen to play even though we seem to be on the bottom of the list when comes to class improvement or changes.<br>

<br>
Yes druids and shaman can charm animals<br>
Bards and Enchanters can charm anything<br>
Necros can charm undead<br>
And many get specifics DD vs specifics<br>
<br>
Magicians get an anti-summoned spell true...but consider this. At 44 a druid gets Banished Summoned, Magicians don't get it until 49.<br>
<br>
Illusions: Ok Necros have undead illusions, enchanters have a ton of illusions, Druids and rangers get wolf form, shaman get bear form, bards and rogues get multiple illusions, shadowknights get undead illusion.<br>
<br>
Why is it that we don't? How do illusions fit into the other class strategy yet not into ours? Also why is it that we get summon alcohol as fun spells but no illusions. I agree we aren't illusionists, but stop handing out illusions to everyone else then, or make some of those items all/all.<br>
<br>
The charm and fear summoned creature I think is within our realm. <p><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://www.owid.com/Sild-sig6.JPG" width="500" height="75">

Face it.. VI created Wizards then thought.. hmm.. might be nice to give them pets.. na.. lets make a new class.<br>
<br>
And while they did this they nerfed 40% of the DD spell power and added pets that they built up.. then when the post 50 game was created nerfed to hell.<br>
<br>
We were never really a complete class I now believe.

<br>
We are supposed to be the masters of summoning things...now wizzies are the masters of travel, so they can prevent a mob from gating...why can't we summon a mob to us?  Just seems to fit our bill.<br>
<br>
Some say it would unbalance classes more than they already are, but with the nerf on CoH now, we should get something like this to make up for it.  And a super aggro would more than make up for the power of the spell.  And I expect it would have a pretty high resist factor also.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, level 51+ mobs can summon PC's, so it seems fitting to allow level 51 mages summon mobs.<br>
<br>
Of course, it would HAVE to be accompanied by the words:<br>
<br>
You say, &quot;You will not evade me, Cazic Thule.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a thought, that will never happen.<br>

Whining about something is not a suggestion.  I heard a great suggestion about being able to cast Illusion: Monster but the way EQ does faction based on body type just wouldn't work and would require excessive recoding.<br>
<br>
I like that form tornado idea.  it should have a knock back effect! or maybe a daze/stun effect!<br>
<br>
Summoning Mob.  This has to work it's way into EQ or it'll be worked into VI's competitors games.  It would take alot of work to make it not exploited.  Make some restriction that you have to be high on the mobs hate list to summon or along those lines.<br>
<br>
Summoned weapons/items with click effects are great.  I want more.  <br>
<br>
What do magicians do in RL/lore? what are some great magician stunts?  When I think of magicians I think of Illusionists but that's the enchanters distinction I guess.<br>
<br>
It would be interesting to have a lvl 60 spell that would cast a Mini-me pet.  A duplicate of the player.<br>
<br>
I was looking at the spell lists for the other classes and realized that they suck just as much as we do.  : ).  <br>
