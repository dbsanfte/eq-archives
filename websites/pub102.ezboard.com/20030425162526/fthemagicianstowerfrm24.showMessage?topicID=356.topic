<br>
I am an evocation mage, and hence I prefer to summon a single pet, deck it out in full plate/focus/buffs, then let it tank while I drop a nuke or two.<br>
<br>
I was doing this using the water pet, but noticed its HP's dropped too quickly. So, I switched to the air pet in the hopes that its agility and stuns would mitigate some of the damage. However, the shroom's slow and stuns (and that cute shroom transformation thing) kept landing, and so the fights still slowed down. I noticed that the air pet was also taking quite a bit of damage in the fights.<br>
<br>
I switched to the earth pet, and I believe I might have stumbled on something: it was never stunned/slowed by the shrooms, and also never transformed into the big shroom animation. At first I thought it may simply be a graphics bug, but I also noticed that the shrooms were dropping at a respectable rate, and the earth pet retained a lot of its HP's after each fight!<br>
<br>
I used the earth pet for two hours straight, and managed to get 25% XP at level 60. That's the fastest I have seen the XP bar move pre-PoP. I had no downtime at all!<br>
<br>
I also switched to chain summoning pets at one point just to experiment with the rate of killing, but noticed that chaining took longer (the pets take quite a while to drop the shrroms by themselves).<br>
<br>
Now, with all this said, I had a few advantages(in all the cases I tried except for when chaining): I had KEI the whole time, plus my level 45 druid bot. The druid buffed the pet with chloroplast, skin like diamond, and endure magic. While the pet was tanking, the druid would cast drifting death and drones of doom (the two combined DoT for about 1000). During each fight the druid or mage would have to heal the pet for about 900 damage, and the mage would nuke with scirroco once. <br>
<br>
With that said, the pet was at 95% health after each fight, and chain pulling was not a problem. Both the druid/mage never went below 75% mana. Extrapolating from the XP gained in two hours, I think I dropped about 50 shrooms.<br>
<br>
Woohoo! After getting the air and water pets, I never thought I would mem the earth pet spell ever again...guess I was wrong! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
To get that kind of xp at 60, you would have to be killing a shroom every 2 minutes or so, right?  Which patches were you camping to sustain that rate?

And yes, I was downing a shroom in under 2 minutes. It would die maybe 30 seconds after my DoTs expire.<br>
<br>
ie. Enter from Echo, follow leftmost path (is that the only path?) along the buildings and gates, then run through one tunnel that has a guard patrolling it. At the end of the tunnel is a shroom patch that has (I think) 6 shrooms. When you exit the tunnel there will be one of those plant guys to your immediate left. To the right is a tarnok village.<br>
<br>
I forgot to mention that I tried not using a healer there (she died from the plant surprise-nuking her at one point, so I left her at Nexus for a bit). Of course, the XP is a bit slower, and there may be a bit of downtime involved (like 30 seconds between mobs), but religious use of mod rods helps. I didn't try a full hour of soloing without the healer, but I would say that 8 to 9% (versus 12% with) per hour should be possible.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#333333>(2/14/03 3:58:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=356.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: First Patch</span><hr size=1> I don't see how you managed 25% regular xp per two hours then... there's just not enough shrooms in that camp to keep you busy.<br>

  Shrooms.  I'm a conjuration spec'd, 60 mage and have killed a lot of shrooms lately.  I use 57 earth with BO4 and Cadeau.  I pull shroom with lowest level dd spell.  I let pet melee shroom to 80% to get aggro.  I nuke with sofb twice and sos once.  I reclaim pet and summon new after each fight.<br>
  I have 76 resist versus disease and shrooms spells stick on me about once out of three or four casts.  The slow is meaningless, the stun you have to be careful with.  If the shroom gets within melee range, it will proc a longer stun and you can be in trouble.  This is the stun that turns you into a shroom.  If it procs that stun twice before you can get away, you may die.  You want a pull technique that keeps you out of melee range till pet has aggro.  All the shroom spells and proc are disease based I believe.<br>
  You have to be level 60 to single pull the shrooms.  Our summoned dagger adds disease resist by the way.  Also the stein of moggok and the mushroom veil have good disease resists.<br>
  I always buy a KEI before I go to FG.  When I started, I didn't have SCM3.  I could only nuke with 2 sofb each fight and stay at full mana after reclaiming pet.  I now have SCM3 and IRE.  I can use the 2 sofb and either sos or a third sofb and after pet reclaim I'm at full mana again after each fight.<br>

I keep forgetting once I start pulling in random order) and when that camp is emptied, there is a little bit of time to kill the plant thingy to your left before the shrooms begin to respawn. <br>
<br>
Granted, that plant is a bit tougher to kill than shrooms, but if you chain pet, it's usually not a tough fight.<br>
<br>
As for the shrooms themselves, if it was 7 spawns per cycle, and approximately 3 cycles per hour, you'd have 21 shrooms, which are about 0.5% XP each, for about 10% XP per hour.<br>
<br>
Perhaps my 12.5% / hour estimate was a bit high for shrooms alone, but if it's possible to add in the plant mob, it's definitely do-able. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=hottieroz>Hottieroz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(2/17/03 7:58:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=356.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Hehe...</span><hr size=1> And thanks for the info on the other shroom patches...I think I might migrate over to the other patches tonight and see what I can do...<br>

<br>
If you send in the pet before the shroom gets to you, you should never be touched by the shroom. So, it's more or less irrelevant whether a slow spell or shroom morph/root spell sticks on you. The only exception is that if things somehow screw up and the shroom roots you within its melee range. Then you're in deep trouble.<br>
<br>
However, if you don't try to sit down before the pet sticks root onto the shroom and gets aggro, you should never run into this problem. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=outofmana>OutOfMana</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#333333>(2/19/03 4:27:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm24.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=356.topic&index=11>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_smile.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Focus the Pet</span><hr size=1> /em confused.<br>

Why is this either/or?  Summon pet while holding earth staff then swap to the stein.
