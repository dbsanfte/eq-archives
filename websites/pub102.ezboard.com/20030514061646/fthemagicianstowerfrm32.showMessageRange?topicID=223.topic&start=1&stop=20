--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Caster balancing isn't done, far from it in fact. We're very aware of it, and it's a priority of ours to finish. I understand that it's taking more time than players would like, and it's definately taking more time than I hoped to get it out to live servers.<br>
<br>
I see a lot of posts saying how easy caster balance would be to do, or &quot;here's one thing that would help us a lot and is quick to do!&quot;. Honestly, I wish that were true. I'd be very happy to have caster balance done and get on to the next improvements and additions to the game. <br>
<br>
The fact is though, while small changes for each class are pretty obvious and easy to do, the bigger picture has to be maintained all the time. I've learned from the process so far that it's not good to release things bit by bit - the average player wants to know the big picture for each change as it happens. How does this change affect me? What do other classes get out of it? Will my class see more changes? Is caster balancing done now? I get these questions every day, and see them posted on community boards all over when any small change is made.<br>
<br>
For example, we've got some plans to improve healing versatility for the priest classes. To do that correctly, all classes that can heal need to be looked at to see how they'll be impacted. Give one class a better heal and all the other healing classes look at how it affects them. The new heal spell may make perfect sense when looking at the class that got it, but any class that didn't get it has immediate concern about why they didn't also get it, how it makes them less wanted in a given situation, and how they now need something to make up for the other class getting a new heal. This means that before we can alter a single small part of healing, we need to have answers for players about the plans for healing across every class.<br>
<br>
This gets more complex because no class has just one single ability. So, say (hypothetically) that we add a better heal to druids. Clerics are immediately concerned because druids are now healing better- what do clerics get? Wizards grow concerned because now not only can druids nuke pretty well, they also can heal even better than previously, making them a potentially better deal for a group or raid looking for members. No matter how small a change is, it causes ripples throughout the game, the player base, and all the community message boards. When it comes to class balancing, no change is really a small change.<br>
<br>
So, on to the point - We're still working on caster balance, and intend to make the necessary improvements. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> We expect the additional changes to pets to be done soon, and then intend to focus on priests for a bit. </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->We've been keeping up with the message boards and community feedback, so we've got a good handle on the concerns of various classes. Thanks for the continued interest and patience as we try to get this implemented in the best way possible.<br>

We still a totally useless class generally.  We still cant solo.  We are still outnuked by druids.  Our life post 55 is mod rods.  And our AA skills are still as stupid as day one Luclin.  <br>

If a mage cant solo, then either hes A) Fighting something he shouldnt, or b) is doing something wrong<br>
<br>
I didnt have epic till 59 and I had your average gear of PoH type gear, BEFORE massive item inflation caused by luclin.  I found places to solo based on reading this board<br>
<br>
Frankly are pets are pretty good up until 55, and now they are becoming decent again.  Yes druids nuke better than us, but who is to say they shouldnt?<br>
<br>
Druids dont have pets, Lets say we do 20k in nuke damage, druids would do what 24k? then you add in the pets 15k.  <br>
<br>
Now what exactly is the problem again heh? <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60178"><img src="http://64.214.131.159/~noctrnl/images/cheersig.jpg"></a><br>

The post said pets would be getting more upgrades soon, then they're going to try to focus on priests, and that it's hard to balance casters. That's it. Nothing about them being done with us yet, I'm sure more will come at a later stage in the balancing process. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=48427>Nerodread Tier'Darius</a>

From graffe's</span><hr size=1> Well first I have to say that Rich Waters really rocks. His post are so good and don't have this aura of distaste in them like Absor post normally do. He doesn't post crap saying &quot;I don't know&quot; and &quot;we are looking into that&quot;. He post things that he knows about for sure and doesn't put out false information.<br>
<br>
When reading his post I saw it as not so much &quot;we are done with int based casters&quot;. I see it more so as they are going to be near finished with changes they are making to pets. Now they are going to move onto fixing some of the healing issues in the game (which there are a number of them). Well priest are the only true healers in the game other then paladins so it makes sense that they will look at them to start there healing balancing.<br>
<br>
His post also gave me some hope that GV Air and Monster Summoning 3 have different changes instore for them and were not forgotten.  Maybe we are finally going to get to summon a mob at lvl 60 to put the balance back in the game.  We get to have mob pets at lvl 60 while enchanters have to work for 27aaexp points to get the ability once every 144mins.  Maybe finally get our monk pet we been waiting for so long to receive.  Dunno but gives one reason to hope.<br>
<br>
I am willing to give Verant the time they need to make changes if they are willing to respond to concerns like Rich did in his post.  I had a very good feeling after reading his post and if they did more things like that I believe they would receive much more support from there player base then they do.<br>

From graffe's</span><hr size=1> the mage vs druid nuke balance has shifted in favor of druids at level 60. pre 60, druids were relatively weaker nukers than  us.<br>
<br>
do i think this is fair <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> at this point in time of the game</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->?<br>
<br>
yes.<br>
<br>
consider this:<br>
druids dont nuke as well as us early on, because they <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> heal better</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> relative to other healing classes. so for balance, their offense is less relative to other offensive classes.<br>
<br>
however, 50+ druid healing ability stagnates. for balance they receive an upgrade in their damage dealing capabilities so they dont become underpowered.<br>
<br>
notice he said they will be looking at priests after they do pets. if druids become relatively powerful healers again, and mages still do less dd damage than druids, ill agree with the collective mage opinion on this matter, yes it will then be wrong they nuke better if they also heal very well. <br>
although i doubt it will happen like that. what i think will happen is druids will become more powerful healers again after the priest balancing, and then when they look at pure casters they will upgrade sofb so that it is more powerful than moonfire (think lava bolt vs starfire). <br>
<br>
everyone will be happy.<br>
the collective druid opinion is they want to heal/support first, and be offense second. it will be terrific if they recieve better heals.<br>
<br>
the collective mage opinion is they prefer being the second best nukers, and taking an offensive role. it will be terrific if pets get upgraded some more, and sofb is also upgraded.<br>
<br>
both classes will get what they want. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 58 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61427" target="new"><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 45 Erudite Enchantress<br></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucolleen2.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Colleen2</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 122<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 5:46:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/colleenmage/eye.txt WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up!

I'm of course very enthusiastic that pet changes are coming up next. Things previously mentioned as possibilities are more hps, more ATK, better saves, and the possibilities of nuetral pets. Whatever they go live with I feel better about possible changes now than ever before in EQ, and if we don't get it all of the changes I'm more likely to be ok with it because I feel that the changes that have been made of late have been better informed decisions than in the past.<br>
<br>
While I'm as impatient for class changes as any other mage, I feel like the wait may finally be worthwhile. I compare this to the discussions that took place about class balance over a year ago that caused me to leave the magician class for nearly 6 months. I'm glad I'm back, and optimistic about the direction things are moving. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/usilverbladetheenchanter.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Silverblade the Enchanter</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magi Draconis</span><br>  Posts: 1467<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 9:43:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.silverblades-suitcase.com/artofadreamer/3d/excaliburthumb1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up!

What am I missing? Druids and shamans get healing spells a full spell circle or more later than clerics. In the lower levels, their utility spells can make up for their <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lesser</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> healing abilties.<br>
<br>
It could be said that shaman slow and haste can make up the difference in healing abilities between them and clerics, but at no point are druids better healers than clerics.<br>
<br>
Not to hijack the thread, but I'm curious how Noonie got that conclusion.<br>
<br>
Also, I think most people are way too hard on Absor. He's polite and friendly and most of the time I'm willing to bet he's constrained as to what exactly he can say. Rich Waters, being the lead designer, probably has much more latitude as to what information he is able to disclose than Absor who most likely must get approval for a lot of the information he might like to reveal. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uansifiretosser.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ansi Firetosser</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 261<br> <font color=#333333>(5/23/02 3:17:36 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=223.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Heads up!

From graffe's</span><hr size=1> Here we go again.  I am a realist.  And at the present moment realistically speaking, everytime there has been upgrades to all classes, Magicians tends to be left in the dust.  I can care less out about pet upgrades at the moment because, I cant use them on Arch Lich or so on.  I sit back and Mod,,,and Mod,,,,and Mod.  Thats it.  This might be fun to some, but as I have always said is &quot;I started a Magician to do Damage&quot;.  I did not start the game with a mod rod in my hand.  Now some  Magicians have more patience and I commend them for this.  But as I look at the upgrades for Velious and Luclin, we have been made a hollow class,,,no substance---compared to other classes.  Each time some of the same people say well,,we will wait for a upgrade and balance, over and over.  Thats getting old, Ill believe Verant when I see it.  Ill just do what I can with what I got.  Oh and btw, go to Maiden Eye and watch Wizards quad kite, and then tell me we are decent in the high in game.<br>
