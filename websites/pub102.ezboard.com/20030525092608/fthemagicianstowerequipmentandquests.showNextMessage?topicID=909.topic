<br>
I got my shovel of ponz the other night, it needed a shovel (from Najena), a ruby (most expensive of the gems), hill giant toes, and a gargoyle eye.<br>
<br>
I know the Torch of alna requires a torch (najena), fire emerald, scales of a fire drake, and fire giant toes.<br>
<br>
I don't know the specifics on the others. The Torch of Alna should be the easiest to get, as the drakes are in lavastorm, and I believe there are fire giants in Solb. Just pick up a fire emerald before heading into the area and you should be set....<br>

<br>
Earth, (shovel of ponz):  Shovel, Gargoyle Eyes, Hill Giant toes, and a Ruby.<br>
<br>
Air, (Broom of Trillion): Broom, Griffon Feather, Cyclops toes, and a Star Ruby.<br>
<br>
Fire, (Torch of ???? forgot):  Torch, Fire Drake Scale, Fire Giant toes, and a Fire Emerald.<br>
<br>
Water, (Stein of Ulysies... or something like that): Stein, Mermaid Scale, Ice Giant toes, and a Sapphire.<br>
<br>
<br>
Then you go to i believe the temple of ro in Lava Storm, its near the big pit of lava following the wall to your left from the druid rings, and you turn the items into Vira i think... Sorry if im not totally acurate about everything, lvl 55 now its been a while since i have had to think about these quests..   Hope ive been some help..<br>

Amazingly that's what I did and she told me everything I needed to complete my focus items.<br>
(sorry I know sound sarcastic but after all you just need to walk around a tad and explore some of the wonderful world of Everquest for yourself. You'd truely be amazed how much you'll learn and how much enjoyment you'd get from that.) <p><center><img src="http://mantriaspiderstomper.freewebspace.com/mantriatag21.jpg"></center><BR>

<br>
I'm not in the lucky situation to be able to play a lot of hours without a break.<br>
<br>
How does my normal EQ day look like?<br>
Getting online:<br>
- Summoning some food and water.<br>
- Summoning focus items<br>
- getting Pet<br>
- summoning weapons for Pet<br>
- medding<br>
- buffing myself and Pet<br>
- medding<br>
<br>
Now I think there went the first 10-15 minutes.<br>
Then I have maybe 1 hour or 1.5 hours left to play, if I'm very lucky 2 hours.<br>
<br>
That's hardly enough time to get anywhere as a Mage.<br>
If I want to travel to anywhere I usually spend one playing turn only for travelling.<br>
<br>
It may sound stupid of me, but I just don't want to go to the Temple just to find out about the quest, because that would mean 2 hours of no playing at all.<br>
(And I'm sorry, &quot;playing&quot; for me means hunting something....)<br>
<br>
Sure maybe the Mage is the wrong class for me, but that as my first choice and theoretically I like it. So I need to live with my handicap somehow.<br>
I don't know, maybe I will one day switch completely to my Druid who is currently lvl 21. But that wouldnt be the class I prefer to play ;-)<br>
<br>
I don't know how many time you can (or could in the past) play the game.<br>
But there are people who have a job, who need to sleep a bit but still want to &quot;play&quot; EQ as far as it's possible.<br>
I don't know if you would like to &quot;waste&quot; your precious playing time by just getting from A to B just to get told something by a NPC what you also could find out by asking other players. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 9:35:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=932.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: question about focus items</span><hr size=1> Oh, let me be a bit sarcastic now too.... ;-)<br>
<br>
Do or did you ever use printed maps to find your way around?<br>
<br>
If you did never use a map: I truly admire you.<br>
<br>
But if you do or did, think about how much you could have learn and how much enjoyment you'd have gotten from learning about all the different areas without any &quot;non-roleplaying-help&quot;. Because what is the difference between me asking for some quest details and using a player-made-map which helps you not having to learn how to get through the different areas on your own. <br>
<br>
I don't want to use 2 hours to run to some NPC to get some basic quest information and I bet you don't want to run 2 hours through a new zone just to get the basic idea of what is where in the zone.<br>
<br>
Do my attempts to get some information in advance make me a worse player? Maybe.<br>
Do I prefer &quot;cheating&quot; (because if you see it from a roleplaying viewpoint, everything that doesn't come with the game is some kind of &quot;cheating&quot;, because it wouldn't be available to your character in &quot;real Everquest&quot; ) in order to use my available playing time as effectively and enjoyable? definately yes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 12<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 9:57:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=932.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: question about focus items</span><hr size=1> Grummel....many adds, but I want to say even a bit more.<br>
<br>
I'm not a poor guy (not rich either, but I get along).<br>
So I could have gone to Ebay and could have bought some lvl 50+ account with a ton pp and all that stuff.<br>
<br>
I could have bragged all the time what great equipment I have, how great I am by reaching such a high level and so on.<br>
<br>
And probably I would enjoy EQ a bit more, because I simply could go out and have fun. I wouldn't have to care about how I can afford or get some cheapish stuff in the time that is available.<br>
After I would have learned a bit about the class I could have simply killed things without caring much about anything else.<br>
<br>
Just a few things that happened to me:<br>
A lvl 47 Mage on a horse stood close to where I was fighting when I was around lvl 10.<br>
I greeted him and asked him if I could maybe get a DS and a summoned weapon for my Pet (couldnt afford such summon spells and thoiught a better weapon wouldbe nice).<br>
&quot;What's DS....?&quot;<br>
&quot;Damage shield&quot;<br>
&quot;Hmmm, I don't know if I have a spell called &quot;Damage Shield&quot; &quot;<br>
<br>
At that point he ride away on his nice horse.<br>
Did he get the level by himself and all the stuff by spending thousands of hours? Yeah, probably.<br>
<br>
Or when I played as a lvl 20 Mage in LOIO and I happened to have a lvl 27 druid in my group.<br>
He looked cool in his wolf form and the stuff he did wear looked pretty expensive.<br>
The next half hour I tried to explain him the concept of snaring a MOB and how helpful it often is if the MOB doesn't run away...<br>
A lvl 27 Druid who never heard about &quot;Snare&quot; before?<br>
Did he get the level by himself? Yeah, probably.<br>
Was he &quot;just&quot; powerlevelled? Yeah, probably.<br>
A lvl 20 Mage (and that was my only char at that time) knew about Snaring and so I guess everybody does who was in some groups with ANY char before.<br>
<br>
Why do I write all that stuff?<br>
No idea, probably I just should have taken the comments.<br>
<br>
It just makes me a bit sick if people assume always that everybody can play EQ for the whole day. That they laugh at you, just because they level 3 times as fast as you. That people who are lvl 50 are welcomed in many guilds even if they just bought the char or got it from somewhere else.<br>
That people tell you &quot;You should realy get that and that item.&quot; And when you look what that item is you see that it drops from some lvl 50+ MOB. &quot;Oh, nice, thanks for the advice....&quot;<br>
<br>
But you, as a lowish Mage who tries to get along somehow you are more or less an &quot;outcast&quot; ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>
Am I frustrated? sometimes.<br>
Will I live with my handicap? Have to.<br>
Do I like comments like the one that caused my messages or things like described above. Yeah. probably. ;-)<br>
Can I change it? Nahhh ;-) <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0> at: 4/17/02 9:59:38 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 13<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 10:22:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=932.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: question about focus items</span><hr size=1> LOL!<br>

Well...yet another bad day for me ;-)<br>
Poor Mantria probably wouldnt happen to knwo what happened her ;-)<br>
<br>
Well while it was correct what I wrote it was of course completely out of topic ;-)<br>
I'm sorry.<br>
<br>
I just started a similar thread yesterday about the focus items and when I saw this one here I thought it was mine. (lazy me for not really checking)<br>
<br>
So I thought Mantria wrote those replies to me in order to tell me that I shouldn't ask so much and to find out about the quests by myself.<br>
<br>
My sincere apologies.<br>

<br>
I have been playing for 3 years and I am in the same boat as you.  I started playing with a real life friend who played a druid(me being a mage of course)  In a matter of a few weeks he was level 30-something and I was stuck in my teens still.<br>
<br>
He had uber items(heck bronze armor on a warrior seemed like great stuff to me then) and I still wore my same ol robe and was lucky to have my spells.<br>
<br>
Just enjoy the game and troll these boards for as much info as possible.  2 years later he has quit and I still play, because moderation is important as well as developing real life relationships and of course WORK /shivers<br>
<br>
Have fun and I hope to see you some time if you ever happen upon the Mithaniel Marr server. <p><IMG SRC="http://www.strike9.com/eq/file.aspx/path=/casitadgato/fullsize/ghetto2_Wgirl.jpg"><br><a href=http://geocities.com/eqsummoners/>                EQ Summoners...The InComplete Magician Source </a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umantria.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mantria</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 106<br> <font color=#333333>(4/17/02 2:20:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=932.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: question about focus items</span><hr size=1> I'm sorry for coming off as a high and mighty Magician who doesn't want to help new people. I am not. I was trying to get people to at least try to explore some. Coming to the boards everyday doesn't give you the feeling of accomplishment in finishing something or fighting something for the first time. After all you know what the outcome is before hand.  I don't have alot of play time myself and when I stumbled across a good exp spot, either solo or with some people, I usually stayed til it wasn't giving me anymore exp.<br>
<br>
When I first made Mantria I had not a clue about playing a mage, much less playing one on Odus.  I spent my first 4 hours wandering the erudite starting city and marveling at the beauty of it all. The game graphics at that time pale to what they are now but I was like a kid in a candy shop. I'd be like ooo ahhh wow look at that or this.  I began to think, hmmm maybe I need to find Tox and try to get some exp(mantria was my 3rd char(others I got to 15th) and I knew some of the basic things).  So I spent almost an hour trying to figure out how to get to the zone. Then finally asked a passing Wizard how I got there. He chuckled, I turned red, and he said come with me. He then showed my the teleport gems and how to use them and how to get to Tox.  Once out in tox I thanked him and started to marvel yet once again. Here was this green forrest with HUGE trees, so high I could not see the tops. (ever seen those pictures of the tourists in big cities staring at the tops of the skyscrappers? that was me)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
So here I am in Tox looking for stuff to kill. I know about sticking close to the guards so I try not to wander to far.  As anyone who has played an Erudite and tries the newbie area there is like almost ZIP to kill. It took me another 3 hours to level to 3.  As I'm sitting at the guard the same wizard wanders by and asks how its going. I said GREAT I'm level 3 already!!!!  He chuckles once again, I turn red(feeling all the time I'm a tomato) and says would I like to go to a better place then Tox for exp at my level.  I think for a minute and say SURE!(knowing this means I get to see more of the world). He brings me back in Erudin and to the docks. We take a boat to Qeynos(ok NOW I'm really wideeyed and stareing like a kid in a candy shop. Everything is so alive and beautiful!  He says let's wander the city a little and he starts to show me around. Finally we get to the Wizard/Mage/Enchanter guild area and he asks me if I have enough money to buy my 4th level spells. I said I had like 4sp 17cp. He stifles a chuckle(least I hope he did)<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   And tells me to wait near the bank. He is gone for 5mins and then reappears.  Hands me 2 bags, each filled with all my level 1 and level 4 spells. I was so happy.  He then said ok Let's go to Halas(erm what's halas?) He says it'll be my home for the next few weeks.  We start running. In North Qeynos he stops and asks a friendly druid to cast sow on us.  We get to blackborrow and I start con'ing stuff. I'm like this is all red to me and wants my heart on a silver plate. He's like. Not to worry just follow me.  We get through BB and enter Everfrost. Sufice it to say I was in awe.  This place was so beautiful. I'm from a cold climate area so the snow made me feel at home. We start running the canyons. After 10mins He says, Durn I always make that mistake. Huh? Wrong turn<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   We finally get to Halas ramps and zone into Halas. Take the raft across the pond and he binds me near the bank. He shows me around Halas some, shows me the girl to turn in the bear pelts for armor.  Takes me around and then back to the docks. We take the raft back across and zone to Everfrost.  He then explains to me that I need to learn this place, great exp and loot.  He showed me a few tricks like stand back in the canyon near the guards and use burst of flame to bring them to me.  Was a blast. I had help from a friendly player who took pity on me when I was level 3.  <br>
I lived in Everfrost for 20 levels.  I didn't even know about focus items for mages. I didn't know much back then.  Heck I still don't know much, know more but *shrug*. <br>
Point being you can come here, learn everything you can, go back into the game and walk through your gaming life in leaps and bounds.  Will you enjoy it? Porbably because some, as was mentioned, don't have the time to explore the world to its fullest.  I personally wanted to explore the world and see what was out there. I didn't know you could get maps from websites back then(may 2000) Yes I learned zones without maps for the longest time.  Course I never went to many places at first. But still had a blast. <br>
I guess want I'm asking from most is to atleast TRY to help yourself some before anything else.  The one that shows they are trying to learn, are working on their own for whatever reason, willing to ask simple questions will get more respect and help from the high levels then the one who says. Can you hand hold me through life?<br>
<br>
Sorry this got alot longer then I had planed. Take Care and if you ever on Povar look me up I'll help with what I can.<br>
