Head to the lift, beyond the lift are 4 underbulks.<br>
<br>
Tactics are very simple. go down lift (there is a lever on right side of lift to operate).<br>
Cast fire pet (i used focused fire pet nothing else no burout).<br>
<br>
There is one underbulk directly infront of you kill this.<br>
<br>
Round the corner are three underbulks target and send in pet. All three will agro pet. Retreat to the lift and go up (You need to click the switch to go up). there are two guards by the lift,and one a bit further into the caven.<br>
<br>
When the underbulks come for you the guards will take care of them so will the dwarfs.<br>
<br>
Go back down cast a new fire pet, easy now the spawn are split up a bit. max 2 blaze to kill. Spread them out a bit respawn is 20 mins.<br>
<br>
Good easy XP at 39, crap loot (Underbulk claw, throwing Range 150 Dmg 10 Dly 15 sells 3 pp merchant).Easy camp very safe (2 at a time is easy, Max hit in the 60 range pet comes out at 40 - 50%) .Downtime is 5 mins if you get them spread out ok.<br>
<br>
At 39 after the inital 20 min delay, was approx 1 yellow per hour.<br>
<br>
At 41 after the inital 20 min delay, from training to the guards it was about 1 yellow in 1.5 hours. Not bad for such an easy safe camp. No wanders, No Trains, No Competition. Always had this camp to myself. Played whilst working on second PC during the day, just got up for 30 secs when there was a new pop.<br>
<br>
Also as get to 44, there are a second set of higher level underbulks further up the tunnel, and other higher level Mobs to pull.<br>
<br>
Not sure but i expect that at lvl 34 these would be soloable with a BOII/DS/PHANTOM Water/Earth pet, certainly with a partner. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#333333>(5/31/02 10:53:30 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Echo Caverns</span><hr size=1> Thanks :-)<br>
<br>
will have to check that out.<br>
For a while (most of lvl 40) The Great Oowomp worked out pretty fine since I could almost always camp him. But lately I'm having bad luck to get the camp and there is nothing real good nearby as an alternative. <br>
And the travel from anywhere else to there is pretty long.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed the needlites in EC so I guess I will give those underbulks a try ;-)<br>
<br>
Just one comment.<br>
when breaking the complete spawn, why using Fire Pet?<br>
It's only worthwhile if it has it's DS up and that can take a while.<br>
and since you aren'tgoing to keep the first Pet anyway, I guess another Pet (I will probably try earth or Air) might be better for this task.<br>
<br>
Anyway...sounds very interesting ;-)<br>
The underbulks are lvl 35-38, so if you can kill 4 within 18 minutes (that's the spawn time for EC I think) the xp should really rock at least in comparision with Oowomp (but his loot was pretty nice, but got everything meanwhile ;-) ) <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuphorion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euphorion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#333333>(6/3/02 7:49:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Echo Caverns</span><hr size=1> Ok, short update.<br>
<br>
first of all....no I don't like that place ;-)<br>
According to Allakhazam the Underbulks should have been lvl 35-38.<br>
well as it turns out, there are 2 different difficulties for the Underbulks: the ones close to The deep should be around those lvls.<br>
The ones at the elevator are exactly and always lvl 30. (Should post exactly how I know, but either you believe me or you don't ,-) )<br>
Now, for lvl 39 the xp could really be nice.<br>
At 41, when I went to there it was ok (I had one yellow bubble missing), now at 42 it's a joke ;-) ) (even if I add 1 of the tougher Underbulks in the spawn circle I'm getting not more than half a blue per 20 mins, so that would mean about 16 hours for the lvl...no way)<br>
<br>
Anyway..for lvl 39 I guess it could be really nice, maybe even lvl 40.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
Ok, that was the ranting, now some more pactical tips. (I hope ;-) )<br>
I hardly ever had to let the guards kill the first spawn, or at most one of the 3 that come together.<br>
<br>
Summon Air Pet. (now at lvl 41 I could exclude lvl 29 and lvl 30 Pets, at 39 you need some more luck ,-) )<br>
BO2, DS it and send it against the first Underbulk.<br>
Now the 36-hitter was the lowest that conned darkblue for me, so if I got such a one I reclaimed it afterwards and summoned a new darkblue one, in te hope I would get a 38 or 40-hitter. At lvl 39 the decision is probably more difficult. <br>
But you will need a 38 or 40 hitter if you want a chance to kill those 3.<br>
I didn't bother with stuff for pet, because after the first I would get a Fire Pet anyway...<br>
<br>
Ok after the first med to full, DS Pet and yourself and send Pet against one of the Underbulks.<br>
Nuke it as fast as you can (Blaze, Blaze, SoS should do it).<br>
Pet will need a heal now.<br>
Blaze on 2nd underbulk<br>
heal Pet<br>
Blaze on 2nd Underbulk....should be dead<br>
Now heal Pet again and then cast 2 Blazes on the 3rd one.<br>
With some luck, Pet is still alive (but got never out with more than 10% health)<br>
<br>
If an underbulk come safter you, you should be fine.<br>
They never ever interrupted one of my spell casts (they hit hard, but pretty slow)<br>
You are DS'ed as well and can still Nuke it.<br>
<br>
Worked out for me 3 out of 4 attempts.<br>
In one attempt pet died with 2 Underbulks left. Culd still kill one of them but then I did run to the &quot;guards&quot; ;-)<br>
<br>
Another time I tried it with a 40-hitter-Fire Pet stuffed completely with Plate armor, 2 Rings of Flight, 2 coldstones and elemental defender.<br>
No chance....&quot;we&quot; could kill the first one, but shortly after it was dead.<br>
<br>
Note: all the Pets were focused, so if you dont have the focus items, I don't think you need to attempt it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway...my summary: not worth the effort if you are above lvl 40. But he was right, it's an safe and easy camp. ;-) <p><img SRC="http://www.euphorion.org/sig/euph_zdd2.jpg"> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/utangting.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TangTing</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#333333>(10/2/02 12:10:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Underbulks</span><hr size=1> Just spent the day leveling from 39 to 40 off these critters.  Once you break the 3 bulk room it is easy - easier than even Golras - level 39 fire pet eats them alive.  I broke the spawn a little differently. I killed the first underbulk in the hall, then sent the fire pet in against the far right underbulk in the room with 3.  All three aggroed the pet - I healed pet and nuked the bulk it was attacking to kill monster.  Once that one was dead, I ran to elevator and double-clicked the lever to go up.  Once you go up elevator your pet poofs, but I ran for the zone line and the remaining bulks forgot about me.  I then went back down the elevator, resummoned fire pet and sent it back it to take on the two remaining pets.  A focused fire pet can handle two bulks easily with a heal and the help of a couple of nukes.<br>
<br>
Each 20 minute spawn of bulks gave about 1.5 blue of xps, so an hour gave me close to a yellow.  Boring work, but steady and sure beats going back three blues in more dangerous surroundings. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=myndbender>Myndbender</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(11/5/02 8:35:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerlevels3943.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=90.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Underbulks</span><hr size=1> hmm, wasn't too impressed with these guys.

I did it all with one pet and 80% mana.<br>
<br>
Killed the hallway one first. Went down easy.<br>
<br>
Sent pet after the one on the left first and it only aggro'd the middle one once the pet hit the underbulk on the left.<br>
<br>
Once the one on the left was dead (rain spell) the pet switched to the middle underbulk and the far right one aggro'd. due to crappy pathing down there i nuked the third one and ran around and had the third one chase me and never catch me.<br>
<br>
Pet finished the second off and came and helped me out with the last guy.<br>

<br>
was bored so i went back at 41.<br>
<br>
each kill resulted in 1% xp according to the UI i am using.<br>
<br>
when i sent pet after the one on the left the middle one aggor'd like before, but my stupid pet switched to the middle one which caused the far right one to aggro.<br>
<br>
alternated healing pet and nuking the underbulks and got them all dead.<br>
<br>
still not impressed, but its super easy xp, no trains, no competition, and not too taxing mentally hehe<br>
