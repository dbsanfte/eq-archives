<br>
Just had a huge row with a guild officer about the inclusion of pets on raids. The idiot had no idea about all the pet changes and how they are all neutral now and how /pet commands can work cross-zone now.<br>
<br>
NB: This was not while we were raiding<br>
<br>
Is it just me, or should raid leaders keep abrest of the latest developments from VI so they know what they're talking about?<br>
<br>
I tried to explain to him the new changes but the ass-hole's attitude was &quot;I don't care, I'm the raid leader, ergo I'm god, just hand out candy!&quot; &lt;words to that effect&gt; and it's so frustrating! Are they all so stupid? It's like trying to make a world war 1 veteran use a PC! He was so unresponsive to the fact that now they just MIGHT be useful!!! I mean the pets are a good 25% of the Magician's power! We're rpetty useless against all but cold based mobs!<br>
<br>
Maybe I should just find myself a guild with raid leaders who actually look at class balancing.<br>
<br>
I so wish I was a magician in real life, I'd summon a mod rod and beat his head in with it!<br>

<br>
Last night I was on a Shei Vinitras raid.  Hes the guy in Akheva where if someone dies on the raid, the boss &quot;resurrects&quot; a &quot;pet&quot; of his in their place which basically creates a mean cycle of everyone dying if people first start dying.<br>
Well, you have to keep 1 guard CCed the whole time because if he dies all his guards respawn.  We had a warrior and a cleric in the back, its a pretty long fight so the cleric needs some mod rod stock and i dont really mind because im just keepin one person topped off and its not really stressful.  So I go send my pet on the boss and come back and keep the cleric stocked up on mana while my pet is on the boss in the other room.  I summon a few rods, use a few rods, get a heal slapped on me make a few more rods so they are well supplied for the cc, then i head back to the other room.  On my way through the door i see some halfling (wish i cought their name) train some centi dators on the cleric.  There was a back up warrior there to cc so i figured well they are fine ill just go try to kill Shei now.<br>
<br>
The cc cleric died.. then shortly after the warriors ccing the guards died.  Then the guards came and start beating on the people at were fighting Shei.  Then because casters were standing on the back wall (there is a mana drain trap around the boss) and healing the ccers, that proceeded to die because most healers were healing the MT and there wasnt really a contigency plan for this (other than using paladins to cc so they can layhands, but this wouldnt have been needed if the original cc cleric wasnt trained).  Well, the new pet guards that spawned out of the dead CCers ran up to the caster ledge... where there was no CC =( and that was basically when the fight was lost.<br>
<br>
Guess what?<br>
Soandso tells you, 'No pets next time!!'<br>
I was like wtf?  My pet never died.  There were only like 6 people alive when i died.  In fact, the last things i saw were some spectre pets and epics while i was training guards out of the room to maybe buy time even though i knew it was futile.<br>
<br>
If a caster dies, the pet despawns... it doesnt &quot;die&quot; as though it were slain.  My pet was at full health the whole time, and the way pets work when players are around, is basically the never get hit.  And now that pets dont die with enrage like they used to helps a lot.<br>
<br>
I mean sure, my pet is like half as effective as the average melee in this raiding party (they are all very uber), but that is still extra dps.  And obviously more dps is good.<br>
<br>
Do pet casters have a sign on our back that says scape goat?  It seems lots of raids try to make it &quot;no ones fault&quot; if there is a whipe out.  If pets were used during the fight, then that means they can just blame on an NPC.  They tried to make it sound like the pets got raped at the beginning and spawned a @#%$ load of guards... sorry the paladins got raped and no one was healing them because they were busy healing the MT.  Making it no ones fault is polite sure.  As long as the raid leader knows what actually caused the failure and adjusts the strategy in the future. <p><img src="http://image1ex.villagephotos.com/extern/519420.jpg"> </a><p>
