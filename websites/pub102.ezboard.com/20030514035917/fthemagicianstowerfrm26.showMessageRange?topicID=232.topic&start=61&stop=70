<br>
Your point about enchanters is fairly wrong though.  Do you know how often VoG is asked for isntead of SoS?  Sure maybe your tanks will keep SoS for the ac or some of the people who can't reach the haste cap with VoG.  But more and more people prefer it over the chanter epic now.  And it will become even more in demand as people get better haste items.  AND it is unlikely that there will never be another haste spell-though it could happen of course.<br>
<br>
Plus-neither of these epics SCALE with new expansions.  As far as I know the cleric and enchanter epics are the same as when they were originally put into the game-minus the duration on the epic haste being upped once if I remember right.  The mage epic however is being upgraded overtime.  Truly upgraded.  It is no where near the same. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/umagemali.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MageMali</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(9/17/02 7:39:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=232.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Epic Pet?</span><hr size=1> As a brand new mage epic, I can't stand the thought of our ultimate pet being usurped by some droppable spell, or even another epic quest. <br>
<br>
What I'd like to see, though, are more situational pets - like the decoy pet. <br>
<br>
You can always count on your epic for overall power...but for certain encounters, you might want to use pet X which has the ability to cast an AE stun...or let's say, the Pet Y that HEALS other pets...Or pet Z that you can &quot;loan&quot; to your group even when you leave the zone...etc.<br>
<br>
OR, what about sitational buffs that you can cast on your pet, epic pet included. Similar to Valient Companion. <br>
<br>
Buffs that increase ATK..MR...FR...etc. Or even buffs that change the model of the pet to reduce aggro and just for showing off. Or buffs that increase the Epics pet power but only work in PoP.<br>
<br>

<br>
Interesting thought here.  What if our epic orb, was a focus item for the 60 plus pets.  Getting our epic would still be a needed epic, because having it, would give us 4 different epic pets to choose from at 60+.  Say the fucos epic orb would grant our 60+ pets plus 2 more lvls and better spells and better stats.<br>
<br>
The regular 57 plus pets are getting closer to our epic pet now, but not many people have the focus elementary staves to make them even better.  It looks like the plus 60 pets are going to be better than our epic pet, but why not make the epic orb a fucos for them, so mages will still go after their epic, and still want to get the plus 60 pets.  I love my epic pet, but if it keeps getting stronger, why would I want to even get the plus 60 pets.<br>
<br>
I remember a long time ago, when people thought our epic was going to be a focus item for our last 4 pets, why not make it just that.  Where it is a focus item for the 60 plus pets.  Just a thought. <p><b>Gandolph / Kozymo<b> <BR>

<br>
Say a pet that has less hp, less damage output, but can DS itself for like 90 would be interesting; or a pet that does half the melee of the epic but has 7k hp and high ac, or a pet with very very little hp and melee ability but casts 400-500 point nukes... etc.<br>
<br>
Epic would still be useful as an all around pet, and then you would have these new situational pets that would excel in a particular area.<br>
<br>
Then you could have the epic 2 have all the best attributes of these new pets =) <p><center><i><b>

<br>
By themselves, the post 60 pets should only exceed the epic in their areas of expertise (earth HPs, air mitigation/stuns, etc.) ONLY if utilized well, and only by a bit.<br>
<br>
During the Epic 2 quest, you have to combine the 1st epic in a container (as was suggested earlier) with some decently difficult items to obtain (not INSANE difficult, but challenging difficult).  When you get the Epic 2, you discover *gasp* that instead of being a new pet, or even a new 1hb primary slot partical weapon, It is instead something ENTIRELY different.<br>
<br>
My proposed Epic 2:<br>
<br>
Magic Lore No Drop (and NOT summoned by a new spell)<br>
<br>
AMMO SLOT<br>
<br>
The item itself has no stat modifiers (since items placed in the ammo slot do not use their stats if they have any).  Instead, it gives the magician Ultravision, See Invis, a Rigth Click Effect (I dunno, how bout a pet only ATK increase that stacks with Burnout?  or a Self only 50 point DS? lets not get TOO crazy here) AND, it acts as a Focus for the post 60 pets (but not for the epic).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In this way, doing the 1st epic quest will be necessary to get to the 2nd epic.  The epic pet BY ITSELF will be stronger than the post 60 pets, but the 60 pets after being FOCUSED will be noticeably stronger than the epic, given their areas of expertise.  The fact that it wouldn't focus the Epic would keep people from being lazy about elemental summoning choices.  Oh, and I suppose the effects of the focus would HAVE to stack with the VT mage Gloves, so those who have the time investment to get the gloves still get the advantatage they earned.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's my idea for this problem, what ya think? <p>After working out the kinks of his new incantations, Knobby decides a Poo Elemental wasn't such a good idea after all...

Your epic, as it stands now, will NOT BE USELESS.  No more or less so than it was when you got it/get it.  <br>
<br>
You'd think from all the crying here that as soon as you install PooP your epic pet will simply evaporate!  Jeez, what a crock of @#%$!<br>
<br>
Settle down, you gumps.  Wait and see what happens.  Stop getting your knickers in a twist over SPECULATION.  <br>

What is wrong with you people?  &quot;Why did I waste all this effort!  Wha wha!&quot;  You idiot.  Your effort was never wasted.  You get a pet that can lay the smack on just about any dang thing you point it at, THAT'S why you put the effort in.  <br>
<br>
Guess what?  If the 61st+ pets are better, YOU'LL STILL HAVE TO BE 61st level to use them!!  And, surprisingly enough - I know some of you guys haven't figured this out yet, so I'm going to say it here - you'll still level faster with an epic pet than without.<br>

No, we may not NEED a pet upgrade in PoP, but since the other classes will have their essential traits upgraded, we SHOULD have our pets upgraded, regardless of if it's needed or not. <br>
<br>
Ummm, no.  The epic is good.  It is hard.  It doesnt need to be replaced.  By anything.  It does its job and does it well.<br>
<br>
I wouldnt mind buffs, or items that buff it (ala gloves dark summoning) that would be tough to get.  But no vendor or dropped scroll should replace the epic.  Maybe build on it but not replace it.<br>
<br>
The whole melee weapon issue is because what else can a mob drop that will improve a warrior?  Ummm, armor and weapons is it.  What drops that improves casters?  Well, bigger stats are nice, and clicky is good, and some of the rare 60 spells like pet heal and ancient dd.<br>
<br>
If nothing replaced the warrior epic they would all be handicapped ... regardless of how upset they were about the introduciton of better weapons u can bet theyd be MORE upset if they didnt have em.<br>
<br>
Yes PCs get stronger in pop but all the things mentioned such as spells and gear will be avaialabe to mages too.  If you think mages are only as good as the pet then youre missing out big time.<br>
<br>
With the new aaxp and tone of PoP I bet it will rely more on magicians speciality of dealing with summoned creatures.  Turn summoned may become useful.  Pets can be given swords of runes for more procage.  The anti summon dd line may get a boost.  The pet swarm and suspend options will increase pet viability in different situations.<br>
<br>
