   1. I found leveling from 13 - 15.5 pretty nice with the sirens. I prefer the southern rocks, with the 2 sirens on one rocks and 3 on the other. I would reiterate what people have said about the two together on the rocks with three, insofar as that they do aggro so you have to be ready to take out the first one ASAP when two come. But once you break that spawn it is a nice almost constant circuit between the five sirens (and the two goblins if you want). Only downside is there is almost no gold (which was a concern with those L16 spell costs). But more on money below.<br>
   2. For those who don't remember, the above set of rocks are the ones when you take the boat FROM Butcherblock. Basically the first landmark in the OOT zone. One nice thing about those rocks is that if you bind there, you can jump the boat when it comes by to the Inn if you want to sell off any items (goblin bows sell for 1.5 gold or so). Then when you're ready to head back, can take boat to Antonica, or take a canoe from inn island up to northern siren rocks, and grab the boat from there back to butcherblock. Or to return to Fay continent take the boat from 5 siren rocks and just go all the way to Freeport and back.<br>
   3. Other siren rocks: I did try the ones on the way out of OOT back toward Butcher. There are two on one rock, and a third on a rock with three goblins. None of these guys group aggro, which is nice. But I prefered the nice cycle of the five on the other rocks.<br>
   4. Aviak island: This was a bit of a let down. At my level (L14), it took me about three hours of attempts and fails (and gates back to inn island) to find Aviak. Of course, I was trying to do it from the Inn island on the way from Butcher to Freeport. Anyhow, I finally figured out to take the canoe from that island as close as I could until the canoe travel wouldn't go any further, then swim the remainder 2000 or so coords. Anyhow, the island was a bit of a let down. Sure, there is a nice range of Aviaks (blue, white, yellow), but I often had to wait for one to come low enough on the beach to pull. I died twice there when a couple would come from over the ridge, higher than I thought their aggro range was, and it was a pain to then get back and get my corpse. The money side is a little better though, with aviak horns selling for about 5 gold.<br>
<br>
Wisps and money:<br>
   1. OK, while the sirens were good and interesting hunting -- both in terms of xp and practicing tactics with pet for pulling two at a time -- it was horrible for money. I mean, I'm looking at maybe having made 5 plats in 2.5 levels of xp. And those L16 spells and their prices (shudder). And keep in mind this is a non-twink GnoMage. The contrast was especially bad because gnomes have it so easy from L1-L12 because Steamfont is so lucrative in terms of plats.<br>
   2. OK, so like many I zeroed in on Wisps. At L12, this was actually pretty great since fire pets solo them pretty easily, and I get solid blue xp through at least L13. So in probably 6 hours of hunting in East Commons (the flats near the guard/toll booth) I got about 7-9 great and 10-15 normal lightstones. Normal lightstones, 5 gold each. Not bad. BUT, I didn't cash in the greaters. No, I hitched a port to nexus, took the spire down to north karana, and gave them to the gypsy (myrlia ro something like that). And voila, research books that sell for 7.5 plat! So each greater in the end could sell for 7.5 plat. Now THAT helped me out financially. If you do that trick, just be careful to have your pet out because lions and wolves go through the gypsy camp constantly. And of course if you're evil align, you'll want to do the same thing but with the Dark Elf vendor is S.Ro.<br>
<br>
Whew. OK, I know that was kinda long, but I appreciated some of the info when I was L12 and looking to hunt, so wanted to pass my experiences along.<br>
<br>
Now I'm onto the L16-19 trek...<br>

Erud's crossing.<br>
<br>
With my solo mage (non-twink but the 5th I've started) I went to Erud's crossing at lvl 8 and left at around 15-16).<br>
<br>
At lvl 8 any adds are death, at lvl 15 you start to wish there was 1 more spawn...<br>
<br>
As for the layout, there are 4 &quot;corners&quot; of the island.  going clockwise these are 1) docks  2) wisp spawn 3) quest ogre, and 4) cat fishing.<br>
<br>
It is possible to &quot;share&quot; the island, but most of the time I didn't have to on Rathe.  It doesn't seem many low levellers come here anymore.<br>
<br>
If the island is fully spawned, there are 5 wisps up, often I've found 1 or 2 between docks and spawn, 1 02 2 on hill near cat fisher (or in center volcano area) and 1 near the ogre.<br>
<br>
All 5 will respawn at (or very near) the same spot (corner counter-clockwise of docks) and they initially travel clockwise past ogre to a hill with 2 glowing rocks.  From here I haven't tracked their progress, I usually camp on their path from spawn to the ogre.<br>
<br>
Now for important stuff...<br>
No, the ogre has never been aggro to me.  I've rarely found one off in the water,  don't swim looking for them (some very serious sharks near island that can see invis).<br>
<br>
I usually used a water elemental at this level, renew summoned is often very efficient in mana usage per fight (nuke once and heal pet til you win...).  Of course if you know what you are doing any of the pets can be effective (the fire's DS may be more suitable for my tactics here...)<br>
<br>
The respawn time if controlling all 5 is reasonable with just enough downtime to regain mana (barely).<br>
<br>
As for the other spawns on the island.  1) katta will assist beetles under attack 2) The poison fo the spiders and snakes can be significant (on you, pet can ususally handle).  3) the vampire bat with a pet is an undercon (without pets they are reasonably easy).  4) Killing spiders, snakes, etc may spawn some tougher critters, notable madmen and elementals.  be careful if others are on island killing indiscriminately.  The only aggro I've gotten on the island was from madmen, elementals, and zombie sailors.  when I was alone AFK was a pretty safe place to be.<br>
<br>
Good luck, have fun, and read above for where to turn in the GLS's. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Like you said, any add was death.<br>
<br>
After getting sick of the boat ride back, I found a new strategy.  Chain casting pets.<br>
<br>
Using Water for their overall stats and non-wasted shock spell, I would pull as usual (never without fm, though).  IF another wisp added, I had a strategy that did not involve gateing back to Qeynos.  First, summon about 4 staffs or daggers.  They do make a difference!  When the pet gets below 40%, give yourself some room and start casting the pet WITH the inventory window open.  With one bubble of casting time left, click &quot;GO AWAY&quot; and your nearly dead pet will suicide, just in time for your new one to appear.  Quickly give it a staff or dagger.  By this time the wisps are on you, and he will draw them off.  Repeat until the wisps are dead, you run out of malachite, or run out of mana.  The last two are certain death, btw.<br>
<br>
I never had more than 1 add, but I had enough mana for gate just in case.<br>
<br>
The money is unbeatable.  I had plenty for all my lvl 12 spells, and walked away several levels higher. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.showPrevMessage?topicID=25.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.showNextMessage?topicID=25.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.threadControl?topicID=25.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=25.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm40>Levels 12-15</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM GAMES AD SCRIPT -->
