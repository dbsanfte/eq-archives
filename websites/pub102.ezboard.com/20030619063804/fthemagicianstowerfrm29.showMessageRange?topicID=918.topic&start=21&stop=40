Stat buffs do not effect pets, except in the case of DEX which will cause your pet to proc more often.<br>
<br>
Pure HP/AC buffs are noticeable and do work.<br>

No idea about items, although it wouldnt surprise me if focus effects and the like did not work on them. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://cyberseth.com/~rhaug/girlball.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=ozommo>Ozommo</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0> at: 12/31/02 6:20:44 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=nikatjef>nikatjef</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 49<br> <font color=#333333>(12/31/02 6:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=918.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/nikatjef/Everquest/Rogue.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Pet FACTS - SOE/VI Please Acknowledge. </span><hr size=1> Ozommo,<br>

   Again, there is no way to prove or disprove it.  From my own observation, stat buffs do have an affect, albeit a very minor one.  Perhaps, Beastlord warders are different, but there is a noticable difference in my warder's performance when I hit my warder with AC / STR / ATK / STR / DEX buffs.<br>

We have proved the pet equiped said item.... Cause we give items that have +HP and + STA and they only gain the +HP's and nothing from the +STA.. Kassara has proven this with the coterie helm.. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>As a Beastlord, I can assure that the spells do stick, the question is, do they have an affect.<br>
<br>
From my own experience, both in parses and eyeball, Dex has a very noticable affect on procs, Str has a very very minor affect on DPS, ATK has a minor affect on DPS. There have been numerous parses on EQ Beastlord where people were able to show that ATK/STR does have an affect, though it is not always obvious.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
I know that +ATK has an effect and logs to prove it, I also know that DEX plays NO role on innate procs (Like the epic pet innate proc). Now, DEX MIGHT effect Beastlord Spell procs casted on pets.. But, don't assume that it has an effect on innate proc's or weapon proc's on pets. <br>

<br>
You cannot buff your own pet in a duel.<br>
<br>
I have never tried to have ANOTHER person buff my pet, but when I type /duel and try to Burnout or DS my pet, the spells simply do NOT stick to the pet. Period. The Beastlord poster seems to agree with me as well, but, I have to find the rest of the data suspect if this simple fact cannot be agreed on. In fact, every pet caster I know of buffs their pets up before they duel....<br>
<br>
I dunno. Could somebody else step in a have a say? I'll log in tonight and do it just to make sure I'm not on crack but I just did this last week and was all annoyed because I forgot to BO5 my pet and suffered in the duel.<br>

   No, the Mage cannot heal their own pet, nor can the Shaman heal dogdog.   Perhaps what you meant to say when you said...<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And yes, You can buff pets while in a duel.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
  Was that, your opponent can heal your pet while in a duel.  And though this may be possible, it is easily proven that you cannot heal/buff your own pet while in a duel.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>I know that +ATK has an effect and logs to prove it, I also know that DEX plays NO role on innate procs (Like the epic pet innate proc).

   Strangely enough, I do equip my warder with proc'ing weapons as well, specifically things like Velium Daggers, Fist Of Ixiblat, etc.  So yes, I have seen a difference in proc rates for weapons as well as proc buffs.<br>
<br>
   That said however, I have often debated whether Mage pets actually proc or cast.   Personally, I am of the belief that the epic and earth pets cast, the air and water pets proc.   Because of this belief, I DEX buff the air pets when my friends summon them and I have noticed, albeit visually only, an increased rate of stuns.<br>
<br>
   Something that many people seem to lose sight of when talking about this subject is that no one really knows what the stats do.  For example, according to Rangers Glade and Safehouse, the difference between 100STR and 255STR is a grand total of 3-5% DPS difference.   According to Monkly Biz and Steel Warrior, the difference between 100AGI and 255AGI is a grand total of 4% Damage evasion, and 2% damage mitigation.  Also when I +STA buff myself, I see a grand total of +30 Max HP or ~2%.<br>
<br>
   In the first two, we are talking changes of 155 points, and at most we are seeing a difference of 5%.  As such, we can't really tell if STR helps players, other than by raising the amount they can carry as the 3-5% could easily be attributed to noise.<br>
<br>
   As far as the stamina goes, as I said, a difference of 2%, which I personally regen back within 12 seconds, however, my warder has, according to VI/SoE, 12 times my regen.   Is 30HP of his 2500HP going to even be noticable when he is regening 30+ per tick?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>You seem to be in a state of denial<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
   Not denial so much as 'Prove it'.  The Crucible has run hundreds of tests, and they still haven't agreed that STA has &quot;no&quot; affect.  You call it fact, I call it theory.  The fact is, unless when can see our pet's and warder's stats, we have no way of knowing/proving the truth, as such, they can't be claimed as fact.<br>

<br>
/pet health report doesnt show fractions, i think anything behind the comma is simply dropped.<br>
So anything from 8.0% - 8.999% will all show up as 8%...<br>
<br>
If i am not mistaken, the summoned 20 hp bracer and ring have a higher rec lvl tag than the ear, so maybe the pet got only 1 hp from each bracer or ring...<br>
<br>
Lets assume the pet had 89 hps, and you nuked it for 81 pts:<br>
8 / 0.89 = 8.988....     8%<br>
<br>
With earring (2hp):<br>
10 / 0.91 = 10.989.... 10%<br>
<br>
With 2 earrings(4hp):<br>
12 / 0.93 = 12.903.... 12%<br>
<br>
With one bracer(1 hp):<br>
9 / 0.9 = 10              10%<br>
<br>
With 2 bracers (2 hp):<br>
10 / 0.91 = 10.989.... 10%<br>
<br>
Try giving the pet an earring and a bracer (3 hps total):<br>
11 / 0.92 = 11.956...  11%<br>
<br>

As for other buffs, while I've never noticed if STA has an effect, every other buff my pet has ever recieved at any level has always seemed to have an effect.

Maybe when they increased the size of NPC merchants they fixed this, but last I checked the pet won't equip the *weapons*.  Next, try giving the pet 3 different types of rings and see how many it benefits from.  My guess is that it'll take all 3.. but we'll see.<br>

Quick point -- stamina seems to effect the number of hitpoints you get per level, or at least I've always assumed that it did.  Under this idea, low level pets would have far less benefit from sta buffs than high level pets.  Something like 3sta might not be enough to see a full hitpoint of improvement.  I'd like to see no effect from a high-level shammie sta buff and avatar before agreeing that sta most likely has no effect on pets.<br>

However, I will grant 3 sta on a level 5 is not that much of a change and the only proof is that dang flux being similar to the 10hp cloak<br>
<br>
Will be trying other tests later with some bloodstone earrings and necklaces (since pets can equip those slots) (2 * 2 on ears and 5 on neck, 9 sta should give us a greater margin of error)<br>
<br>
And, as someone brought up, with different pets<br>
<br>
3 sta, btw, does affect HP at that level.  You do get 1hp, and on a pet whos HP is less than 100, that should show a change in percentile.  (I do grant it's a pretty small jump.  I only thought about STA as an afterthought when I was about to give the pet the helm and realized it HAD sta  (-8  I was only looking for HP stuff.  Not gonna blow some 500pp item on a pet.)<br>

<br>
I know AGI has a very noticeable effect on pets, especially the earth pet (obviously).  The air pet becomes near impossible to hit with extra AGI on.  So, we know AGI works.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen an effect of STA on pets.  I use a 60 shaman to two-box a lot and I've never really noticed any difference with adding stamina.  <br>
<br>
STR seems to have an obvious effect.  Parse the average hit with and without Burnout on.  You'll probably notice a difference.<br>
<br>
I haven't really toyed around with DEX too much because I can't summon weapons that are based around this.  Yes, I am too low of a level to summon Blade of Walnan's.  The only real way to tell is to summon a pet raw with just Burnout and parse him.  Then, parse him with all the DEX buffs you can imagine (items, shaman buffs, etc).  <br>
<br>
So far, I've noticed added AGI makes the biggest difference with pets.  Cast &quot;Deleriously Nimble&quot;, a +70agi shaman buff, on your pet and notice that your pet will tank for ages without taking any damage.  This is with air pets as well.  <br>

<br>
The testing methadology used in this thread is reasonably sound, but flawed in that it relies on low-level pets and people generally cannot agree that the buffs will have any significant effect on said pets.  Why not retry the tests on a level 19 pet?  It should still have sufficiently low hp to make the results visible.  Or a level 49 pet?  This will make the HP differences harder to see, of course, but might help with the testing of the other things (like the effect of AGI / STR / DEX).<br>
<br>
Interesting reading, regardless.<br>
<br>
My personal experience is that STA has no particular effect on my pet; I cast it anyway, though.  It may not help, but it won't hurt either (except my mana pool, but heh, I'm a shaman).<br>
