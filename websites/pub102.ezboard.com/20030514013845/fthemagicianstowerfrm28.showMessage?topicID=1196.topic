<br>
One of the things that really has just pissed me off to no end is the lack of droppable caster gear. I mean most of the people that I know that are not uber, still for the most part have no PoP focus items. Now when Focus Items were first released they said they would be adding a number of focus effects to items via multiple patches. Well we got one patch, and never a new one. I figured well they were just going to wait till PoP was released and most of the gear would have focus effects. Well that has not happened either. It is great that uber magexx in a guild that can kill sol ro, and get a uber focus item with stats that make arch lich drool. However all of us are not that lucky, and previous to PoP everyone had very good focus items available to them. <br>
<br>
Now there seems to be like zero good focus items that are droppable, and readily available to the masses. Melee were able to get Windblade, and I am seeing that new uber 2hb monk stave that is dropping, as well as a number of 16/22 and 14/20 1hb/h2h items dropping. Seems melee are making out as always, however casters are getting the major screw in terms of items.  Wand of the War Wizard is the only really nice caster item that I have seen that is droppable with a good focus effect. However I have seen about 100+ Windblades for sale, yet i have never seen that wand for sale. I am just really frustrated on the lack of FT items, and focus items available to the non-uber caster.<br>
<br>
I thought recommended level was being added to so many items so that they could bring good solid items to the general public. I mean Wand of the War Wizard is not even that good in relationship to the +200hp/mana items I have seen dropping off some of the gods. I don't understand why a item like Wand of the War Wizard which has a limited focus affect, with sub-par stats compared to even kunark epics is kept out of reach from the general public. <br>
<br>
Improved Damage focus items as well as Mana Preservation items need to be made available to the public like they were previous to PoP. I hate having to take such a massive stat hit wearing mage summoned earring/bracer/ring. Also where is the PoP version of CT boots, or the PoTC earring quest. I am just sick of playing a caster that plays 8hrs+ a day but chooses not to be in a uber guild, and constantly get screwed over when non-uber melee to the left can get weapons with 16/22 ratios, and 42/34 without much hassle.<br>

Why should verant/soe spend any time on piddly int casters when they have always raped them in dropped loot since kunark?<br>

After all verant/soe has much better things to do like add frogloks as a playable race<br>

Bust out some skill or a little cash, go farming for parts, and get one made. Fair stats in addition to having focus effects. Also, if you haven't noticed, there are a lot of dropped Foci around. Usually something like Anger/Fury/Distance/Conservation of E'ci/Druzzil/Sollusk, et all. <p><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=52886&quot;"><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.ninjacorp.com/Rhasin_sig.jpg" style="border:0;"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></div><!--EZCODE CENTER END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=calebe>Calebe</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 598<br> <font color=#333333>(1/15/03 9:54:13 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1196.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Where are all the focus items!!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> Well they did add one nice focus effect item in PoN. Easy to get, and has a level 4 effect on conjuration like the enshrouded veil effect. <br>
<br>
Of course it is for necromancers only, and of little use to them. I saw the item drop early on with the PoP release and thought ahh so a tease, there are focus items in them there planes.<br>
<br>
I was right, but as it is SoE, they are in zones only the largest of guilds will ever see, and not for the average player.<br>
<br>
You remember the average player don't you? They are 90% or more of the PAYING player base, why should SoE make a few items they would want to see and get a chance to loot?<br>

This is really a outrage IMO. This is by far the worse treatment of casters ever. The items we need are being kept from us. I mean yes I am happy for the uber casters that can get focus effects with +150 mana/hps. I am not asking for items like that. Just some items with maybe 35hps/mana +5int, and a ok focus affect. The mage focus items should have really had better stats on them. That would have solved alot of problems.<br>

Too bad it has to come off AD in PoV...<br>
They are out there, and keep in mind they also added all the more limited focus gear.  Such as The weapons drive shaft, which is haste on detrimental spells only ( not all like our summoned ring).  Or the several with DD focus for cold ( not that that helps mages) <br>
So there are focus items out there just gotta wait for them to trinkle done.<br>

<br>
You heard right nothing, nadda, zip.  Not an item, a parchment not anything.  Now I don't play 8 hours a day like Wez so I don't usually have the time nor is the zone empty enough to hit minis multiple times like that.<br>
<br>
I'm sure there are plenty of things that I haven't seen from that zone--in fact I'm sure of it because I've been part of 6 mini kills and seen one item drop.<br>
<br>
So like usual the itemizations sucks hard and if you are a semi casual player like me that plays in 2-3 hour stretches you are really screwed.  I'm way better off just racking up DKP at raids and getting velious and luclin drops given that PoP drops have been PooP for me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=woonx>woonx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 297<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/03 12:31:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm28.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1196.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Where are all the focus items!!!!!!!!!</span><hr size=1> There's a bunch of trade skill focus items from PoP, these are by far the easiest to get.<br>

Above that you pretty much have to kill raid type mobs, but no need to be able to kill sol ro, or even have access to the zone, behemoth, grummus, aerin'dar, saryrn, etc all drop focus items, and they are already killed by pickup raids, so I don't really see any reason to protest. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=75721">Woon</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->  <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://tde.e-slackers.net/">&lt;TDE&gt;</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <br>

<br>
I've seen ornate armor parts for sale already, so expect more to show up in bazaar soon.<br>
<br>
Elemental Planes also drop parts for awesome dropable caster gear. (60hp/mana some stats/resist efect: mana preservation IV primary/secondary/range) - expect lots of such items to show up in bazaar soon.<br>
<br>
A small raid (no uber guild required) can kill minis in Tactics - ornate legs/bp, runes and some pretty nice items.<br>
<br>
Minis &amp; Tower bosses in Bastion of Thunder are doable by a small guild as well.<br>
<br>
They also mentioned the sage quests being fixed, considering you need high research skill I'm sure it will have a nice reward for pure casters. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39884" target="top">Soriak</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
