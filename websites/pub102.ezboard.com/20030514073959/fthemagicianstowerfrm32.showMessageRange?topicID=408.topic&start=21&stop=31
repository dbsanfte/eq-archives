Not a slam, but a true statement.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Back in the day, I used to argue with my family over anything and everything just for sport. The general rule for more heated debates was that if any person were to insult any other person, no matter how subtley disguised the insult was, the insulter the loser. I think it's a very good rule for debates: the only time you really have to turn to insults is when you're at a loss for valid arguments to make. You may not be my family, but at this point, as far as I'm concerned, you lose. Frankly, age has nothing to do with anything, although if it did, you've certainly shown your maturity simply by making that statement.<br>
<br>
1) You're complaining that you can't solo like you used to. 2)You're complaining that the only ways to solo now are agro kiting and chain casting pets. 3) You're somehow twisting words around in your head to blame pet's lack of the ability to tank on the mage's ability to chain cast pets. 4) Worse, you're blaming chain casting mages for all of your hardships. 5) You're saying that chain casting mages are nazis that only want improvements to chaining. 6) You want slow and you think it helps chain casters equally to non chain casters.<br>
<br>
1) Get over it and roll with the punches.<br>
2) Get over it and roll with the punches.<br>
3) Please stop that.<br>
4) Please stop that. These parties deserve no blame for anything, any more than any other party.<br>
5) The burnout spell suggested in the original post on this thread helps both chain casters and agro kiters(who may mess up and have to run ahead 6 seconds and make a new pet.)<br>
6) Slow, on the other hand, would only help you &amp; your style of play, you greedy little hypocrit. You obviously either know almost nothing about being a mage or are trying to trick casual readers who fit that description. Your statement that slow helps chainers and nonchainers equally is FALSE. Don't know why? Here's a hint... a chain caster who casts slow is an agro kiting beastlord. If you can't figure it out, get a beastlord friend, have him cast slow on a mob, and then cast a new pet, /pet get lost-ing the old pet to make way for the new one. Watch what happens. <br>
<br>
In conclusion: You blame chaincasting mages for asking for upgrades only to chain casting mages and leaving the rest behind. This however, is not true, as the suggested burnout+ds helps 2 facets of solo, agro kite and chain cast. The only suggestion that you, the supposed objective mage crusading for the good of _all_ mages, could come up with: Slow. Slow would help agro kiters, and people who like to have 1 pet and have him tank. However, before any improvements are made, people who like to have 1 pet and have him tank is not a solo category for the magician. And, slow helps chainers less than burnout+ds helps people who like to have 1 pet aand have him tank, as slow has absolutely 0 impact on chaining.<br>
<br>
Therefore, where burnout+ds covers 2/2 solo categories, slow merely creates a new one, but the ratio is 2/3. I'm going to have to ask that, in future suggestions for improvements, that you should suggest suggestions which cover a full 100% of mages instead of creating new categories. Please think of all mages instead of just spreading us thinner, thx.<br>
<br>
ps. mages are not the only class who solo much differently at low levels than high levels. In fact, very few casting classes, if any, solo the same way 1-50 as 50-60 as 60-65. Please stop saying that mages have to change when everyone else keeps their same strats. It simply isn't true. <p>Happy trails.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krilenspiritlink>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 571<br> <font color=#333333>(12/4/02 7:36:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=22>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Supplement to Chain Casting - New spell</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Also, no disrepect to BL/Necros, Im glad because of your upgrades...Im pointing out a fact that we all can chain.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Misleading argument. We can all chain, but mages are superior.<br>
<br>
Beastlord pets are inferior. Slow and chain casting pets do not work well together. Beastlords do not get Quick Summoning.<br>
<br>
Necro pets have ridiculous mana costs, and so do their pet haste buffs. Necro pets also take a peridot. Where a malachite is no big deal at all, a peridot is a huge deal if you're chaining pets.<br>
<br>
At first you argued that chainers were equal but only asking for upgrades that help us, then you said mages should not chain at all because it's not what we did at low levels, now you're argueing that mages should not chain cast pets because we get muzzle of mardu and beastlords can do the same thing. Inconsistent!<br>
<br>
I want to believe everything you say but your inconsistency suggests to me that you just hate chain casting pets and want to remove it from the face of the earth.<br>

<br>
Krilen, please note:  that any person can take a sentence and derive at a different conclusion then maybe 5 other people who read the same thing.<br>
<br>
Clearly speaking, I am not against chaincasting.  I have to do it myself from time to time.  Yes i know about Mages being able to suspend pets now also.  But still, at the rate POP mobs tear through our pets when we are not in a group is rediculous.  Also, please note Noonie's parses which puts the Beastlords warder's damage very close to ours...but the thing is,,,there's can tank better.  Our pets are more situational. <br>
<br>
Now as I recall Verant one argument for not giving us root or anything like that was because our pets kept harm from us.  Well, our pets still kind of do that, but with mobs hitting for 300+, and our pets dying in 8-10 seconds what is the reasoning for no root/slow?  Or how about a pet that can tank a little better?  Or how about a pet with more hitpoints.<br>
<br>
Hell, I dont even care about root/slow.  I would rather see pets with either abilities to tank better or more hitpoints.  Give us POP abilities that could summon better pets.  Hell, even Necros now can bring forth dead enemies,,,which means pets that hit for 300+ (even only for limited time).<br>
<br>
For some reason we are stuck on DS/Pets/Nukes.  How about a AA ability that would combine attributes of 2 pets?  When I say work on something that can benefit all Magicians, it is stuff like that.  Im not against chaincasting at all.  But I believe our pets should be able to tank for a little before we have to summon another one.  That is why I would rather see something that will improve our pets.<br>

News to me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, our pets can tank for a little while before we have to summon a new one. I don't straight chain cast anymore. I usually throw burnout, and DS on my pet, and then heal it, until my pet enrages despite chain healing, THEN I cast a new one.<br>

If the pet does not last 20sec,,,then what is the point.  Before Verant excuse was Magicians didnt get root/snare/slow or anything because pets where good enough at tanking and kept mobs off of Magicians.  Well that is not a good enough excuse anymore.  So, since we know the VI stated that, why cant we get pets hitpoints upgraded...or damage mitigation?<br>
<br>
BTW, dont get me wrong,,,at least the person who started this thread is trying to think of ways to improve our class.<br>

So i see 2 solutions to this problem:<br>
<br>
1) improve pets mitigation (and stop with the summoned items, im sick of having to summon 2356362 items per pet)<br>
<br>
2) improve pet heals either by making them heal more per cast, or reduce casting and RECAST time. If lev64 heal had like 3secs casting time and 1 sec recast, that would do the trick. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krilenspiritlink>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 583<br> <font color=#333333>(12/9/02 8:31:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=408.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: A Supplement to Chain Casting - New spell  </span><hr size=1> Our pets last more than 8 seconds.
