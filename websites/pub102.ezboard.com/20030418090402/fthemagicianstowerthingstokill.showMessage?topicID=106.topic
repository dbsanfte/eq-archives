I'll give you a few pointers as I can.<br>
<br>
1. At 18 you may be a little too young to tackle them. They will easily charm you, and you'll find yourself dying to your pet a lot. I'd wait until 21, I believe that's when you get your new nukes, plus you're big enough to resist the charms.<br>
<br>
2. If you're in a group, the charming situation is worse, because you'll be killed by your groupmates. Or, more often, you'll be KILLING your groupmates. A charmed magician is a terrible thing to behold.<br>
<br>
3. If you or your pet are charmed, and the evil eye is killed before the charm wears off, then the pet will go renegade. This means it will attack anybody that comes near it. If you've got a mean streak in you, train it to the Runnyeye entrance, but don't do this if you can help it. It's heartbreaking to see some poor shmoe zone from Runnyeye with a sliver of life, only to be put down by an angry elemental on the other side. (Heh, thanks to the scryer I had a renegade 34 fire pet running around Upper Guk the other day. Man, you should've heard some of the /oocs)<br>
<br>
4. The best way to deal with the eye seems to be to Bolt the eyeball while you put your pet on his pet. For best effect, attack before the eyeball has a pet. The eye will attack you, so be prepared for some DD pain and charm attempts. Two bolts will put most eyeballs down. More for the Lords.<br>
<br>
5. If the big one spawns in the middle (Lord Soptyver) you're done. Unless there's a high level there to clear him for you, he will aggro if you pull either eyeball.<br>
<br>
6. Roamers abound in the eyeball pit, watch out for them. Plus, the pathing is downright terrible. You will just have to go and learn from experience.<br>

<br>
Once, charmed by an evil eye in Beholder Gorge and my pet dead, I stayed charmed for over 5 minutes. I couldn't believe how well that charm stuck. I followed the eyeball all around Beholder like a puppy dog. Every mob we met, the eye would Quickness them, then I would fire shield them, then we'd move on. It was hilarious.<br>
<br>
Another time, in another life, I was a paladin trying to fight a Tae Ew something or other that charmed in CT. He was surrounded by a mob of green things, some of which would heal him. Three times during the fight he stuck a charm to me, and while I was charmed the lizards would heal me back to full. Then the charm broke and I'd go back to fighting the Tae thingy. I was able to win the fight only because of those lizards healing me up.<br>
<br>
Being charmed can be scary, but sometimes it can be entertaining, too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><p><font face="Arial" COLOR="blue" size="2"><b>Nefarius Frobozz</b><br>Devout Agnostic Gnome Magician of the 39th Trial<i><br>Terris-Thule<br></i></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unabienincinerador.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nabien Incinerador</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.geocities.com/nabieneq/fire10.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 186<br> <font color=#333333>(11/27/00 7:19:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=106.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/nabieneq/explose3.gif WIDTH=96 HEIGHT=156></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Advice requested on Evil Eyes</span><hr size=1> I was in solB the other day going to help break the SS room and while we were still forming the group at the zone I saw the noble cast.

I felt pretty embarassed telling my guild how I died...<br>
<br>
For Eyes I would wait until level 20 when you get your bolt.  You don't want your pet going up to the eye as it will just charm it and your as good as dead.  Instead what I would do is summon an air pet, and park it a bit from me.  Pull with a bolt, and keep chaining that.  Everytime the eye casts on you cast /pet back off.  This way the pet will kill all the annoying greenies that get on you (eyes pet, minos, goblins, muddites) while having the bonus of a stun once in awhile. <p><img src=http://www.geocities.com/nabieneq/Sig1test.jpg> <BR>

Wizzie EEs in Runneye should be dealt with totally as would would a Wizard.<br>
<br>
1) mem your best bolt, DD, and ward summons spell.<br>
<br>
2) Buff yourself up, and do not summon a pet*<br>
<br>
3) Stand way back, and let bolts fly at the eye.<br>
<br>
4) If eye lives, cast your DD on the eye.  You may get interrupted by eye's pet or eye, keep at it to it dies.<br>
<br>
5) When eye dies, kill off the pet with your Ward summons line. **<br>
<br>
*You can choose to have a pet, but park him a ways off.  Only run to him for help if you are really in trouble.  If the eye charms your pet, you are as good as dead.  Without a pet, and you get charmed, you will be totally safe and ye can heal up via the Phantom Armor regen that you buffed yourself with before the battle.<br>
<br>
** Running to your parked pet after EE is dead and letting it deal with the EE's pet is more mana efficent then trying to nuke it down with Ward spells.<br>

<br>
For EK it's a piece of cake (well assuming the stupid things spawn I'll touch on this later).<br>
<br>
Wait 'til 20 because you need Bolt of Flame for it's awesome range.<br>
<br>
Mem Fire Bolt, and 16th lvl Shock of Flame and 8th lvl Shock of Swords. Cast pet and buff yourself and dont worry about buffing the pet, he's backup <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Follow the eye and get his path down. Park the pet back a bit from where you plan to launch your attack (he's a backup remember). You want to attack from the very limit of the bolt's range (practice this somewhere to get a good feel for it).<br>
<br>
From max range, Face away from the evil eye (directly the opposit direction) and fire a bolt. As soon as you recycle fire a second bolt. Right near the end of the second recycle you're first bolt hits (after going in a big circle). Here's where you can decide for yourself... you do not need the full damage from a third Bolt to finish off most eyes (unless one got resisted, or a tree or something elsegot in the way) so I usually finished with the 16th lvl DD and saved my 35 mana <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After all this carnage you have a few possile outcomes:<br>
<br>
1. Dead eye and a very angry evil eye pet on you. Easy fix, run to your pet who will eat it for lunch. These pets are so weak you can nuke them down yourself if the Eye fight went as planed.<br>
<br>
(This happened for me about 60-70% of the time after I got used to looking for a good open area for the bolts to circle in)<br>
<br>
2. Eye very near dead, but still far away wasting it's mana debuffing you with it's wonderful enchanter debuffs. This is why I learned to keep the wimpy lvl 8 shock of blades memed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  2.1 casting time leaves a very good chance (even with it's pet beating on you) you can finish the eye before he gets close enough to you to start casting his wierd pushes you back damage spell.<br>
<br>
(This happened about 20% of the time)<br>
<br>
3. Eye nearly half dead. For some reason or another one bolt missed but one connected (I think the eye's pet caused this the most). Terrain (dang trees!), it's pet, a wandering bandit, you name it. The more practice you get, the less this one happens and I'll tell you later the best places to attack the eye on it's route. All you can do here is pound away on the shock of flame spell key and pray your channeling is high enough. You can also try running/backing towards your pet for help, but if the pet jumps the eye, it WILL get charmed 3 out of 4 fights. If you can get your pet on the eye's pet you might have a chance, but again once the eye gets close YOU will get charmed 3 out of 4 times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
(Early in my eye fighting days this happened maybe 20% of the times. More recently it's down to 10% or less.)<br>
<br>
Now, general things to deal with in EK.<br>
<br>
ALL THE FREAKING CATS AND DOGS!<br>
<br>
Gorge Hounds, and Lions, and Dark Stalkers (oh my!) will make your day a living hell at level 20 as they will all agro on you when you least need it. That alone is enough reason for me to advise against the eyes at 20th. Last I fought here I believe I was 28th and some puppies STILL argoed on my pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
If you know the zone, the best place to ambush the eye is when it has just passed where the bandits camp. Seems the puppies are the least crowded out there. Jumping it by the Gorge is a bad idea (since the GORGE hounds hang out there). And on the mountain is also a bad time for your bolts, and there is sometimes a Cyclopse on that mountain (big time ACK!!!!).<br>
<br>
My honest advice? Don't come to EK for the eyes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Come to EK for Crag spiders. They take longer to kill, but are STUPID and they DONT CHARM you or your pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Come back around lvl 28 and own the stupid eyes and get the nice braclets and optic nerves <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  OR... do like I do now: When ya pass through ask if the eyes are up. The people hunting puppies and kitties and spiders (oh my!) are usually glad to have the eyes removed <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Funny since they (big crowds killing everything in the zone) cause the eyes (and other nasties) to spawn more often.<br>
<br>
Ok, Finaly, that's all I have to offer on evil eyes in EK.<br>
<br>
For the record, I think I am something like 32-6 vs the evil eyes in EK. After a rough start at like 2-4 I almost never die vs. them now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  In all those kills the drops have been something like this:<br>
<br>
nothing (or misc. crap loot) more than half of the time<br>
evil eye stalk (looks like a poison sack) maybe 5 or 6 times<br>
a bundle of optic nerves (used for crafted bracers quest) 3 times<br>
polished bone braclet (+3 Int, +3 Wis sell for 100-150pp) 3 times<br>
<br>
From what I have heard, from people that have camped in the Gorge, more stuff drops there than these outcasts in EK. Funny cause these outcasts are obviously a little harder to kill. I have never had one die from two bolts and have heard many say the ones inside can sometimes be killed by two bolts.<br>
<br>
Can anyone who has fought in the Gorge verify that the eyes there drop more or less loot?<br>
<br>
Well, this post has worn me out, but I hope it can help someone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I have to admit, from my old D+D days I still have a special place in my heart for killing these things <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Can anyone who has fought in the Gorge verify that the eyes there drop more or less loot?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Well, loot seems exactly the same.  Gorge EEs are the same as the EK ones in power, unless it is one of the named ones like Lord Svril (there are several named EEs in the Gorge, the only big boss is Xorbb, whom I have never fought).  The named ones are a few levels higher in strength, not much tougher.<br>
<br>
As for bolts:  If you are using the level 20 bolt, you will need to use about 2 or 3 (or an extra DD) to kill regular EEs.  If its Cinder Bolt, regular EEs will often die to one shot of that, sometimes you need to mem a small DD to finish them.  The named ones (cept Xorbb) will die to two Cinder Bolts, or one Cinder Bolt and a Blaze.  <br>
<br>
I estimate the regular unnamed EEs have about 300 to 350 health.  Named ones probably range from 325 to 450.  Excellent loot for the level you can begin to hunt them (low twenties).<br>
<br>
(Runnyeye EEs are much tougher, and they are Wizzies that nuke hard.  They don't have pets, but they hardly need them.  Besides there are always goblins around that are perfectly willing to act like pets for them!  I would say these are pretty safe to tackle in the low to mid 30s, except Borxx, who will mess you up if you do not know how to handle an NPC wizzie that can *proc* Force shock and have high hit points (and cast).  &quot;Borxx blinks twice...&quot; BAM! and watch that heath drop!).  Not that Borxx is tough, you just have to be prepared and have the right kind of group to kill her.   Need some bashers, a healer, and a mage w/Air pet is always nice.  Tell those warriors to put away the 2Hander and get out a shield (unless dey be one uh da bashers!).  If you are 40+, then solo her if you dare <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Runnyeye EEs will also drop PBBs, nerves, as well as the Runes for the Crafted Paldrons quest.  Borxx drops a lens for the Staff of the Observers quest. <p><b>Seek Pyremaker</b><br>
