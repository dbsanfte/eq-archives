Most of it boils down to it being the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   only</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> healing spell of that magnitude.<br>
<br>
The real mistake in implementing CH was the shortsightedness of the designers.  They put it at 39 because at release that was the end game.  It only went to 50, and the jump from 39 to 49 was large, but nothing like the jump from 50 to 60.<br>
<br>
Add in those extra 10 levels, and enough uber items for Melee to make a Billy Goat Puke, and you have a real unbalance for the classes that are stuck with the clerics <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   level 24</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> heal till the early 50's, then the <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   level 34</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> spell as their ultimate healing spell.  They just plain cant keep up.  It costs a Druid or Shaman a substancial piece of mana bar for something a cleric can do with one spell.  I don't believe I can stress this enough.  Level 51 heal for Shaman and Druid = level 34 cleric spell.  That might be acceptable for a Paladin, but not a class that's supposed to be the primary healer for it's group.<br>
<br>
Seriously, look at items Pre-ROK for melee.  The Uber Warrior armor was Crafted or RUBICITE!  People actually worked hard for Bronze!  Banded was more than just Twink armor, but a serious investment for the early 20's Melee.  Then came Planar Armor. CH didn't make too much of a splash, cause it wasn't really mana efficient to use, except in downtime or really big encounters.<br>
<br>
Foward to Trak and VS kills.  Now we are talking unheard of AC on armor, not to mention many of the spells a Melee might want.  HP items become more common, as do a few Haste items.  Weapons with unheard of Delay-- the previous best was a Yak, as even Naggy and Vox drops were not much better.  Casters are no longer needed for damage, because with a little more time, Melee can output the same thing, and not have to Med.  Clerics need only Med for ONE LEVEL 39 SPELL.  Chanters are needed because Crowd Control is King.  Warriors are getting amount more HP unbuffed that they used to get from having every buff in the game stacked on them, and a ton more AC to go with it.<br>
<br>
Where is your Shaman and Druid during all this?  Fizzleing whole bars of mana, trying desperatly to get off the 34 cleric heal spell in their Mid 50's.  They plain can't cut the mustard.  As a Favor later on, after Vellious in fact I believe, they moved Sup Heal down to 51 from 54 or 55 where it was.  yippee, at least it don't fizzle a much.  At this point, the best a Shaman or Druid can offer is Regen, and the same heal spell that clerics are using as patch heals for casters- cause that's all its good for.  At least shaman had slow, as the value of that little spell became more apparent with hard hitting, longer lived mobs.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't want to talk about Vellious.<br>
<br>
<br>
But, there is the reason CH is overpowered.  Because it turns the other 2 healing classes into 2nd and 3rd class citizens.  So much so that for a while, others laughed when Clerics or Shaman claimed to be healers at all.  CH is as overpowered as if Wizards could launch a 10k Nuke with very little danger of aggro, for a healthy mana cost, at level 39.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But... They don't have to completly do away with CH.  They just need to make it not available 100% of the time.  If they made it have a long recast like the Divine Aura spells, used only in emergencies, that would be fine.  Maybe do 2, so that they can me memmed at the same time, with the higher level one having a Short but Very intense Heal over Time Effect, for use on Uber Mobs.<br>
<br>
Then they follow that change up with completing the Healing line of spells, extending it beyond level 34 for clerics.  Give all 3 healing classes appropriate upgrades every 10 levels, just like the first half of the game.  Maybe allow a normal CH at level 60, where it should have been in the first place.  Clerics should be the best at healing, but not to the exclusion of all others.  <br>
<br>
There is no other role so complely owned by any other class. Mage Pets VS. Necro Pets.  Shaman Slows VS. Chanter, Bard, and now Necro Slows.  Chanter Haste vs. Shaman and Bard, Wizard Nukage vs. Mage Nukage, Mage DS vs Druid DS, Etc, Etc, Etc.  There is no other role that someone doesn't do at least well enough to GET BY.  That's the problem.  You can't GET BY with a Druid or Shammy on heals in the end encounters.<br>

<br>
You post is very good but I think you really miss why Verant does the things they do. Druids are to offensively geared now to see any drastic improvements in there healing ability. I do think they should be better at healing but not in the current form the druid class is in. They have far to much offense to be remotely close in healing compared to the cleric that has little.<br>
<br>
In your post you state how no druid/shaman can heal a group in endgame encounters so you must have a cleric. Well this is true to a large degree but look at topor, group regen, and 75% slow. Should a shaman be remotely close to a cleric in healing power given there offensive and defensive ability? I have to say no.<br>
<br>
Verant stated many times during the last class balancing over a year ago that druids and shamans are not meant to replace clerics, but a shaman and druid combined in a &quot;normal experience encounter&quot; should be able to keep things going fine in a group. Well a large portion of the game is normal exp'ing and in that area druid+shaman is greater then clerics at the post 51 lvls.  I don't think everyone has to be great in all areas of the game. I remember feeling very crappy in sol b pre-lvl 44. I also remember how much it sucked at lvl 56 not to have a magic based nuke higher then my lvl 44 spell. <br>
<br>
There are alot of areas of the game where everyone is just not going to be as affective as they would be under other conditions. IMO druids are damage dealers first and healers secondary. Look at the druids spell list, most of there spells are of a offensive or defensive nature. Shaman are buffers first and debuffers second and healing third.  It is to late to change CH now because not only have encounters been balanced around it but also the healing classes have been balanced around it. Complete heal has made it possible for druids to have nukes like Moonfire and for shaman to have 75% slow, topor, insane poison dots and Can4. Those classes have far more versatility then clerics. They have been geared away from healing and do other things far better. The cleric is only good at one thing and that is healing. Do to mob and weapon inflation clerics are sad against undead now. No one gets a cleric in a undead zone to be a offensive force like they did in the old days pre-kunark.<br>
<br>
Complete heal is overpowered and the other two healing classes in the game can't compete with that spell....BUT...those classes have things that make them viable at end game encounters. You need backup healers, slowers, debuffers, damage dealers in the endgame. Druids can be healer, debuffer, or damage dealer, and shamans can be slowers and debuffers but clerics can only be one thing really and there lies the balance no matter how screwed up it might be.<br>

<br>
1) just completely and totally remove it from the game, and then readjust the environment and players equipment to scale with the change. <br>
this means: <br>
-no more gazillion hp mobs<br>
-no more 900 quadding mobs<br>
-a decrease in melee ac<br>
-scaling down of manaburn (manaburn in its current form cannot exist in a world where the uberist mob has 40k hp)<br>
-shaman would become the preferred healer class for xp groups unless changes were made to the cleric class.<br>
-clerics would either have to be given slightly sub-enchanter slows, or some form of damage which is above shaman and below druidic in power, so as not to underpower them.<br>
-since druids would again be viable healers, druids offensive power would be scaled down to the same level it was pre kunark<br>
-casters would be way, way more desirable. a decrease in healing power means more downtime, which makes caster damage as attractive as melee damage.<br>
-melees would remain as attractive as they are now<br>
-mage pets would again be suitable tanks. post 50 soloing would be much easier. (since mage pets are already underpowered in tanking ability i see no reason to scale down mage pets the same way melee ac would be)<br>
<br>
basically what i prepose brings back all the great things about pre kunark (casters being efficient, druids and shaman being competitive healers with clerics again), but without the downsides (melee not being good). <br>
<br>
sure it sounds like uber mobs would be alot weaker, but they would be <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   equally as difficult for players</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> since ch no longer exists. remember, all that matters in establishing pvp balance is what one classes spell/swing/nuke/buff looks like in potency compaired to another classes. all that matters in pve balance is how difficult the environment is for the players. the numbers and data <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   themselves</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are meaningless, its how the numbers <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   relate</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to each other which matters.<br>
<br>
------<br>
2) nerf it badly. move it to a level 60 spell which costs 1000 mana to use. i would also give it a 3 second cast time with a 60 second recast delay. i would cap ch at 3000 hp. and again, i would also scale down environmental challenges to account for the lack of, or lessening of complete heal. <br>
although, these &quot;changes&quot; arent preferred, since it would <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   feel</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> like a huge nerf. plan #1 is much more desirable since it wouldnt sting as much. down side is #2 is more difficult to implement.<br>
<br>
as long as complete heal is in the game, and it remains so efficient to use, there can never be balance.<br>
<br>
edit: i dont think my nerf nerfed ch enough, honestly, so im changing it a little. 30 seconds is still not long enough to be balanced. 1 minute is. i also decreased its cast time giving clerics have a reason to keep it memmed, so the spell doesnt become &quot;complete&quot;ly useless (hehe). i also would cap ch at 3k hp. not quite a complete heal, but pretty close. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unoonievioletskies.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NoonieVioletskies</A> at: 5/14/02 7:18:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wezloc>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 691<br> <font color=#333333>(5/14/02 7:07:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ch is so overpowered.</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;as long as complete heal is in the game, and it remains so efficient to use, there can never be balance. <br>

<br>
I disagree with this assesment.  Clerics have the best AC/HP buffs in the game, meaning they have superior buffs---Buffer, secondary roll.  Also, they too have decent Nukes, though perhaps not as good as druids.  Let's not forget the vital roll that Rez plays throught the game-- at least as comparable a utility to Teleports.<br>
<br>
The point is, NO ONE should dominate a roll to the exclusion of all others, unless party's start allowing 15 slots so you can have one of each.  CH does this for clerics.<br>
<br>
The situation regarding xp groups prefering shaman over clerics as healers is a little more recent.  I also it comes of increasingly cowardly players.  No longer to people seek out yellow mobs to kill for xp, but blue, nearly light blue mobs where little healing is needed given the level gap and vastly superior gear of melee's.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't recomend that shaman and druids become equal to clerics in healing power.  I suggest that the gap be narrowed to what is was before level 39--5 level stagger on healing spells.  Then, with CH being made an emergency spell like DA, their Heal over time series, and their bonus to strait healing spells, they still retain superiority.  If there is a lack in class ability at this point, beef up the secondary skill of Nuker, and add a minor utility roll to them of some kind- perhaps share Undead Slows with Necromancers. <p><img src=http://personal.atl.bellsouth.net/atl/d/a/dastorys/Pictures/Necsig.jpg>

Weapons are so powerfull because of CH. It is plain not true. <br>
<br>
I think there are ways to balance the game even with CH existing. Maybe CH does not bring enough agro. Mobs should become really mad at clerics after CHs. Maybe a cleric should not be able to CH twice in less than one minute. Maybe this game needs mobs that have a so nasty AE that it would kill everybody in a large radius in, say 1 minute. Then you would have to kill this mob under 1 minute or the raid would fail. <br>
<br>
Weapons are so powerfull because, mobs have so many HP. Why do mobs have so many HP, because mobs have to become harder and harder, when you have defeated a mob, you need a new challenge, a mob that hits harder, and has more HP. The reward must be inline with the challenge, better than the one you had by defeated your first mob. So you end up with mobs HP inflating, and weapon damage inflating.<br>
<br>
The pattern is : Defeat mob M0, have Weapon W0 that is better that all that you had before. When you have killed enough time the mob M0, you begin to lurk Mob M1 that is harder that M0. Of course you would be really desapointed if weapon W1 dropped by M1 was the same class as W0 so W1 will be generally better than W0.<br>
<br>
There is no problem in weapon inflation, it is in the logic of the game. The real problem, is people at Verant seem to be superstitious. They are not afraid of raising the strengths of mellees (weapons and ac) however, they begin to shout in panic when you talk about increasing the strengh of casters.<br>
<br>
The real problem is not CH, it is the lack of Vision from verant that wants all the encounters be the same and make this game kind of stupid. 1 main tank, CH rotation is the problem, then find the way to disable CH rotation, and tune the HP of the mob according to it.<br>

<br>
That's easy.  Just make CH add a buff icon (like Donal's BP) so it can't be cast on you for a period of time.<br>
<br>
The real problem is VI can't do this because of the time it would take to retune Velious and Luclin (as well as some of Kunark) and the high end game would be completely broken for several months.<br>
<br>
Roll forward...  EQ2... I'm betting Complete Heal, CoH, rez sticks and other unbalancing content are somewhat better thought out.<br>

<br>
CH is not overpowererd.  If you want to disable the CH rotation, why not disable the ability to drop mod rods on the ground...how about a twitch rotation for casters?  This is a tool for high end encounters.  It takes forever to cast and the fact is that its the one spell that clerics have in battle that makes them critical on raids.  Why not take mez away from enchanters and change the game so that only one or two mobs would ever attack?  Why not make it so the whole game is soloable?  Because thats not the way it was designed.  The game design is not broken because of CH or because high end encounters are tough.  High end encounters SHOUD be tough.  It SHOULD be very tough to kill things in the highest dungoens.  It stands to reason that things that have been around for ages have grown extremely powerful and learned how to avoid magical damage.<br>

<br>
oh and another thing,<br>
i hate the word nerf. its a stupid, ridiculous word. eq is a scale, and human players attatch emotion to changes made in the balance of the scale, and changes which for some reason they dont like they call &quot;nerfs&quot;. <br>
<br>
the whole concept of a change strictly being bad, i.e. a nerf, is ridiculous because every single balance change that was EVER made is both positive and negative.<br>
for example, mage pets get upgraded.<br>
positive of this change is that mages become relatively more powerful compaired to other offensive classes.<br>
negative is that every other offensive class relatively got weaker, even if they are stronger still.<br>
<br>
players only recognize the aggressive part of a balance change, the part that is openly told to you (ATTENTION, MAGE PETS NOW ARE RELATIVELY STRONGER). which ever aspect of the change (positive or negative) is readily apparent is the deciding factor in whether or not the players label it an &quot;upgrade&quot; or a &quot;nerf&quot;.<br>
<br>
im rambling. i just wanted to say that people are too human and they get blinded by emotions. think about balance as a scale, where the goal is to make all classes equally desireable, and i think it will all be more clear. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=33330" target="new"><b>Noonie Violetskies</b>, 58 High Elven Conjurer</a> <br><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=61427" target="new"><b>Aylliah Ravenlure</b>, 45 Erudite Enchantress<br></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uwalk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Walk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 341<br> <font color=#333333>(5/14/02 8:29:10 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=32>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: CH overpowered?</span><hr size=1> CH isn't so much the problem as tanks with 6000+ hp and mobs that hit for 1000's<br>

Also as far as dominating a area of specialization post 55, maybe you should look at the enchanter class.

<br>
As for CH, the point isn't that it's required, yes it is required.  But if it didn't exist, mobs/encounters would be tuned differently so it wasn't needed obviously.  Clerics have a lot of other nice heals too btw, and don't forget rez..  Even w/o CH clerics would be a viable class.  The problem is that CH, and the fact that mobs are tuned for CH, makes clerics *required*.  I'm sorry but in a game with 13 unique classes, no one should required for 90% of the content..<br>
<br>
Anyway, fun discussion, but nothing can or will really be done about it..  At least with EQ1...<br>

Now I can see some of you asking yourselves if I've finally lost it or am I just trying to pull a fast one on you but really, it's true. <br>
<br>
Do you know how many times I have been in Fungus Grove or Maiden's Eye or (insert zone here) looking for a group for some experience? *End of woe is me segment* I can't solo. And when I do the downtime is a nightmare. We weren't meant to solo. Neither were warriors and the like but they manage just fine with their spells (thanks armor clicks) and equipment. <br>
<br>
I see all of you calling out for a nerf of the all too powerful Complete Heal. It isn't going to happen this round of EQ folks. Maybe in EQ2, but it's a tad bit late for that in the original EQ. You would have to redo all of EACH EXPANSION because every single one has been disigned with this in mind as well as tactics that include this spell. Is it overpowered? Inherently no. <br>
<br>
You need the warrior to DEFENSIVE on an_uber_mob_025. You need someone to Mala/Malo/etc the mobs so that the nukers have an easier time. Get my point?<br>
<br>
The Cleric has little to fall back on and has shared a lot of its secondary responsibilities and roles to other classes. The one thing that they excell at and really shine with is ... yup, you guessed it, HEALING. Why? Because that's their primary role and basically the only one that they have to hold onto that niche. Each class has a niche. Each has a role. Accept it and move on.  <p><table border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=1 align=center width=80%>

CH is not the reason why mobs HP are growing and weapons are being better. The reason is players want new challenges and new equipment as well as new contents. There are a lot of people that are really happy with their upgrade. I think casters have the short end of the stick, and that is why they are against this evolution.<br>
<br>
There is however a real problem with this game, you always need alot of clerics in a guild, but you can do with 1 or 2 magicians or necros. That is not good, that will kill the game. Either there are too many classes in this game and not enough space for the role of each class. Maybe 3 priest class, 4 caster, and several mellee is too many. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/urekcim.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rekcim</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(5/15/02 6:48:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=206.topic&index=39>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: CH overpowered?</span><hr size=1> CH also made it so that only Warriors can efficently tank.  <br>

Btw I solo just fine with very little downtime.  Mages are supposed to be solo'ers... one of the few that was equipped for the job originally...  of course now that warriors and rogues can buff and heal, and outdamage a nuker on full burn...  But originally mages were among the top solo classes, second only to maybe druids before the kite nerf, or necros..<br>
