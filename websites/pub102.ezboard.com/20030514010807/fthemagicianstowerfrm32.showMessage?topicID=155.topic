In another thread, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wezloc</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> gave a useful categorization of the stages of life for magicians for the first fifty levels:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I think the pre-50 list can be broken down but it goes so fast that it really isnt a big deal. But I will try anyway...<br>
<br>
1-3 mage very weak but isnt everyone? =)<br>
<br>
4-24 mage is very strong getting nukes that rival wizard nukes and pets that are on par with old world experience mobs of the same lvl.<br>
<br>
24-34 is very weak time for the mage. Most mages I have spoken to mark this as one of the most difficult stages for the mage. Pets really dont improve all that much and our nukes are way to weak by the time we reach lvl 28 to 29.<br>
<br>
34-44 this is a good time for the mage. DD power takes a giant leap forward and at lvl 39 pets get regen and the lvl 44 pet quads.<br>
<br>
44-50 This is the stage where mages become uber gods for there lvl. lvl 49 pets are awesome and when you combine that with the lvl 44 shock and lava bolt there is no other offensive class as powerful at this stage of the game. (wishes these days would come back /sigh)<br>
<br>
Wezloc<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I really have two questions.  Is this a fair categorization?  Seems like it to me, but then I have spent so much time post-50, I am loathe to try to speak with authority on behalf of younger mages.<br>
<br>
Second, what <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>are</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> the class balance issues that effect magicians pre-50 and at what levels are they felt?  Are there specific problems for pre-50 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> that are missed by discussions dominated by post-50 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->?

The 34 pets didn't seem to last very long, and couldn't out taunt that the aggro the new nukes dished it. I remember hating those levels where pets either took forever to regen if they lived, or I took forever to med because I nuked too hard trying to save my pet. This is also the period where you go from yellows being doable, to high blues eating you alive.<br>
<br>
Then again my mage was my first character to experience those levels so perhaps I didn't know where to hunt effectively. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=eriol>Eriol</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(4/1/02 12:21:39 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  He's Completely Right from what I know</span><hr size=1> I was powerful from lvl 4-24.  And the period from lvl 24-34 is hell.  I have basically been sucking exp from any group i've been in.  Magicians just don't help much in the group because our nukes are so weak.  Just the other day a lvl 29 Enchanter was out-nuking me!  By a lot!  His were 280+, and my best one WITH focus was 211!  I know I am just sucking off exp until i hit lvl 34, where my nukes get good again.<br>
<br>
I honestly can't comment on higher lvls, only being lvl 32 right now, but soloing good exp mobs is also almost impossible at these lvls.  There are good places, but they are usually not safe either.  And yellows?  Good luck finding any to solo relatively safely.<br>
<br>
The core of the problem is that magicians do NOT get a significant damage upgrade at lvl 24.  The lvl 20 bolt does almost as much dmg as the lvl 24 DD, and we don't get another DD or bolt until lvl 34, at which time we get both.  So we basically spend almost half of our lives, and more than half of our time 20-34, with about the same dmg nuke!  If I had to fix it, I would move our lvl 34 DD DOWN to lvl 29, and keep the bolt at lvl 34.  Then we get incremental dmg increases through the lvls.<br>

<br>
I tried to remember back to the key events when I was a younger <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and here is what stood out for me.  Early on, my pet was more powerful than me, and gained enormously by being handed a rusty two handed weapon.  Even when they stopped being yellow or even, they were still better than the mobs I faced.  And I could melee well enough.<br>
<br>
I'd say this period ended around 20th or so.<br>
<br>
I remember <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>really</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> feeling the weakness of my pets just before the next spell circle for some time, maybe until 39th.<br>
<br>
From 39th to 50th, life was good.  All I had to do was find a camp with blues that no one was using, learn to pull and avoid adds, and I was set.  And I was good at that too.  I would poke my head into underpopulated zones, look for odd corners or static spawns, and master them.<br>
<br>
That is when I started training my friends to respect the awesome power that is a <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Once I mastered the camp, I would invite others, especially those lower level than me in the guild that were having trouble grouping with the big guys, and show them my camp, and start pulling.  It rocked.<br>
<br>
I don't remember ever being unsatisfied with my nukes, just my middle-level, end-of-circle pets, as I said.  I also remember being disappointed that I could not make more money selling summoned items, not even bandages.<br>
<br>
Based on what I remember then, I conclude that pets might need a boost from something like 20th or 24th up to 34th or so, in order that they do not peter out as the next spell circle approaches.<br>
<br>
Based on what others have written here, some adjustments of nukes might be plausible, keeping in mind that I have also heard <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> complain that our nukes are sometimes too close or even better than theirs at low levels.  But then improving <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Wizards</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> at those levels seems okay to me.<br>

A 4 month break during that and the fact that I spend alot of time just mucking around causing trouble and stirring my other guild members up <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  None the less I remember the hardest time I had as a mage was grinding from 34 - 44. At one point when I was level 42 a friend of mine in the guild literally dragged me through that level and 43. I would get bored of the soloing and go spend some time looking for a group to no avail. A higher mage in the guild more or less took me aside and just said &quot; stick it out until 44 and you'll see&quot; So I took his advice and stuck it out until then. Dinged 44 and took off with new pets to kill some more faction with Kaladim Citizen's ( as if I can get it any worse ). Only had the fire pet at the time and figured I might as well try it out. I barely got 2 nukes off. I was amazed because after all that time I actually felt powerful again and wasn't always on the verge of gating or clicking the sow potion and moving as fast as I can as far away as possible.  Now all I can do is just look forward to level 49 and the pets there but this time, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I've got them already and on level 48 ding I will be carrying them with me in a backpack at all times <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . <br>
<br>
As far as balancing and tweaking I would have to completely agree that from 24ish to 34, 39ish its a must. Maybe even to 44. I went through so many alt's because it was just so I guess frustrating during that level frame to play a mage. Not getting groups, just roaming around looking for that perfect camp to get that I could pull just one mob with Malise and stand back and toss a nuke and 2 heals on the pet. 42 days played time to level 46, my warrior alt has 3 days played at level 31. Kind of sickening I think <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Last thing is I have trolled these boards for months and months on end even when I took a break from EQ in general and have to see that even from the worst ( foci item nerf ) to the very best , ( seeing very constructive and thought out opinions ), this message board has to be one of the very greatest resources for the magician class as a whole.  I don't see how any proper magician can't come to these boards and the magecompendium and not walk away knowing at least one new thing or seeing another side to something.

What you did is commonly called <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> lurking</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->: reading the boards and not posting.  It is generally a very good idea to lurk for a while on a board to learn its tenor and limits before posting.<br>
<br>

<br>
One comment on your experience.  Sometimes its not knowing where to hunt.  That becomes tighter generally as you rise levels.  At first level, you can solo yellow giant rats and fire beetles, but as you rise, you wind up having to select creatures that are more and more less powerful than you.  For example, at 60th, I can only reliably solo things that are just barely blue to me.  If <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Planes of Power</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> adds another ten levels, then at some point I will likely be completely unable to solo for experience.<br>

Now that I have been just about everywhere and done just about everything. (Barring some of the very high end stuff that I'm working towards. I have hunted in ToV, but not NToV, etc.) My options seem quite a bit more limited. I've come to truly know the limitations of my class and my abilities. I can garauntee that I can't solo a white or yellow any longer like I used to be able to do every once in a while even in my 40s. <br>

As I look over the break down I see there were many LARGE gaps in power for the mage. Really the only true powerful lvls for the mage are lvls 44 to 50.  It really wasnt so easy to solo the entire portion of my pre-50 mage career and many times i sat frustrated and groupless while druids stole my spawns to add to there quad kite. errrr<br>
<br>
The lack of any mana regen and large gaps in DD upgrades coupled with extremely difficult research made the pre-50 lvls very crappy lol.  So I have to change my stance and say pre-50 magicians could really use some tweaking. Also if the argument is made that pets at lvl 49 are overpowered then is that because we are so weak through most of our career up until lvl 44? If this is the case then the powerful pets we have at those lvl balance due to the fact we have very weak pets and DD spells previous to that lvl.<br>

<br>
Overall I felt as if the magician was still powered appropriately for this stage of the game, but the problem comes in, is that plate wearing classes can get so much better armor and weapons than the game was designed to support at these early levels.  While Magicians really can't be twinked to through them out of balance.  <br>
<br>
With under 10K you could twink a warrior to the point that he can solo effectively 1 - 40 with no down time.  A level 10 warrior in full Rygor duel wielding Yaks only comment he would receive would be questions asking why he's using such an inferior weapon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=qaedainmagikot>Qaedain Magikot</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 602<br> <font color=#333333>(4/1/02 9:31:30 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=155.topic&index=16>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Magician class balance pre-51?</span><hr size=1> Having just come out of my pre-51 stage, this January (a little under one year, (February, 2001)), I believe I can offer some insight on how this went, as it is still fresh in my mind.<br>
<br>
First and foremost, it was easy...<br>
<br>
But this does not go without saying, that it is easy for many other classes, including but not limited to the pet classes.<br>
<br>
I did have a working knowledge of what mobs had the major hitpoints and which ones did not, as such I did not go to kunark until I was forced for decent EXP at the 30th level in the Overthere.<br>
<br>
I soloed much of my time, and much of it was without worry, but this was all in the Old World, where AC, HP, and Strength of mobs is lower compared to that of every other expansion continent.<br>
<br>
I had no problem getting groups when I needed to up and through my late 30s. However, as I came to the Dreadlands, it got increasingly more difficult, the further I went into my 40s, especially 48 and 49.<br>
<br>
50 is a difficult level, as you're too high for some spots, and not quite high enough for others...I duoed through 50 with another magician in the Dreadlands, and all has gone well since.<br>
<br>
I'm drawing very close to 54 by the end of this week. I have finally come into the recruitment of a very nice, very respectable guild on my server, and I hope dearly that I have put the right impression on them.<br>
<br>
<br>
However, in regards to balance...<br>
<br>
I believe a near-perfect equilibrium has been met at these lower levels if you comare myself, and any other class of a similar level and similar equipment.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, as I got into my twenties and stumbled upon this place by some chance (My memory slips as to how I got here)...I became more aware of the problems, and began to notice that quite a few of the melee types were benefitting heavily from gear, where I stayed relatively the same, punctuated equilibrium.<br>
<br>
As I escalated in levels, the rift between the 2 types in everquest grew larger, melees were accelerating rapidly, but likewise, I felt I stayed competitive.<br>
<br>
The 51+ game is where it does change, and refinement needs to be done...A fine balance does need to be sought for casters between gear and spell dependance.<br>
<br>
While the caster background of relying on powerful spells, many purchased, cannot be ignored. We find ourselves in an awkward position.<br>
<br>
A) If beneficial spells were dropped, in much the same manner as melee weapons...All with varying degrees of power, the rift my begin to close.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Example:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There is the purchased line of spells that we are all used to, however there is a PLETHORA of other spells that drop, with the same effects, but in varying degrees of casting speed and damage done (as well as other effects of course, such as amount of damage on a DS, and duration of that DS)...In much a similar fashion to the 1 hand slashing skill for melees. One hand slash is a universal skill, however hundreds of weapons are applied to it, and so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
B) Focus items are unavoidable, but they should be droppable, and some NOT droppable...In a much similar fashion to melees.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, the problem with the above suggestions is this...<br>
<br>
Melees weaponry drops like hotcakes, even very good ones, highly sought after weaponry...The highly sought after spells...Do not.<br>
<br>
This is where I believe the issue lies, there is only one denomination of a certain type of spell (such as, there is only one type of 54 water pet)...There is no varying degree of differentiation.<br>
<br>
Likewise, these highly sought after spells and focus items, would most likely be sold for insane prices...For instance, Kodiak's Endless Intellect, is being sold for 60k on Bertoxxulous, but I have counted 40 copies in 30 days of the spell, hardly rare...But melees (and this is the gospel truth, the price on this spell was first set by a melee on our server, and the majority of the sellers OF this spell are melees) continue to overestimate the value of spells, because as I said, there is only 1 type.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Recap:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
1. Focus items need to be (and are) being implemented as quested, no drop, and not no drop.<br>
<br>
2. Perhaps variations of identical spells need to be produce, varying in effectiveness and power (Much like a 1 hand slash weapon)<br>
<br>
3. Drop rates need to be increased yet again on rare spells, as they are frequently the most power...Verant seems hell-bent on keeping a bottleneck on powerful spells, only putting casters further behind melees who have a plethora of very good weaponry (melee spells), that drop regularly, or can be purchased.<br>
<br>
<br>
4. The major issue is the relative ease of acquiring a good weapon for melees, and the relative difficulty of acquiring a good spell for casters.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I've touched on several issues within this thread, and not all of them are quite on topic. But that's my analysis of the pre and post-51 game.<br>

Please keep in mind that i am only a level 30 mage so my knowledge may be very limited.<br>
I hope to suggest some ways in which i think the class can be made a little better (and a little more fun) to play.  Some of these suggestions may also contribute to the more general class balancing issues as a whole.<br>
<br>
1. Pet pathing - in some zones this problem has made me look like a half arsed wizard.  My suggestion - make pets path like the autofollow command makes PCs follow other PCs.  This would also have to make pets travel as fast as their<br>
masters regardless of speed buffs (should this even be a problem for air elementals?).  If they could make pets autofollow for the guardme and followme<br>
commands and make the following distance minimal (ie right behind you) then i think pathing problems would disappear.  The fundamental idea here is to make the following or guarding pet mirror every move you make but just one step<br>
behind like the way NPCs followed you in some of the old 8bit and SNES Nintendo games.<br>
<br>
2. Pet  power - I think for up to level 30 (the end of my expertice) the only thing that is needed is more damage output OR more HPs.  The only reason i say this is that i have seen my own abilities as a soloist degrade from soloing<br>
yellows fairly easily to worrying about some high blues.<br>
<br>
3. Malise Resists - is there any reason at all for the majority of mobs i face to be resisting a spell that targets resistances?  This spell is almost useless to me.<br>
<br>
4. Mana Regeneration - i dont think it would be too much to ask for an increase in mana regen rates for all PURE casters, after all they are supposed to be masters of magic are they not?  It really pains me to tell my group that i have to sit through the next pull because i need to med.  Or if im soloing im picking spots with 10 min. spawns to give me time to heal and med and recast buffs for<br>
pet and DS for myself.<br>
<br>
5. Pet zoning - this really ticks me off.  This game is supposed to be a fantasy world but the zones and zone boundaries exist from a programming limitation.  Why should pet classes be penalized for this?  Do warriors have to reequip all<br>
their weapons and armor from a backpack when they zone?  NO, so why should i lose one of my weapons simply because i chose to travel across vast areas (a central theme to the game i might add)?<br>
<br>
6.  Pet casting times - Mages are masters of elementals, or at least they should be due to their reliance on elementals.  So if mages are all about pets, why is it that these spells take the longest for us to cast?  Im not suggesting 1 second cast times like whats been proposed on the test server (although i<br>
wouldnt object, and that would all but take away the need for pet zoning) but something along the lines of casting times equivalent to those of same level DD spells.<br>
<br>
Just my feeble 2cp.<br>

I saw a level 4 in a Fungi and Lammies the other day?? That to me is just insane. Sure I'll pass off gear to an alt character to some extent but I try and limit it. <br>
<br>
Looking through listings of items for caster classes, it seems that the vast majority of them are designed for post 50 which I am not against post 50 having the ability to get some amazing equipment. Anyone who knows post 50 players and has ran around with them knows that this is when the game starts, and some would even argure, ( depending on their preference ), that the game doesn't start until 59-60. In alot of ways I totally agree with them because that is when casters get to obtain all this gear that they sit and drool over looking at Magelo profiles like Jaytee and other players who have the very high end of the gear. I know this has been on of the most frustrating things for me because the quality of equipment compared to melee pre 50 is seriously in bad shape unless you have the ability to twink the caster or your guild has a resource of it for you to borrow until you better equip yourself.<br>
<br>
Now by no means would I want the equipment that gives bonuses as high as 15 - 20 on all saves available to a level 20 character. Maybe more AC for lower level with a very slight increase in core stats such as INT/WIS SV's HP ? I doubt it would stem the flow of seeing a level 8 in the same robe I'm wearing which bites my arse but it would still be something to look into as far as balancing of the caster classes. From looking at alot of the threads of what caster classes should have done to them not one has really touched on equipment as a whole. The availability of melee gear is mind boggling compared to the caster classes. <br>
<br>
<br>
Aeoss - Pet pathing is and will always be an issue for any pet class but VI has made it pretty clear that it's not an easy fix and working in the IT industry I'm inclined to agree. That would take a LOT of coding as pets will take the paths of npc's in alot of situations. Run into a place like crushbone and run to trainer hill and sit there and watch your pet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Good old Jebartik likes to site see along the way, meet greet etc. Now watch the NPC's in the zone, they will take a funky path also.<br>
<br>
Malise - what level mob are you casting it on? There is always the chance of it resisting on pretty much any mob but the higher level the npc the more likely it is to happen. I have blues resist spells of all various types all the time, it's not constant but it does happen. I just usually sick the pet and toss another malisement on it and hope that one sticks. After that I don't waste the mana or my pet's health trying again, it's time to get to business.<br>
<br>
<br>
None the less there is a bit of balancing to pre 50 but even more so to 50+ still. Maybe just some things to make pre 50 magicians more useful in group situations if not that to make them a pure solo class by beefing pet power a small amount and a bit more destructive spell power or soloing type spells such as root/snare etc. <br>

Things that Mages these days forget.<br>
<br>
[list]<br>
[*]Sword of runes procced on everything for 41 damage per proc. This made soloing back then alot easier.<br>
[*]Pets were npc's and not &quot;pets&quot;. They procced more and hit better then they do now.<br>
[*]24 - 34 sucked cause we only had firebased nukes for places like sol a. Not as much a problem these days with places like loio. Still a problem though.<br>
[*]We didn't have to deal with post kunark, high resist, massive hp mobs.<br>
[*]Runed cowls and gebs were uber gear <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  they actually made a differnce back then for mages. Apothic was great.<br>
[/list]<br>
<br>
Now of course twinking a melee is insane at super low levels. As modauth pointed out a level 4 with fungi and lammies and for a mage you can go? 200 int? and thats about it.  <br>
<br>
Yes you can get some 65 hp rings or whatnot but then so can the melee. Thats not a caster specific upgrade<br>
