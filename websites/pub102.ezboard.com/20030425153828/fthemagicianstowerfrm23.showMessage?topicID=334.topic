There is a camp of them just to the right of the entrance past the town near Echo Caverns.  He said to pull from near the entrance and that they could be pulled as singles.  However, he could not remember at what level pulling them as singles began.  I tried pulling the closest one at 49 with a debuff spell, but brought the whole camp with my intended victim!  Fortunately, I was able to zone into EC with little drama.  I am now level 50 and have been doing this level in the Dreadlands.  That is serviceable for this level, but I would like to make another run at the Tarmoks.  Therefore, I am hoping that one of you who may have hunted these mobs in FG can lend some pointers.<br>
<br>
At what level can the Tarmoks be successfully pulled as singles?  Have I been told correctly that the best place from which to pull is near the entrance to the FG town?  (Just far enough in to prevent the wandering guard from KSing.)  If not, from where would you suggest pulling?  I assume that since none of the domesticated underbulks came when I pulled the whole camp that they will not be a problem.  I have been told that they are more dangerous than their Tarmok masters.<br>
<br>
According to Illia's bestiary on Allakhazam, Tarmoks range in level from a low of 40 (Herders, Lookouts, Protectors, &amp; Tribesmen) to a high of 44 (Defenders, Lookouts, &amp; A Sleeping Tarmok).  One poster at that site indicated that he thought that their maximum level had to be lower than 44.  (He thought it could only be 41, but this I doubt.)  Obviously at 51, I would use my new earth pet.  Progressing towards 55, what type of pet would you suggest?<br>
<br>
For those of you who fought in FG generally in your 50s, is grouping to hunt Small Mushrooms viable with the 51+ pets?  In other words, would I be useful to a group at level 51?  At what level can the Small Mushrooms be viable solo for a magician?  When can they be pulled as singles?  (Illia gives a level range of 46-49 for this mob.)  As I move up in levels, what type of pet would you suggest to hunt these in groups and/or solo?  (I'm thinking air when it becomes available since these tend to cast more than melee according to board posts.)<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for any information you can provide about these hunting options in FG.  I appreciate your time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=stren>Stren</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 86<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/03 12:48:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hunting in Fungus Grove</span><hr size=1> I think I single pulled Tarmoks at 53 with Malosi. I never pulled with a nuke.  Tarmoks got me from 53 to 54, it was pretty good exp and there is a chance of loot from them.  I stopped at 54 because most of them became light blue to me.  <br>
<br>
I've never hunted the shrooms so I can't give you anything there.  <br>
<br>
Personally, I would head over to Cobalt Scar and do wyverns until 51.  Just pull with whatever Malosi type spell you have.  Take it down to the beach where you would have your pet sitting. Kill it.  Its doable with 49 earth I believe.  Then when I hit 51 I would go to Neriak and take the 4 spawns in the Third Quarter until 55. Nothing bets the exp they give.<br>
<br>
Theres a lot of options in this forum if you don't want to do that.  But FG is probably not where you want to go if you plan on leveling fast. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 422<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/03 4:42:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Hunting in Fungus Grove</span><hr size=1> As was said before, you can pull tarmoks at 53.  However, doing so will complicate matters when you come back later to hunt shrooms, so you may want to hold off.  There's plenty of leveling spots for 53 up, and only one piece of loot drops off of the tarmoks that's worth anything.<br>
<br>
As for shrooms, a group can handle these in their low 50's.  And yes, you can contribute at 51.  In fact, your earth pet is nearly immune to shroom spells, and if you have a healer/slower, you can easily allow it to be the main tank. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=eloinapyromancer>Eloina Pyromancer</A> at: 2/12/03 4:43:06 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duveen>duveen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(2/12/03 6:11:37 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Faction issues</span><hr size=1> Okay, I did a bit more recon here tonight, still at level 50.  I was able to pull three types of Tarmoks as singles (Beetle Herders, Protectors, and Tribesmen).  More may have been pullable as singles, but these were the mobs readily available.  After about 30 kills, I am dubious to them.  I believe that I started out apprehensive, but I’m not sure about this.<br>
<br>
In regard to the faction comment by Eloina Pyromancer, can you be more specific on the problems being KOS might cause with them.  Specifically, I know of only the one camp just as you enter the mob area from the FG town.  Are there others?  (I have not ventured very far into the open area yet.)  Groups in FG seem to be pulling shrooms to other areas in sight my current pulling spot near this camp of Tarmoks, so it would seem that this camp of Tarmoks pose little threat to these shroom camps.  (In other words, there are good pull-to spots outside of Tarmok space.)  Am I reading this incorrectly?  One of the appeals of the Tarmoks to me is that I will generally always have the camp to myself.  I have checked on FG often and while there are shroom groups most times, the Tarmoks lead a dull existence on my server.  I can pull mobs to my heart’s content.  On the other hand, I currently plan to hunt shrooms solo in my later 50s and don’t want to screw that up with earlier hunting.  Any further advice would be welcome.<br>
<br>

Assuming that I choose to hunt them further, I will report back with the strategies that I employ.  Now, can those of you who have hunted the Small Mushrooms in FG answer any of my questions relating to this mob as noted above?  I hope especially to learn at what level the shrooms can be pulled as singles.  From the information on posts at Alakhazam, it would seem that the shrooms cast three basic spells: a root, a stun, and a seemingly light DOT.  Thus, magic and disease resistances are suggested for those hunting them.  Some posters on that site favor focusing on magic resistance, while others say to focus on disease.  Which would my fellow mages suggest to focus upon and what minimum levels seemed to work against the mob's magic most often?<br>
<br>

<br>
They cast a root, dd+stun, and a slow.  The root is a melee proc, so don't let them get close to you.  Don't remember a dot, but maybe.  As for your own personal resists, I do well enough at 60 with magic resistance &gt;100.  About 1 in 5 casts land on me.<br>
<br>
However, using gvoc:earth is very much recommended for its disease resistance during battle. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=duveen>duveen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 25<br> <font color=#333333>(2/13/03 7:47:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm23.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=334.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_question_mark.gif" align=absmiddle>  Thanks!</span><hr size=1> Again, Eloina -- and the rest of you as well -- thank you very much for taking the time to share your knowledge.

Krizin J'Narus or something close to that.  Run across the bridge and down over to the building thats an offshoot from it.  Go inside and Krizin is usually standing there.
