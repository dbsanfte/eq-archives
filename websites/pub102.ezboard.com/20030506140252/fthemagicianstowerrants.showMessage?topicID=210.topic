Krilen you have caught my attention because you seem to be so anti caster and i wonder why is that?  Every post you make seems to be about promoting a nerf or telling casters (mages more so) to stop bitching so the speak. So I have to wonder why is someone so anti mage/caster coming to a mage board and posting negative things.  Are you that much in need of attention?<br>
<br>
My point of view I look at all magicians as brothers. We fight and dont always agree but at the end of the day I know they all want what is best for the class. I have been in very heated arguments with people on this board but I dont take anything personal. I know sometimes the exchange of ideas will get things very heated.  I try (althought I fail at times) to see things from others point of view. I have found myself agreeing with Raz more (/gasp), and Noonie (/shiver) because I am trying to take the time to listen and understand where they are coming from even if I dont agree.<br>
<br>
I say all that to say this. Magicians might be divided on alot of points but one point we are not divided on is we want improvements for our class and we love our class.  We will come together to ward out trolls that seek to do us harm and you my friend (/sarcasm off) happens to be someone that wants to do the class harm. I dunno if you are some uber melee type that fears your pressure status as supreme damage dealer might come to a end. Whatever your deal is you really need to stop it. You trolling is really annoying and I for one am going to call you out on it. <br>

<br>
But i totally agree with you wezloc about the negativity of some of the ppl posting &quot;ideas&quot; onto this board. Why on earth would a fellow mag try to adjust the class in such a way as to make the early part of a mags career so blatanly difficult that it will either burnout the player from attempting to keep up with other classes or just turn them off from playing the class altogether.<br>
<br>
I agree we need changes, but lets not start off by just making changes that benefit lvl 60 players, these changes need to be from lvl 1 upwards, never start from the top always start from the bottom, becuase its easier to see the ramifications of those changes.<br>
<br>
I have no ulteria motive for posting on these boards, all i want is to play my mag the best way i can, yes i have good equipment yes i have good spells and yes in general im very happy with my class, but i would never want to downgrade my class in such a way that it will benefit me becuase:-<br>
 1. Im part of a fairly uber guild that will be able to help me get the new proposed items i may have helped create.<br>
 2. I already have lvl 60 so i won't have to worry about struggling with newly nerfed spells that i may have suggested.<br>

His idea is worthy of discussion, which is why I copied from another thread where it was buried and moved it to the top level where it could be discussed.<br>
<br>
There are several important points that he makes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Casters are not dependent on gear, nor do they improve by gear.  Therefore, the gap between the best and worst equipped casters is much less than the gap between the best and worst equipped melees.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
This point had been largely missed in discussions of caster-melee imbalance.  While most everybody, myself included, emphasized the ability to twink melees with equipment, and the poor quality of caster loot in comparison to melee, loot independence for casters was taken for granted.  That is, we complained about not getting the benefit of equipment, but ignored the fact that casters benefit from not really needing it much in the first place.<br>
<br>
In other words, the fact that caster loots sucks does not itself suck as much as it might appear.<br>
<br>
While I am still in favor of some improvements for caster loots, it is now clear to me that the best caster gear should improve casters less than the best melee gear improves melees.<br>
<br>
I did not learn this until the discussion of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Weak Non-Focused Pets</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pets are overpowered.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Maybe.  There are a spectrum of opinions regarding pet power.  Some say they suck, others think they are adequate or nearly so.  Others say the issue is not power, but availability and risk.  Just because <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krilen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s is a minority opinion, does not make him anti-Mage.<br>
<br>
He may even be right.  Too many <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> dismiss or take for granted the utility of having an <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Elemental</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> on call for the price of a few hundred mana and a malachite.  I suspect that with the exception of risk of trains, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Elementals</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are far better than most <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> are willing to acknowledge.  In general, players of a particular class tend take their own abilities for granted, while emphasizing the abilities of other classes which they lack.<br>
<br>
It also brings up an important question.  Just exactly how do you demonstrate that pets are either underpowered or overpowered?  While DPS can be revealing, I think it is not by itself generally sufficient.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Pet strength should depend on enchancements.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
Not unreasonable.  As I have written elsewhere, the ability to chain cast pets puts strong limits on increases in raw pet power.  I am of the opinion that any significant improvements in pet power should be in the form of external pet enhancements, such as buffs, or dropped or summoned pet only items.<br>
<br>
I find many flaws in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krilen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->'s proposal.  It is radical, costly, and has no clear benefits.  It has the appearance of being motivated by self interest, and would punish casual players.  It lacks compelling arguments or evidence in its favor.  It also has the distinct appear of singling out <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> for punishment, as many of the argument he puts forward apply to casters in general, yet he avoids that conclusion.<br>
<br>
It is not well argued, in other words.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Stated more weakly, less radically, and with trade offs, something similar could have been proposed like this:</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Verant</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> likely considers pets overpowered or close to it.  The existance of chain-casting means that raw improvements in pet power are unlikely, and the current level of raw pet power gives little room for over all improvement.<br>
<br>
I propose that in order to make pets scale better as players rise in power, that raw pet power be reduced somewhat, and more power concentrated in focus-type items.  This gives more scope for improvements in pet power without encouraging chain casting or AFK experience.  Further, a variety of pet focus items at varying power levels would make for more worthwhile <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magician</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> loot and help to distinguish accomplished <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Magicians</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.<br>
<br>
What does not work is:<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> ...nerf pets into oblivion, and force casters to hold focus items...Weak as hell with no items, powerful with items...Any idiotic loser mage...you want to be more powerful then you are now, and don't want to do anything for it. I cannot respect that...If you're too lazy to get your focus items...Personally, I think I should be more powerful than you...I want pets nerfed...merely by leveling to 60 the caster has earned the right to be as powerful as a warrior who has levelled to 60 and done extreme things yeilding extreme loot<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->The language incites more than it convinces.  It undermines the very points <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krilen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is trying to make.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, let me make one thing <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;perfectly clear.&quot;</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  I learn far more from people I disagree with than people who already agree with me.<br>
<br>
If I did not think what <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Krilen</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> had to say was important, I would not have moved it to a top level thread.<br>

<br>
mage + pet really brings nothing notable to most situations besides damage output. yes, our pet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> can</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be used as a bad tank where there are no melees. yes, mana transfering can be  useful. and yes, coth can be useful.<br>
<br>
but none of those things compair at all to what <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> any pure or hybrid melee can bring to an encounter in support</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
<br>
also keep in mind, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> not all pets are created equal</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>
voc water <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> can not tank very well at all</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. voc water, fire *and* rage of zomm should all outdamage or equal defensive melees. why? because they bring little support themselves. none of those pets can tank.<br>
our offensive pets SHOULD outdamage a defensive paladin and shadow knight, and they should equal a warrior.<br>
<br>
now, if you want to say earth, air, and dyzils outdamages like leveled (to the master) defensive melees, then i would agree with you, that would be wrong. however, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> they dont</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.<br>

<br>
I do not think Krilen wishes ill of the Magi class.  My guess is that he is in the 60++ level range and sees very very little reward for his effort.  This strikes him as unfair and unbalanced.  In an effort to increase the &quot;rewards&quot; of the 60++ game (making casters (magi) more loot based) he knows that he would have to ALSO weaken (make casters (magi) more loot based) magi below the 60++ game to keep balance.<br>
<br>
I am not sure where I fall on the whole issue that to better balance casters (magi) we must be more loot based.  There are plusses and minuses to both sides.  I don't get much gear in EQ, /shrug I don't NEED much gear in EQ.  Once you get to 60 and wish to enhances your &quot;power&quot; there is not much more that you can do...<br>
<br>
His words are quite aggressive at times, this does more harm for his views that help but, I do not think Krilen wishes ill on the Magi class. <br>

<br>
Try to remember that our SPELLS are basically our equipment and there is a vast difference between a caster with a certain spell and one without it.  Which do you want when facing NToV Dragons, a wizard with Dragonbane or one without?  Remember that some spells are still insanely hard to find and only those that are very dedicated [or lucky] will find them.<br>
<br>
The Ancient spell lines are meant to augement this difference as will Focus items [when the loot verisons start dropping or items are giving focus qualities] and FT items.<br>
<br>
In my opinion it is really only the high end pets that lagged behind [I would probably agree that some pre 49th ones are a bit much] but that is mainly due to the huge increases in  mob abilities [when green mobs hit like planar mobs you know there is a problem] while the pets have been stagant, gaining a couple points of damage and a few more HPs.<br>
<br>
A slight adjustment would be nice and maybe some more focus items so those of us that do end game raiding will have the means to augement our pets to the level of the game we are at.<br>

<br>
I love my mage. I feel a bit underpowered at times, I want to improve. But I don't think there's any room for mages to get any more powerful with merely 26pp vendor spells. Dropped spells are far from dropped weapons/armor because anyone knows what spells they need. And they're cheap, mod rod 2 8kpp when i bought it, price dropping no doubt.<br>
<br>
I present my ideas because my pet is too powerful with no loot, too weak with uber loot.<br>
<br>
And by the way, if you wonder where I stand in the endgame, I'm baron, level 57 and in a guild who never has more than 2.5 groups to do something, probably about 20 50+ in the guild total, often lack enc or cleric to kill stuff. Hardest thing we do is HoT in ToV, personally I don't want to do anything much harder, and I think the guild feels the same~ I'm in the middle. There are mages who don't do anything harder than light blues in KC, but they are just as strong as me. Then there are mages who spend essentially their entire lives in NToV and I am as strong as them. <p><center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=109465>~~~~Krilen !~~~~</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uelawise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elawise</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#333333>(4/1/02 9:09:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Wezloc</span><hr size=1> Will the 60++ game sustain the customer base?<br>
<br>
Up to this point the influx of new players had far outstriped the number of players leading the game.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think that VI has realized now, that someone who just buys the game now, is at a very distinct DISADVANTAGE  (Twinking, knowing best classes, Newb sysdrome, etc..)  Now you may say good, I played X hours a week for three years, they owe me something.  But VI does not and cannot see it that way.  They have to balance retention with new customers.  Many of you post bashing newbies and or not willing to group with newbies.  (If you don't that was not meant for you)  Is that really good for the long term of the game?<br>
<br>
Many ubers are trying to protect their status.  I really do understant that, and you have a right too.  But uber  status is directly tied to a healthy business.  Not the balance of the game, not who raids better.  Its tied to how VI treats the greater population, including the new people entering the game.  <br>
<br>
None of you will play EQ forever.  They have to balance the influx to be greater than or equal to the outflux.<br>
<br>
How many of you believe that the monthly price increase has nothing to do with server population.  If the accounts were growing as they have been in the past.  Then the price increase is not really needed.  influx being greater than outflux means that even though other things have increased such as electrcity, salaries etc..  There have been more than enough new people in the game to compensate for it.  How many new US normal blue servers have been introduced in the last 6 months?  compare that to the 6 month before, and before.   see where i'm going. Population increase is slowing.<br>
<br>
  If you think the class balancing is anything else, sorry its not a class issue, its business.  If VI does nothing but address the 50+ game, and widen the gap between the haves and have nots.  Will this game survive another three years?  <br>
<br>
I believe that there will be a good many drastic changes, 1 to 60.  <br>
<br>
In addition to to keeping the uber powergamers from becomming bored and running off to the next big thing, they also have to do the following.<br>
<br>
They have to balance a new person starting out, to the uber who twinks his new char.<br>
<br>
They have to keep that uber carrot dangling just out of reach of the average player.  Enough to inspire him to keep playing, but not enough to cause him to quit in frustration.  That means the he is being heard and listened to in ballance discussions as much as the uber minority.<br>
<br>
They have to find a solution to the wealth issue.  I would estimate that 95% of all wealth (loot money etc) that enters the game, stays in the game.  That is a real issue of atrracting and retaining new customers.  level ones running around in equipment that no one under 50 should be able to afford.<br>
<br>
I've been trying hard lately to look at EQ the business, and not just the game.  If the business fails so does the game.<br>
<br>
If I had a magic wand, and could change anything, I would<br>
<br>
1.  Make all items level dependant.<br>
2.  Make all items have an associated maintence cost.<br>
3.  Make more spells use components.<br>
<br>
and in doing so I would be able to <br>
<br>
Reduce downtime !!!!!!  (doing the equvalent of nothing in EQ is like going to the golf course and sitting for 30 minutes between holes.  It should only apply in extreem circumstances)  It would releive much of the frustration many casual / average players feel.  Being activly enguaged in the game instead of passing time.<br>
<br>
Introduce Far Better Melee' equipment.  However at a very high maintence cost, so its only pulled out of the bank for the big raid.<br>
<br>
New spell lines FAR superior to any available now for that level.  Have the compents be crafted.  (i.e.  take different drops and combine this with various tradeskills / research to make the component for the spell). Caster equvalent to high maintence cost.<br>
<br>
decide for every 5 levels what a character (any class) should be able to defeat 50% of the time at that level solo, and balance all classes to that.  So if a lvl_X warrior with no cleric to help him, should defeat a lvl_Y monster 50% of the time.  (After fight downtime is not a consideration at this point)  all caracters should.  The class interdependacy would be to take higher mobs, faster with less downtime.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Currently Evequest is the pillar on which the the foundation of MMO games are built.<br>
<br>
Other companies see the nearly one million customers and want a piece of the pie.  Competion will not come in the next &quot;Big&quot; release, but VI will loose share incrementally.  (I'm almost willing to say that they are now)<br>
<br>
Ever hear of Viscalc?  Lotus?  Excel?<br>
<br>
1. Know which one was really the revolution?<br>
2. Know which ones are not around anymore?<br>
3. Know which one was intrumental in memory management?<br>
<br>
Looking at Everquest in that perspective, I'm not so much concerned about any improvements to my class, and more concerned that I can continue to enjoy playing my class / character well into the future.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In case you couldn't answer the questions above.<br>
<br>
1.  Viscalc.  It was the very first comercial spreadsheet program. <br>
2.  Viscalc   Now the company as far as I know, no longer is in business.<br>
3.  Even though it is Mocrosoft who made excel,  and seemingly the driving force behind the current computer improvements.  The driving force behind the LIM (Lotus Intel Mocrosoft) memory standards was Lotus.  They needed the memory to satisfy cutomer demand for bigger and better spreadsheets.  LIM standards was the first driver / software to really make use of memory above 640K.<br>

<br>
2 lvl 60 mages, 1 in uber guild that raids, the other solo'ed the whole way to 60, sure their equipment is different, but other than mana pool and hp's they are basically the same, same spells, same dmg output.<br>
<br>
This is a gap that really should be filled somewhat (which is why the better focus items will be dropping off boss mobs and diety's), it is a huge gap for melee (though they can buy their gear and get it's advantages alot earlier, but wheres the advantage for casters?).<br>
<br>
Same goes with twinking, how many posts are there about casters get almost no advantages from twinking?  Whether twinking is right or wrong doesn't matter, give a melee and a caster a 20dmg weapon, and highend armor.  They will both be melee'ing for 19ish til lvl 10, then for 25ish til 15 and 32ish til 20.  At 20 the melee will  be doing in the neighborhood of 60, while the caster is forever stuck at 40ish.<br>
<br>
Now compare the armor, the casters will still be getting hit for max almost the whole time, while the melee is taking less than 1/2 the mobs max damage most of the time.<br>
<br>
As is obvious, but the spells up til 20 will not match up to what we can do through melee with a 20dmg weapon if you count in med time, and overlook how much dmg we take.  <br>
<br>
Really int/wis/mana items do not do much for a caster when it comes to twinking, sure a 10 mana item is alot better than 10 int until lvl 5, a 60mana item is better than 10int til lvl 30.  Even at that, how far is that 60 mana going to get any casting class? 1 lvl 12 spell?  So a twink caster at lvl 10 can cast maybe 2 more spells then a non twink?  Maybe can melee for 5 more dmg? Not as impressive as the gap between twink and non twink melee.<br>
<br>
Though it doesn't stop at the lower levels, there isn't a huge mana pool difference from 2 casters with a huge difference in wis/int or mana items, they do not do more dmg with their spells because of it.<br>
<br>
I really think Krilen sees the same things everyonelse does, just that krilen chose the wrong words.  Yes we should have items that increase our abilities (VI agrees, hence focus items-soon).  Why stop with the 8 we have for pets? Why not give us more to bring our pets up, as opposed to increasing our pets across the board? <br>
<br>
If there is no items to increase our power then there is no gap between us, is all he is saying.  2 lvl 12 mages 1 twinked 1 not twinked cast for the same dmg, yet 2 melees in the same predicament (sp?) hit for different amounts and recieve different amounts of dmg from the mob.<br>
<br>
/flame on<br>
<br>
Nerf our pets?!?! WTF WTF WTF WTF<br>
<br>
/flame off<br>
<br>
Only thing I could disagree with. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=wezloc>WEZLOC</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 451<br> <font color=#333333>(4/2/02 12:13:45 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: not that bad</span><hr size=1> I am not really sure about the twinking caster bit....hmmm I have a lvl 30 necro twink. He has over 300 in mana items and 210int, 952hpts at lvl 30.  He has a Zland heart.  Ummm I am here to tell you that it makes a huge difference. I can kill 3 to 4 mobs off one bar of mana. If I wasnt twinked that wouldnt be possible and the health regen on the heart is awesome for a necro. I dont even lose health while mana regening at this lvl.<br>
<br>
Try twinking a enchanter and starting him out with 200int and 200charisma and see the difference it has. In a group he will be able to re-apply mezz and stun alot more then he would non twinked.  Alan said in his earlier post that charisma only helps charm and as also having a 58 bard I can really attest to that.  A enchanter at lvl 20 will be able to hold a mob charmed for a much longer duration then a non-twinked enchanter do to twinking.<br>
<br>
Shaman with a fungi tunic at lvl 24? Hmmm that is uber twinking to say the least. Kill non-stop with no down time to speak of up until the early 50s.<br>
<br>
Clerics with a 200wis and 200 in mana items is going to be much better then the non-twinked cleric. He is going to be able to get 4 to 5 more heals which is very dramatic for say a lvl 25 or 30 cleric.<br>
<br>
Druid with a manastone and fungi tunic?<br>
Wizard with a mana robe and zland heart?<br>
<br>
<br>
Mana Robe on my server cost less then a fungi tunic and Zland heart is about 30k.  A fungi and a t-staff will cost a twinked monk about the same amount. Casters can be twinked so when I here people saying that gear doesnt make a difference it tells me you really dont know how to twink. Being able to cast 5 to 6 more spells is dramatic. The gear that my necro has on give him over half his mana pool at lvl 30. No one call tell me that isnt a huge affect from twinking. So please stop saying casters cannot be twinked because that just isnt true.<br>
<br>
Everytime I see a lvl 45 mage soloing with a burnwood staff, or a druid quad kiting with a lumi staff I realize that casters can be twink to dramatic degrees it is just that people are either not seeing it because they dont want to or they just dont know how to twink.  But if you going to compare the monk with a fungi and a t-staff then you got to compare that to shaman with a fungi and JBB not a shaman in totemic armor.  /shrug<br>

<br>
For a magician, the size of the mana pool means next to nothing. When do you go 100% - 0% ? I do... rarely. Mainly when soloing-- but I only will fight mobs that take all my mana accidentally, because it's so ineffecient (rockfiend jumping me from halfway across the zone in thegrey comes to mind.)<br>
<br>
Mana robe and zlandi are good.. they are like a fungi for casters. But when casters spells start to pail in comparison to a melee's weapons, the mana robe and zlandi on a caster are like a monk with a fungi and 2 fighting batons. He can replenish his resources quickly, and then do nothing with them.<br>
<br>
And as for more mana... well I described what it is above. To compare int and mana to melees, it's like a rogue getting +hp gear. can be good for the rogue, but he'd be much better off getting resists or ac for defensive stats.<br>

It was about twinking. If you twink wizard with mana stone, zland heart, and 300+ regen items it will directly affect how long he can continue doing damage. When spells at lvl 30 cost 100mana or less 300 mana can be the difference of 500 to 600 dd for a wizard. That is HUGE at that lvl. A fungi tunic is a nice twink item but a monk with fungi and T-Staff are not soloing shrooms in fungus grove. It takes better equipment then that alone. But if we are strickly talking about twinking then it can help a low lvl caster do large amounts of damage....far more then he could do untwinked. A necro with 950hps and zland heart a lvl 30 is a different animal from a lvl 30 necro with barely 150int....it works both ways. The higher you get the less twinking affects your proformance. But dont discount a shaman at lvl 24 with a fungi and a manastone. He is very much on par with a lvl 24 monk with a fungi and two jade mace. Casters can be twinked, you can choose not to accept it but that dont make it true. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ukrilenspiritlink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krilen Spiritlink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 46<br> <font color=#333333>(4/2/02 5:46:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_sunglasses.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: not that bad</span><hr size=1> Okay, I'll agree with whatever you're saying about twinking, but it caught me off guard since it's a bit off the topix &gt;&lt;<br>

That is only if there gear is extremely highend to uber. It is going to take more then 2k hps which is a normal about of hps for a well equiped monk at lvl 60. Fungi and T-Staff are just two items and the rest of there equipment has to be extremely high end.  Also if a monk can solo shrooms with a t-staff and fungi is he doing it with or without epic?  If you say without then I wouldnt believe a claim like that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showPrevMessage?topicID=210.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showNextMessage?topicID=210.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=210.topic&index=14><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.threadControl?topicID=210.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=210.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=210.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants>Rants !</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
