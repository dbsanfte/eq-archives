I am so confused...</span><hr size=1> Hi all, I am new to EQ.  I am not sure if this is in the correct forum.   But the newbie forum seemed more about specific stuff and I have some GENERAL questions.<br>
<br>
I started on New Years Day and went from level 1-4.  Can anyone help me to understand here.  I am not sure what I am supposed to be doing.  <br>
<br>
1.  Now, it SAID to start with killing small things like rats and snakes.  Things that were white or blue on target, NO red or yellow.  Well, EVERYTHING was red and there were NO rats or snakes around (still haven't seen any).  I have killed Large Sylvan Bats, Orc Pawns, Pixie Trickters, large wasps, etc.  BUT, what (besides killing, as in QUEST stuff) am I supposed to get into?<br>
<br>
2.  I learned to loot and sell to merchants...BUT they only bought my stuff once.  No one will buy it now.  I put everything in a bank and all of my slots are FULL now for equiptment.  What am I supposed to do now?<br>
<br>
3.  HOW do I change clothes and get a ROBE.  I have two rings, an earring, a cape, sleeves, a veil, a necklace, wrist and arm bands, etc.  in my equipment.  But I can not figure out how to get them to show up on my CHARACTER.  Also, I need to BUY or aquire a robe somewhere.  I see other magicians (lower level that I am) with robes.  But I just don't know how to do that.  I am really tired of running around NAKED!<br>
<br>
4.  Also...what spells do I need (or SHOULD I look for) at this level.  When I shop (granted my inventory is full now and I am having to drop stuff all OVER the ground) I see the names of spells, but don't know WHICH spell is for a MAGE (as compared to an Enchanter, Wizard, Necro, etc.).<br>
<br>
Like I said, I am REALLY confused!   If anyone can help, I would REALLY appreciate it.  I am LOVING the game but I really need to get more in touh with what I am doing BEFORE I progress much farther.  It DOES say (when kill things) that i DO gain experience...yet, I can not sell loot, DRESS myself or get spells (OR know much about them...I still have ONLY what I came with, spell wise...Minor Shield and Burst of Fire).  I DID buy a second wepon for the wepons spot on inventory (a torch).   <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3 color=#FFE4C4>~Morally Bankrupt and Perverse~<br>Would you rather laugh with the sinners or whine with the saints?</font></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=glenfinen>Glenfinen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 358<br> <font color=#333333>(1/3/03 5:11:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Lil help for you</span><hr size=1> 1) What race are you?  Halfling?  You should be able to find some blues to kill somewhere.  Ask someone in game to show you some level appropriate stuff.  Your guild master should provide several quests for you.  Hail all you can find and you should find some quests.<br>
<br>
2) Merchants will buy all of your non quest related loot.  I am not sure what you are doing wrong there.  Right click a merchant, then click an item and click sell.  Save your money and buy some bags from a bag merchant.<br>
<br>
3) You can buy a robe in your guild, or auction to buy one from a player.  Make your way to the East Commons near freeport to find some players selling some goods.  Some newbie equipment has no graphics so you look naked.  You need to find a robe really - that is all that will show up besids boots gloves and hat(hats only if you find a good one that has a chain or leather look).<br>
<br>
4) When you find a spell merchant near your guild you can right click the spells and it will give you a level that you can use it if you can.  You will need to sell batwings wasp parts etc to make money.<br>

for your questions, I will try and help a bit.<br>

<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->at low levels, expecially when you get your new pets, yellows can be killed easily, and once you get the hang of things you can continue to kill yellows up until the 30's (may take a bunch of deaths to learn for someone who just started though) dark blues (there are light blues but you won't start seeing any until around 8th level) are usually the best exp since you can kill them much faster than you can kill yellows or whites.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. I learned to loot and sell to merchants...BUT they only bought my stuff once. No one will buy it now. I put everything in a bank and all of my slots are FULL now for equiptment. What am I supposed to do now?<br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->not sure what you are doing here.  Vendors will buy from you unless you ruin your faction with them.  Faction is very important, sometimes if you kill certain creatures you will see a message come up after you have killed them saying something like &quot;Your faction standing with xxxxx has gotten better&quot; whatever the xxxxx says is who likes you more or less than before after killing the creature.  Another possibility is you are trying to sell to an NPC that isn't a vendor (not all of them are vendors)<br>
<br>

Glad to hear you are having fun.. the game can be a bit daunting to new players who have never played before.. if you need help ingame there is a /help command and most higher level players that have been playing a while have no problems helping a true newbie out.. me being one if you play on Erollisi Marr server look me up and I can help ya out <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

I am so confused...</span><hr size=1> You did not say, but from your post I think you must be a High Elf Magician.  I am going to give you advice as if you were an High Elf Magician.<br>
<br>
You will need to equip the things you have.  Push the &quot;I&quot; key and bring up the Inventory window.  Take something from your inventory slots and drop it into the window in the center of the Inventory window.  It should auto-equip it to the right slot surrounding the window.  <br>
<br>
Also, get some bags/backback/boxes.  These are containers and you can right click on them and open them.  You can then put things in the containors. <br>
<br>
Every class has a Guild.  You had a rolled up note when your character started. Right click on this and it should tell you who to give it to.  If you hand it in, you should get a robe.  Additionally, in the Guild, there will be vendors who will sell you skills.  <br>
<br>
In the guild area, there should be someone who will give you some low level armor quests.  You will have to search around and /h to hail them.  Then any text in [brackets] should be used in a sentence back to the npc.  They will then give more information for the quests.  <br>
<br>
For the selling problem, some items you loot are No Drop.  You can sell or drop these items.  You can only turn them in to the NPC for that quest.  Chances are all of your inventory is not No Drop and can't be sold.  Get some bags and use these.  <br>
<br>
Help this helps.  <br>

You may find yourself over confident and bored with killing bats and wolfs repeatedly.  You'll find yourself hunting deeper and deeper into the forests.  Unfortunatly, the monsters rapidly grow stronger the further away from your starting town you get.<br>
<br>
Everybody gets bored of killing the same monsters over and over but that is what's needed to have skills and strengths required to move to the next area.<br>

I am going to prin this out.  <br>
<br>
Let me add some info...<br>
<br>
1.  I am a High Elf.  However, I DO have the letter to hand in but I have NO IDEA where this person is that I am supposed to GIVE it to.  I have not seen the Magicians Guild IN Felwithe either (and I have been all over).  WHERE DO I FIND IT?<br>
<br>
2.  I AM clicking on the vendor and &quot;giving&quot; them stuff.  I know they WILL buy it, because I HAVE sold to them (same vendor) before.  But now, EVERY item that I give they say &quot;Sorry, Draccaviir, I have no need for this item, you can have it back.&quot;  I have tried to sell all of these...<br>
<br>
A.  Orc Hatchet<br>
<br>
B.  Bat Wings<br>
<br>
C.  Bat Fur<br>
<br>
D.  Royal Jelly<br>
<br>
E.  Wasp Wings<br>
<br>
F.  Wolf Pelt<br>
<br>
(and more, I can't remember it all).  Even a rusty dagger.<br>
<br>
NOW, IF I have offended them by killing...whatever, HOW do I get back in there god graces?  I MAY have killed something that I was not supposed to...I have killed all of the following, several times...<br>
<br>
A.  Large Sylvan Bats<br>
<br>
B.  Large Wasp Worker's<br>
<br>
C.  Large Wasp Dron's<br>
<br>
D.  Pixie Tricksters<br>
<br>
E.  Orc Pawns<br>
<br>
F.  Arboren (?) Sprouts<br>
<br>
G.  Widow Hatchlings<br>
<br>
H.  Forest Darklings (?)<br>
<br>
I.  Decaying Skeleton<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, Like I said, there WERE NO blue or white targets around were I started (in Felwithe and the Fardark Forest).  So I just went after all of the forest creatures.  Does doing any of the above make it so I can not sell to Merchants?  UGH!<br>
<br>
Seriously though, I have not seen my guild to hand in the letter and get my robe.  I HAVE seen these places IN Felwithe...<br>
<br>
A.  The Armour shop<br>
<br>
B.  The Halo's (?) shop<br>
<br>
C.  The Bank (Beyond Felwithe)<br>
<br>
D.  A Pub/Tavern<br>
<br>
E.  Traveler's ? (Inn).<br>
  <br>
I think that is all.<br>
<br>
I am totally messed up?  I have no guild and the Merchants hate me.  DANG!

It sounds like you were trying to give them the item, they will not accept it.  This is also how you can buy things from vendors.  I strongly advise not buying anything other than your spells, backpacks and other containers, malachites (for summoning elemental pets), and food/water from vendors.  They will overcharge you a lot on anything generally worth buying outside of these.  For higher quality gear, either use /auction or simply go to the Bazaar.<br>
<br>
Return to Felwithe and ask someone to show you where the magician's guild is.  Try /who mag while in Greater Faydark (outside Felwithe) and ask via /tells some of the mages for advice.<br>
<br>
I assume you have scribed and memorized your starting spells.  If not, you need to do so.  If you have not tried the tutorial, I strongly recommend it, it will walk you through some of the basic mechanics of the game.<br>
<br>
You've never indicated you've begged/asked anyone for money or gear, this is GOOD.  Explaining you are new and asking simple questions will sometimes yield gifts, but it is extremely impolite to come right out and ask for items.  /cheer you for not having done this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Well, EVERYTHING was red and there were NO rats or snakes around<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Rats and Snakes are sort of &quot;shorthand&quot; for entry level creatures to kill. You are on the right path killing pawns, bats, wasps, etc. Bats and Wasps are the Rats and Snakes of that zone. Just be sure to cosider them as not EVERY bat will be blue to you. Never assume.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>2. I learned to loot and sell to merchants...BUT they only bought my stuff once. No one will buy it now. I put everything in a bank and all of my slots are FULL now for equiptment. What am I supposed to do now?<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
There are some things the mechants just <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>will not</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> buy (Orc heads, orc bones, wasp polen, etc.) If a merchant will not buy something, then assume it is a quest item (more on that in a bit). Feel free to keep perhaps one of each thing they won't buy and then be sure to go get thing that they will buy (bat wings, wasp wings, etc.) And remember, not every one standing around town is a merchant. There are guards, quest giving NPCs, and general townsfolk. Your best bet is to go into a store and click on the folks there. AND remember that you need to be close enough when you click on them, otherwise you just get the &quot;consider&quot; message (&quot;Merchant Bob judges you amiably.&quot;)<br>
<br>
On Quest items:<br>
You can go to the Allakazam website to look up quests and items. A list of quest items can be found here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/dyn/quest_item_index.html">everquest.allakhazam.com/...index.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So if you have wasp polen or an orc head (heck, even bone chips) you can look here to see if they are used for anything (look under &quot;W&quot; for wasp wings, &quot;B&quot; for bone chips, etc.)<br>
<br>
You can also look up quests in a particular zone or town by checking here:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zlist.html">everquest.allakhazam.com/db/zlist.html</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
So if you ar ein Felwithe you can click there and see if any quests sound good to you.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>3. HOW do I change clothes and get a ROBE.

<br>
You should get a free robe when you start. If you take the note you initially got when you created your character and give it to your guild master (she is located in your guild hall).<br>
<br>
Here is a link to EQ Atlas, which has maps for EQ. This map of Felwithe...<br>

<br>
shows your guild hall is in Southern Felwithe (building #3). To get ther eyou go to room # 1 and go upstairs to the teleports. You walk into the Magicians port and you appear at the steps of your guild hall. Go in and on the left you will see some people in a room standing against the walls. There are the magician spell vendors. If you continue down the hall way you will see more rooms. Look for the person named in your note and give it to her. You will be rewarded with some experience and a robe (green I believe). <br>
<br>
Remember, this is not your typical RPG where every single item of clothing appears on your body. You won't see rings and medalions and whatnot. Heck, sometimes you won't even see pants. All that maters is what shows in your inventory screen.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>4. Also...what spells do I need (or SHOULD I look for) at this level.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Well, I told you above where the magician spell vendors are. At the Casters Realm you can get a list of Magician spells:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Magician">eq.crgaming.com/spells/sp...s=Magician</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
I would suggest the following spells in order of preference:<br>
1. Burst of Flame (important for attacking)<br>
2. Minor Shielding (for protection)<br>
---since you have a dagger and food and will always have them for the first 10 levels, forget the other level one spells for right now, you can get them later. Save your money for more important spells---<br>
<br>
When you get to level 4<br>
1. Upgrade to Burn (more damage)<br>
2. Elementalkin Earth (the best pet to start with and learn)<br>
3. Gate (to get around easier)<br>
<br>
The rest are up to you.<br>
<br>
And don't forget, to summon your Elementals you need malachite (a gem). One malachite for each pet summoned. You can buy them in bulk at the gem shop in southern Felwithe (bldg 5 on the S. Felwithe map)<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you out and gets you on your way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Right click the merchant to bring up a list of stuff they sell. Then click on your items (left button) and they will tell you how much they will pay for it.<br>
<br>
If the list of stuff they sell doesnt print up, go find someone else.<br>
<br>
Truthfully, I wouldn't reccomend a mage as a starting character, they are kind of a pain as you need to learn 20 things at once. I would play a melee class to start. Early in the game, a melee class is very straightforward, and you are really just trying to learn how the world works, not to level your character to 65 as fast as you can.<br>
<br>
As for items, I believe you have dropped them on your &quot;paper doll&quot; model correctly. The reason you don't see it, is most low end gear you find like cloth or tattered silk has no graphic. Your newbie (beginner) robe will have a graphic, I think High Elves get a purple robe, but don't remember perfectly.  As you get further along, you will be able to see more of your gear, as higher end items tend to have more distinctive graphics.<br>
<br>
What server do you play on? I am sure some folks who live there wouldn't mind helping you out.<br>

Felwithe proper connects with Greater Faydark.  North Felwithe is at the back of Felwithe, in the tunnel just past the lake (not the tunnels near the moat), and, of course (obviously to annoy us because it takes longer to reach) is where the mages guild is found.  At the back end of North Felwithe, there is a structure over the lake.  Enter the building and hail (target and press 'h') the guy standing there.  He should help provide you with information on how to get some better gear for yourself.  Wander around the building until you find three red pads - each of which is under a banner.  Find the banner that looks like your character symbol (the picture seen on your inventory window) and step on that pad.  This will teleport you to the mages guild proper.  Find the guy who's obviously in charge (the name should match the one on your note - this is the mage guildleader), hand the note in, and then hail the guildleader.  He or she should provide a basic quest which when completed, iirc provides the level 1 spell Flare - not a particularly great spell (all it does is fire off a ball of light that annoys creatures it hits), but at least you don't have to pay for it.<br>
Other vendors in the mage guild will have your spells.  Move the cursor over a spell and right click it in order to get information on what level is required before you can cast the spell.  If you find a vendor with malachite (a green gemstone), buy a stack (20 pieces) of it.  You'll use up one of these each time you summon an elemental, and the first elemental spells are available at level 4.  Don't summon an elemental until you're in a zone that you intend to fight in because the elemental will die when you change zones.<br>
Finally, exit the building using the teleport pad in the mages guild.  Enter the other building in North Felwithe (the one next to the entrance tunnel) and examine the vendors there.  One of the vendors carries a number of spells that are used by the majority of spell-casting classes, and which are not found on the spell vendors in the mage's guild.<br>

I'm sure youve noticed by now, when you zone into felwithe from Greater Faydark you can go right or left (or into a building) either way will take you around some winding passages.  Keep heading in the direction you would have if the building hadnt been in your way, and you will come to a pond.  Turn left and follow the walkway along the pond, and you will pass the baitshop.  Keep going that way and you will zone into (I think) North Felwithe.  Take a left, and keep going you will come to a big lake with a building high over the center.  There is a ramp up to the building, and 3 portal stones inside the building.  If you target one of the NPC (non player characters) an press the letter H, you will Hail him.  He will respond with helpfull information.  Step on one of the &quot;glowing&quot; portal stones and you will be ported to one of the 3 other buildings on the other side of the lake.<br>

One of those buildings will have your mage spells, and a trainer.  Remember to hail them, and right click on them.  You are probably using a dagger at this point, and might want to increase your piercing skills with your guild trainer.  You also want to find the vendor selling spells for your appropriate level.<br>
<br>
If you wish to see what your spells do before spending money on them, <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/">Casters Realm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> is a nice starting place.  Their information is not always correct, but its an excellent starting place.  This will take you directly to your <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Magician">Spell listing for magicians</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>
<br>
One last thing, before you attack any creature click on it and press the C button to con (consider) it.  Or you can right click on it to do the same thing.  The colors will give you an indication of its difficulty.  In the future you will also use the message to tell you how your faction standing with them is.  (you should be ally to your hometown merchants for instance).<br>
<br>
Good hunting, and enjoy!!<br>

<br>
When you see your guild master be sure to put at LEAST one training point into each skill you want to raise.<br>
<br>
Since you get 5 skill points per level you should have about 20 now.<br>
<br>
Put one into peircing (for your dagger)<br>
and one each into your spell casting abilities (abejuation, alteration, cahnnelling, conjuration, divination, and evocation)<br>
and now that you are level 4 put a point into meditate (it helps you regain mana faster when you sit and look at your spell book while regenerating)<br>
<br>
It's important to put at least one point in because your skill in those areas won't increase until there is apoitn allocated to them. And don't worrk, those skill will raise up on thier own as you fight and cast spells.<br>
<br>
You can then spread the rest of the points out in things you want to work on or just save them up for later use.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of skills and at what level they are available to you:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eq.crgaming.com/creationguides/skills/default.asp?class=Magician">eq.crgaming.com/creationg...s=Magician</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
And remember, each time you gain a level (or DING! as we call it) you get five more training points. <p><p>&nbsp;<p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=474342"><img src="http://www.inktank.com/images/eZsig.gif" height=150 width=508 border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showMessageRange?topicID=31.topic&start=21&stop=39>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showPrevMessage?topicID=31.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showNextMessage?topicID=31.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=31.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.threadControl?topicID=31.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/unread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=31.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=31.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub102.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="themagicianstowerannouncements">Administration<option value="themagicianstowergeneral">General<option value="themagicianstowerfrm32">Class Balance<option value="themagicianstowerfrm45">User Interface<option value="themagicianstowerspells">Spells<option value="themagicianstowerequipmentandquests">Quests<option value="themagicianstowerfrm28">Equipment<option value="themagicianstowerfrm29">Magician Pets<option value="themagicianstowerfrm30">Magician Skills<option value="themagicianstowerthelibrary">The Library<option value="themagicianstowerlibrarysubmissions">Library Submissions<option value="themagicianstowerfrm26">The Epic Pet<option value="themagicianstowerfrm25">The Magician's Epic Quest<option value="themagicianstowerfrm31">Polls<option value="themagicianstowerrants">Rants !<option value="themagicianstowergoofystuff">Goofy Stuff<option value="themagicianstowersuggestions">Suggestions<option value="themagicianstowerthingstokill">The Hunt<option value="themagicianstowerfrm27">Player vs Player<option value="themagicianstowerfrm37">Levels 1-3<option value="themagicianstowerfrm38">Levels 4-7<option value="themagicianstowerfrm39">Levels 8-11<option value="themagicianstowerfrm40">Levels 12-15<option value="themagicianstowerfrm41">Levels 16-19<option value="themagicianstowerfrm42">Levels 20-23<option value="themagicianstowerlevels2428">Levels 24-28<option value="themagicianstowerfrm43">Levels 29-33<option value="themagicianstowerfrm44">Levels 34-38<option value="themagicianstowerlevels3943">Levels 39-43<option value="themagicianstowerlevels4950">Levels 44-50<option value="themagicianstowerfrm23">Levels 51-55<option value="themagicianstowerfrm24">Levels 56-60<option value="themagicianstowerfrm46">Planes of Power<option value="themagicianstowerfrm47">Levels 61-65</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower>The Magician's Tower</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthelibrary>The Library</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.magecompendium.com/">The Mage Compendium</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">Upgrade your account to ezSupporter...</a></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center><a href="http://login.ezboard.com/BBSSystem.showUserPaymentScreen" target="_blank">...and never see another ad or pop-up again</a></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM AD SCRIPT -->
