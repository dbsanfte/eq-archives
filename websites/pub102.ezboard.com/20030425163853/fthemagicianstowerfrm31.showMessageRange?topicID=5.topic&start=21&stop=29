<br>
A friend of mine (shaman) and I went to CC to do a little farming one day... we both had some alts we wanted to twink.<br>
<br>
Well, he brought up that pet of his and owned the place!  I wasn't even needed!  After that, I thought to myself, I want to play ultimate pet class.<br>
<br>
I started my mage that very day, and never looked back.  I play him almost daily, to the point where my druid is getting sorely neglected.  He levels like nobody's business.  Yesterday, he made 34.  The nukes he gets are icing on the cake.  I expect in a month or so my lil' ol' mage will be grouping with the friends I made as a druid.<br>

He was showing off in Nro, sending his pet after all these things and summoned all kinds of things.<br>
<br>
I have kept that image with me for almost two years.  I had started a high elf mage and just didnt like the race (roleplaying a high elf just isnt for me)  So, I put her on the shelf and went back to my main (druid).  <br>
<br>
I recently gave up my druid completely.  Was tired of just getting groups because I can evac and/or snare.  I've been playing with lots of different classes - a beastlord, a cleric and finally the mage.<br>
<br>
My long distance boyfriend and I have been playing together exclusively since we met so I wanted to have something that I could play solo but I could also duo with him.  He missed being a caster and I remembered my love for the Mage and their pets. So that is how Suffar and Catta got created.  Albeit we're only 10, I can see myself sticking with this one until 60. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tevzia>TevZia</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#333333>(2/24/03 12:58:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why I wanted to be a Mage</span><hr size=1> Because it was the only character that wouldn't die to every other monster.<br>
<br>
My Erudite Cleric I don't think managed to kill a single monster actually.<br>
<br>
My Iksar shaman fell into the water in Cabilis and took 30 mins to get up, got killed by some frogloks and never found another zone.<br>
<br>
My Troll Shaman got killed by some nasty human Troll hunter and I never found my corpse. (was level 3 though so major progress).<br>
<br>
My Mage however, didn't leve the path outside felwith for a long time so when I died I could always find my corpse. And, she could kill things now and then.<br>
<br>
65 Levels later she still dies a lot, so some things never change. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kabreras2>kabreras2</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(2/24/03 3:28:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm31.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=5.topic&index=27>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://mapage.noos.fr/broca00001/images/fantasy/Magiciens/5timy.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Why did you  make a mage?</span><hr size=1> my first char i made was in a cyber , i made a  wizi and got him to level 8 ,  had a  friend RL playing nere me for the wole time  his mage ...he was 50+ already<br>

When i decided to try the other end of the spectrum. Go from pure melee to caster. None of this ranger/pally nonsense in the middle. Now melee are getting dusty sitting on the shelf. I use the warrior to farm silks in Ek. thats just about it. Magician has turned out to be (imho) the most fun character there is to play. My guild, (which is a young guild but growing nicely) didnt have a mage of significant level either, so filling the gap is important.<br>

First Character ever, paladin....60+ levels later I just finally realized I don't really enjoy being one.<br>
<br>
Second Character, Druid... 42 levels later, love this class for it's usefulness...to me.  I use my druid for all sorts of activities it would take any other character longer to accomplish.<br>
<br>
Third Character, Warrior...  52 levels later, love this guy.  Think that being a warrior is a ton of fun, but you are VERY limited in what you can do.  Basically, nothing solo.<br>
<br>
Fourth Character, Shaman, .....deleted ....arggghhhh<br>
<br>
Fifth Character,  Cleric....  level 41 now...  still like this class when I want to be lazy... and lets admit it, there is &quot;some&quot; work that goes into being a cleric, but for the most part it's &quot;CH in, SoAndSo NEXT!&quot; and then med till your turn comes back up.  <br>
<br>
Sixth Character,  Necromancer ..... level 26 ..... like this class, but got a little boring for me.<br>
<br>
Seventh CHaracter, Beastlord...  deleted ..... another Arggghhh<br>
<br>
Eighth character, Ranger... level 20....  I just liked the idea of tracking really...and druid does an okay job so this guy sits ideal.<br>
<br>
Ninth Character, Wizzie.....  deleted...... why?.......<br>
<br>
Tenth Character, Magician ...... level 29 and rising.  My new main character and the only one I play unless farming (for now).   <br>
<br>
I started this game wanting to play a Paladin, I'll be honest.  After about a week, I remember see'ing a Mage and thinking that it would be kewl but was always to scared of the pure caster.   Ya know what I mean, always dieing to the orc pawn and the like.  It was scarey back in the day.  A lowbie, level 1 or 2...starting out in a new game.  I wanted every advantage and paladins could tank and heal themselves.    <br>
<br>
After 3 years, and little success with any character, small advancements and what have you.  I finally realized (with a little twinking) that starting a Mage would be a reality and what the hell, I might as well.  Played everything else right?<br>
<br>
I am in love.  Do I hate not having root, sure.  Do I hate dying (which still happens, often I might add) sure.  But it's such a change.  It's such a rush, and it's so much fun.<br>
<br>
I don't care that Magicians may or may not be the most powerful class in the game.  What I do know is that we are in the top 5 for sure.  That Magicians do rock and roll when they need too.  <br>
<br>
I don't group much, but I was in a full group in Paludal Cavens the other day and the puller brought 6 mobs into camp.<br>
<br>
We had a chanter mezzing as best she could ( you know how these groups are at level 22 or so.  Assist is still a few levels off)  At any rate, I am assisting the main tank we set up and sending in pet and nuking like crazy.<br>
<br>
I basically solo'ed 5 of them before I ran out of mana, pet was still alive and I was at full health.  Sure, the group's melee did good being in the middle of all that and we did lose the SK cause healer was sleeping I think, but after that experience, I can't see playing anything else.  <br>
