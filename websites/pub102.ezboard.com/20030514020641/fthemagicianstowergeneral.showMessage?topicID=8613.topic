<br>
We wanted to give you an update on some of the things we've been working on lately. We've been following the various class and server boards, and looking for pressing issues. While this isn't the complete list, here are some of the topics currently being reviewed - <br>
<br>
- PoP planar flags and how they are acquired. We're experimenting with some ideas that let people accompany their raids to the deeper planes without having all previous flags. Our goal is to allow a player to participate in raids and guild events, even if the player wasn't able to acquire a previous flag. This would not grant them a flag for that zone, but would give them access to it while on the raid. We're looking at several options, but our current version in testing allows a raid to bring along a small group of people without the necessary flags, if the raid has most of it's members flagged for an event or plane. <br>
<br>
- PoP zone access quests. We're looking at the difficulty of the quests for individual access to the various planes. Our goal is to make it reasonable to gain access to later planes by doing the quests, without making it trivial or unbalancing when compared to the raid-gained planar access methods. <br>
<br>
- We're looking at the state of Charm spells, and may make adjustments so that the cost and risk associated with charming high-level pets is balanced with the power of the spell. <br>
<br>
- We're continuing to evaluate the drop rates of PoP spell parchments to see if any further adjustments are needed. <br>
<br>
- We're reviewing the tanking ability of the various melee and hybrid classes to be sure each class is competitively balanced with the others. The main factors we're considering are the ability to take damage, deal damage, and the additional abilities of each class. The goal with this review is to find any issues where melee classes are not &quot;bringing enough to the party&quot; when comparing their package of abilities. We're paying particular attention to the avoidance-focused classes such as the monk, to be sure things end up where they should. <br>
<br>
- We're going back through priest classes to find any major balance issues. Currently we're focusing on healing, secondary abilities, and the value of each class in different situations. <br>
<br>
- Shields and blocking. We're reviewing the impact of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield. We'd like increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon. We're working on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield. <br>
<br>
- Lull spells. We're watching the impact of recent changes to be sure these spells remain useful, but are not over-powered. <br>
<br>
- Riposte and Enrage on planar mobs. We're looking at alternatives to make these abilities less punishing on common planar monsters. <br>
<br>
- Tradeskills. We're reviewing the current recipe line-up for any gaps in skill progression, and items that aren't appropriately rewarding for their difficulty. <br>
<br>
Thanks for playing, <br>
<br>

This is kinda crappy because as always they are again totally forgetting about casters. I guess caster balancing is over as half assed as it was. I swear I really hope SoE has there $hitZ together with EQ2 because they really have very little concept of balance. I wonder if anyone at SoE on the Dev team plays a mage, and if they do are they happy with the fact that mage pets get shreaded in secs in tier 2 planes, and mages can not even kill light blues in most tier 1 planes, while SK, Bards, Necros exploit various pathing bugs to fear mobs and kill them with no chance of dying or picking up adds. Enchanters solo 1aa per 30mins or less, wizards quad in HoH, and druids charm kill without risk..................<br>

Barring the loss of elemental tankability in <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>PoP</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, mages appear to be doing quite well.  Pet groups still work so far.

<br>
There are still lots of people who don't have all of their 60+ spells, and drop rates are still very slow for people who can't play for long periods of time on the rare occasions they secure a camp where parchments might drop.<br>
<br>
I'd say that their review of this and the charm issues are still part of caster balancing.<br>
<br>
Though, I am still very disappointed that there is no word on pets or the magicians ability to solo in PoP..... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I love my mage, and I am very happy with the progression the mage class is moving into.  I still feel that Mages are a very special class, and only those that love it, and play it well understand what the class should be. SOE doesn't really have a clue what mages, are or should be.<br>
<br>
What I mean is if mages are about Pets, and Bolts then why are we lacking in these areas. Yes FBoT is a great spell but why are there not more bolt spells? I really don't see why mages don't get fast cast bolts....Scars needs a serious upgrade, and so does char.  Well what i mean is we need some post lvl 60 upgrades to these spell lines. IMO these are serious balancing issues. Mages had fast cast nukes, althought weaker then wizard nukes, we still had them. Now we have large nukes which are great but we lack the variety we had before.<br>
<br>
The new pets are really not better then the epic pet. They only are the best option because the epic pet can not land spells on post 61+ mobs. So either the epic pet needs to be raised in level or the new pets need damage upgrades, and hit point upgrades. Pets die so fast it is a joke. If a mob is not slowed they are not even able to keep a mob at bay for 10secs. In the tier 2 and 3 planes so many mobs proc near unresistable dd nukes that even during enrage the pet is dying to procs. Pets get wasted in POP, and this is the first time ever that mage pets were useless in terms of tanking. Well mage pets were designed to tank. It is one of the balancing features of the class because we lack defensive spells. Well at this time our pets are not very good at taking damage, and there hps are insanely low. I think doubling there current hp total, and increasing there dps by 10-15 or increasing the proc rate on the summon weapons is the only way to fix the problem.<br>
<br>
Also Raz I can't even believe you tried to compare druid charm soloing to mage soloing. I will just not even comment on that anymore.  Just sit back, and think about why a mage can't even hold a candle to a druid soloing..............<br>

Well my take on this is that SoE kinda sees the mage as a minor concern.  If you look at the numbers not many people play this class.<br>
<br>
So we got some nice damage in groups?  Still many a mage goes lfg for hours or days between groups.  We are almost completely unable to solo in PoP unless we have the ultra rare Call of the Arch Mage spell and do't mind a lot of deaths and risk in BoT.  Outside of that soloing for us at level 65 is just not possible unless 1 AA every few weeks is somehting you can live with.<br>
<br>
<br>
My Conclusion:<br>
<br>
SoE is not going to change the way the Mage can solo in PoP for the better.  In fact they will most likely nerf Mage Charm.<br>
<br>
I suggest all of you consider mages lucky to have some added group damage now.  Make a new character when the new expansion comes out.  Play your mage at raids.<br>
<br>
It was a good run of it.. but the class is not group desired and cannot solo well.  No one at SoE seems ot care.  /shrug.<br>
<br>
I'm happy enough to do good to great group damage on raids and those unlikely ocasions I get a mercy group.<br>
<br>
Outside of that I will simply make a froggy shaman and have some fun later in the year.  I play the game to have fun.. like many of you do or used to do.  Its not fun LFG for 4 hours.<br>

There is so much misinformation surrounding our charm spell, i would like to put in a word of truth. <br>
<br>
1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Regarding soloing with charm</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. <br>
For a mage it really is quite useless as a soloing tool, unless you plan on training everyone in bot every 15 minutes and have access to buffs from death (hint: no one in bot will want to buff you after youve repeatedly trained them :P). <br>
Yes it is quite possible to kill <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>something</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> solo -- in fact one time i killed 3 things solo back to back. No, it is not feasable to do it consistantly without the assistance of at least a botted support class to reduce enemy dps. This is because eventually, charm <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>will break</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> while you are fighting, and when that happens you are in all likelyhood going to die. <br>
There just is simply no way a 65 mage can live through a charm break <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>and</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the enemy mob beating you up at once without someone to heal you or help mitigate that damage (through stuns, snare, root, runes, ect). You will die too often to make it a worth while venture. However, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>partnering</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> with several classes is quite feasable.<br>
<br>
2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Regarding maintaining a charm pet indefinately.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> A pet <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>can</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> be maintained indefinately if you have a good cleric in your group and elemental silence. <br>
Even still, it is quite risky for a mage, since we are so heavily dependant on others to mitigate damage unlike the other 3 charm classes. <br>
Maintaining a pet is virtually effortless if someone in your group can snare and is feeding you runes. Also, making pathing and distance work to your advantage, even unsnared, is key to mitigating ex-pet damage (i find it quite ironic that a game flaw which plagued us so long, is now advantageous <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ).<br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Regarding charm pet strength</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. It all depends on how much you buff it. How much you can buff your pet while still being able to manage it depends on the skill of the player, the class in question, and the skill of your groupmates. Typically i as a mage with humble equipment (unbuffed 2100 hp) will give my pet a set of weapons and use bo1 on it, which is fairly manageable for me. This results in it doing a dps of about 350ish (not counting charm breaks during battle, which would lower its dps). <br>
If i am grouped with an excellent cleric, or a snare class, i will buff my pet higher. But usually that is the buffs i use on my pet. If im grouped with a crappy or occupied cleric, i just use an unbuffed pet.<br>
The pet also makes an excellent off tank. Sometimes i will just stick my pet on an add, and it is often dead before the full group kills the other (without even losing half its health!). The strength the pet has in tanking is in many ways more powerful than its damage, and honestly i think that something should limit this tanking power.<br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>My impressions of mage charm.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Honestly i feel our charm is <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>mostly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> balanced, granted the risks and situational element involved for a mage. It is clearly the least overpowered of all 4 classes charm spells, but none the less it does need changing.<br>
<br>
4) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What should be done.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> There are a few things which in my opinion would completely balance the charm line, and almost unfortunatley none of them are being implemented on test <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
Simply have the charm spell put an effect on both the mob, and caster, which gives the following effects:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>When charm is applied to a mob...</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
...It cannot be hasted nor given weapons. The natrual dps of a mob is quite enough reward for the risk. <br>
<br>
...Overwrites all snares on the mob. Snare trivializes the risk of charm completely (im speaking from experiance here!) and it is absurd to allow charmed mobs be snared. <br>
<br>
...A buff on the caster will overwrite any and all rune spells. High level runes mitigate the risk of charm far too much (again speaking from experiance).<br>
<br>
<br>
5) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>What not to do to fix charm.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
-Please do not decrease the duration or resistibility of charm spells (which is the direction i unfortunately see you going). Charm breaks frequently enough, and if it were to break more often than it does it (for a mage at least), it wouldnt be worth the risk and cause frustration to both the mage and their healer. <br>
<br>
If you really must limit the amount of time a charm pet is kept, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>do it through recast delays</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. That would be a much wiser solution, since it would involve more casters while causing less frustration.<br>
<br>
<br>

They do this because whenever they patch spells, all of the spell changes on Test go Live.  That means anything they don't want to go Live they have to delete.  So since they didn't want the charm changes to go Live, they had to reverse the changes and put them back in after the Live servers were patched. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://members.aol.com/nodnarbjh/csig.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

Now this is just not true in my experience. Last night in Bastion of Thunder my water pet was comparing very favorably in terms of damage output against most mobs. Pop off a couple of nukes and I was clearly in the lead in terms of damage. That is without even counting the damage shield and the pet weapon procs.<br>
<br>
On some mobs it could outdamage the warrior and ranger. A somewhat rare occurence, but it does show the pet is quite competent at dealing damage. <br>
<br>
Of course, it gets slaughtered quick if the mob turns on it, but that pet enrage bought our group enough time to scamper down to zone out and exit when things went bad. As an aside, don't let that pet girdle with the 500hp fool you. It may allow the pet to suffer one or two more hits, but that is hardly an upgrade. (It would be cool to have a spell that considerably raised the defensive abilities of pet for about 20 seconds while  cutting down on its damage output... just for variety)<br>
<br>
The only pet that needs tuning in my opinion is the fire pet, <br>
which I cant quite figure a use for. <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101077" target="top"><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:white;"><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">Hata Takushi</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--></a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
Second, I disagree with the tanking part. ANY tanking class will get wacked in a few seconds to a non-slowed tier2+ mobs, our pets included. On a slowed mob, &quot;I&quot; (not a cleric, me , a mage), can be healer for an air pet tanking slowed mobs (and to a certain extend unslowed mobs, but it sucks a lot of mana) in PoP tier 2-3. Pets tanking is fine, unless you want pets tanking much better than PC melees, they can't go much higher than now as far as tanking ability goes. They could use a bit more HP, but honestly it's not that bad, like I said before I form pet groups all the time and I'm usualy main tank AND main healer for those groups, the only thing I look for is a slower and I can pet tank any mobs up to tier 3 named. Mobs are brutal in PoP, they eat pet in under 10 sec, but guess what, they also eat warriors in under 10 sec without healing and/or slow.<br>

You see, the problem is not the class, it's your reputation. It's common knowledge around the EQ community that mages are now one of the best, if not the best damage dealing class in groups. If that's not enough for you to overcome your bad reputation when looking for group, you'll find yourself bitching in 5 months that no one wants to group with your froglok shaman, not because of the class, but because of YOUR attitude. I know most mages on my server, and none of them have trouble finding groups. Then again, those mages are not as whiny and negative as you are, and have things called &quot;friends&quot; (prolly hard for you to grasp this concept of &quot;friends&quot;) or &quot;guildies&quot; or &quot;other players&quot; that are not annoyed at them, hense they find groups. If I was you I'd stop to think about that a sec or two, or maybe even a year or two, personnality is not something you can change overnight.<br>
<br>
The problem here seems to be the player more than the class (go read your &quot;quitting&quot; threads all over and please try to tell me again with a straight face that you don't get groups because you are a &quot;mage&quot; as opposed to not getting groups because you are &quot;Rthen&quot;). It gets old fast to hear you constantly bitch and moan about every single thing, maybe if you had a more friendly attitude you wouldn't get as much difficulty finding a group.<br>

Due to their very useful utility spells besides charm.<br>

<br>
that is so not true, if anyone spend their time in Valor ... they will get their 61/62 spells. <br>
63/64 will be a bit tough to get but not impossible. As the spectral are coming down on price. <br>

<br>
Such weak agrument. <br>
Charm was expected to change since the kael incident.<br>
All VI did was making sure it can't be use on boss.<br>
<br>
I guess you can think they may be finally getting to work in 2 years time. But if charm wasn't changed for last 2 years why do you such high hope for it to be change now?<br>
Has it been more powerful? yeah.<br>
But a charm pet has always been powerful as a caster chain-nuking. <br>

Mage damage is fine. <br>
May be a little fine tuning up, but it is fine. <br>
Go read safehouse for how much rogues whine about mage damage already. <br>
<br>
And if you are a mage that can get elemental armors, your sustained dps will be even higher(and no idiot go around and post mage &gt; all in all other class boards please).<br>

<br>
How long you think a 60 monk/ranger last without a healer while tanking a tier 2/3 mob? <br>
You think mage pet is useless now in terms of tanking?<br>
Have you tried to tank a CT(the dungeon) entry mob with pre-PoP pet? <br>
Watch how fast they die.<br>

Either way, you failed miserably. <br>
