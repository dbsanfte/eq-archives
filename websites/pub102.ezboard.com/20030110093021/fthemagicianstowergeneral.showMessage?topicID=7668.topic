Currently the only one with any working combinations (combing scrolls for notes that yield weird charged items) doesn't seem to lead anywhere. The other two don't seem to have any working combinations (though the possible number of word/rune combinations is staggering).<br>
<br>
Also hope updated means that at least the ethereal parchments will drop off more mobs. And maybe a bit more commonly too. While it's been a bit frustrating to find them, I am glad VI chose to start off with more limited drop rates and leave room to adjust upwards. Alot of folks consider the lowering of drop rates in Luclin to have been a nerf, really to me I thought it was really odd to see nearly every mob dropping a spell, and some dropping two or three. Of course people were angry when the drop rates were reduced. But leaving yourself room to improve drop rates will usually make folks happy since it will not feel like a nerf. Hoping some of the loot drops are the same as the rewards for some of the tougher encounters have been kinda depressing (though some are excellant IMO). Same deal, just no more epic ratio weapons dropping off yard trash, if they need to be improved they can be and folks will be happpy. Better than putting in something that is unbalanced and later fixing it and everyone being unhappy because of the &quot;nerf&quot;. If that's in fact what they are doing, then kudo's.<br>
<br>
Ideallly it'd be nice if an xp group could average a spell per person in a typical playing session. In a week of playing, I've gotten one spell, at this rate, I might have all my spells for 61 in three months if I get no duplicates or level 62 spells. That's just way too rare IMO. Course I can trade duplicates, but only if it's a spell someone would want (let's face it, most mages will probably get stuck selling the focus necklace summon to a vendor since I don't think many will actually want it).<br>

I so have to agree, there has been none of what the more cynical players call the classic SOE &quot;bait and switch&quot; in this expansion. Before this patch many players were fearful of an exp nerf for places like Plane of Valor, but there's nothing in the message about it (which doesn't mean it didn't happen!).<br>
<br>
Loot drops feel about right, and exp is decent if you venture to the planes and very good if you pass the difficult Trials and other encounters. I sincerely hope that this is part of a plan for this expansion which is proof that they are sticking to their &quot;levelling is something that will happen naturally rather than be a chore&quot; promises, and not a glaring oversight their doctors are desperately trying to come up with a good spin for so they can nerf it.<br>
<br>
I just wish I was sure of this <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Luclin bruised me in many ways, especially after CoH's continual and gradual nerfing. I'm more critical of content, and treat the good stuff like a treasured morsel I must wring every fleeting moment of joy from. The fear of stuff being nerfed is everywhere, in particular on the &quot;big&quot; forums - how many posts have you seen about people finding great drops / parchments / exp and being unwilling to post about it?<br>
<br>
Sure, part of that is greed or a fear of their discovery being swamped with hunters, but at least a part of it is the ever-present threat of the Bat. For the good of the game they have to put the bat back into the cupboard for a while, even if there is mildly overpowering content. Exploits and game-breaking bugs need to be fixed, but random assaults form the bat need to stop, at least fro a time IMHO <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kinelaria>Kinelaria</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 436<br> <font color=#333333>(10/31/02 12:07:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7668.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Patch Message October 31 2002</span><hr size=1> I think the only disappointments I've had this expansion:<br>
- Spells too hard to get (doesn't help Inny players hate mages, so getting into good groups is a real chore)<br>
- Plane of Disease is just very boring to me (green goo, green goo, oh look a spider came over from PoN, green goo, BROWN  GOO WOW!, green goo, green goo, hey look a plague rat ported up from Ak'kanon, green goo, green goo... you get the picture)<br>
- The small group encounters didn't work as I thought they'd been advertised, i.e. seperate groups being able to run the same event. While they can do this, they cannot do it simultaneously. Leads to lines to these events that can get quite long and the problems with lines of course, line breakers who jump past groups who've been waiting their turn.<br>
<br>
But the pro's I just don't think I could list here entirely. The great bulk of this expansion has been really cool. I'm sure they will iron out the issues we have. Maybe not entirely how we'd like them to, but I'm sure we'll at least be content with what they do.<br>
<br>
Just realized Servant of Ro and Host of the Elements were not mentioned in the patch. I really hate losing control of my normal pet while using the servant. Don't mind neccessarily that the servant is uncontrollable so long as it stays only on the mob I had targetted when I summoned it. Though would be best if pet commands were sent and accepted by all pets you have active. Also hoping at some point they raise it's level so it actually can land spells on higher level mobs (Servant of Ro that is, Host looks like it does fair damage against stuff).<br>

The spell thing really cause too much tension between players and put too much stress on players.  If they have fixed this, cudos to them for listening to their player base.  This team seems more willing at least to listen and address issues we have that will lead to more enjoy.

So while I am all for melee's having ready access to bandages, I wish that they wouldn't just give our spells away to anyone they are useful for.<br>
<br>
ie. monks have pouch of quellious (55 spell!!)<br>
rogues have a summon throwing dagger item<br>
rangers have a summon arrow item<br>
<br>
<br>
So many of our summons just aren't useful to anyone, and yet the few we have that are useful they put on items anyway. <p>--------------------------------<br>

What the heck does this mean?  There were no level 61+ spells in the other expansions.<br>

Some people would hand in ethereal parchments and get lvl 50+ velious dropped spells or even worse, vendor-sold spells from Velious/Kunark expansions.  The fix now makes parchment hand-ins only give PoP spells. <p><p align="center"><font face="Tahoma"><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7621>Chakkolio<a/><BR>Arch Mage<BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kilmir123>Kilmir123</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.lowlandelites.net/vb/avatar.php?userid=13&dateline=1034772585" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 64<br> <font color=#333333>(11/1/02 3:59:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=7668.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: RE: comment</span><hr size=1> The old world spell-drops was a bug for Hybrids. Think of it like this:<br>
Hybrids get several spells of their &quot;original casterclass&quot;. A 61+ Shadowknight gets some lvl 50-60 necro spells, a 61+ Paladin gets some lvl 50-60 clerics spells, etc.<br>
<br>
VI/SOE simply tagged any lvl 61+ spell for your class as a possible result of the turn-in &quot;quest&quot;. That's why us mages got the Firebolt of Tallon and Paladins got stuff like Heroism (lvl 63 for pallies). <p>Arch Mage Rhand Kinslayer&lt;br&gt;<br>
