Right near the bottom of the ramp to High Hold is a group of gnolls.  The one you really want is Chief Sra.....  He gives awesome exp at 20 thru 24, as high as 29 he cons blue.  The loot is fair, just kill all the gnolls there and passing crag spiders.  Get a small sewing kit ( there's a merchant north of the gnolls), and combine 2 webs dropped off the crag spiders, this way the web becomes stackable.<br>
<br>
Use a water elemental because they aren't affected by the crag's poison.  Trust me.  Go here.  Kill him.  The Chief has a perfect spawn time to be able to med up and be ready.  He gives awesome exp.  No one camps him either.<br>
<br>
Just shuddup and try it.<br>

20th lvl = Chasm Minotaurs, Crag Spiders, Gnolls (undead reaver gnolls I think give xp at 20th).  Also you can try the Aviak village in SK.   But I would avoid SK until around 22-24 because SK can take you from 24 to 29 easy and you might get sick of it :)<br>

<br>
At level 20, I hunted the hermit a bit and I managed to get one of the double-spawns in Lake Rathe.  This took me to 21 pretty easily.  Unfortunately, Lake Rathe was camped next so I went looking for another good spot.  This led me to try the Chief above with no luck.  I then went to Kunark in Lake of Ill Omen.  I stayed by the windmill and pulled low blue mobs all day long.  I leveled to 22 here pretty easily but it took a while.  Down by the lake, there are higher level mobs but they were mostly yellow which I have been staying away from lately due to the long downtime.  Groups around level 22 are ideal for these creatures.<br>
<br>
I went over to The Overthere over the weekend and I got 1.5 bubs in about 2 hours hunting blues along the North shore in that zone.  I plan to stay here for this level. The loot with these mobs is pretty good. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> Nepracon</span><br> <span class=usertitle>Unregistered User</span><br>   <font color=#333333>(2/25/01 3:43:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   DUDE high hold keep is the place to go........</span><hr size=1> All u need to do is group with some higher lvls like around 20 to 22 and fight gobblins great exp i went from lvl 18 to lvl 20 in like 8 hrs very easy just sit back and watch yer pet kill and u can kill all gobblins but the guards but thats why u have yer group members to kill the guards for u im telling u great exp and awsome LOOT......l8er see yeah on erollsi MArr<br>

that's your new hunting ground. You can med near the farm house close to the path... an occasional lion will bother only your pet.. and sometimes you can hear a Hill Giant coming.. stay clear of him ;-)) <br>
Some borer beetles will be blue to you, scythe beetles will all be.. and beetles are quite nice to beat and give good experience. And then there are tons of griffawns.. and killing them is a joy.. always a good battle, even on weak blues. And then there is /gems for downtime ;-)<br>
When you reach lvl 23, 24 you can go and try kill the griffenne... when it conns white.. but be careful with other griffs nearby..  and watchout for the Griffon, who will want to punish you, since you are killing his mates that he needs to have fun with... hehe<br>
Oh and willowwisps appear from time to time.. they are green, but a GLS gives you 9 pp at gypsies, and your pet will do fine all by himself, killing them.<br>

have fun &amp; may your spells never fizzle<br>

Go to Ocean of Tears.<br>
<br>
Everytime that I went in the Karanas there were druids kiting something or other over my head which isn't hard considering I play a gnome.  I hunted there for a little while, but I just didn't think that the loot was that good...  I also hate the walk all the way over there and I was too cheap to pay for a port.  hehehe<br>
<br>
In OOT you can fight gargoyles...  You could have started to solo them at lvl 16 (awesome xp at that lvl), but at lvl 21 they still give 3/4 of a blue bub of xp.  Don't know about lvl 22 to 24 (I forgot to check per kill), but I know that you still get xp because the times that I shared the island with someone he was a lvl 24 pally.  I asked him and he said that he was getting decent xp.<br>
<br>
The will drop one eye every two or three kills on average.  For everyone with a cha better than 60 you can expect to get 8 to 9pp for each eye.  The best part is that they stack.  From lvl 18 to 20, I had collected 2 full stacks of these eyes...   I bought all of my spells, and still had 200pp or so left over.  <br>
<br>
If anyone goes here, and there are more than two hunting groups on the island, leave or log...  It is a written law that someone will mess up and pull a spectre and everyone will die...  All and all it is a good spot, and it is very rarely hunted.  Most of the time if you exclude the ppl on the boat you will share the zone with about 6 other people (peak hours).  One last thought about the island... the greater skellies are placeholders for the gargoyles, kill them if you see them.  Happy Hunting <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uaphael.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Aphael</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(7/9/01 8:02:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm42.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   also...</span><hr size=1> as others have mentioned before, I strongly recommend heading to Kunark and Lake of Ill Omen... <br>
the majority of players there are well versed in the art of EQ so finding good (and I mean GOOD) groups is rarely a problem... <br>
there are loads of stuff to hunt and getting to 25 or more should be a breeze...<br>
there are three ways of getting there... ranging from easy to hard:<br>
<br>
1 - take the raft from Oasis of Marr.. it will stop at a small island once in Timorous Deep... get off here and head along the mountain to the right... you will come to a set of docks and some sunken ships... the dock to the right is where you want to wait... <br>
a ship called The Bloated Belly will take you to The Overthere... once you've zoned in, wait a bit till the boat starts moving... when you see the wall jutting out in the water, jump off and swim ashore on the left side... you don't want to go all the way to the docks where some nasty undeads and dragoons are waiting...<br>
now you head to the Frontier Mountains zone... once in, head left along the wall till you reach the Lake of Ill Omen zone... <br>
<br>
2 - Take the shuttle from Butcherblock Mountains on Faydwer... head through Firiona Vie and into The Lake... this is scary since the place is swarming with baddies, but with a SoW and invis it shouldn't be that much of a deal...<br>
<br>
3 - get a port to Dreadlands... I did this the other day and it was scary as hell on lvl22... hehe... kinda fun, though... you will have a long and scary walk to the Frontier Mountains zone... <br>
<br>
once in Lake of Ill Omen you will have loads and loads to do... just find a nice group and your xp will start shooting... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
