No, not in a raiding guild.  My monk is very well equipped from raiding six montsh ago.  Did my first raid since then yesterday and killed Vindicator.  What hoot.  heh  All spells my shaman has gotten have been in an open group and /randomed.  I did however get pretty lucky on my turn ins.  10 spells and one duplicate.  I nearly have all of my lvl 61 and 62 spells of interest.  And guess what?  I started this shaman in 1999.  I did not get malo/torpor until two months ago.  Spells are more trivial to get than ever for me.<br>
<br>
I just see a problem when the non-raiding mage is enjoying some very significant upgrades in power while mr. joe blow monk is also doing the same stuff as that mage and getting very little increase in power other than new damage tables as he levels up (As a lvl 64 monk these don't seem to be significant yet).  Hopefully, there will be some new weapons (like the 50/45 for tanks) that this monk can get that will put him back up on the same footing as the casters which are seemingly getting some very nice upgrades for some very minimal time investment.  Unfortunately, I have yet to see it happen.<br>
<br>
In the mean time if a non-raiding mellee is half the mellee that a raiding mellee is then I would expect the same thing to apply to casters.  And of course one of the problems is that spells, that every caster can reasonably expect to get in their game time, are balanced against mellee items that drop off of gods and what not.  <br>
<br>
A casters biggest increase in power comes from spells.  If these spells remain easy to get then the system is broken and the biggest increase in power for a caster should not come from spells (since they are relatively easy to get) and should come from equipment instead.  <br>
<br>
So they need to tone down spell power, and introduce items which will vastly increase the power of spells.<br>
<br>
Of course this is all moot if mellee can reasonably expect to see equipment upgrades to match themselves to the upgrades that casters are getting from spells outside of a raid environment.  There is very little evidence of this so far. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=immlazen>Immlazen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 151<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 6:31:51 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=162>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  It Begins</span><hr size=1> Quit smoking that stuff Broda<br>

Where was all this talk when Mages were not doing damage but sitting around Trodding everyone?  You had Wizards Manaburning mobs, melees damaging mobs better then Mages, and priest class almost outnuking Magicians.<br>
<br>
BTW, since when should a Melee class outdamage a pure caster?  Also, Magicians give up all defense just to have offense.  What do Monks give up?  NOTHING.  They have very good defense/very good offense.  Guess what?  Mages only have very good offense.  So how can you even compare the two.  Hell, do you even post on the Necro boards?  What about Beastlord boards?  There pets are just as good and have better defense.  But I guess you just want Mages to be a support class and not do damage.<br>
<br>
Also, as far as spells and weapon drops.  First of all, I have only gotten 2 parchments since POP came out.  Yes, some have gotten lucky,,,,but the majority have not.  So your basis of spells being easy to get is off point.  What is the point of a caster leveling without any new spells?  Now compare that with melee leveling without any armor.  A melee still improves by leveling, more so even without new armor.  Also, in old world look at all the armor was dropping compared to spells.  Further more casters need armor and spells...so we take a double hit.  So dont come Trolling these boards with half truths and half ideas.  Look at the whole picture.<br>

Comparing melee gear to caster spells is flawed. a lvl 65 mage is hardly different from a lvl 60 mage if he has no spells, but a lvl 65 monk or rogue performs much differently than a lvl 60 of the class. If you want to compare spells to gear, compare lvl 65 spells, that will only be gotten from gods, much like loot.<br>

IF they are comparably equipped.  But I will still say that if you don't need a monk for pulling a mage will bring more to a raid any day then a monk.  <br>
<br>
I have a huge problem the way this game was itemized for casters and mellee.  Not just pop, but the entire game.  <br>
<br>
And I tell you what, my shaman should be a piece of @#%$ shaman.  He is poorly equipped, been on maybe three raids, but can do the job that a shaman is needed to do at 80% of the effectiveness of a shaman that has been raiding in VT.  That is what is called lousy balancing.  <br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
Dont really expect anything to be done about this.  My shaman will probalby always be 80% as effective as the top shaman and the my monk will probalby be 50% more effective than the average monk.  Mellee power is now spread over a much larger spectrum than ever before, while caster power is spread over a very narrow spectrum.  It just seems fundamentally wrong to me.<br>
<br>
Of course how could this ever be fixed?  I don't see any solution, so why complain.  <br>
<br>
PS. the reason mages TRoded was because that brought a hell of alot more power to the raid than anything they could do.  If rogues could make those things you would be seeing rogues chain casting rods and being torpored down.<br>

This is a fairly large misconception.  From 60 to 62 I received no upgrades in my ability to deal or take damage.  (From extensive parsings in Ssra basement.)  I have yet to take a look at the changes from 62 to 65, but plan on doing so soon.<br>
<br>
I think alot of the game is balanced upon perception.  Mages have always done incredible amounts of damage.  But they weren't perceived as powerful.  <br>

<br>
Cyr I did answer this in my Post. I will rewrite it here.A bit more lengthy then before. However I ask you respond to it before asking the question again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Kunark- Many Of our core spells are vendor sold, Infact Nearly 30% are, Of the 70% that are drops 50% of them are Sub 55 turn ins/Drops. Honestly how many mages had a tough time getting 51-54 spells?<br>
<br>
Off the top of my head the only rare spells in kunark that could not be gotten by A single group effectivly were.<br>
<br>
Velocity, CoH, Aegis(Wasnt in the game lol), 54 Water pet And Muzzle of Mardu.<br>
<br>
All the other spells could be found easily by one group in sky fire. Such as our 58+ Fire air and water pets (These were rediculously easy to get).<br>
<br>
When you look back nearly 80% Of all mage spells were extreamly <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Common </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, However there were a few that were always a pain in the arse. <br>
<br>
Much the same way as velious AND luclin. Was there really a spell that was hard for mages to get in luclin besides the pet heal?<br>
<br>
The parchment system is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> More </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Difficult then the old system the ONLY thing that has changed is that some class dont get screwed as much on certain spells. IE GSS or Malo.<br>
<br>
All they did was generlize the drops, They have in fact tho made them less common then kunark. I again point to the fact that at least one spell from every lvl (save for 55) Is sold on a vendor in kunark.<br>

<br>
Also monks in particular get a natural upgrade to 15/20 Fists. The <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> Best </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Warrior one hander in the game is 16/20. <br>
<br>
How do you justify the fact that monks get an innate upgrade like that? How do you Justify that just thru the course of lvling Monks have a weapon delay ratio=to that of a sraa/VT drop sword?<br>
<br>
Then again, How can Anyone justfy that Normal waariors have the HP of a suped out monk, Or that Rogues can out damage a monk with a kunark weapon simply because of &quot;back stab&quot;<br>
<br>
You justfy it because thats <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong> What the classes do </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Thats thier special thing, Spells are ours.

<br>
My theory has always been that the spells we obtain through general play need to be good. With lots of AA and great gear, the Spells become great.<br>
<br>
Add in some more Ancient spells that start out as great, and will turn into excellent when looted by the type of player that would actually be able to obtain them.<br>
<br>
I'd rather see the major improvements come in for 99% of mages, in the form of good obtainable spells, as opposed to seeing the gap widen between the haves and have-nots, and see 1% of mages get all of the benefits.<br>
<br>
This way, 100% of mages are improved, but the 1% I mentioned before are still better than the other 99%.<br>
<br>
Our class as a whole needed to be improved. PoP helps accomplish this. There is no problem with the way things are currently going, and I have no doubt that Cy will see some things in the later tiers that perhaps cause him to rethink his position.<br>
<br>
By balancing our class as a whole first, then adding in some goodies for the uber's, I think everyone will be better off.<br>
<br>
My comment to Cy would be, your suggestions here tend to create a ceiling for our class. Please don't complain about the way things are working now, instead request better benefits for the people who raid the high end content. Always keep the ceiling moving upwards..... <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
Monks - Hm, they're role is the best damage from the front and second *melee* damage overall I believe, however Rangers are catching up tho not sure exactly..The AC nerf really didnt do much to their power, who cares you dont tank raid mobs anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And my groups in pop usually have a monk tank and it works fine with slow<br>
<br>
Mage pets - Imo not really wanted to tank unless solo, epic is an okay tank vs a slowed mob but the mobs in pop have large attack ranges so the pets ability to tank is limited to &quot;keep the mob in place while it owns someone random&quot; unless the pet + mob are far away.  Unslowed mobs eat pets in about 4.5 seconds, it seems pets tanking ability was reduced to velious IE they have about 100 ac or something insanely low like that.. Thats fine, a pets role is to do damage just like every other non-tanking melee.  Personally I rather my pet not die and do damage.  Whoever said pets do more than monks is crazy heh, epic parsed about 60% of monks in my guild.. Like 300k to 540k damage in PoV.  People seem to forget that the mage herself does a ton of damage, in that parse I think I did around 350k in nukes <br>
<br>
I agree with Broda also that it's rather strange that casters in pop are just as good no matter if they're unguilded or in a top end guild because anyone can get the spells.  While that seems fair, it's not because melees cannot do that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So I agree in that aspect.  Also instead of making mage/necro/bst pets different VI has seemed to make them all the exact same, except give mage pets slightly more max damage which does very little.  All are level 60, and only the beastlord gets 2 pet upgrades post 61+ (since we all know our 61-65 pets are the same as they were like kunark spell levels), Unless the 65 earth pet is actually something stronger which I doubt.  <br>
<br>
VI said there wont be any more ancient spells, so likely they'll be items with effects or something.. Atleast I hope so because I sorta liked that casters were different due to gear like melees (SoA prechange, FT, Epic, etc) but epic isnt needed and everyone can get the best pet now (62 water) so I really hope VI puts in high level quest items or some such to distinguish players again, like melees have to deal with <p>Ylaine D'esibour<br>

It's not as different as everyone seems to think.  Mages get pet upgrades that aren't difficult to get, true.. but monks get fist upgrades as well which are totally free.  True maybe they shouldn't have nerfed th 18/20 fists.. It didn't seem that out of line to me, but that doesn't seem to be the only issue here. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=goladus>Goladus</A> at: 11/8/02 8:17:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=h0gfather>H0gfather</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 692<br> <font color=#333333>(11/8/02 8:14:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=394.topic&index=173>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.aus-1.au.nu/images/photo.gif width=90 height=112></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_cry.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: ummmmm</span><hr size=1> Cyricus you once told me you were an Admin on these boards, if that's not the case then I gratefully retract my statements about you representing the Tower mages.<br>

Well 15/20 is not that great.  We can't put anyting in our hands if we use this so no stats no proc and have to drop the epic, which is a glove slot and forces our fists to be 9/16.  If you can get somethign comparable to epic to put into the glove slot you will already have 15/20s with very good stats.<br>

And the most damaging warrior 1h is probalby 16/19 while monks is 17/19.  But their most damageing weapon is a twohander.  But, yes, if you want to talk about taunt which is a warrior's job then the best weapon would be the 16/20. <br>
<br>
And yes, I know about the damage table upgrades.  They don't seem to be much now, but I will find out more once I hit 65 and go back to Ssra basement to do some more parsing.  But the power increase is nothing as spectacular as the one you see from going from 55 to 60 as a mellee.<br>

The problem could just as easily have been a quirk in the design of the epic in the first place.  Indeed it was..  The epic totally replaced normal pets, which have always been earned from normal xp mobs.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, you aren't getting an upgrade to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>epic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> by getting a new pet, you're getting a sideways-mostly-upgrade to the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>epic pet</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  I, for one, will not be bagging my <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>epic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> even when I get a new pet, as the <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>epic</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> is still the best mainhand item I have.  Even when I do get better, the ability to summon an item with such good stats will always be potentially valuable on a corpse recovery.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Don´t get me wrong - i am happy with the new pet(s), but wrt to game balance it is horrible.  <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END-->I disagree.  High end mages still have lots of toys available, toys that lower end mages don't have-- that increase a high end magician's overall ability to be effective in whatever they need to be doing.<br>
<br>
Ancient spell balance?  Possible issue here.. but again Ancient spells were addressing a specific problem.  Casters had traditionally gained most of their power via levels and spells.  Most casters did not get very significant spell upgrades in Velious, while melee classes continued to get more powerful.  Ancient Spells, coming from Vulak, addressed this inbalance.  Ancient spells in Vex Thall addressed a similar issue with Luclin, but I suspect that was more a case of &quot;put those spells in Vex Thall too so that uberguilds don't have to go wipe out NToV all the time to kill Vulak&quot; kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Ancient spells are level 60.  They're still the best available for that level, and still address the issue they were meant to address, which was the imbalance that happened because casters stagnated at 60 while melees had access to more improvements.  Now casters can level again, so ancient spells aren't a concern.  Perhaps new Ancient spells should be implemented, but imo that remains to be seen.  I think they are going to rely on focus effects rather than new spells for high end casters.<br>

Hmm I hear this type of statement said a lot and I personally take issue with it.  Ok I am not in a uber guild, nor have I ever been in a uber guild. I have raided with serveral uber guilds, and done pretty much 85% of all the high end encounters outside of VT and Emp. <br>
<br>
I play about 8hrs a day. I have been playing for nearly 3 years, and I have a lvl 60 epic bard in full PoG armor, and I have a lvl 64 epic mage. During that time I led my own guild, and accomplished a number of things that i am very proud of. Now explain to me why a player like myself should not gain as you do? Are you saying that guilds that are in Vindi/Velk status are not &quot;raiding hard&quot;. Are you saying that because I am not in a VT guild that I am not worthy of improving because I am not in a guild as powerful as yours?<br>
<br>
The facts are I put in 8hrs or more per day everyday in EQ. I have.............<br>
<br>
lvl 60 epic bard<br>
lvl 64 epic mage<br>
lvl 56 druid (almost epic)<br>
lvl 52 monk (almost epic)<br>
<br>
Do you have two epic toons? Do you play nearly as much as me? By your own standards because I play more I should have more then you. Understand this my friend that you can be a hardcore player without being in a min/max 1-2% top guild. I have one account, and none of my toons have ever been PLed.  I play hard I just don't like all the crap that goes along with being &quot;uber&quot;.  So please lose the snobbish attitude thinking that only mages in VT guilds &quot;Play Hard&quot;. It simply is not true.<br>

<br>
This is what I thought early on but it really isn't true. Mages have gone back to the &quot;pet for all occassions&quot; class. Beastlords have a very nice well rounded pet. There level 64 pet does 55 to 60dps against PoP mobs with procs. That is hardly a big deal when you consider The new air pet is doing the same, and has the ability to use armor/procing weapons, and has a built in magical stun that helps reduce overall damage taken. Beastlord post 61 pets do not tank very well. They have 50% slow, and it makes them appear to tank well.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the new water pet was parsed doing 95dps in PoP. Umm the beastlord new lvl 64 pet is not even remotely close to that. Hell I parsed my lvl 62 water pet at 88dps, out doing a primal/epic lvl 62 rogue. So we have the best damage pet in the game by far. My necro friend said his pet is in the 45 to 50dps range which is even lower then the beastlord pet. However the necro pet can take advantage of mage weapons while the warders can not.<br>
<br>
Lastly it seems our new air pet is equal to the level 64 warder if not a tad bit better. They tank for about the same, and do comparable damage yet the warder doesn't cast a magic based dd stun. Our pets can proc and cast their own attack. Girdle of Magi'kot does make a big difference on pet's overall proc rate and hps. A fully armored out level 61 air pet with summoned plate armor, Girdle, Muzzle, Bo5, proccing weapons, focus gear, will out tank a lvl 64 warder and out damage him by a nice margin. Giving all the new gear to the water pet allows him to tank rather nicely for short amounts of time. I was using my water pet to take golem adds in PoV just fine once i fully buffed him up.<br>
<br>
I really think if the Air and Water pet are preludes to what we can expect from the level 65 earth pet then I can't wait. Something tells me this is going to be a defensive beast, and I wouldn't be surprised if he crits, and has the ability to do critical blows.  I mean think about it, who would have ever imaged that we would get a pet that could do 85dps or more consistantly?<br>

No one is saying that vindi/velk/whatever other example you want guilds do not deserve to improve...  The point is..everything in eq is a progression.  You progress from vindi and velk-with more power to help you with harder mobs, thus you are improving...- to the next tier and the next and the next and..you get the picture.  These people should improve.  They should be better then people who do not raid vindi or velk or etc.  Should they equal vt? no..thats part of the progression.  Otherwise...why go to vt?
