We walked out two days later, and two levels higher. (And I had a frost goblin skin, which is why I went there.) This wasn't easy at all, but here are my survival tips.<br>
<br>
There is a mob right next to the zone as you come in. He never aggro'd on me, so long as I didn't move. I would bring up a pet, tell it immediately to guard here. Then my wife would bring up her pet and we wasted the lone goblin.<br>
<br>
The next mobs are down the hall and around the corner. Don't go to them, bring them to you. Looking down the hall, pull the goblin on the right. You will get 4 goblins. We put both pets on one mob and would try to kill at least one of the 4. Mendicants are healers, and if one of them comes, put the pets on him. If there is more than one mendicant, you are in for one really tough fight. Diviners are wizards, and they hurt really bad, but they have no hit points. Two doses of my heaviest nuke usually wiped them out. If a mendicant *and* a diviner came, I would one pet on the mendy and one on the diviner, then nuke the diviner.<br>
<br>
Our pets often died on this first pull, and we were forced to zone. The important thing is to reduce the number of goblins in a war of attrition. We went through a lot of pet components. You should be fighting near the first corner, right next to the zone. This way, when the gobbies run, they can't take advantage of the pathing bug at the second corner. A mob that reaches the second corner will teleport instantly across the room to the top of the ladder. There are a lot of goblins here who will probably kill your pet, heal the runner, aggro on you, or all of the above.<br>
<br>
Also, this area is train central. Since Perma is often peopled by fewer than six players, many players will inconsiderately train things as nasty as ice giants all the way to the zone without warning. For that reason, and the pathing bug, you'll want to continue deeper for a better camp spot, like we did.<br>
<br>
The next pull is the goblin at the top of the ladder. You'll want to bring him back to the zone like before, because you're getting 4 goblins again. Basically the same proceedure for a war of attrition as before. Speed is of the essence so you don't get the ones you've already cleared repopping on you. Once you can safely reach the area on top of the ladder, life gets easier because you can pull fewer mobs and you don't have to deal with the pathing bug. Move your base of operations to small room at the top of the ladder.<br>
<br>
There is a ramp at the back of the room leading down. On the right side of the bottom of the ramp is a room with a campfire and two goblins in it. Pull first goblin you see, you will get two. There is a third goblin a little way down the hall to the left, but he won't aggro unless you let a runner get near him. Once you've cleared the campfire room you can move in, and kill the goblin in the hall at your leisure. Park your pets and yourselves on the farthest back wall of the campfire room. This is a safe spot from trains, my wife and I watched many run by, then walk back in, with no concern for us.<br>
<br>
Just past the loner in the hall there are two more on either side of the hall. These will come together, but it's only two, so they're no big hassle. After these two is a stretch of serpentine hall that is safe. Not safe from trains, but safe from goblins popping in or roamers. Now comes decision time.<br>
<br>
If you follow the hall you will see the flag room, with three goblins looking at you. (The one on the left is a little hard to see.) /con these and see how tough they are. If you pink the one on the right, you will get these three. Don't pink the one in the middle, or you will get 4 or 5 goblins. If you think you can take these three in a fight, then you can take the entire flag room. If not, you will need to stay in the campfire room and pull the hall and the top of the ramp to there. Much better, though, is pulling the campfire room, the hall, and the flag room to the &quot;safe hall.&quot; If you do this, you can leave the gobs at the top of the ramp alone, and never fight 4 at once again.<br>
<br>
Once you clear those first three in the flag room, the rest is cake. In the back of the room there are two on the left, and two on the right. You can pull one of these pairs without aggro'ing the other, though I recommend starting with the two on the right. Once these are gone, there are two more on the other side of the rock wall. All told, thats 14 mobs you can comfortably pull to the safe hall.<br>
<br>
If ever a train comes through, the train will ignore you and concentrate on whomever they're chasing, unless they catch you fighting a goblin. If they don't aggro, then run to the back of the campfire room again, and wait for the train to wander back.<br>
<br>
The cash isn't great while doing this. I found myself encumbered by 100's of silver and copper, with no close by place to change it. However, there were a lot of words dropped, as well as some bronze and ringmail, and my favorite, a bit of lichen which was light, stacked, and sold for 6gp apiece. I got rich on that stupid lichen.<br>
<br>
Finally, I never once saw a piece of Frost Goblin Skin drop. I asked the zone to let me know if they saw any, which they were happy to do. One fellow who was camping the preacher and archeologist got a piece. So I invised, ran to the archeologist room where it dropped, looted, and gated out.<br>
<br>
For me, it was a very profitable expedition. Hopefully this lengthy guide will be of use to others, as well.<br>
