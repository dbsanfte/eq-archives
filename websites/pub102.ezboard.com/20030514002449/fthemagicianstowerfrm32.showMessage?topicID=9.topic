<br>
First of all we are Mages what this means is we rely on summoned stuff pets etc.<br>
<br>
Issues we need to address are our PETS hard enough. ( My opinion no they should be better ) We are now no longer in the some power range as Druids, Necros or Enchanters why should i spend any time on my epic when he pales in comparsion to a fully buffed  mean machines that dire charm can get them.  Even without this skill pets need power upgrades they need to make people say heh get a mage his pet will rip up these mobs, rather than dont get a mage his pet might break my mez or his pet might cause a train.  Sure we should all be perfect mages but the simple fact is everyone makes mistakes and these things will happen.  The other night i wacked my toe on my desk and by the time i looked up pet had caused a massive train.  The only way to balance this is for people to see a pet as a must have rather than luxury in group.<br>
<br>
Does are summoned items get us groups or help us solo NO why they are mostly not really need and the stuff that is you can get on right clickable items.<br>
<br>
This is not a thread about pathing as this will not be fixed should it yes of course.<br>
<br>
Verant does not seem to understand our problems we need to be calm and give examples of why we feel we need things.  They might not have even thought about it from some angle.<br>
<br>
I am not asking for bigger nukes as we are masters of Summoning stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  not DD'ing.<br>

I dont think we need much but there are some simple things that would increase our powers to good lvls.<br>

You don't think our pets are tough enough?<br>
Friend, people I group with are absolutely amazed at how tough our pets are.  But it is up to YOU to teach them what our pets can do.  I do this everytime I get a chance.<br>
When I was young and fighting in DL I would calmly note that I was surprised that my pet was out-meleeing all the tanks.  Sure some melee players didn't like it, but when they reviewed the battle stats they couldn't dispute it.<br>
Now the next time they were looking for a group, do you think they wanted another melee class fighting beside them, or my pet who would save their butt if they got it trouble.<br>
Now get in a group without a chanter and watch the other players marvel when you send your pet in to solo the adds while they help the MA.  Oh look Pa, there are three tanks beating on something that the mage's pet can solo.  <br>
My personal favorite is when the puller forgets to ask the caster's mana percentage and brings another mob.  All the other casters are nearly OOM and ringing their hands.  My typical responce is &quot;Aww, you guys med.  I am at 30m and gtg.  The puller and my pet can handle this one.  IF I have to, I'll pop up and throw a heal on my pet.&quot;  <br>
Trust me, they will respect your pet.<br>
Please let me touch on another topic quick.  Perhaps the problem is not that people don't want mages in groups, but rather, mages sit on their butts at the zoneline and pathetically whine for a group.  I learned how to cure this back when I was fighting in LOIO.  START YOUR OWN GROUP!!!  Don't wait for others to have pity on you and invite you into their group.  Take some initiative and start your own.<br>
I am currently leveling in Chardok.  Sometimes its hard to get a group, since others are already far into the dungeon.  So I enter the zone shouting, &quot;Blasting and Casting uber mage and hungry pet LFG&quot; (hint, a little comedy never helps).  If no one responds, I follow it up with, &quot;Blasting and casting uber mage and hungry pet soloing because we can!!!&quot;.  If this doesn't lead to a group that has already started, people zoning into the area that see you can solo these mobs are more than ready to hook up with you.  And when they express some trepidation about being in a group of only you and them, comfort them with the words, &quot;Don't worry my pet will protect you!&quot;.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

As for getting groups i dont really have a big problem as i do start my own groups if i know the zone..  one thing that does annoy me I am a UK player i get into Seb at the right time on my server and there are lots of camps not camped so i sit there and start a group... now somtimes ill invite someone he look that theres no chanter and or cleric and disband were as if we just waited we normally can have a camp and be running in 20 -30 mins max ... <br>
<br>
Back on topic they do not need to hit harder they need lvl increases i think.  When pets are fight mobs that are Red or Yellow to him he is not effective.  I dont think it would be overpowering and would increase our dmg out put alot.<br>

I agree! Sorry folks but there will ppl that find fault with EVERTHING!!!!! There are way to many mages that made it to 60 with the tools they gave us WAY WAY to many.. <br>
<br>
<br>
I agree pets could be stronger but they are not, learn to work with them, and stop whining about them. <br>
<br>
One thing when I read this board and NEVER see ppl talk about is our debuffing spells!!! We rule in getting mobs lowered in ressist to help others to slow and kill... I just dont get it when I finally get some of these mobs debuffed I need to sit to med and let the pet work.. All logs i have viewed shows the pets doing damage.. I think if you look at the pet as a long lasting DoT it may help you understand our pets role..<br>
<br>
They gave us a NICE pet heals spells, BOY I wish, I had them when I was doing the grind to 60...<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe if we would get our post 50 focus items this would help you guys. But I know deep down someone would find something to bitch about..<br>

<br>
Really disappointed, in fact.<br>
<br>
I'd be terribly upset if I didn't play on a PvP server.  The new gear is nice to give to the pet for resists (if they even use it!), but in PvE?<br>
<br>
How about a line of things modeled after the Waterstone.  1-click invis.  1-click nullify magic.  Give us our first and only escape spell in the form of a 1-click Yonder.  5 minutes of brainstorming would give you a list as long as your arm of neat utility spells that we could get actual use out of without messing our ability to kill things.<br>
<br>
And how about they upgrade our friggin' summoned weapons already?  They weren't that good to start with, these days you can't give them away to newbies because even 4th rate Kunark twink gear weapons are better.<br>

<br>
They are immune magically to one kind of magic (basically)<br>
<br>
Fire: Fire immune<br>
Earth: Disease immune<br>
Air: Cold immune<br>
Water: Poison immune<br>
<br>
The air pet is also somewhat magic resistant. Or at least, good at resisting partially. Fighting a necro, used an earth pet, fire pet, and air pet. Of course all the pets got feared and I got owned. However, using my air pet, I noticed one very important thing. Whereas my other pets would be feared and STAY feared throughout the fight, my air pet would break the fear within 5-10 seconds, and go back to pummeling on the Necro. What that means, I don't know, but my air pet has also resisted Gravity Flux spells in Seb when I have not.<br>
<br>
Fighting last night in Fungus Grove (small group, 52 warrior, 59 sk, 55 mage (me) and 60 druid). Druid pulls 3 shrooms. I DS the group, we seperate the mobs and each tank gets one, my earth pet tanks one. Now, these shrooms slow, BUT.. knowing your pet, and having known my earth pet would not be affected by a disease based slow, while the tanks (unhasted) were beating on their shrooms, I was laying waste to mine, and even DoTing theirs, to help them along. Guess who won their respective fight first? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I finishd out first, the SK next (fairly quick succession, though I think his shroom was caught in my Sirroco spell, twice <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ), then we all ganged up on the 52 warrior's shroom and gave it a dirt nap. This wasn't a Greater Vocerate pet, either, but just the little 51 earth pet. The healer also wound up out of mana through the fight, to add to our difficulties.<br>
<br>
Magicians IN RAIDS suffer because of the inability to use pets on the raid. Magicians in Experience groups still dish out quite a bit of damage, and unlike a melee, we can spread our damage out where it's needed most, or slaughter one creature as fast as possible. What's needed isn't necessarily higher damage for our pets, but rather, Better Pathing (or better AI for pathing), the ability to use our potent pet power more often (vs fearing mobs, vs dispelling mobs, on indoor areas, vs AoE mobs). /pet hold.. kind of does this. Not really, as you have to get 59 before you can get it. Quick summoning.. kind of helps. Vs AoE mobs, disperse your pet, choose one of the type that's comming in, and in 5 seconds, you've got a big bad tank ready to beat it into oblivion, tailored to resist the mob's AoE.<br>
<br>
Know your class, know what you can do, and for heavens sake, show what you can do <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Warriors are often called for because they're simple to understand.

One thing with this pathing issues, I tell you, I have summon companion up inside places that I have no clue about pathing..  This makes life sooooo much easier then it was.(remembers the day my pet took the long way!!) Make sure pet is on guard and all you have to do is summon pet appears and hit guard again...Pet has been moved and ready to go!!!<br>

I think epic should be higher than lvl 49, and maybe some more dex. Making pet 50+ won't hurt too much, will it? Maybe just a buff or something...but it would be nice to do some damage even when I'm needed for rods 100%. <p><div align="center"><b><strong><font size="-1"><FONT COLOR="Red"> Arcius Karn</font></strong>

There is no way our pet should even compare to any type of mellee. Its called class balance, sad but true..  you have to add our nukes the pet DS.. Are you counting this in the damage?????<br>
<br>
Ppl you got to stop comparing what our pets can do compared to other classes.. Hell the logs I have seen of pets damage we are not that bad.. <br>
<br>
Ever think about asking for buffs for your pet from a shammie??? Think ppl think!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Yes I wish our pets was stronger but you know VI going to do what VI wants.. Live to learn with it.. I almost quit myself when they changed the pets agro..

<br>
Alan spent time gathering info on what the Mage class as a whole wanted to feel balanced.  We asked for a spell that made pets immune to AoE fear so we could use them on Dragons.  We got it.  We asked for pet SoW.  We got it.  We asked for pets not to eat one wave of our Rain spells.  We got it.  We asked for higher level pet heals.  We got two of them.  We asked for new pet graphics.  We got it (yeah they suck IMO but thats besides the point).  We asked for Improved Invis.  We got it.  We asked for an upgrade to the Mod Rod.  We got it.<br>
<br>
WE GOT MANY OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS WE ASKED FOR DURING THE CLASS BALANCING DISCUSSIONS!<br>
<br>
So I have to ask the question ... if our class is so screwed up, why didn't these other issues get mentioned on our class balancing talks?<br>

The fact that he says that everything is hunky dory with a class he is NOWHERE NEAR the end game of is a little insulting.<br>
<br>
As for the statment that were not all about damage, your right because we have SOOOO many other extrodinarily useful abilities, we are a damage class have been since release, PERIOD. Its fine if our pets don't outdamage melee by themselves but overall mage + pet should outdamage ANY melee. Melee have far more valuable utility in todays game with the exception of the warrior. And if you knew anything about the end game you would know our damage output is somewhere around bard level.<br>
<br>
Kal, many of these issues were mentioned, these were the problems that were semi-acknoledged, and what is called fixed on these boards is somewhat the joke, they put up summon companion and call pathing fixed? Valient Companion solves AOE fear? umm ya. <br>
<br>
You also have to realize that many of these issues didn't exist a YEAR ago when the balancing discussions took place. Back then melee didn't outdamage mages by an average of 2:1 on uber mobs, sleepers wasn't up for the semi uber guilds and vulak haden't been droping loot for a year, also if you recall melees were rebalanced with every melee recieving a major upgrade with the exception of rogues. Wizards have been upgraded several times in several different ways, mobs have only gotten tougher and we hadn't yet been shafted on the AAXP skills(dire charm anyone vs ele forms anyone?)<br>
<br>
Oh wait the solution of course to the caster problem is to raise all the ac's in luclin to a level where the casters were needed for there damage spells, completely ignore the fact that a ac level that reduces melee effectivness absolutely cripples pets.<br>
<br>
I will give that our spell list in luclin was decent(although there are as usual some glaring brain farts here as well), and that we got new pet models(as god awful as they are in my opinion). <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ubranvensaryrn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Branven Saryrn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 71<br> <font color=#333333>(1/15/02 10:46:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=9.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: We need to STOP this.</span><hr size=1> Only pet immune is water to poison eh?

Making COTH not work in some Luclin zones is a class defining nerf.<br>
<br>
We wanted pets to be immune to fear, and we got it.  It's a gimpy spell that doesn't last long enough, but we got it.<br>
<br>
We asked for pet SOW.  We got pet JBoot speed, but for some strange reason pet SOW is one of the rarest drops and there's more reasons to not cast it than to cast it.<br>
<br>
We asked for pets to not eat a wave of rains, which is really handy in PvP and made mages more welcome in AE groups.  I very rarely see AE groups so again, it's hardly an issue.<br>
<br>
Improved mod rod!  Wooo.  I never envied the necro's ability to give all his mana to other people.  That ability sucks.  Having a good use for your own mana would be a lot cooler.<br>
<br>
We got pet heals.  So... Quick trivia quiz.  Would you rather:<br>
A) Spend 400 mana to heal your pet for 900 hit points or<br>
B) Spend 400 mana to summon a new Greater Voceration pet for 2800 hit points?<br>
<br>
The heals are a red herring.  Distracting, but not that useful.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically we asked for meat and potatoes and we got a couple of cookies, a pat on the head and a point towards the door.  How about 1 nuke with Lure style resist rates?  How about upgrading pet melee damage across the board to reflect the MASSIVE increases to player melee damage since the game came out?  How about better alternate skills than these halftime elemental forms?  How about letting pre-epic mages be damage dealers like we were pre-Kunark?<br>
<br>
I made my mage after leveling a warrior to 58.  Frankly, warriors got spoiled.  My damage output jumped bigtime with Kunark and then again with Velious.  Skills like Defensive made me a solid #1 tank.  Those were some real, big time, heavy hitting, serious enhancements.<br>
<br>
What did YOU get?  Pets they won't let you summon in raids, a COTH spell and a greater ability to give your mana to people who can cast REAL spells?<br>

<br>
Actually AE groups aren't the issue with this change.  Scintilation never hit our pets.  It's rain spells like Sirocco that would hit the pet for one wave while hopefully hitting the MOB for three.  If anyone uses a Rain spell in an AE group they need to have their head examined.  Sirocco is a Mages most mana efficient damage spell if at least two waves hit for full.  It's one that I regularly keep memed and am quite happy that my pet no longer eats a wave.<br>
