<br>
60 Water pet always has been very close to epic pets melee ability. I remember parses posted months ago of epic and water against shrooms in FG and in those I think a maxed water actually outmeleed the epic (in any case the results where nearly the same melee dps so statistical errors could account for the small difference).<br>
<br>
The highest level mob I've routinely seen Epic land procs on is 60. My epic was landing procs on even cons in ToV yesterday and he routinely lands procs on the Lvl 60 nameds in Umbral (assuming they are susceptable to cold). I cannot recall him landing procs on Lvl 61+ ToV mobs with any regularity, if at all.<br>
<br>
I think pet levels need to be upped (especially epic now that all pets are summoned at Lvl 4<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  so that at least the spells and procs at least stand a chance of landing on the 65+ mobs.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ucydmab.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cydmab</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 542<br> <font color=#333333>(7/29/02 10:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=610.topic&index=23>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: epic pet.. </span><hr size=1> I also ran these tests prior to and after the patches (I got the logs somewhere arounds here, I never bothered posting them since the end result in my mind wasn't too exciting (epic pet still better than water pet)). Basic result was the same: (max) water pet dps and epic pet dps were essentially the same. In one sense the epic pet gained some ground because it's damage got raised to 79 while water pet's max is still 68 (70 focused). So first off: water pet meele dps from the rear has ALWAYS been in parity with epic pet (although one had to do some work to get a max or near max hitting pet before)<br>
<br>
For those that don't know, pets do not proc on level 61+ mobs. They'll land procs like crazy on level 60 mobs, but do absolutely nothing on a level 61. <br>
<br>
I have never seen any evidence anywhere that water pet and epic pet's underlying attack characteristics were different. Same % hit rates, same percentage of max damage average hits. Essentially the water pet does just over 10% less damage per hit (70 max versus 79 max), but gains backstabs which roughly cancel out the lost damage.<br>
<br>
Let's not forget for soloing and grouping, epic pet BLOWS AWAY water pet (and most of the other pets 95% of the time) because of procs, damage shield, stuns, and extra hit points. Furthermore, on raids in guilds with pre- SoDs or luclin-weapons, the epic pet is likely to be one of the highest taunt entities fighting the mob. This means nukers and healers can manage aggro relative to the pet, as opposed to a warrior wielding epics or something.<br>
<br>
So, let's see, in a guild with uber equipped level 60 warriors, on raids against level 61+ mobs, on the fraction of mobs where it is easy to get the pet behind the monster, and when the mage is level 60, THEN the mage can summon a pet (GV focused water) with simular effectiveness to a mage with an epic pet.  I see *no* problem with this state of affairs. Hell, how many level 60 non-epiced mages are there in guilds with the warriors wielding SoDs or better? If there are any, they are probally feeling gimp enough as it is; do you really want to nerf GV water further relative to the epic pet?<br>
<br>
About the only buff to the epic pet I'd like to see is allow his procs to land on any level mob; I personally find the level 60 mob cut off to be arbitrary, and possibly even a bug/oversight ala the haste cap. This would also have no effect on soloing and almost no effect on exp groups. <p>Sage Cydmab Promethean <BR>

<br>
soo... baring that in mind... <br>
<br>
if 1 person spend 500 hours on lvl <br>
shouldn't be too far off from someone else who spent their time doing 500 hour epic instead. <br>
<br>
and when i said the only hard part is in PoA i mean in terms of mob difficulty only ... not the diffculty of getting the pieces (i.e. i think the cloak is a difficult piece but the mob itself is easy to kill) <br>
<br>
but i assume spending 80 hours should get the cloak and another 100 hours should be good for hate staff ... and crown .... it depends on your guild because there isn't much OPEN PoA raid like Hate ... soo .. that's what i meant by diffcult in my last post.. <br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Whether you use it for its entire range of purposes or not, it is far and away the best pet in the mage arsenal.

<br>
for those of you think epic is NOT that much better than water..<br>
<br>
take monk epic for example say in kunark era.. <br>
i can say that monks are not getting that much better with epic at 60 at raids and when grouped with shaman and chanter too... <br>
<br>
Since if he has some kind of haste item(CoCW/CoF .. even RBG), plus chanter haste is already at haste cap. ... epic effect become redundant ... also, for stats shamans get buff that will make the epic itself seemed like a minor increase. <br>
<br>
BUT does that mean monk epic is no good nor it's effects is not nice to have? <br>
I wouldn't think so. <br>
<br>
same goes with mage... just because you ONLY use your epic in situation where it's AC/DS/STUN is unimportant doesn't mean it DOESN't EXIST and not an improvement from water... <br>
<br>
also note... U HAVE TO position water from behind to make almost the same dmg. ... which in most cases in soloing you can't .. and if in group .. it takes a bit to do depends on the tank in group is lazy or not. <br>
<br>
so... in reality, unless the mobs are all stationary and will not hit back like the soulbinder.... epic will be superior to GV water by a margin .... <br>
<br>
of course it's again just IMO.... feel free to comment and whatnot.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/upromethiuz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Promethiuz</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#333333>(7/29/02 12:42 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm29.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=610.topic&index=25>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: hm...</span><hr size=1> Something about Monk epic that is often overlooked.

Our 60 Water Pet is now close to our Epic (Damage</span><hr size=1> few things, <br>
<br>
1) he talking about melee output against 61+ mobs, don't come talking about pet overall dmg output in xp groups, this is not what he's talking about and is not relevant to the point he's trying to make.<br>
<br>
2) Mobs at that level WILL be positioned well, otherwise you will wipe out, simple, he mentioned it, yet people still come back and say... wa wa wa my guild don't position trakanon good! Cool, you only missed the fact we not talking about trakanon or your guild here.<br>
<br>
3) He isn't ignoring pet procs, procs are irrelevant at that level. Don't say pet procs raise his dps in xp situation, that has nothing to do with this discussion.<br>
<br>
4) beside the point but i think people exagerate the difficulty of getting a crown. It might have been hard to get up there with old world and/or kunark gear, when quest got implemented. But it was killed PRE-kunark, when yeshkas were uber, it's droppeable... I mean c'mon, now with weapons that break 1:1 ratio, every damn tank AC reaching softcaps, manaburn, AAs, velious and luclin gear. The worst thing you'll encounter in PoA has 32k hp... not like that's difficult. Nowadays a pack of wizzy can drop 125k hp mob in 3 seconds. Mage epic is fine, the biggest pain imho is STILL the freakin pegasus cloak, it was when I completed it, still is to this day. ^_^<br>
<br>
So imho the real discussion to have here is : How should lvl 60 water pet compare to epic melee-wise.<br>
<br>
My quick answer is i'd expect greater voc. water to be very close to epic pet melee wise. Wich he is. <br>
<br>
My longer answer is while I can live easily with equal MELEE dmg output, imho a mage with epic should have a little edge over a non epic mage in the high end raiding game. This is not really happening since at that level the damage output will come primarily from melee. <br>
<br>
Since raising melee output of epic would also affect a lot of other situation where he's already dominant, we need to look elsewhere imho. The simplest way I could see is to make pet be able to land procs on raid level mobs, eighter by &quot;fakin&quot; they are higher level when they cast/proc, or by making proc lure type, or by removing whatever is preventing pet spell output to land.<br>
<br>
And also eighter fix air pet damage a bit or make him a KICK ASS tanking pet.<br>

I know intially they kept them low level so as not to trivialize content.  I you went through a dungeon with your pet up you stood a good chance of having mobs agro on your pet because of his lower level even if they didn't agro on you.  But now with non agro pets agro and levels only come into play when you tell the pet to attack a particular mob.  Then why not raise their levels a bit.  The only advantage is that they will hit better than they currently do against the kinda mobs we all face today.<br>

Perhaps on the rooted mobs (creator, AL, HP, etc), but alot of the other mobs either get pinned on the wall without a reverse pin, or shift around as the MT gets tossed a few feet in various different directions.  I think it is unrealistic to assume that you will get 100% backstabs on any mob except reverse-pins and rooted mobs and for my guild that is only perhaps half of what we kill (and yes I am talking about everything in luclin emp, etc and not trak)<br>
<br>
The other issue I have and the reason I made all the posts in the first place is that the title of this post is not &quot;Hmm... Our 60 Water Pet is now close to our Epic only when attacking level 62+ raid mobs when it can backstab&quot; which to me is a pretty huge qualifier.  It's just a straight &quot;Hmm...

It's just like seeing an advertisement that says in big letters at the top &quot;New BMW just $1&quot; and then in fine print at the bottom of the add you see &quot;with payments of $2,000 per month for 2 years&quot;<br>

Call me picky but this title seems like false advertising and that's why I responded in the way I did. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90022>Xoran</a href>

You could ask the guild to change the facing of the mob for you, but that might screw up healing and other stuff and may be a pretty big change just to squeeze out an extra 3 dps from a pet.<br>

50% I would consider a high figure, because sometimes even if you could put the pet behind the mob, you wouldn't want to (for balance reasons) <p>Sage Cydmab Promethean <BR>

<br>
/sarcasm off<br>
<br>
Seems really weak to compare one pet to the other in such a one sided way. If you'd like to compare the mob in a few more situations I might be more inclined to agree that the epic needs a bigger damage upgrade. Put the Water pet in a tanking situation and compare them then. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Seems to me that the Epic pet should be the best pet, maybe not in any one area, but when you combine all of the parts together.<br>

Our 60 Water Pet is now close to our Epic (Damage</span><hr size=1> I think the fact that the epic pet can equal or outdamage the BACKSTABBING water pet is crazy.  If this proves anything, its that the epic puts out some sick damage.  95% of the time it will also be landing some cray dd spells on top of that.  Add to that it has over 4 k hps now, a SICK damage shield, higher ac and you get the picture.  <br>
<br>
I have NEVER seen a raid/group that positions a mob so you can BS all the time.  I also have a 60 rogue in a good guild and can speak from someone who is conscience of where/how a mob is positioned.  Sometimes a mob kills the MT and will start turning around till aggro is reestablished with the ST or SA.  Mobs will be pushed back into walls and you can BS etc..  I think its cool that the epic can keep up with a 200+ bs'ing 60 water pet with no spells and the pet BS'ing 100% of the time.  <br>

<br>
1. epics are level 55 gear.  Seeing it do 5% better than your level 60 pet should be cause for celebration. Think of how many classes bank their epics, or simply ignore them.<br>
<br>
2. no way in bloody hell should mage pets get any more powerful.  Your fooling yourself if you think your pet in any way shape or form from level 1-60 is &quot;underpowered&quot;. Your pet is easily 70% of a melee, and you are at least 50% of a wizard.  Only in raids agianst FR/MR mobs are mages not as useful. (and even then you just having stacking problems, not that your class is unneeded)<br>
