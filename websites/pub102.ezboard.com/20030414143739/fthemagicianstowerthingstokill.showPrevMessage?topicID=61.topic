<br>
Besides scouring the bazaar and allakahzam for resist gear numbers, I am curious about how the strategies have changed.  The last post I could find here for OWD raids was dated Jan '01.  Since then a lot has changed.<br>
<br>
For starters, pets no longer get aggro.  I read that pets used to be a no no on OWD raids because they would get feared and bring back trains.  Is it OK to pull out a pet now?<br>
<br>
While I really like discovering these types of things out for myself, I figure it would be better for me to be fully informed ahead of time.  <br>
<br>
If anyone has some Vox/Naggy info fresh in their mind, I would love to hear it.  The good so I can try it, and the bad so I can avoid it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><DIV style="position:relative; width=80%; filter:Blur(Add = 1, Direction = 225, Strength = 10)">

Old world dragons are truly a joke anymore.. get your resists up to 150 unbuffed and you will probably never get touched (expecially when you add your elemental buff and a fire shield against naggy for the extra FR) nuke at 50% and that's about all you need to know.. I always use 49 fire for naggy and 49 water for vox, but use whatever you want.. give it a couple daggers, a shiled, and a blanket and you are good to go he probably won't get touched anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Was quite a fun day so lemme start at the top.<br>
<br>
For starters, I logged on at 6:00pm in PoK.  50%XP into 43, and the max recommended level to go is 44.  Did not matter because I did not even know the dragons were up.  I do my usual summoning routine, SoW, lev, invis, and run to my hunting ground of choice - The Lake of Illiterate Morons.  Found the bloodgills completely free except for a single 55+ druid camping the marauder.  He was really nice and gave me and pet PoTC.  Started my 12 goblins in 9 minutes routine.<br>
<br>
About 6:45, guildmate comes on and asks who all is going for vox/naggy.  Like a typical newbie sweathog I yell &quot;ooooh ooooh oooh!  I wanna go!  Please please please!?&quot;  Gotta be 44 to go, and I am now 65% into 43.  Gotta be at the raid (in permafrost) at 7:45.  I tell them that I will be there, and I will be 44.  They laughed and said OK.  Since each pass of 12 goblins is 12% XP on a 15 minute spawn timer, the math just added up.  3 full passes and I would ding, with 15 minutes to spare.<br>
<br>
The math was really close.  I dinged 44 at 7:35.  Time to run!!  I SoW up, and gate back to PoK.  Dump my loot, grab my backpack with the 44 spells, and grab my backpack of resist gear.  Run full speed for the Halas stone and then Full speed to Permafrost.<br>
<br>
Being really close to the mark, a guildie suggested I send tell to the raid leader that I was OMW.  She was very nice and helpful, and really glad that a mage would be there.<br>
<br>
Finally zoned into Permafrost, but got a little lost on the way to Kings Rock.  Sat down and caught my breath.<br>
<br>
/who magician<br>
There is 1 player in Permafrost Keep<br>
44 Magician Morillion (Erudite) LFG<br>
<br>
So I am the only mage on this raid,eh? Cool.  I start scribing my spells in order of importance. - Mod rod, Elemental armor, Shock of Swords...etc<br>
<br>
As a courtesy, I offered mage stuff over the chat channel.  BOOM!  I was instantly the most sought after person in the raid.<br>
&quot;Shard Please&quot;  &quot;Shield Plz&quot;  &quot;Rod Please&quot;  &quot;Arrows Please&quot; &quot;Bracelet Please&quot; &quot;Blanket Please&quot;.  Everything except blankets was available and it was fun to have a mob.<br>
<br>
I finally got grouped and junk buffed then real buffed.  Had quite a collection of icons and more than double my normal hit points.  I had over 100 CR with gear, and with buffs it was over 160.  Meanwhile there were several groups in the front who were fighting multiple Ice Giants and Spiders.<br>
<br>
The fight for vox started, and my group was finally called in.  I did a summon companion on the pet and sent him in to fight.  I managed to get below her and get 2 Cinder Bolts off before she died.  I resisted her breath and fear 3 times, and one landed for a good deal of damage.  Pet ran off somewhere, and I had to summon him back after she died.<br>
<br>
All in all, a fun fight, and super cool to do.  Only 2 deaths. We do the loot thing, but there is nothing I can roll for.  Next up: Naggy!<br>
<br>
I get a port to Lavastorm, and we regroup.  Do the LFG stuff, and switch out CR gear for MR/FR gear.  Get a group, and follow into SolB.  We run through, and our group and 2 others have to hold the spider room.  Lots of hit points for such little spiders.  <br>
<br>
We finally get called up to the throne room.  I helped out with several fire giants.  We get called up to the bind corner, and then to the buff room.  Get quite a few buffs again, and we prepare the assult.<br>
<br>
The fight begins, and at 60 pct health, our group is finally called.  We run in and I send pet to fight.  <br>
<br>
&quot;you lose control of yourself&quot;.<br>
<br>
I got caught by the Dragon Roar spell, and so did pet.  We both just froze in place and watched  the whole fight, and could not move until after it was dead.  No spells, no pet melee.  My dps was zero.  Fun to watch, but I was a bit put out.<br>
<br>
Well, we had a few deaths that were quickly rezzed.  They started out on the loot.  Naggy dropped 3 books that night, which must be some kind of record, because everyone was in shock.  When the items up for bid came up, I managed to win a roll on Rokyls Channeling Crystal.  EE III and 50 hp/mana.  Pretty sweet.<br>
<br>
So that was my dragon raid experience.  If you have never done it and are under lvl 52, I highly recommend it.  It was an extremely organized and effective raid, and I learned quite a bit.<br>

If she gets backed into a wall, she no longer gets interrupted, and CHeals herself. Its all over then.<br>
<br>
With normal melees, they can switch sides when she nears a wall, and push the other way.  A pet group would have a difficult time getting pets off of her, then on the other side of her.  It could be done, in theory, but considering her AoEs, backing the pets off would be difficult at best.<br>
<br>
Plus that assumes that the pets won't get feared.<br>
<br>
Still, it would be interesting to try non-conventional groups vs. Vox.  Right now, Tunare has a dragon database, and weekly dragon raids that are coordinated with the server board.  Every week is the same thing - 8 to 10 groups of lvl 44-52 peeps going in to get raid credit and a chance at seniority for the ND loot.  The first 4 groups are always the same, with monk pullers, pallys, and cleric.  The rest of the casters get dumped in the group 5+.  It was fun at first, but there is no challenge to it at all. <p><div align="center"> <a href="#"><img src="http://www.nemeandesign.net/eq/sig2.jpg" width="382" height="66" border="0" onClick="window.open('http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=528641', 'morillion', 'WIDTH=800,HEIGHT=600')"></a> </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=krankenthegnome>Kranken the Gnome</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 399<br> <font color=#333333>(2/27/03 2:03:01 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerthingstokill.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=439.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Storytime</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>No two magicians epic or no epic can take down Vox, however one gropu of lv 60 people could likely do it if it was possible to engage her without getting banished.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

If vox did not banish she would be mage soloable<br>

Vox is only level 53 or 54.  A well equipped level 65 mage would have no problem solo'ing Vox, considering some of the mobs they are taking on. <p>--------------------------<br>

<br>
The people in that thread has soloed a lot of dangerous mobs, including mobs that are very-very tough and they were also likely a bit lucky.<br>
<br>
One standard group of lv 60 people (warrior, cleric, enchanter + 3 damage dealers) if they know what they do should be able to take down Vox without a problem. In all likelihood they don't even have to be lv 60 all of them.<br>
<br>
It isn't the 32khp that is the problem or the fearing or the despelling. The summoning is dangerous but survivable. When people are whiping killing Vox it is usually due to one of two things: She gets walled, CH's and kills everybody or she doesn't get interupted, CH's and kills everybody. I am having great trubble in seeing how a magician solo would handle the CH.<br>
<br>
Naggy on the other hand is a different beast, because he doesn't CH. It would still be a tough fight, but not entirely impossible.<br>
