<br>
That it's commonly viewed as a middle ground between the two isn't in dispute.  That it's a predictable developmental stage of history, which naturally precedes and follows other such stages, is hogwash.  The latter is what the definition asserted.<br>
<br>
I will not respond to the ad hominem portions of your post.<br>
<br>
Cerios:<br>
<br>
&quot;This actually reminds me of when I was young and I was having a debate with an uncle of mine, and he was saying how mad it made him that people were stealing from his store, because it meant that the store would have to raise its prices. I being about 10 years old at the time asked him why that was, as he tried to explain to me that if the store was to stay in buisness that they would have to raise there prices to maintain there profitability thereby costing all the honest consumers more. Well by this point anyone with half a brain listening to him would have understood the stupidity of his argument but to him the logic was simple straight forward and definitly had never actually been thought threw. &quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, I'll bite -- your uncle's argument is sound.  He has X amount of product which he sells for a certain amount to maintain profitability.  If his stock is reduced unexpectedly because it's stolen, he has to charge more for the remaining stock to maintain profitability.  What the heck is stupid about that?<br>
<br>
Cerios:<br>
<br>
&quot;As to your last point, the inefficenicies of goverment, its quite obvious you don't really have any idea what your talking about when it comes to the mechanics of goverments. Dollar for dollar goverments are without a doubt far more efficent then even the most efficent capitalist orginizations of any real size and are far less prone to corruption.&quot;<br>
<br>
You have not posted any data to support this claim.  In fact, the long term inefficiency of state run business is well documented.  A state run business does not *need* to be efficient, it needs only to provide the basic minimum of service to continue.  A business competing with other businesses, on the other hand, must necessarily outperform other businesses or it will go under.  It's a question of necessity.<br>
<br>
The fact is that the capitalist consumer has real power to influence efficiency:  he chooses, with his pocketbook, what sort of business is rewarded and what sort is not.  With every purchase he determines which business stays afloat and which sinks.  <br>
<br>
Conversely, the consumer in the position of dealing with a socialised business (which does not compete with others) is weak.  If he is dissatisfied with the way the business is run, he must whine to those in charge, hoping they'll see it his way.  He is reduced to the status of a child begging favours of a parent.<br>

The trade off comes between spending money and getting rapid service.  In the US we have a healthcare system where if you don't have money you don't get service, but if you have money you get service and usually very quickly.  If you look at Canada, a country with a more socialistic healthcare system, yes everyone is covered, but instead of getting seen by a doctor right away you may be waiting a week or two or more to be seen.  Also Canada is running into the problem of doctors refusing to perform medical procedures becuase the clinics/offices/hospitals are doing nothing but losing money because everyone is entitled to healthcare.  So what good is a bankrupt healthcare system that can't provide support to anyone.  <br>
The idea of socialism, as with communism, is good on paper but when applied to the real world it falls apart.  The largest problems with giving away something like healthcare to everyone when not everyone can afford it is that 1.) you have an unequal distribution of the burden of payment, or 2.) you have a system that's giving out more money in healthcare than it's taking in.  Personally I don't like the idea of my money going to pay for someone elses drugs, so option 1 is out.  As for option 2... well the problems with that can be seen in Canada.  The basis of &quot;universal&quot; healthcare, just like social security, is that you have more people paying into it than people using it and this will only work for a time.  <br>

Here are two cents of mine.<br>
<br>
I assume most of the people that posted here are american, which I am not. I am danish, so the comment may be flavored by looking over the pond.<br>
<br>
The american political system is dominated by the two big parties, republicans and democrats. I know that people occational try to start some other parties or run as individuals, but are usually not very successful in getting much support. So, because you have the two parties, if you are not a republican, then you must be a democrat. It is a bit two-dimentional. If this is how it usually works, it is easy to transfer this to other things. Neither the republican party or the democratic party has much in common with a comunist. So, because USSR for a long time was the enemy, was comunist and used socialism as a way to run the country, and because USA was 'the good guys', wasn't comunist and used capitalism as a way to run the country it is easy to say that comunism = socialism. This is not correct, but comunism has often embraced socialism.<br>
<br>
I myself is used to a lot of political parties and so are a lot of european countries. It has happend that one political party has had absolute majority but only very rarely so. What most often happen is that the goverment ends up consisting of a coalision of parties, with a bias towards either right wing or left wing. It has also happend that even minor political parties has gotten a significant influence on the politics run by the goverment.<br>
<br>
What I ment to say with this is, that it is all shades of grey and there are more poles in the system than just capitalism, socialism, comunism and so on.<br>

The federal government says they can only dump so much into the health care fund, and the provinces say they can only dump so much into the health care fund.  But every year both provincial and federal governments run a surplus.  The provinces all except Alberta have some sort of provincial sales tax.  Alberta collects royalties from oil.  That money is supposed to go into health care and education but it has as of late gone into paying down provincial debt and 17% wage increases for the MLAs.  <br>
If we examine the problems with Canada's socialism it all comes down to provinces wanting more control.  I am a firm beleiver in one strong central government for the people.  However this will only happen if by some fantastically odd twist of fate we get a majority NDP government with a Prime Minister with the balls to start recinding provincial rights and taking over the resources and industry of the richer provinces.<br>

<br>
The general argument for socialism seems to be the mistaken impression that 'People are equal'.  People are not equal.  All men are, to coin a phrase, NOT created equal.  Certain people have genetic potentials which are different that others.  Some people are born stronger, some faster, some smarter.  Each person has advantages and disadvantages, and it is THEIR job to optimize their skillsets for those advantages.<br>
<br>
I work my ass off to make a very good living at a very young age.  I entered the work force at 16 and have been working full time doing software ever since.  The wonderful government of this fine country/state (/snort) collects close to 40 percent of my paycheck to pay for things I neither want, nor need, for other people.<br>
<br>
Social Security?  It won't be there when I retire.  And I'm already planning for retirement.  I won't need it.  And yet I'm forced to pay for it.  We know it's dying.  All it is is a vestigal system designed to buy pills for people too inept to plan for retirement.<br>
<br>
Welfare?  Even better.  I spend my hard earned money so some prostitute can pop out twelve kids (welfare pays by the kid, dontchaknow) and use the income to pay for drugs.  My hard earned money buys drugs for whores.  Doesn't that make me warm and fuzzy.<br>
<br>
People are not equal.  Go to college, get a damn job and work for your living like everyone else.  There are two basic needs.  Food, shelter (defining clothing as shelter).  There are plenty of homeless shelters (which I support), and anyone can find food.  Hell, churches and charities (which I donate to) hand it out like candy.<br>
<br>
Beyond that?  Toughy lucky. Medicine is expensive, education is a luxury.  Ideally, yes, I'd provide medical care, but PRACTICALLY (something many of you don't seem to be) we can't do it.  There is no system that can be implemented to provide free, good medical care for everyone.<br>
<br>
I like the luxuries in life.  Between my car, EQ accounts, movie tickets, cable plan and cable modem, I probably spend more than enough to support a family or two.  But you know what, and this is the part people aren't going to like?  I'm fine with that.  I work, I buy things I like and enjoy them.  My ability to drive in style, enjoy quality TV and play EQ is, quite frankly, more important to me in the grand scheme of things than some gutter-trash who decides her crack is more important to her than her career.<br>
<br>
I was raised to work.  Taught to learn.  I went to crappy schools, but I didn't learn there.  I learned in books.  Public libraries are free, and from them I derived enough knowledge to make a good life for myself.  There is no reason anyone else in the US can't do the same, except Laziness.  And there is no way you can tell me it's fair to make me pay for other peoples' laziness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=darkerplanes>DarkerPlanes</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(1/14/03 8:50:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=68>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   this post is still here?</span><hr size=1> my god, I can't believe this post is still here.... lol<br>

The quality / intelligence of the posts runs the gamut from inanely absurd to thoughtful and concise. Given this, and also given that I do not wish to become involved in ideological arguments, I still wish to contribute.<br>
<br>
First, a little of my background so you know where I'm coming from. I am probably older than most of you, maybe younger than some. I have had the distinct pleasure of living and / or working (I am an American) in Japan, Korea, Mexico, Italy, Guam, Greece, and Egypt. This does not make me smarter than those who haven't, it just gives me a wider experience base to work from. I am generally conservative in my politics. My spouse and I make an amount of money that I dreamed about as a youngster; nonetheless it is not considered a GREAT deal of money in today's society (well, at least in today's American society).<br>
<br>
Generally, people who feel very strongly about anything, political or not, are really on the fringe of society. It does not matter whether their views are conservative or liberal.<br>
<br>
Here are a couple of examples:<br>
<br>
&quot;My own experiences have shown that IN GENERAL, the weatheir folk get, the higher in an organizational position, the more lousy, greedy, scummy, back stabbing, moronic, out of touch, un-knowing of the company's actual business etc they get, grrr.<br>
Fact of life is that folk who are powerful, again as a GENERAL RULE, in *any* system, tend to be SCUM BAGS, because scum bags trash anyone and anything to get ahead&quot;..... &quot;Maybe more folk need to see death and destruction before they realize WTF is so important about HUMAN LIFE and happiness.&quot;<br>
<br>
Ok, who are the wealthy people you have been associated with? How are they scum bags? I DO happen to know people that are very well off. They did not get that way by cheating or hurting others. You cannot group ANY segment of the population by a stereotype. That in itself is no better than racism. Have you yourself experienced this death and destruction you tout? More than likely not. Just a guess here, but I bet you are pro-abortion (I am NOT trying to start a debate about the pros and cons of abortion. I am merely citing what I think is an inconsistency of logic dealing with &quot;the importance of human life.&quot;)<br>
<br>
Here is another:<br>

&quot;i dont understand all you socialism supporters out there .... i would be forced to give most of my income in taxes to the government, allowing only enough to pay my bills .... i dont want to merely exist and pay ungodly amounts of taxes and/or give my money away to others .... i dont see why you support socialism(damn evil communisim) ....&quot;<br>
<br>
After going through these threads, I do not think most of the posters are advocating socialism or communism. In the USSR, citizens were not forced to give back what they had earned, they just earned very little, and most knew only that they were poor. They did not really have access to information that would have allowed them to make a serious comaprison; and no, socialism is definitely not communism.<br>
<br>
What I have learned from personal experience and inferred from watching history unfold around me is this: generally speaking, it does not matter what kind of economic or ideological system you live with, if you want to succeed and prosper within your environment, you can, whether you do that on the backs of others or not. I am not saying that all political or socioeconomic systems are good or even desireable. I merely speak of possibilities. <br>
<br>
Lastly, the people that make the most noise with angry and hostile arguments are probably people that don't really know what they are talking about. They tout data they claim to be facts even though much of it cannot truly be verified. They are most likey uneducated or immature. In many instances, they are probably people that feel wronged or downtrodden in some way and have either chosen someone else to blame or have been told someone else is to blame. Our current world situation is a perfect example of this very thing.<br>
<br>
Have I ruffled some feathers with this commentary? Probably, though that was not truly my intention. Like others have said, I just felt like putting in my two coppers worth.<br>

<br>
Social will not work without Capitalism. They are forever tied, hand in hand.<br>
(Insert Socialism here)..You cannot give away something you have none of. <br>
Free education, sure great, they would be truley a good thing to happen to those who cannot afford to pay for it. But whose going to pay the teachers who are to teach it? And if that is figured out, &quot;the payer albiet&quot; Whose the one giving the money? Oh ...wait... what is that you say... we dont have the money? Hmm looks like we need to rasie the money for that to occur. ( insert Capitalism right here).<br>
<br>
(Insert Socialsm here)<br>
Free Health Care, Man that would be just &quot;peachy&quot;.<br>
Hmm need a cure, gotta find someone who can discover, or be able to research it. Hmmm.. he's gonna need equipment..... hmmm he's gonna need help.... hmm gonna need funding for all of this... and I think we should have some of the brightest ( see first example on education).....to get it to go forward. Oh wait... this is going to need to be &quot;FUNDED&quot;...( Insert Capitalism right here).<br>
<br>
Get the idea yet?<br>
The 2 will forever be intertwined. Sorry but thats the truth. While the Ideal ( of Socialism) in its basic concept is good, and why Capitalism is good in that it supports the &quot;Ideal&quot;... there is one thing that has always ( and it was said earlier in this LONG forum).. and forever will rear its ugly head. ( and for those of you misconstrued and decided to seperate the two).. is Greed. ( not laziness AND Greed. Laziness IS  Greed. Greed of ones lifestyle ( good or bad) and not wanting to change it, knowing that it can be if one tries and has the willingness to make it so.<br>
<br>
Granted some of the worlds countries poorrest people dont have to much to choose from in the way of changing their lifes to make it better. So I'm not including that. THose are true area's that need the help of general countries that have the ability to help. Dont give them just food and water, teach them to farm and cultivate.<br>
<br>
TO forcefully make those that have come to the realization, that in order to make it NICE, or BETTER for those around us less fortunate(not by choice or course), that befreo we can help them you HAVE to help yourself. This is another one of those common sense things that people often skip. I see alot of smart, intelligent people, that lack common sense.<br>
<br>
To those of you posting on this discussion about how we should take care of everyone in the world regardless of their desicisions ( I dont see you turning your PC off that you just used to post here and selling it and then giving that money away to them). Stop you;re only fooling yourself, in fact you probably just logged on to EQ to play a few more hours.<br>
<br>
And for those you can search web sites and get definitions, and other &quot;critically' interesting data.<br>
However interesting or &quot; smart&quot; it might look, to those who are informed and have thought deeply about these things, and or experienced them... know better. It wont help you.<br>
And finally a lesson in politics that might help. ( take it with a grain of salt)...<br>
Communism is the Ideal of Socialism... at Gunpoint.<br>

Assets and belongings aren't always considered part of wealth, but rather as the result of wealth.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Not to sidetrack into an exestentalist and Marxists viewpoints here, but...just throwing out food for thought.<br>
<br>
A.  Assets ARE monitary weath IF they can be tranfered into money.  Hence, sell a home, get a few million dollars (money, itself...just transfered into a different form, still the same on your financial statement in either form..thus STILL overall 'monitary' WEALTH).<br>
<br>
<br>
B.  If someone is well educated and intelligent, they COULD very well be BROKE their whole life...but NEVER poor.  Education is a form of wealth (due to INCREASED quality of life...another FORM of wealth).  Some people use it and some do not. <br>
<br>
Or if you want to talk about economics itself per authoritarian socialism,  as in the U.S.S.R., The Union of Soviet SOCIALIST (NOT communist) Republic.  Karl Marx theorizes on (autoritarian socialisim AS pre-communism tranferance) that in economy, QUANTITY (of goods OR actions) EFFECT quality.  Thus, the more, the RICHER (monitarily OR lifestyle wise).  Or the OVER production...causing lack of demand and low economic states.<br>
<br>
As for DEMOCRATIC Socialism...well, I don't have much to add that has not already been discussed.  Plus I have a patient in 5 minutes, LOL!  <br>
<br>
But I will say this, when I was younger I though it was a GREAT theory.  Now that I have seen it in practice, I think that QUALITY (of life, healthcare, education) go DOWN for eveyone under a democratic socialist system.<br>
<br>
  My husband who is English disagrees.  He like the idea of EVERYONE getting medical care, become better educated when they want/need it (like he had in England).  I think that (in the US at least) we STILL have that.  Medicare pays for people with health problems who can NOT afford.  State University systems give GRANTS (no LOANS) for people to attend collage if they can not afford it, etc.  So I see no NEED to tax us all to over 50% when we already ARE taking care of people that need to be helped.  JMO<br>
<br>
But ya know...a lot DOES come down into what you are born into.  Education (among other things...primarly travel and age) can manipulate it.  Either way though...that's life.  Some people have a CHOICE to create their own paths and some people DO NOT (in places where they are TOLD what to do and ONLY what to do and are not educated enough to know the get the hell outa there and strive for more). <p><center><img src="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/DraccaSig.gif"><br><br><b><font face="garamond" size=3><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=543802">My Magelo Profile</a></center><font size=0 font face=garamond font color=black></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=draccaviir>Dracca Viir</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.boomspeed.com/apothokeri/staricon.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 1/22/03 9:08:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=caenn>Caenn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#333333>(1/23/03 9:44:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=72>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: idiot socialists</span><hr size=1> Wow!  This is an awesome thread.  Too bad I happened across it so late <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       .  I'm not going to pick apart every comment in every post.  I'd be here all night.  Just going to add my two cents on a few comments that caught my eye.  I'm sure this will nonetheless turn into a very long post.  Sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       .<br>
<br>
I'd like to make two points right up front:<br>
     <br>
     1) Others have touched on the point that pure capitalism is not necessarily feasible and must be regulated by some form of socialism.  I most definately agree with this concept, though the degree to which it must be regulated is a matter for debate.  Just know that when I refer to &quot;capitalism&quot;, I am referring to it in this context.<br>
     <br>
     2) While it may be &quot;cliche&quot; and smack of &quot;rhetorical, brainwashed drivel&quot; (as will other parts of this post) and serve as fodder for some of the over-educated pseudo-intelligent types out there, like it or not, a society centered around the free market economy has made the United States of America (arguably) the most powerful nation that has ever existed at any time in history.  And it's happened in a relative flash-in-the-pan of 200 or so years.<br>
    <br>
Well, here we go...<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Silverblade: &quot;One rich person BUYS the rights to that heart or can afford the operation and you can't.<br>
is that fair?&quot;<br>
<br>
Well, that is most definately not how it happens...at least in the United States.  This is quite simply a broad and false assumption/generalization on your part, which, I think, is indicitave of most of your stated positions.  I think you probably know this, but you're so fond of demonizing the capitalistic system that you've indulged yourself to such melodramatic rantings throughout much of your input to this thread.<br>
<br>
For what it's worth, transplantation recipients are placed on priority lists and given organs according to how compatible they may be with a given donor organ.  The wealth of the recipient is completely irrelevant.  There is a rather (in)famous case still getting some attention here in the US where a two-time violent felon received a heart transplant <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>while incarcerated</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  Cost to the state of California (i.e. ME) was supposedly in excess of $1 million.  <br>
<br>
You see, even in our hateful, cold, fiendishly capitalist society, there is a safety net which provides life-saving health care for those who cannot afford any other health care.  Granted it doesn't include in-home doctor visits, but, well, so what?  If people want that, they can go out and get a job that allows them to afford it.  And don't say that it cannot be done, because I am living proof that indeed it can.  I am sick to my stomach of listening to apologists for the lazy and advocates for the unambitious tell me what can and cannot be done.  I come from nothing and have made something of my life.  Enough said.<br>
<br>

<br>
Melik001: &quot;I have yet to see ANY form of government work the way it was intended. Human greed will always taint even the noblest intentions.&quot;<br>
<br>
Other posters to this thread have stated much more eloquently than I could why you are correct.  I'd just like to expound a bit by saying that the true genious of the capitalistic system lies in the fact that it doesn't just accomodate this human trait, it wholly embraces it.  Humans will act the way that humans will act and no law or governing system will ever change that...and THAT is why systems based on universal equality not only will not work, but <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>cannot</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> work.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Silverblade: &quot;People should have the right to CHOSE their doctor, but *nobody* should *EVER* be able to *BUY* better health care than someone else, except when it's purely cosmetic surgery (which is usally a want, not a need).&quot;<br>
<br>
This is just plain asinine.  Unlike you, evidently, I believe that I was born into this world owed nothing.  I have the maturity and the character to understand that *GASP* there <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>will be</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people in the world who can afford bigger and better things than I can.  If they've been able to figure out how to do that, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>more power to them!</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->  They have just as much right to better health care as they do to a bigger TV and a faster car.<br>

Belarkan: &quot;In light of events in middle east (preparation for war on Irak, a country not related to Bin Laden, but a huge oil producer....)&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, I'm making the assumption based on your posts that you do not live in the United States.  Please forgive me if I am wrong.  But my sentiment is still the same.<br>
<br>
We are a country that lost over 2,800 people in one fell swoop to middle eastern Islamic terrorists - something that the rest of the world seems to have already forgotten.  Perhaps where you come from that could be dismissed and written off, but not here.  I am sick and goddamned tired of people who cannot <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>possibly</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> understand the dynamic of what is going on in my country right now trivializing our actions by attempting to boil it down to oil.  <br>

I, for one, happen to understand how precious our way of life is, and I am grateful beyond words that we have leaders with the testicular fortitude to do what needs to be done to protect it.  I won't even get into the reasons for us doing what we're doing in Iraq, or what ties there may or may not be with Al Qaeda.  But suffice it to say that, as is usually the case, YOU will sleep safer tonight thanks to OUR blood and sweat.  Whether or not you can swallow your pride long enough to admit this to yourself is another issue.<br>

Balanz: &quot;My strong advice is to go to college and take a Labor History class. You will be less frighteningly stupid.&quot;<br>
<br>
As is blatantly evident by half of what you said in this post - and by this statement in particular - education is in no way indicative of intelligence.  It just means you can read a book and regurgitate information.  Woopdie-freakin'-doo.<br>
<br>
My strong advice to YOU, my friend, is to take your nose out of your books and go out and gain some life experience.  Learn how to make a point without being overly insulting.  Learn that you have neither every solution to every problem nor every answer to every question simply because you have a college education.  Learn that what works in theory is most often totally useless in practicality.  Most of all, learn some humility.  <br>

Silverblade: &quot;From what I know of USA politics, Republicans were NOT originally the &quot;rich man's tax dodge mouth piece and right wing extremist&quot; party that it somewhat has become, correct?&quot;<br>
<br>
Nor are they now, though this is another popular left-wing fallacy that you've apparently bought into.  <br>
<br>
I've always considered myself a centrist (read: fiscal conservative, social liberal...and no, I don't like the Libertarian party) and am registered non-affiliated, but reading uninformed crap like this from people like you makes me question my beliefs.  If you were an American it would really bother me, but since you're not I can't really blast you for not studying up on or understanding the ideologies of one of the two major political parties in this country.  The sad thing is that there are many Americans out there who are just as utterly clueless as you are /sigh.<br>

Please tell me you're kidding.  Refer to my 2nd point at the top of this post.<br>

Just a bit of background...<br>
<br>
I left home when I was 17 and joined the United States Army.  I served four years, during which time I travelled all over Europe, did a 6 month tour in Bosnia as part of the NATO force in that country and worked on humanitarian aid and de-mining missions in Africa with the United Nations...among many other things.  During my time in the Army, and Bosnia in particular, I saw what I believe to be the best and worst of what humanity is capable of.  I am now 23 years old, three quarters of the way to my first bachelor's degree (in philosophy) and am in the first stages of a career in law enforcement.<br>

Anyway, ill state it again (that is for your advice to people who dislike capitalism to go live in China)<br>
<br>
1/ Economy is not governed by fate, like free market zealots would like to believe.Things can change, and will.<br>
<br>
2/ Beeing against free market doesnt mean to be against America or a bad Citizen.(Neither it is to be against war in Irak)<br>
<br>
3/People often attack America when its about to criticize capitalism: its because Capitalism and USA are bound together, a tool for each other if you want.<br>
As people realise its time to really limit free market before its too late (you know, those little things like global warming and world great poverty, beeing worse and worse every day, but hey isnt it destiny? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   ), they are also conscious they will have to find a way and limit USA imperialism....because capitalism and USA are tied together.<br>
<br>
I think free market in Europe has reached its limits, or the limits people are ready to  pay for, things are changing, we are not going to sell our identity in the name of Ideology.<br>
<br>
4/ Sadly, the real evil axis nowadays, is not the one we can find in newspapers: Its Washington/WTO/IMF.<br>
<br>
5/ 09/11 Bombing were tragics, but they dont allow USA to do whatever, nor do we have to live forever sentenced to think, read, and sleep 09/11.<br>

Talk about drivel!<br>
<br>
&quot;1/ Economy is not governed by fate, like free market zealots would like to believe.Things can change, and will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Free market zealots? LOL.... Ok, why do you say that capitalists say a nations economy is governed by fate? Isnt that an oxymoron? Isnt capitalism based upon the premise that we dont wait for fate, that we do things to ensure success? Tell me, where would we be without a free market? Do you really think the world would be better? What is your alternate option to a free market society? A government controlled market? It didn't work in the USSR. I doubt if it will any where else. Can you give me an example of a non-free market society that works?<br>
<br>
&quot;3/People often attack America when its about to criticize capitalism: its because Capitalism and USA are bound together, a tool for each other if you want.&quot; <br>
<br>
I really don't understand your logic here. How are they bound together? In fact, isnt the GNP of the European union outstripping the GNP of the USA? Why arent you crying out against Europe? How dare they, those dirty imperialist Europeans!  LOL<br>
<br>
&quot;As people realise its time to really limit free market before its too late (you know, those little things like global warming and world great poverty, beeing worse and worse every day, but hey isnt it destiny?  ), they are also conscious they will have to find a way and limit USA imperialism....because capitalism and USA are tied together.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you seriously blame the &quot;free market&quot; for world poverty and global warming? How absurd. Where are your facts? How can one nation, or even a group of nations, which operates within a free market cause or keep any other nation or group of nations in poverty? Do you seriously believe that global warming would not exist if the free market system did not? How naive. It might even be worse. Give me some examples of American imperialism? I would dearly love to hear them. One thing alot of people like you fail to remember is that<br>
Americans are probably the most generous people in the world. No other country's citizens give more to charitable causes ... and not all of those charities benefit only Americans. Much of it goes to people that need it around the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think free market in Europe has reached its limits, or the limits people are ready to pay for, things are changing, we are not going to sell our identity in the name of Ideology.&quot;<br>
<br>
Very funny. The Europen market continues to grow. They will soon, without a doubt, be the dominant economic power. Sell your identity in the name of ideology? What do you mean by this? Won't you be doing the same thing in this &quot;non-free market everyone is equal&quot; way of life you seem to favor?<br>
<br>
&quot;4/ Sadly, the real evil axis nowadays, is not the one we can find in newspapers: Its Washington/WTO/IMF.&quot;<br>
<br>
This is funny in the extreme. I have never really understood the arguments against the world WTO or IMF. Can you explain why they are bad? Seriously, can you give me a logical argument? How can an organization that promotes world trade and another that helps countries that are in financial crisis be evil? Do you really know what they do?<br>
<br>
&quot;5/ 09/11 Bombing were tragics, but they dont allow USA to do whatever, nor do we have to live forever sentenced to think, read, and sleep 09/11.&quot;<br>
<br>
Where are you from? Do you think it was just Americans killed on 9/11? What do you consider the USA &quot;doing whatever?&quot; Are we the only country engaged in the fight against terrorism? Have you been blind and deaf to all of the other terrorism that has happened at an increased rate, world wide, since 9-11? Do you truly believe that none of this other terrorism would have happened if Americans had not taken such a strong stand against it? Are you willing to let your friends, neighbors, and loved ones be killed and then do nothing to stop it just because it might create trouble for a while?<br>
<br>
Please, if you are going to make statements like these, at least put facts down instead of just opinion and supposition.<br>
<br>
I will hazard a few guesses here. You are probably young, maybe old enough to just be starting college, maybe not. Chances are you are not an American. You are full of angst and anger. You do not like your life situation, or possibly that of your families.You do not like the situation our world is in either ( not that any of us do) and are frustrated because the really bad things dont seem to be getting corrected. And, without really studying to see the whole picture, you have latched on an extreme point of view about the causes. Why, because it is easy to do. You probably did not form these opinions on your own. Most likely someone else told you these things and you accepted them because you dont like your lot in life and want someone to blame.<br>
<br>
I know this will probably cause a flurry of responses. I guess we will see what happens. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=elladin>Elladin</A> at: 1/24/03 8:07:39 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=belarkan>Belarkan</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_redspot.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#333333>(1/24/03 8:42:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerrants.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=364.topic&index=75>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Idiot capitalists</span><hr size=1> I wont answer on personal attacks, but if you honestly want to know why one would think like me (im not the only one, by far, so *boggle*, i invite you to read here, and maybe leave behind most of your generally accepted ideas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
1/ About the IMF and WTO and the so called free market:<br>
<br>
-from Pierre Bourdieu, sociolog and Philosopher:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.analitica.com/bitblioteca/bourdieu/neoliberalism.asp">www.analitica.com/bitblio...ralism.asp</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
How those organisations, rather than helping poor countries, have actually ruined them (see those areas where IMF has enforced its prescriptions, Africa, South America, all those countries are wasted, worse than before.<br>
<br>
-&quot;Globalization and Its Discontents&quot;, by Joseph e. Stiglitz, nobel prize winner, professor of economics at Columbia University.<br>
You can have a sample here, its talking about Ethiopia and IMF.<br>
<br>
Im sure youll be stuned, unless of course you just want to flamme:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/catalog/spring02/005124excerpt.htm">www.wwnorton.com/catalog/...xcerpt.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-&quot;Rethinking globalisation&quot;, by Martin Khor, Director of the Third World Network, a clearly biased organisation, but one would be biased against WTO for less than that.<br>
<br>
How WTO has become the main tool for International enterprises to increase their power.<br>
<br>
Read here if you dont want to read the whole book:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/analysis/book_review/Martin%20khor.htm">www.jubilee2000uk.org/ana...20khor.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
<br>
2/ How free market and Globalisation (its consequence) is slowly depriving politics over the world, of any real power, through illegal organisations such as WTO and IMF? Illegal, thats obvious, because they have no legitimacy as far as people vote goes.<br>
They operate across borders.<br>
Thats why i made my comment about economy slowly turning into fate, something you cant change, because you hold no power on it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3/Now about global warming: <br>
So, you dont see the link between free market, economic globalisation, and Global Warming? (obviously, i was also talking about all ecologic issues, basiccaly we are destroying our planet.)<br>
Ill tell you that: as ultra-liberalism (thats how we call globalisation policy in france) makes its way into minds (not all minds, fear not), people are thinking more about making money, and our planet is the last of their concerns.<br>
But...isnt it a matter of life or death?<br>
<br>
You could read here, as a start if you want (youll note the nice attitude of USA on this matter).<br>
<br>

<br>
4/ About USA &quot;charity&quot;, lets pass on your cliche, anyway all western countries are guilty.<br>
You must understand that charity, this old religious concept, is only helping us to get rid of our guilt.In fact it helps to maintain a whole system, so we dont have to find real organised solutions.To assist is not to help.<br>
<br>
Again, in aid for developpement, US are the worst students of the class; a class of donkeys, ill agree.<br>

/5 Terrorism.<br>
<br>
*Schrug* I was trying to get an answer, how is Irak in any way related to terrorism (Bombings by Al Quaeda), but all i seem to get are hysteric answers.<br>
AL Qaeda is a whole different matter, but most people seem to try and blur the difference, why?<br>
<br>
This war is the reflect of American Imperialism, try to turn off tv sometimes.<br>
<br>
Now i dont say that American Imperialism isnt in line with the winds of History, its just that im unhappy with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hypocritical reasons, like i already said, elections soon, oil, geostrategy,Enron gate,  any reason i will accept it, but dont tell me again about bombings by Al Qaeda, that Irak has to do something with it.<br>
<br>
All this war will do is produce more terrorism and instability in an area where the balance is already weak.<br>
<br>
Btw, yes all western countries are helping each other to track real terrorism.(i said real, please take note)<br>
<br>
<br>
5/ About Free Market, Globalisation and cultural integration? You really dont see?<br>
How we are going to end up all seeing the same movies, reading the same news (its already the case...), eating the same @#%$, all getting social protection lowered to the minimum, again in the name of ideology?<br>
<br>
Really... you dont see? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So, i hope i made things a little clearer for you, feel free to answer me, without the &quot;LOL&quot; and those naive answers coming directly from school books, id be rather disapointed.<br>
Btw, no need to talk about USSR again, im not a communist, thanks.<br>
When people are debating about capitalism, why do they always feel the need to talk about USSR?<br>
There are alternatives to free market, and while USA are the first country in History to be able to reach the Universal, and enforce its vision of the world on everyone else on the planter, i surely want to be able to say &quot;no&quot;.<br>
<br>
<br>
I maybe dont see this &quot;big picture&quot; as good as you see it, but i have the feeling you ll go to bed tonight with a little better &quot;big picture&quot; in mind.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course if you dont bother to read those links before any answer (it took me some time to gather this info in english, but shouldnt be that long to read), well thats only dishonest, and you only came to flame me. <br>
<br>
Oh, before i forget, im 29, i live in france, i earn some decent money as a teacher (mainly history) , and im with my gf since 12 years , we got no kids, and im perfectly sane, as far as sanity can go <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>

<br>
&quot;9. What in your view are the true motives propelling a possible war? <br>
<br>
There are longstanding background reasons, which are well known. Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world. It has always been likely that sooner or later, the US would try to restore this enormous prize to Western control, meaning now US control, denying privileged access to others. But those considerations have held for years. 9-11 offered new opportunities to pursue these goals under the pretext of a &quot;war on terror&quot; -- thin pretexts, but probably sufficient for propaganda purposes. The planned war can serve immediate domestic needs as well. It's hardly a secret that the Bush administration is carrying out an assault against the general population and future generations in the interest of narrow sectors of wealth and power that it serves with loyalty that exceeds even the usual norms. Under those circumstances, it is surely advisable to divert attention away from health care, social security, deficits, destruction of the environment, development of new weapons systems that may literally threaten survival, and a long list of other unwelcome topics. The traditional, and reasonable, device is to terrify the population. &quot;The whole aim of practical politics,&quot; the great American satirist H. L. Mencken once said, is &quot;to keep the public alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary.&quot; In fact the menaces invoked are rarely imaginary, though they are typically inflated beyond all reason. That's a good part of the history of &quot;practical politics,&quot; not only here of course. It doesn't take much skill to evoke an image of Saddam Hussein as the ultimate force of evil about to destroy the world, maybe the universe. And with the population huddling in fear as our gallant forces miraculously overcome this awesome foe, perhaps they won't pay attention to what is being done to them, and may even join the chorus of distinguished intellectuals chanting praises for Our Leaders. The US preponderance of power is so extraordinary that there will be plenty in reserve if things seem to be going wrong. And if that happens down the road, it can all be shovelled deep into the memory hole, or blamed on someone else, or maybe on our naive faith that others are as benign as we are. It's pretty easy: there's a treasure trove of experience to draw from. &quot;<br>
<br>
You can have the rest here if you want, and please turn off TV.<br>

My politics are rather conservative LOL. Your ideas are more ultra liberal. And another thing, try reading material from people with opposing viewpoints as well. It does not good to read the drivel from those espousing only one view point.<br>
<br>
And who is throwing around insults? All I said was I considered you young and immature. Yes, I did call your comments inane and absurd; but not once did I insult you or your country. You on the other hand have done nothing but insult Americans. Do you think your opinion is the only one that counts?<br>
<br>
Showing me links to internet articles proves nothing. If i wanted to spend the ridiculous amount of time you do finding someone, anyone or anything to support the way I think, I could as well. It proves nothing.<br>
<br>
And your answer on charity -- try telling the people that do benefit from charity that all you are doing is hurting them. <br>
Guilt, guilt over what issues? It has nothing to do with guilt, but with your attitudes I'm not surprised you dont see it.<br>
<br>
You know, I had no idea you were from france, but i can see it in you demeanor now. I did not want to open the door to personal attacks but you opened the door -- &quot;a class of donkeys, ill agree.&quot; Hearing these arguments from you has reaffirmed an old opinion of mine. In my travels around the world I have had the opportunity to visit and deal with people from a number of nations and cultures; and even though I will not try to say that all french people are like you, I will say this, you are not a very good example for your country men and you are propagating a probably undeserved reputation of french snobbishness and elitism.<br>
<br>
If you truly believe that Iraq has nothing at all to do with terrorism, you are truly naive.<br>
<br>
And speaking of this so-called American imperialism, try looking into your own country's history. I'm sure it has a perfect record.<br>
<br>
Do you favor a wait and see policy on the fight against terror? Do you think that will really work? We sat around and waited, we did nothing to combat people that practice terrorism and are living with the results -- and when i say we, I am talking about the world community.<br>
<br>
Of course the world is changing. We are all growing to be like each other. As the global population grows and technology improves, all boundaries will begin to fade away. It will happen regardless of what you and i think. We may never see it, but it will happen. Get used to it.<br>
<br>
The &quot;LOL&quot; remarks were meant to show how funny I think your answers are; and seeing how angrily you retorted, I must have been right on several issues. I did not bring up the USSR to compare you to a communist. I just used it as a comparison for a controlled economy. Oh yes, The Soviets were not communists, i.e., the word SOCIALISTS in the acronym.<br>

Still, socialism is not a solution, but free market isnt the answer either for it leaves behind roughly 3/4 of mankind (with something like 2 dollars a day maximum...), and it has failed until now to answer true questions about the futur of earth.<br>
All those great sentences quoted from those philosophers dead since 200 years (A.Smith exemple coming every 2 posts is the funniest of all /all praise the mighty invisible hand of market!) wont change cold and hard facts.<br>
<br>
The beds are burning, like someone said, and charity isnt going to be enough.<br>
<br>
America, from its never attained position in History of world  leader, is viewed everywhere as the main support for Ultra liberalism, so in the same time, as both part of the problem, and part of the solution.<br>
To make things worse, USA are seen to be leaded by a small oligarchy, totally cuted from people, that could care less about the consequences of its short term acts.(its of course more problematic since G.Bush election, at least Clinton and Bush Senior had some diplomatic savoir faire).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
But its only talking, i have no anger against Americans, i could also tell you why from personal experience, i know you are generous people, on more aspects that the average French people i met.<br>

But not a single word on why.<br>
Im not going to expand about USA foreign policy since 1945, but for sure, you didnt sit and wait!<br>
If you mean that you do this war because you have the power, huh i guess its true, but then lets not pretend.<br>
This would not be a crusade, nor a fight against evil.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, will you explain me why im truly naive?<br>

<br>
Know, I &quot;demonize&quot; the despicable idea that money &gt;&gt;&gt; people. Capitolism is merely an econimic tool, but like almost anything people do they take it to extremes. Religion, politics etc. I have heard people argue that it IS right that people should get favoured medical treatment because they can afford it, same with education, I totally utterly deeply reject that. By merit or limitation of resources, fine, but not by &quot;he who has the gold&quot;.<br>
<br>
Hm, America has run into such trouble because it's so powerful, but so naive and frankly hasn't had the utter ** kicked out of it and learned to eat humble pie like the rest of the world has, which leads to arrogance and a lack of empathy, like Britain in the late 1800s. Note this is a cultural overlook, not *a statement in regard to individual citizens*. Cultures change and mature, America is basically a youth, brash, powerful, but headstrong, with little sense of forethought. Capitolsim is good for solving immediate needs, but without damn good restraints or *willing co-operation*, long term its catastrophic.<br>
Examples include the butchery motor vehicles, tobacco and alcohol cause. The former is a real useful item, the later personal enjoyments, but between them they  havoc they caused makes the deaths suffered in wars puny. and NO ONE DOES anything because they are seen, designed and advertised   and have become ingrained in society due to retailing needs.<br>
I'm not sayuing they should be banned, lol  no. But that because folk were making fat profits from them, and good selling techniques, they have been taken far too lightly and the mega-deaths practically ignored.<br>
<br>
In a round about way, its about personable responsibility and morality, a good point someone pointed out in regard to an actual problem socialism doesnt solve. neither does Capitlosim, but capitolism exploits weaknesses.<br>
<br>
When the ice caps melt, when the oceans die, when giant hurricanes make living on the seaboard  impractical, what will we do?<br>

<br>
As you can see by my low post count - six now? heh - I'm not one to chime in very often.  The only time I really do is when the issue is something about which I feel very strongly and think I have something to say that may add to the discussion.  Consequently, I tend to say things in the heat of passion.  <br>
<br>
However, while there are admittedly things in my last post I'd like to edit out, I frankly don't see the logic in many of your counterpoints.  In many cases your comments are too general to really qualify as good criticism, and in other cases you do some of the same things you criticise me for.<br>
<br>
Look, I don't mean to turn this into a &quot;why America is good/bad&quot; debate.  I use it as an example of functional capitalism because a) it is my largest frame of reference and b) like you said (and I agree with you), the US and capitalism are bound together.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Berlarkan: &quot;One would expect, from a wise Philosophy student like you surely are...&quot;<br>
<br>
Honestly, is the condescension really necessary?  I'm all for calling a turd a turd, but at least have the balls to come out and say what you really mean.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;Because, really, your whole post is more a claim of your absolut comfidence in the system than the fruit of deep thoughts.<br>
<br>
<br>
You dont even try to justify yourself  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       &quot;<br>
<br>
My responses were general at best because I had so much I wanted to cover.  This is a message board for those of us addicted to a video game..not a dissertation, afterall.<br>
<br>
You've apparently failed to consider the possiblilty that my confidence in the system <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>is</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> the fruit of deep thought.  Additionally, it is presumptuous of you to take my confidence in the free market system for an &quot;absolute confidence&quot; in the entire American governing system.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan:<br>
<br>
(quoting me)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;society centered around the free market economy has made the United States of America (arguably) the most powerful nation that has ever existed at any time in history. And it's happened in a relative flash-in-the-pan of 200 or so years&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am grateful beyond words that we have leaders with the testicular fortitude to do what needs to be done to protect it.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;that the true genious of the capitalistic system lies in the fact that it doesn't just accomodate this human trait, it wholly embraces it&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Naivety appart, do you really buy that??&quot;<br>
<br>
In regards to the first statement you quoted, I cannot see where you could disagree. The only argument I can think of at 7am has to do with the context of the word &quot;powerful&quot;.  There is a reason that the United States is the one remaining super-power.  Please, tell me why I shouldn't &quot;buy that&quot;.<br>
<br>
In regards to the second quote, sappy (bleh) language aside my sentiment is the same.  And despite the fact that a very vocal minority in the US disagrees (the media eats it up), most of the country is in agreement, insofar as you can trust poll statistics.<br>
<br>
And the third point...well, once again I ask you explain to me where I'm wrong.  I would argue that if you disagree it is because you don't fully understand the concepts on which capitalism is based.  To me the explanation is self evident:  capitalisim works because people are competitive and greedy by nature and will always be so.  Governing systems and trade laws and wishful thinking cannot change that.  If you'd like I'll write a whole post on just this topic, but right now I want to respond to the rest of your post.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan:<br>
<br>
(quoting me)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;I won't even get into the reasons for us doing what we're doing in Iraq, or what ties there may or may not be with Al Qaeda&quot;.<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;Please, will you?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->       &quot;<br>
<br>
Sure...<br>
<br>
To begin with, we are still in a state of war with Iraq.  We just happen to be at armistice, or cease-fire if you'd like, something for which there are agreed-upon conditions.  Saddam Hussein has routinely broken the conditions of this armistice.  <br>
<br>
Just to cite a few examples: firing on US and British fighter planes patrolling the no-fly zone, actually downing one of our unmanned spy planes a few months back, selling oil that he's not allowed to sell to fund military assets that he's not supposed to have, kicking UN inspectors out of the country in the 90's after having made a farce of the inspection program, brutally crushing a Kurdish rebellion in 1998(?), etc.  The current inspection program is nearly as much of a farce as it was in the 90's, though this time Iraq is at least trying to fake compliance.  As I type, Hans Blix is addressing the United Nations.  He is reporting that he believes Iraq has had weapons in the recent past (in violation of UN sanctions) that they were not allowed to have and indeed may still have such weapons.<br>
<br>
That much is provable.  The rest is my opinion and is up for debate...<br>
<br>
This behavior, however, has been tolerated because the threat from Iraq was &quot;contained&quot; and the world turned its attention to, among other issues, the mess in Bosnia and later Kosovo.  Then 9-11 happened.  The United States is no longer so much concerned with containing or reacting to threat as it is with eliminating it outright.  9-11 was all the primer that was needed.  The government is attempting to change its long tradition of reaction to one of active pre-emption, hence the possibility of &quot;pre-emptive&quot; military action in Iraq.  <br>
<br>
I do not find it much of a stretch to think that a) Saddam Hussein would provide terrorists with training, weapons, funding...whatever they need, were he given the chance, and b) that terrorists know this and will try and make it happen.<br>
<br>
The US government claims to have proof that he possesses large quantities of VX nerve agent and the anthrax virus among others.  While I do not think that they would be stupid enough to lie about this, contrary to what you may think, I do think that it is necessary to present this proof to the world.  Members of the US left who were opposing military action on the grounds that there was no proof (Joe Lieberman, to name one) have since publicly reversed themselves after having supposedly been shown said evidence.<br>
<br>
The problem with making this evidence public at this point is that there are surely intelligence assets remaining in Iraq (i.e. people).  Obviously, this would include European as well as American personnel.  The release of such intelligence would necessarily expose these spies to the Iraqi government, which, in that regime, would certainly result in their execution.<br>
<br>
As for oil...the United States imports a relatively small portion of its oil from Iraq through the &quot;oil for food&quot; agreement (another farce).  I pay about $1.45 USD for a gallon of gas right now.  If all the oil wells in Iraq were to dry up tomorrow I imagine I would still be paying about $1.45 USD a gallon the day after.  The notion that we are bent on controlling all of Iraq's oil is just plain absurd.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if you honestly believe that the United States <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>wants</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to go to war, I just don't know what to tell you.  I am still on status to be called to active duty.  Do you really think I want to go off to a desert halfway around the world that I could wind up not coming back from?  Please.<br>
<br>
Enough on Iraq...we can get into that a bit more later on.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;Oh, before i forget, im 29, i live in france, i earn some decent money as a teacher...&quot;<br>
<br>
Good lord, this explains a lot.  I see teachers in France are reading the same books as teachers in the US.  What's scary is that you're teaching a whole generation of kids to think like you.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
As far as all of your quoted articles are concerned, the fact that you can surf the net and quote &quot;authorities&quot; on the far left of the left wing proves nothing to me.  If I cared to do so, I'm sure I could surf the net and find quotes from just as reputable ultra-right wing sources.  I'm not concerned with what you read, because I'm fairly confident that it's ALL you read.<br>
<br>
Though it is off subject, I feel it's relevent here.  I'm an atheist.  I always get a kick out of religious people who attempt to invoke biblical passages to reinforce their positions.  What you're doing here is no different.  The links and articles you posted were so biased (not to mention flat wrong) that they were not even laughable.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan:<br>
<br>
(quoting me)<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
&quot;...as fodder for some of the over-educated pseudo-intelligent types out there...&quot;<br>
-------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
&quot;You certainly seem to think you are worth a damn IRL ?&quot;<br>
<br>
I'm not going to take the obvious shot here.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;1/ Economy is not governed by fate, like free market zealots would like to believe.Things can change, and will.&quot;<br>
<br>
Somehow I don't think I'd be far off in assuming that you're lumping me into the &quot;free market zealot&quot; crowd.  First of all, I absolutely do not believe anything close to this.  Free market <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>itself</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is not governed by fate.  Fate implies that there is some greater design.  <br>
<br>
To me, the fact that you believe this to be so means that either you do not truly understand the meaning of the word fate or, as I've already stated, that you do not truly understand the concept of capitalism.  In this case I believe it is the former.  <br>
<br>
Free market is governed by competition, which feeds directly off of the immediate wants and/or needs of the people.  It is therefore extremely ecclectic by nature.  Fate would imply that there is some greater plan or greater power at work shaping events to an end... i.e. socialism.  This is anything but the case where capitalism is concerned.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;As people realise its time to really limit free market before its too late (you know, those little things like global warming and world great poverty, beeing worse and worse every day, but hey isnt it destiny?  ), they are also conscious they will have to find a way and limit USA imperialism....because capitalism and USA are tied together.&quot;<br>
<br>
And you accuse ME of having &quot;blind faith&quot;?  Sheesh.  Blather like this just serves to erode your crediblility.<br>
<br>
And why is it that Europeans seem to think global warming is going to wipe us all out tomorrow?  I mean, I agree that it is a definate problem and must be addressed...but there is such as thing as <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><span style="text-decoration:underline">prioritizing!</span><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END-->  Have you heard the saying &quot;one step at a time&quot;?  Seriously, there are so many more immediate threats that need to be addressed.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;nor do we have to live forever sentenced to think, read, and sleep 09/11.&quot;<br>
<br>
I would be interested to hear how your opinion changes should (god forbid) something on the same scale happen in your country.  I agree that we cannot allow ourselves to be bound the events of 9-11 forever.  But at the same time, there are still people out there who, if given the opportunity, would take great pleasure in doing it again.  And until that threat is quelled, I don't believe we can safely let it go.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
Ok, one more Iraq thing...<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;All this war will do is produce more terrorism and instability in an area where the balance is already weak.&quot;<br>
<br>
I've heard liberal anti-war types saying this in the US as well.  Can you please explain this to me?  It seems to be one of those common arguments that sounds really good but that nobody ever cares to substantiate.  I'm not saying I disagree necessarily, I'd just like to know your reasons for believing this to be true.<br>
<br>
---------------<br>
<br>
And lastly...<br>
<br>
Belarkan: &quot;It isn't enough that you bring almost nothing to the debate, but you also feel the need to insult people, because belittle them is the only way for you to make a point:&quot;<br>
<br>
I love the irony here.  First you insult me, then you admonish me because you feel that I am insulting.<br>
