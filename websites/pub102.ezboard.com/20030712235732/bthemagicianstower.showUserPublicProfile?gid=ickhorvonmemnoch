People try and spread happiness as if it were a syringe filled with bloody aids and your ass the perfect point to prick you and spread the filthy seeds of destruction. And, like herpes, once you get the disease, you carry it around with you for life like luggage. There is no cure, there never will be a cure and it will eventually spread. 

I can tell you already have it. Vile creature. I have it too, but not by choice. By understanding the disease, you are able to take the first steps in living with it and being able to work towards a cure. 

Remember, people want you to get infected. Unlike some diseases where you can join a commune of fellow infected folks as to help prevent the spread of the disease, people spread happiness like herpes jelly across a hot slab of toast. They promote it on television with their sappy sitcoms, over the radio with their cute little talk shows and through movies with their typical hollywood happy endings. It's pushed in your face from the moment you come screaming out of your mother's bloody womb. The Doctors slap your ass, and if you're a male, slice into your genitalia and then expect you to go off and be happy. 

Ever wonder why children scream like they're on fire? It's because they're in the early stages of infection. Feeling the putrifying disease echo through their bones like some backwoods symphony, they cry in torture, fearful of what the disease of forced happiness will eventually do to their now rotting minds. 

Happiness, in all it's forms, is a disease that has evolved to placate us from reality. Ever wonder how the world seems more in tune, intelligent and reasonable when we're about to start World War III? That's because we're no longer happy and can actually begin to use that giant chunk of jell-o that's been sitting dormant in our skulls. They say love and happiness are the best emotions to carry around, but when you carry a strong misanthropic slant of hate and negativity, the emotions are a thousand times more pure. 

Since there's no cure, let's look at our options: 

A) You can go through life accepting the disease and doing what you can to prevent it from spreading beyond you and, at the same time, doing your best not to be happy. This is actually easier than it sounds. Pound your thumb with a hammer until it's squashed like a grape and you'll understand just how easy it is. 

B) You can be a happy-go-lucky sap and feel twice as horrible when melancholoy knocks on your door and proceeds to kick your ass. This is probably a good description of you and you're apt to never learn. 

C) If you MUST be happy, be happy at the expense of others. Laugh at their miserable situations, push people down flights of stairs, trip a retard, whatever it takes. Just don't come smiling to me or i'll beat you silly. 

Either way, it is avoidable. Do what thou wilt so long as thou aren't deriving any pleasure from thine experience. These words are law. Happiness is a disease. Distancing yourself from it is the cure.
