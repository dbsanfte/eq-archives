<br>
Pets are Tanks.<br>
<br>
In the past, tanks have complained about our pets being overpowered sometimes, but it was situational.  Our pets could never keep agro like a real tank could, or had the same hp and ac of a real tank.  You never heard a group or raid going after a named say, they didnt need a tank, because they had a mage pet for that.<br>
<br>
I have never played a ank, even going back as far as 1980's and playing D&amp;D.  So, there is no envy here, but feeling sorry for tanks.<br>
<br>
I feel sorry, that even with dc, tanks were getting left behind on being needed.  Now with these new charmed pets, why would a group or raid want a tank with 7k hp, when they can have one now with 20, 30, 40k or more hp, and hits in the hundreds.<br>
<br>
What has been said in the past alot, is that pets are great to have and help out, but they should't replace a tank with one pet.  Now, one pet is replacing 2 - 3 groups?  Sorry, but to me, that seems like god mode in some of the old games I left, to come play EQ.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, they will fix it, so that it is still useful, but not be, where EQ has only enchanters playing the game anymore. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="font-family:Times New roman;font-size:medium;"><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Gandolph / Kozymo</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>

There are perhaps a few encounters where a tank can be substituted by a charmed pet and perhaps these encounters need some attention. However as an average enchanter in your average  tier 3 group fighting average tier 3 mobs (most of which appear to summon) the safest way to fight is using the traditional group makeup, and a charmed pet for additional dps. Sure if the MT goes afk, ld's or dies a charmed pet can keep us going till we get him/her back, but if we try and do this for a sustained period we will come to grief far more often.<br>
<br>
Also remember that the tanks efficiency is based on the efficiency of CH. As more PoP armors become available to tanks and their HP gets close to 10k so a 7.5K CH actually heals 7.5K HP, rather than 4 or 5k which is probably the norm atm, then using a charmed pet to tank holds no real advantage. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=pissed1vi2soe@themagicianstower>Pissed1VI2SOE</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 565<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/03 7:07:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=447.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   The Charm 'nerf' and it's faults.</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr> they didnt need a tank, because they had a mage pet for that <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I know a few mobs where pet &gt; real tank.<br>
<br>
Then again I sheet my pants when I saw a lvl 60 warrior MA one of these guys that AoE's for 2K fire dmg, and the tank was resisting just as good as my fire pet.  Gratz to that warrior, gratz to VI for &quot;fixing&quot; some of the resists that allowed that particular warrior to resist alot, heck it saved me and a few others from having to chain pets.<br>
<br>
But there was a day when it was pets or wipe on very few specific mobs.  I am glad those situations have been changed, it always made me feel bad to see warriors standing back drooling at my pets resists. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iumunorn>IumunoRN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 29<br> <font color=#333333>(1/28/03 10:32:52 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=447.topic&index=46>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Charm 'nerf' and it's faults.</span><hr size=1> The charm nerf is aimed at every high level charms, but to be really honest the only one that will be *really* affected is the enchanter class.<br>
<br>
I played an enchanter for over 2 years before finally giving up in disgust in the luclin era and I switched to a cleric since then. So I have a certain experience with the class and I am wary about some of the suggested fixes. My perspective is mostly about raids, because this is where issues will arise for the class if charm is nerfed to the point of no longer being worth the risk.<br>
<br>
There is one reason why enchanters are 100% fine and maybe overpowered in the PoP expansion and it's because charm is working. It's the single reason why enchanters stack in most raids in PoP. Pre PoP the mobs were either too high for the old charm spells, too resistant, or just hard coded immune when they weren't. The enchanter ability to charm wasn't underpowered back then. Worse; it was (mostly) *useless*.<br>
<br>
Now I know mezz is working again and it's also a good change. But mezz *is* situational. There is a few encounters where it can make the difference between victory and defeat. Most of the time we tell our enchanters to keep a charmed pet instead of worrying about mezz and we tank split the adds - or root them if we have room. Help with faster clearings this way. With PoP and many areas the size of a football field there are many adequate alternatives to mezz. Harmony being one of them, and far superior and that, given that most of the zones are outdoor.<br>
<br>
What is certainly true, is that without charms enchanters are incomplete. Buffs aren't a balance factor. It's something that is easily botted. Classes are balanced by their active combat role, and the enchanter's role in PoP is overwhelmingly centered on charm. If you disable charm, or nerf it to a point where it's no longer worth it's risk - because there is a varying amount of risk depending on the area - then you will unbalance the class the other way.<br>
<br>
Now I do admit that there are some problems with charm and PoP. <br>
<br>
The problem I do have with charm (and PoP in general) is the experience discrepancy between classes that can solo efficiently (enchanters, druids, necros and maybe 1 or 2 others), and the classes that are group dependant.<br>
<br>
How do you lure an enchanter to join your group to provide essential melee support when he can get so much better xp soloing or duoing? Answer, you can't because he's making far better xp soloing, and he doesn't want to be bottled up in the soporiphic role of slower/buff dispenser. <br>
<br>
And since slow is essential for any form of non charm melee engagement in PoP, there goes a significant portion of your slowers. <br>
<br>
Basically it's hard to get an enchanter to group, because he's playing a different (and superior) game when it's coming to grouping and getting experience. This is wrong. <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
What I am trying to say is that yes, we have to admit there is a problem, and a serious discrepancy in the experience game that has to be solved. <br>
<br>
But be wary of any solutions that would make charm not worth the risk anymore. Right now the enchanter's place in the raiding game is dependant on charm being worth the risk, and the support required to maintain these pets - because you don't find PoS frogs or PoV golems type mobs for every raid.<br>
<br>
I think the right place of charm is in a setting where either everyone can solo (why not?), or in another where you need more than the resources of just the enchanter to maintain and use the pet at the effectivenes we currently see. There's nothing wrong if you use a 400 dps pet but need resources from several other players to mitigate the risk created by charm, because then it's not really one player doing that damage, but several.<br>
<br>
That's my idea of how it should be. What changes to make to move from the current situation to what I think it &quot;should&quot; be? To be honest - I am not sure. The fastest fix would be to make all PoP mobs summon, but it would kill the ability to solo for anyone but shamans, and I am not sure it's a good idea. But it would certainly make charm more of a group thing.<br>
<br>
Another partial fix would be to modify the game mechanics so that everyone can solo for some xp if they can't find a group.<br>

No class should have anywhere near the combined abilities of the current enchanter.<br>
<br>
If enchanters want to keep this ability, and no longer desire to buff/debuff/crowd control then fine take those abilities away from them and leave the charm alone.<br>
<br>
Enchanters without slow/haste/mana regen/mez should be fairly well balanced but as they are right now is ludicrous, it blows me away that they have left it for as long as they have. Mages and necro charm needs to be nerfed severely but enchanter charm needs to be slapped back to pre pop levels if any semblence of class balance is to exist. I haven't felt so overpowered as a class since I was playing my necro pre kunark and even then I can honestly say I don't think I felt as overpowered as when I play my enchanter now.<br>
<br>
It has come to the point where I just group my enchanter-mage-cleric, I don't even bother ever using my mage just my enchanter-cleric, so I now am basically just leveling my mage with no contribution from him faster then I could raise him with a power leveling(non-grouped cleric) and by some distance at that. I can just imagine how mages without a cleric bot must feel at this point when trying to find groups. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=yanbun>Yanbun</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Sage</span><br>  Posts: 616<br> <font color=#333333>(2/1/03 4:44:18 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=447.topic&index=48>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The only problem with this nerf...</span><hr size=1> Fix: Apply the same rules to charm that Dire Charm has.
