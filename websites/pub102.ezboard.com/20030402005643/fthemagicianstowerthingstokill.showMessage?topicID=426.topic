I recommend this method lvl 57+ and I have no idea how it would work at other lvls being that I never tried it.  But u can give it a try and let me know how it works. Here is the post as I put it in the other forum......<br>
<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
 Ok...obviously not anything. But I figured out a tactic that makes it relatively easy to solo just bout anything that doesn't summon or cast. I used this tactic and was able to solo PoN mobs at lvl 57. <br>
Ok. Picture urself pulling a mob. U got earth pet back at ur fight area. U send in earth pet BEFORE mob gets to u. Bout 50% of the time (if not more) the pet will root the mob before it runs in to fight. If not it'll usually cast root during its run to the fight. As soon as pet roots mob (pull with malosi or malosini) tell pet to /back off. U now have a rooted angry mob that hits for way too much dmg for pet to succesfully tank. What next u ask? put pet on /follow (make sure of this because pet will run back to u quicker then if he were /guarding a spot) get urself to about max distance where pet will still recognize /attack command. Send pet in and back off as soon as it roots. By doing this over and over again u can keep mob rooted pretty much as long as u'd like. Of course pet does not always root before it reaches mob, so back pet off before it gets in mobs melee range and when it gets back to u send it in again. 57 earth pets root lasts for bout 18 seconds, so pet gets bout 2 or 3 &quot;runs&quot; between u and mob before root breaks. The way the odds work u can almost always get another root in during this time. Best method is to try and root mob as often as u can. In other words don't wait for the 18 seconds to wear before u send in pet. This increases ur chances of keeping mob rooted, duh :-P. Now being that norrath is not a perfect world u are going to have times where mob resists root or pet gets too close or pet doesn't root mob before it gets to u. It is during these times that pet is going to have to do a little tanking *gasp*. Watch the fight and as soon as pet casts his root during fight spam /pet back off. A beat up pet will come back to u, leaving very angry mob rooted behind it. Again make sure pet is following u or else it will meander its way back to /guard spot and will never get out of melee range quick enough.<br>
Ok, with all that being said (forgive me for the thoroughness) u are probably wondering how this helps u aside from p*ssing off a spider that hits for 300+. Of course the pets root does bout 70dmg everytime but that isn't going to kill a mob quick enough to make it worth ur while. The next part of this method u can modify to ur own liking but I'm simply going to tell u what worked best for me. Have wrath of the elements and elemental maelstrom up (lvl 55 and 44 dots). With that patch a lil while ago these two will stack beautifully. Cast wrath on angry rooted mob. &quot;Ahha, but Mr. Mage, u tricked us! the dot broke the root and now i'm dead! we hate u Mr. Mage.&quot; Silly children, u died because u stopped reading the post a few lines ago and hastily went to try and kill the mean spiders in PoN. The trick to getting around this is prolly the most dangerous part of this method. Watch the cast time when dotting the spider. When there is about one bubble left send in ur pet. One of the awesome things bout the new interface is that u can use pet controls while casting, unlike hotkeys. Now this is the part where u rely on luck. The reason I say send in pet at one bubble is because the majority of the time the pet will cast root right after mob is hit with wrath. Now I say majority. Some people might find it to work better to send in pet as mob is hit with wrath. Whatever works for u man. This method is all about timing. Often times u will find u have to let pet tank mob while it tries to root it, before u can pull pet off. Once u've gotten the mobs hp low enough u will often find urself running in circles while pet tries to root mob, in which case u pull pet off (spam /pet back off, u know the deal by now). And often times it will work perfectly and pet will root mob after it has charged at u no more than 2 feet. Now, at this time u use ur best judgement as to whether or not to rinse and repeat with ur 44 dot. Usually if timing was perfect and neither u nor pet were hurt i'd say go for it and cast 44 dot, again sending pet in at one bub. But if timing didn't work out so well u should prolly spend ur time healing pet, or healing/medding self. Don't forget to constantly be sending pet in to root while ur recuperating though. Last thing u want while ur binding ur wounds is a spider sticking its fangs in ur lil caster butt.<br>
Like I said, this is just a guideline, and u should use ur best judgement as to how to use this method. If u find urself running out of mana too quickly while using both dots, then slow the pace of the fight down and only use one dot. Spider will die slower of course, but that gives u more med time while pet keeps it rooted. If u find ur luck and timing to be really good and u wanna twine in a nuke in there to make the fight faster, go for it if u got the mana. However, I don't recommend bolt nukes or rain nukes for this method. Working out the timing is just simply too hard with bolt nukes (due to the delay incurred while bolt travels to target) and rain nukes triple ur chance of breaking root and pet simply can't keep up with it.<br>
Another tip: the great thing bout this method is that u can easily implement chain casting into it. If timing goes wrong too many times u can simply make a new pet instead of healing it. Of course buffing new pet is kinda tough, but if all works out it won't do much tanking anyway so it doesn't matter.<br>
I'm sure I'm missing a few tips and tricks that I personally use when doing this method, and I'm sure that others of u will find new ways of taking advantage of pets manaless root. If u do plz let me know. Oh by the way, this can also be a great way to keep adds at bay when in a group. Most groups give me wierd looks when I tell them I will root the add, but oftentimes its better than the cleric doing the rooting when u get like 4 werewolves or something. Hehe no one cares if the mage dies, besides u prolly won't die, it'll be ur pet first in which case u make a new one. Everyone knows mages are always the last to die hehe.<br>
And one more thing, I used the spiders in PoN as an example for this, however this method can obviously be applied to any mob that ur pet can root and that doesn't summon or cast, as long as u got the guts and the mana to kill it. Good luck to u all and let me know how this works for u, I promise it works wonders for me. And a third of a blue bubble per kill at lvl 57 aint a bad thing.<br>

Cast wrath on angry rooted mob. &quot;Ahha, but Mr. Mage, u tricked us! the dot broke the root and now i'm dead! we hate u Mr. Mage.&quot; Silly children, u died because u stopped reading the post a few lines ago and hastily went to try and kill the mean spiders in PoN. <br>
<br>
The trick to getting around this is prolly the most dangerous part of this method. Watch the cast time when dotting the spider. When there is about one bubble left send in ur pet. One of the awesome things bout the new interface is that u can use pet controls while casting, unlike hotkeys. <br>
<br>
Now this is the part where u rely on luck. The reason I say send in pet at one bubble is because the majority of the time the pet will cast root right after mob is hit with wrath. Now I say majority. Some people might find it to work better to send in pet as mob is hit with wrath. Whatever works for u man. <br>
<br>
This method is all about timing. Often times u will find u have to let pet tank mob while it tries to root it, before u can pull pet off. Once u've gotten the mobs hp low enough u will often find urself running in circles while pet tries to root mob, in which case u pull pet off (spam /pet back off, u know the deal by now). And often times it will work perfectly and pet will root mob after it has charged at u no more than 2 feet. <br>
<br>
Now, at this time u use ur best judgement as to whether or not to rinse and repeat with ur 44 dot. Usually if timing was perfect and neither u nor pet were hurt i'd say go for it and cast 44 dot, again sending pet in at one bub. But if timing didn't work out so well u should prolly spend ur time healing pet, or healing/medding self. <br>
<br>
Don't forget to constantly be sending pet in to root while ur recuperating though. Last thing u want while ur binding ur wounds is a spider sticking its fangs in ur lil caster butt.<br>
<br>
Like I said, this is just a guideline, and u should use ur best judgement as to how to use this method. If u find urself running out of mana too quickly while using both dots, then slow the pace of the fight down and only use one dot. Spider will die slower of course, but that gives u more med time while pet keeps it rooted. <br>
<br>
If u find ur luck and timing to be really good and u wanna twine in a nuke in there to make the fight faster, go for it if u got the mana. However, I don't recommend bolt nukes or rain nukes for this method. Working out the timing is just simply too hard with bolt nukes (due to the delay incurred while bolt travels to target) and rain nukes triple ur chance of breaking root and pet simply can't keep up with it.<br>
<br>
Another tip: the great thing bout this method is that u can easily implement chain casting into it. If timing goes wrong too many times u can simply make a new pet instead of healing it. Of course buffing new pet is kinda tough, but if all works out it won't do much tanking anyway so it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'm missing a few tips and tricks that I personally use when doing this method, and I'm sure that others of u will find new ways of taking advantage of pets manaless root. If u do plz let me know. <br>
<br>
Oh by the way, this can also be a great way to keep adds at bay when in a group. Most groups give me wierd looks when I tell them I will root the add, but oftentimes its better than the cleric doing the rooting when u get like 4 werewolves or something. <br>
<br>
Hehe no one cares if the mage dies, besides u prolly won't die, it'll be ur pet first in which case u make a new one. Everyone knows mages are always the last to die hehe.<br>
<br>
And one more thing, I used the spiders in PoN as an example for this, however this method can obviously be applied to any mob that ur pet can root and that doesn't summon or cast, as long as u got the guts and the mana to kill it. Good luck to u all and let me know how this works for u, I promise it works wonders for me. And a third of a blue bubble per kill at lvl 57 aint a bad thing.<br>
