If the feed back is bad I won't send it lol.<br>
<br>
Magicians to a degree can heal with our ac spells and bandages. I am convinced that we will never become what we once were so I have basically given up. Was going to post this in class balancing but no one goes there so figured I would post it here so that I can get some fast feed back. Much has been talked about regarding magicians in experience groups and for the most part we do ok damage wise. There are different group makeups tho and personally I love to duo with warriors or monks and I do it often. So hear are my ideas to become better in different non-cleric/enchanter group types.<br>
<br>
Single target chloroplast.<br>
<br>
Magicians already get regen in the form of ac buffs. Our ac buffs are not to bad and I think Verant shys away from giving use group versions of these because alot of melee would take this ac/regen spell over the cleric version making them obsolete in alot of ways. So why can't we have a regen spell that we can cast on ourselves and others. With mod rod 2 taking so many hps a stackable single target regen would be nice. Also it wouldn't be out of line since we can already cast regen on ourselves. Druids and Beastmaster can cast clarity like spells on others so why can't int based casters get some form of healing. This would make grouping with warriors and monks alot easier when there is no healer around and promote the inter class dependency that VI so wants.<br>
<br>
Bind Wounds<br>
<br>
Magicians can summon bandages so why can't we take full advantage of them? It doesn't make since that we can summon them as early as lvl 1 I believe so why can't a caster with 255int learn how to bind wounds to the same degree that a ranger or warrior can.  Traditionally the art of healing and medicine takes great int and wisdom and it doesn't seem right that casters cannot bind to over 200 just like melee can. They raised it to 70% for all melee classes so it needs to be raised again for casters. pre-kunark I could understand it maybe but with luclin gear and magicians hitting the 2k mark in hps it is really time for this to change.  If I can sense heading as good as a ranger the same should be for bind wounds.<br>
<br>
Bandages<br>
<br>
Why can't our magicial bandages heal for more then normal store bought bandages? This is another thing that could promote melee classes grouping with magicians when there is no healer around. It wouldn't be as fast as having a cleric around but at least we could do some experience if a warrior and a mage are unable to find a group.<br>
<br>
Pet heals<br>
<br>
These are nice spells but really need to be improved. Maybe not a complete heal pet spell but improve the lvl 52 spell to heal 900hps and the lvl 60 spell to heal 2k hps. IMHO 400m for 900hps isn't very good when you can summon a new pet with 3khps for 400m. With AAexp skills like Quick Summoning it further makes this heal weak and in need of improvement.<br>
<br>
health regen summoned armor<br>
<br>
Why not have a higher lvl version of the summoned plate armor spell. Give each peice +2 regen maybe. That way this armor will really help pets and help on corpse recoveries. As it stands if a group gets wiped out it is very hard to corpse recover if there is no monk or rogue. So having armor with regen would really help when it come to fighting back to bodies. A cleric that is naked and back down to 110wis isn't going to be able to keep a group trying to corpse recover alive for long. Being able to give a melee one or two pieces of armor with some regen as well as a regen buff could really go a long way in making magicians more group friendly. It will also promote different kinds of groups taking place.<br>
<br>
Lastly this suggestion has been mentioned before but I really think this is something that should be looked at. Either allow the magicians to cast burnout on players or allow us to have a player castable version the burnout series that is maybe 45 to 50% haste with the ac and str bonus. <br>
<br>
I didn't sign up for a utility class but post 55 this is truly what magicians are. If we are going to be utility classes at least give us tools to be a respectable utility class. Personally if changes like this went in I would be happy. More nukes that won't be used because we are summoning mod rods or more improved pets that still won't be used on raids is just a waste. Would like to have them but the above changes would impact the class alot more then damage increases.<br>
<br>
And before you flame me I want the damage increases but I think there are other things that can help us also in additions to the damage increases.<br>

If anything, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Clerics</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> should have this ability first and foremost, with Druids in second place.<br>
<br>
Mage bandaids doing more healing per? A % modifier might not be bad, or a hp boost outright when used might be good, though even with a Magician's attention, a melee would still be better off with another healer.<br>
<br>
As for becomming utility, casting buffs or heals on others, I dislike the idea wholeheartedly. I don't want the Mage class to fall into the same problem as Enchanter class does in being buff whores instead of just mod rod whores <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

I never said this or damage upgrades. I said this in addition to damage upgrades. Also during the upgrading of wizards a year ago they received alot more utility in the form of transing. We can receive our utility upgrades (if there are any) in the form of improved regen and bindwounds.  Even with increased nuke power I think the class lacks utility. Also please allow our focus items to stack with dropped focus items.<br>

Then again, we already have plenty to summon for raids as is.<br>
