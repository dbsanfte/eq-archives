1) He (and the dev team) view mages as a whining class with no specific examples or suggested solutions to problems.  As a result they don't even attempt to talk about changes to the mage class (other than nerfing things like CotH).<br>
<br>
2) Mages are viewed as middle of the stack in soloability post-50<br>
<br>
3) Dire charm &gt;&gt; mages in exp groups through to 60 (although they don't have the pet control experience yet, and they're presumably busy with croud control).<br>
<br>
<br>
Key issue, and one I keep bringing up, is #1.  We are a divisive community that can't even get agreement amongst ourselves to a list of problems, let alone suggested solutions.  We whine more than anything else.  And as this all goes on we're being relegated to an average damage dealer, a third level pet class, and middle of the pack soloer.  We're being indirectly nerfed out of existence.<br>
<br>
So we have 2 choices:<br>
<br>
1) Learn to work together and come to a real list of problems and a viable set of solutions that takes into consideration VI's perspective on us (not like most of the ones to date that are rediculous wish lists)<br>
<br>
2) Keep up what's going on and seal our fate<br>
<br>
Your choice.  All of our choices.  As of today, we are only unified in the whining about the VI posts.  I hope this changes soon.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------<br>
I mostly browse the boards but I think this is probably the biggest reason why mages haven't gotten an upgrade in a while.<br>
<br>
Mages want pets to do more damage<br>
Mages want pets to have more HP's<br>
Mages want better nukes<br>
Mages want nukes other then fire/magic<br>
<br>
There's alot more, but the problem is, you really can't raise pet damage and raise nuking damage at the same time.  However, unless pet pathing and the &quot;idea out there&quot; that pets are bad for raids, having pets do more damage won't do much good for the high end mages.<br>
<br>
However, raising nuking damage then makes people wonder why they should play a wizard (though lure based spells help) if mages can do as much damage, have pets, have summoned items, etc.<br>
<br>
Plus, if they make non epic pets better then that means they have to upgrade the epic pet to be better then the non epic ones.  <br>
<br>
I think that is alot of why VI has a very hard time balancing mages the way they are.  They will really never make anyone happy.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ueuripedmoped.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Euriped Moped</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Arch Mage</span><br>  Posts: 311<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 9:15:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.attbi.com/~yolora/zdance.gif height=40 width=40></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Has Alan's comments helped?</span><hr size=1> Ryue: you're simply wrong.<br>

We overlap with many classes and no one is quite sure where we fit in.<br>
<br>
For example, all wizards pretty much seem to agree that their purpose is to throw down the big nukes to make things dead fast.<br>
<br>
There is no such clear guiding philosophy beind the magicians. Therefore, you have every magician forming his or her own opinion on what a mage is. Thus, some mages push for larger nukes because that's how they see their mage. Other mages push for stronger pets because that's how their mage makes sense to them. Others see mages as a form of support class, and push for more group utility. An argument could be made for any of these interpretation of the magician. <br>
<br>
* Pre-50, we often rival wizards in our nuking power.<br>
* We have the strongest pets and are practically helpless      <br>
   Without them<br>
* Our summons probably provide more <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> effects</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we can<br>
   bestow on others than most of the buffing classes (if you <br>
   factor in summoned weapons, food, etc...)<br>
<br>
So the reason I believe mages seem so divisive, is that most people who start a mage have no real concept of what a mage <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> is</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->. And, frankly, at this point you won't be able to establish an overall concept of the mage without greatly upsetting those people who see their mages differently.<br>

<br>
I definately agree with that.  Ufortuantely that's not as an easy fix as everyone thinks.  Pets follow the same pathing as mobs and in order to fix it, every zone would have to be gone through and have the pathing changed.  Long process and I think its one that you'll never see happen as it really only effects 2 classes that rely on pets.<br>
<br>
Magicians all agree that every aspect of the magician class needs to scale up the same past 50, as it did before 50.<br>
<br>
Well, I would agree that pets need to be upgraded.  I agree that high level pets do need more HP's, need to hit harder, , need to be higher level, and need to be balanced better for high end raids.  However, I don't think you'll ever see DD damage changed or added too.  Once you start changing those, then you get into what happened when Kunark came out and Wizards through a fit because we did close to the same damage that their ice comet did.  <br>
<br>
MS3 would be a good spell to work with for a change of the mage class.  Allow it to summon a level 48ish mob that instead of having the skin of something there, actually is the mob itself.  That would be the exact same thing as the enchanters DC, but have less risk because of no chance of it being resisted.  If they don't want to make it MS3, make it a AA skill that summons a high level &quot;Demonlord&quot; pet or something like that.<br>
<br>
However, if you do that, you really trivialize the epic and that would have to be changed.  Its MUCH eaiser to sit and get exp in order to get that skill rather then sit and work on getting everything you need for the epic.<br>
<br>
Every other class in the game scales properly, EVERY SINGLE ONE. Magicians are the only class that does not receive significant upgrades past 50. <br>
<br>
Druids are hurting post 50 and even more after SoL as far as raiding goes.  I've played both a mage and a druid to 54+ and I know the druids pain.  <br>
<br>
Just roll that around your mind. <br>
<br>
Oh, I have.  I stopped playing my Mage when DAoC came out (wish I hadn't, but I was burnt out).  I'm having a hard time deciding to come back or not as I love EQ, but I don't want to get sucked in again.  The mage was fun, but I hated trying to look for a group all the time with little or no luck. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/ugoladus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Goladus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Grand Poobah Goladus</span><br>  Posts: 1147<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 9:28:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Has Alan's comments helped?</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> 1) He (and the dev team) view mages as a whining class with no specific examples or suggested solutions to problems.

Why?  Because I personally think its too big of a project and one that Verant will never take on.  <br>
<br>
Read the comments made about moving the Wizzy spires in East Karana.  That task seems simple enough ... but it means (according to Absor) having to download a 6 megabyte patch, and something that Verant simply will not do.<br>
<br>
Yes in some zones pet pathing means pets are allowed or pets are not allowed ... but the amount of zones where pets are an absolute no no are the minority to zones where they're fine to have up.<br>
<br>
So I would rather see Mages as a whole concentating our efforts on showing Verant how badly we are in need of an upgrade of some sort to stay viable as a class in this game.  Our utility is fine at the moment.  I can even live with disabled CoH in some Luclin zones.  What we need are pets that can put a dent in MOBs with incredibly high AC.  From what I can tell, pets add to about half the DPS of a Mage's damage.  Without the pet sustaining that, Mages fall drastically on the usefulness scale.  After all, we are THE pet class ... with a degree of useful utility.<br>
<br>
AbFab - I personally am a little upset that Absor chose to respond to that person's submission ... because I'm sure he's recieved hundereds of others from Mages that used more tact in their posts and were more clear and concise about our problems.  The only conclusion I can make it the post pissed him off ... and I'm not so sure that's a bad thing.<br>
<br>
I say this because finally some discussion about the Mage class is coming up again on the EQ forums.  And it opens the door for us to try to get something done.  So to answer your question ... I think it has helped.  As long as we don't drop the ball ... and that we try to turn his initial negativity into something constructive that he can take to the development team.<br>

And if you are not in their holy trio, you have a right to angry.  Knowing that this is going to be a melee based game and the trinity is the base of it all, we are left with the choice to either suck it up and be the one or two nontrinity classes on a raid (that is if there are open slots), start a trinity class or go to a different gaming system.<br>
<br>
I agree with the majority of post 50 mages out there that we become more useless as we get closer to the 60 mark.  For the upper level ecounters, our DD/DoT's very rarely stick, the malo line rarely sticks, we are often not allowed pets due to bad pathing and we end up be limited to use CoH in a few CoH friendly zones, drop mod rods and pull up a pet when the call for clerics to camp rings out in a feeble attempt to buy just a few seconds...<br>
<br>
It is apparant to me Absor has never been on a Hate Raid and seen how one pet can cause most of a floor to aggro because the pathing is such that for the pet to go 25ft, it has to take a tour of the floor before getting to the end point.  I am not counting bad pet controllers in this equation and I have met many.  I am purely talking about just bad pathing period.<br>
<br>
And lets talk about the difficulty of our epic.  It is arguably the best thing we as mages can get in the game period.  We cant go to NTOV and get an uber pet drop or an item that gives us bonuses to summoned pets and enhance our spell casting effcientcy.  Wow, its great I can get items to push me well over 200 in INT but if the spells bounce anyway what is the point?  At least with the pet we can do some damage somehow...<br>
<br>
I was a very positive mage till I got to about 54 and then the reality of the whole upperlevel game hit me with a ton of bricks...  My pet, my class defining attribute is taken away because of issues with pathing mostly and due to other experiences with bad pet controllers.  Our DD/Dots dont stick, so now I am down to just trying to Malo and Mod Rod...  <br>
<br>
I love my mage but I cant help but feel like he is neutered once he hit the upper level/end game.  There is no way anyone of importance has played a mage in the upper level game...  There are other classes too that need fixed to be of more use.  We are not alone...<br>

<br>
This is <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> exactly</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> what Alan is talking about.  Statements like this will never get a fix.  Pathing needs fixed in some areas certainly, but not <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> everywhere</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->.  I've never had pathing problems anywhere in Sleeper's Tomb.  Watching the mobs in ToV, the only area I can think of with poor pathing is the zone out behind Lenny the Keeper (thats from pet experience, not mobs), and if there are major problems with pathing there they will be found once more people have /pet hold.  CoM, majority of the zone, same with the Hole.  However, I think thats a little too vague.  PoA, most of the time its fine, drake island is the only that stands out as having horrid pathing.  No real problems with Kael, or Icewell (though its been a while for Icewell).  No problems in PoF.  PoH, the only real problem that comes to mind is in the Maestro's room near the throne.  Perhaps 2nd floor as well, anyone go there often that would know?  PoG has no problems that I can think of that bother pets.  Never had trouble in Sebilis, in the exp area.  After killing Trak, if you stay to kill Juggs for spells, there's some funny pathing in Trak's lair near the left side as you enter it.  Chardok use to have bad pathing down near the nobles.  I haven't been back since the zone was changed though.  No problems that come to mind in Sol B, or LGuk (but its been a while for LGuk).  The way I read Alan's post was, we're listening, but you need to give us specific problems, not more of this &quot;pathing everywhere is broken, make us gods&quot; crap.<br>
<br>
I also disagree with needing to scale the same way we did pre-50.  We got a spell post-50 that we didn't have anything like before, CoH.  It changed our role, whether we like it or not; we aren't just damage anymore.  Personally I think we deserve a tad more damage, (this is just a number I'm throwing out for an example, not anything specific) let's say 10%.  5% increase to our nukes, and 5% increase to pets, since there are some fights where you can only use one or the other.  However, if CoH was done away with, then I would agree that we should scale the way we use to.  Hard to say which I'd prefer though, CoH+minor damage upgrade, or major damage upgrade. <p>~~

I don't think it a coincidence that Alan posted what he did when he did. I think it is the direct result of all of our friendly discussions. I also think he is a lot craftier than people here give him credit for. Look at the post he chose to respond to and the answers he gave. He's asking for specific inputs to help him and the dev team make the final decisions on caster balancing. Well help him out folks!<br>
<br>
Notice he responded to some necro as well a couple days ago, and the cleric epic thing too? Notice the emphasis on dire charm? He's also baiting the enchanters for input. <br>

I predict here and now that we will see the casters adjusted within a month. Hold onto your hats and be careful what you ask for. You might just get it.<br>

i really dont find that much of a problem with pathing in the game.  yeah its bad in some places but ever since summon companion i get around it very easy.  This is the lazy fix but fixes most problems i had ever had w/ pathing.<br>

Would i like it fixed, shrug, rather have other more important things fixed then pathing.  Ppl that cry about pets not being used on raids, shrug i use pet on any raid i want, go out there and show the doubters you have skill enough to control your pet instead of blaming VI for your useless pet skills.

Not so.  All they have to do, and I believe it's  a minor thing to do, would be to have all pet's con indifferent to all mobs.  Then they can wander all they like and not bring every mob with them when/if they return.  <br>
<br>
Maybe we should forget about them changing pathing and just all push for this?<br>

<br>
A.  Verant sees the Mage community as (1) whiney about the abilities we get, (2) overtly demanding for more abilities without long-term consideration of what these added abilities would do, and (3) prone to emotional outbursts rather than reasoned arguments.<br>
<br>
B.  The Mage community sees Verant as (1) overtly smug and contentious about what they decide they're going to &quot;fix&quot; and what classes are worthy of certain abilities, (2) incredibly slow in customer service / response to customer concerns and desires, and (3) prone to uneducated outbursts rather than researched arguments.<br>
<br>
Now, a problem like this does not develop overnight.  In fact, its been brewing for approximately 2 years now, partly due to the lack of open communication between the adminstrative base (Verant) and the customer base (players).  <br>
<br>
As paying customers, we feel that we are purchasing a product.  Under normal market rules, the customers &quot;are always right&quot; and customer demand focuses the direction of work by the producers (in this case, game admin).<br>
<br>
However, Verant has always taken the stance that the admin is always right, and customer demand for service will only interrupt the direction that the admin wishes to take the product.  <br>
<br>
Compound this attitude with a lack to of interest in investigating customer complaints, and you can quickly reach a state of discontent among the customers.  We as customers are unfortunately in a very poor position.  We have no representatives on any design teams.  In fact, our sole &quot;vote&quot; is with our money, and by canceling our subscriptions we let our discontent be known.  But even that is short lived; unlike BMG/Columbia House, Verant doesn't care if we don't come back.<br>
<br>
To finish, No, Alan's Comments have NOT helped.  I feel that his flippancy has only angered our &quot;group&quot; more, as it only adds fuel to our suspicions that Verant is uninterested in the comments of its player base.  From what he has written, he has only proven his unwillingness to research customer complaints, and an unwillingness to conduct internal investigations into why so many of their customers are dissatisfied.<br>

It is my opinion - and I think not an unreasonable stance - that we should be compensated for that fact, even if it is a spell or ability that can only be used on the moon (or in zones where CoH is disabled).  After all, CoH was the major bone we were throne post-50.  It is  not some optional quirk for our class - it is an integral part of our balancing.<br>

<br>
For example, the other day i dusted off an my warrior and was fighting in the basement of Highpass Keep beating up some goblins with a mage and a few others.  Well as you know when goblins start fleeing they head upstairs a bit, well the mage pet instead of following the goblin upstairs hangs a right and runs into next room where 4 goblins were.  well you can probabably guess what happens next. (I had a nice goblin massage).  Now you can claim that this was just an idiot mage (i gave him a few choice words for not watching his pet).  Later this guy got us killed when he summoned a pet and didn't tell it to &quot;guard here&quot;, then preceded to med.  The pet wandered off into the above room and pulled another train when we were all low on health (and another goblin massage).<br>
<br>
But i got to thinking later, if pets follow the same pathing as mobs then why didn't the pet simply follow the goblin up the stairs?  Why don't mobs pace back and forth nervously when they are standing in the same spot?  Why doesn't a mob disappear into a wall when it's chasing you to your death?<br>
<br>
Now i learned good pet control by starting out as a necro (feign death is your friend) and i became a mage because i really enjoyed the pet aspect of necro and saw how mage's kicked my pets arse.  I keep playing my mage because i had faith that VI was going to eventually get around to fixing pathing.  I thought they recognized that pathing is one of the biggest weaknesses of EQ (when a friend of mine got me to start playing EQ said that EQ is a great game but the two biggest problems were Customer Service and Pathing).<br>
<br>
Now pet pathing is something that all classes would like to see improved.  And the above example is not an unusual or even an example from an uber zone.<br>
<br>
I'm sure we could all list about a billion examples of horrid pet pathing, but for the developers to blow off pathing as not a big deal is inane in the extreme <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=rhasinfirestorm>Rhasin Firestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Master Summoner</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#333333>(1/30/02 11:25:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=56.topic&index=17>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: CoH</span><hr size=1> Istaron,<br>

<br>
I do not feel Alan's comments are about his views on the Magician community as a whole. If anything, the magician class reflects the GENERAL POPULOUS of EQ players that overexadurate, overgeneralize, and fail to make good with valid examples of problems in game. Perhaps it's part of Verant's own doing, with nerfing anything player-beneficial (bug) as quickly as possible, and moving with lackluster speed or even disintrest (apparent to us) when it comes to a problem that has plagued players for years (pathing, charm bugs, etc). We perhaps feel we MUST make it seem critical in order to get some action done about it, only to find still no action on Verant's part. <br>
<br>
Too bad this kind of behavior only numbs both sides, and with a general 'corperate' attitude behind Verant, it helps nothing. Perhaps they want to help &quot;The game&quot; but at this point, helping the game ranges from balancing, making things right to ensuring that Verant has pleanty of money to expand, support their staff, as well as to keep people interested (usually done through new releases, and a surge of cash flow in to the company). So when they say they want to help the game, their attitude doesn't necessarily mean &quot;we want to fix things&quot; but rather &quot;we want to ensure we have jobs that we enjoy&quot; and at the moment, they enjoy Everquest from the back end. Usually when they stop enjoying it, they move on to be replaced by someone else that does, with their own ideas of &quot;how things work&quot;.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the fact still stands that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> if</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we want anything done about inequities in the Magician class, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> then</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> we must state problems we feel are the most important. We must state <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> solutions</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (multiple) for each problem. Give them a choice, propose the one solution you want first, but also pose other workable and acceptable solutions. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Help</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> Verant find bugs in the system. Try your best to repeat the bugs, under what circumstances did it occur, where, keep logs. When you make a bug report to Verant, include <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> everything</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> from your thought on what caused it to the raw log itself. Perhaps there's something in there they can use to track it further in their system. Try not to make proposed solutions outrageous, or totally off the wall, but rather workable, acceptable.<br>
<br>
We truely need to find out Verant's view of Magicians, of what defines a magician. Until I hear different, I personally am going under the assumption of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;Magicians are Summoners of things.&quot;</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> We also Conjure things, but those things are secondary to what we do summon. We summon people,  elementals, and monsters (as those can be rationalized to have existed prior to a magician casting). We conjure food, water, beer, arrows, daggers, weapons, armor, utility items, items with effects, and even direct damage spells (as those items created Did Not Exist prior to a magician casting. They were brought into being by the magician). Conjuration and Summoning are very close in nature, and given that a magician MIGHT use magical energy from alternate planes to solidify into an object (matter from a plane of cold to give an item that is imbued with resistances, etc), the way in which a Magician conjures can be viewed as advanced summoning. Therefor, I feel it is safe to presume that this view is correct. The notion that Magician pets are The Best, that Magicians are Pet masters, or similar assumptions are only perks to provide 'uniqueness' between us and Wizards and Necromancers. They are NOT the basis of the class.<br>
<br>
I'm sure I'll have more to say later, but at the moment, that's all I can think of. Be rational, be sane, be realistic, and understand what kind of place you're dealing with concerning Verant. Understand that even they do have limitations on what kind of solution is workable. How many of you would love to go through a massive patch a la Luclin again just to have entire zones revamped as per your vision of a perfect solution? I wager very few. <p>Rhasin Firestorm<BR>

It seems that Alan is willing to get on mages about providing more substance. But yet, not providing the proof that mages are overbalanced when it comes to soloing. <br>
<br>
How are we supposed to respond to a comment like &quot;Mages are overbalanced soloers&quot;. It seems to me that is an emotional comment in an of it self if not made with some facts associated with it. <br>
<br>
It just seems to me that a double standard exists. Its alright for Verant to make comments like &quot;Mages are overbalanced soloers&quot; or &quot;the Mage epic pet is overbalanced&quot; and provide no substance to their claims. But when Mages make the same type of arguments back to them, they are seen as emotional and lacking in fact.<br>

I donno if I've made myself clear or not, but just stop asking for it and they might take us seriously<br>
<br>
they see the same ole &quot;pathing sucks&quot; at the begining of a complaint and write it off as another mage whine, and disregard it, lets talk about things they CAN fix... and lets remember this IS verant, they are going to do the least possible effort they can do in their game, thats the reason they havn't fixed us yet.  There are relatively few mages in comparison to other classes, so when a problem arises, or they make a problem, they are very reluctant to spend time fixing it because its only gonna help a few people.  that is one of the MAJOR reasons they would not fix pathing.  It would take the most major overhaul of the game from the time they released it in EQ history, asside from expansions, they would spend more time on that then anything else, and who is it going to help?  a very very few amount of players that play mages, oh it'll help necros, but again, not too many of them left, beastlords, which there are an overwhelming amount of, but they are all twinks of a more desired class, so they are not going to quit the game caus their warder can't follow em.  In fact verant already got rid of every mage that is gonna quit because of how bad pathing is or several other aspects, so they will NOT fix it, if they leave it the way it is, they lose VERY few people... if they fix it, they have to pay the programmers for a LOT of time, TONS of time to do this, and they will gain *nothing* from it.<br>
<br>
However, if we ask for things they can EASILY fix, they are a LOT more likely to help us out.  What are these issues you talk about?<br>
<br>
Pets not hitting uber mobs<br>
-solution, raise the pets level to about 5 below the caster (people say the original reason they never went over 50 is caus they would automatically summon, well pets are treated as PETS now, NOT npcs, so they will never summon, and I am sure they can put in a code to not all the pets to summon with very little effort)<br>
<br>
WE can't hit uber mobs<br>
-solution, give us a lure already, level 58 or 60 give us some weak ass lure that has no value at all, maybe give us a clone of a level 51 or 52 wiz lure, wizzies are gonna throw a fit right?  give em an unresistable nuke at level 60, that does less damage then their lures, but works on everything, and is unresistable.  Right there you fixed several issues of the mage class not being able to nuke, made the wizzies even happier so they'll stop bitching, and all it took was the creation of 2 spells (maybe 3 or 4 if they give us a couple lures), which is a small amount of time<br>
<br>
Get the point?  ask for things they will realistically give us.<br>
<br>
I look at some of the wish lists people have and I think to myself and wonder if these people have the slightest clue what they are asking verant to do.<br>
Examples<br>
Focus items, I LOVE the idea, several people have said this, I think it would be the single BEST addition to the everquest game.  They're not gonna do it tho, they said they would with luclin, didn't have time and didn't, maybe hope next expansion they will, but dont expect it this time<br>
<br>
Better summons, I really dont give a @#%$ if I can make a loaf of bread or a 15/20 weapon, it doesn't effect me at all.  Stop asking for them, again they need lotsa work but verant has stated time and again that they do not want our stuff so powerful that it has an impact on the economy, and people would twink with a mage friend giving them a weapon and/or armor when they log on, instead of buying it.  Stuff with effects on it?  same thing, not gonna happen.  I would LOVE more summons, but lets face it, we didn't start a mage so we could conjure up weapons, we started it for the pets, with the combination of having potent nukes, and the other aspects.<br>
<br>
All the spell ideas you come up with, great stuff, but theres no !@#$ing way they're gonna give em to us, so again, stop asking for em, caus when you do they just ignore your whole paper on it.<br>
<br>
AA abilities need some MAJOR work, this is a valid complaint and needs to be fixed, but lets again be realistic in our suggestions for new ones<br>
<br>
<br>
ALSO, our other problem is specific examples.  When you provide a complaint, NEVER EVER EVER send it in without examples, it'll just take up their precious time reading it so they can disregard it, instead of reading maybe an important one.<br>
<br>
Alan wants examples of pets that can be dire charmed that put our epic to shame?  lets make him a list and send it in.<br>
<br>
Want examples of a pet vs. an uber mob, see how much damage it actually does?<br>
If anyone here can stand to sit a round out (if your guild is good enough) and simply collect data, parse it, see what our pets DPS on anything vindi class or above, compare it to warrior, rogue, monk, SK, pal, etc. parse it all up, come up with specific DPS ratios on them, send it in, along with a copy of the log, so they can parse it if they want<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok I think I've rambled enough... we need to be consistant about it, thats all<br>
<br>
Ron if you read this could we maybe have a forum similiar to library submisions for a small period of time, allow everyone to post all their ideas, then have you, or any other good rep. of the mage class go through it, see what we believe are viable complaints, with enough evidence, draft up a report on it, and present it for verant plz?  have this forum have all the evidence and stuff too, moderate it if you have to and get rid of the moans and groans people are sure to put in...<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

<br>
Perhaps you missed my previous post up there in this thread on this very issuse.<br>
<br>
They dont <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> have to</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> go through every zone to fix the pathing, they only have to make pets con indifferent to all mobs.  Then the pet can wander all he wants and not cause a group or entire raid to get wiped out.<br>
<br>
If they made that change, there would no longer be a reason (read excuse sometimes) for raid or group leaders to tell us to dump our pets.  And that includes Chanters upset about pets breaking mez, since the adds won't hit the pet to get on it's hate list unless we send them to attack it.<br>
