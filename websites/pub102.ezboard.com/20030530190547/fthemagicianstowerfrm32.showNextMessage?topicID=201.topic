I am not sure we can narrow our focus to 3 specific issues, but I would like to attempt to do so.<br>
<br>
Once we have accumulated enough data to choose 3 issues which the the majority of mages want addressed, then we will have to go through the process of accumulating data to prove that they are valid issues. <br>
<br>
I would like this post to follow certain rules so as not to fill it with garbage if possible.<br>
<br>
1. No mage will post more than once as this will skew the results.<br>
<br>
2. No mage will post more than 3 specific issues in the hopes of keeping the topic focused.<br>
<br>
3. Please list level and guild status to determine your experience level.<br>
Guild status as follows.<br>
1 = Uber Guild<br>
5 = No Guild<br>
<br>
4. Your xp status:<br>
Rank as follows:<br>
1. Solo<br>
2. Group<br>
3. Group some of the time, but solo more often.<br>
4. Solo some of the time, but group more often.<br>
<br>
5. Your raid experience:<br>
<br>
Rank as follows:<br>
1. Have raided the biggest toughest MOBs this game has to offer. I have helped Kill Tunare, and the dragons run when my guild and I show up. <br>
5. I haven't seen an Uber MOB. <br>
<br>
Now lets see if we can get this survey rolling and get some real information on what issues mages would like to see addressed. No need for suggestions at the moment, lets just come up with the issues first.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nathariusbladestorm>Natharius Bladestorm</A> at: 3/3/02 1:21:15 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nathariusbladestorm>Natharius Bladestorm</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 109<br> <font color=#333333>(2/25/02 2:08:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re</span><hr size=1> I will start this post off.<br>

My top three mage issues:<br>
1. Pets taking half xp if they do half damage.<br>
<br>
2. Lack of ability to use pets on raids consistently. (I haven't been able to use my pet on one raid so far, this is driving me crazy.)<br>
<br>
3. Lack of a really compelling class specific AA skill. (I don't have any experience with the high end AA skills, but I don't see one that makes me really want to get it. This has been especially so after having read other mages experiences with our class specific AA skills, and seeing what other classes are getting.)<br>

<br>
issues of concern: <br>
<br>
1. pet dmg/hp increase from  49 pets to the post 50 pets... increase? there is one? lol.<br>
<br>
2. epic quest..earth staff in hate sucks. why? because once you join a gulid capable of doing more than hate, unless you beg and plead ya never go back to hate.. and then magi isn't up so its a waste of time for everyone.  make our quest hard, not by rare spawns that are easy to kill but require long camping, make some freakin hard mobs to kill that always drop the piece and can be triggered...(ya did it for other classes, why not us?)<br>
<br>
3. pets taking half xp...<br>
<br>
4(rallos zek specific) let me use my AE spells without hitting grp members and pets.  i can use PB ae and they don't hit grp, but kill pet, i can use rains to not hurt pet, but they hurt other grp members pets and other grp members... sheesh..shouldn't be that hard to fix..)                         <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/unitrooftheorb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Nitro of the Orb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#333333>(2/25/02 8:07:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   My Opinion</span><hr size=1> Guild Status: 4<br>
XP Status: 3<br>
Raid Status: 5<br>
<br>
Major Complaints:<br>
<br>
A) Mage pets have absolutely HORRIBLE pathing, making them useless in dungeons.<br>
<br>
B) Mages have no defense without pet. I think that giving us some kind of immobilization spell line (preferably a snare spell line, similar to the rangers) would seriously help us. As for this making us overpowered... I had a good friend who I watched play one day. Level 35 druid, could quad-kite giants when no-way no-how I could without some nice buffs (SoW) and preferably a snare from a passing druid. Same with necros. If Verant thinks that we're almost overpowered, they need to take a look around...<br>
<br>
C) Better DS line of spells. Mages really should have a much better line of DS's. Face it, our pets will never deal the kind of damage to even really hurt a blue MOB. DS's, not only one of our main contributing party skills, do most of the dmg to MOBs when we solo with pets. At least for me. The Druid DS being 1-2 points lower than ours seriously eliminates a desire for a mage in group.. after all druid can heal, snare, root, nuke as well or better than us, and Evac (dungeons/raids mainly)<br>
<br>
D) Okay, so I'm not supposed to have a fourth... but hey. Mages have NO defining role on raids or even high level groups. CoH has been nerfed most places it is needed, more nukes possible. I had a friend who was trying to join the UBER guild on the server. He was a level 60 mage, epic equipped and very experienced. When he applied for membership, he was told &quot;We already have a mage.&quot; As opposed to the 14 warriors, 12 druids, and 9 clerics? Not to mention the large assortment of other classes not even mentioned. Mages are almost USELESS in a lot of raid situations. Not to mention one of the biggest quoted mage &quot;assests&quot;, a pet, will ruin any type of dangerous dungeon raid. Even in low level dungeons like Guk and Splitpaw etc my pet would often kill my group with bad pathing.<br>
<br>
Just my rant, I've got more but have to go.<br>

Guild Status - 3<br>
XP Status - 4<br>
Raid XP - 3<br>
<br>
1) Biggest problem in my eyes is the lack of &quot;Desirable&quot; Role for mages post 50. This affects our ability to get into pickup groups and into pickup raids. Our only true role post 50 is as a damage dealer, and that does not make us extremely appealing, when their are 10 main roles (MA, SA, Puller, Snarer, Healer, Slower, Haster, Clarityer, Crowd Controller, evacer) in a group that need to be filled. Damage is generally not thought of as a role in a group, because most everyone can do damage.<br>
<br>
2) Second biggest problem, is our lack of scaling post 50. At 49 Mages are very strong, and in the world of Mudflation still right amoung the best classes in the game. By 55 this is no longer the case. We need to scale better post 50. The risk of using a pet should be equal to the reward. I could care less with pets being made indifferent, IF the reward were made large enough to make finding a way to use the pets worthwhile in more situations, I'd be a happy camper.<br>
<br>
3) The above two are, my biggies for Mages. I would say my third item would be the lack of quality caster loot available. For melee, there are many options for best items to use for different slots of your inventory. For casters this is not the case. Boots of blade calling and Burnt wood staff for example. In all of EQ there are two items that can Significantly increase the DPS and downtime of a mage. For melee, items that can increase DPS are everywhere. I was on a Chardok Royals raid over the weekend and both a Shard of Night and Argent Protector dropped, not too mention several other fine weapons that any low untwinked 50's melee would have been happy with. Other than a few low 50's spells, not ONE caster item dropped. This just seems very wrong to me. Loot should be better balanced. Casters should have the same oppourtunities to improve themselves as Melee. Part of the FUN of EQ is improving your character though upgrades, and the oppourtunities are just not there like they are for Melee.<br>
<br>
That's it,<br>

XP Status: 3 (but if not for mages having a hard time finding groups, i would prefer 4 <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   )<br>
Raid Status: 4<br>
<br>
my mage issues:<br>
1) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  bad pathing</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. the risk vs reward in pet usage is all out of wack. the extra damage that comes from a mage pet doesnt warrent the potential raid wipeout causing effects bad pathing has.<br>
i realize pathing issues can never be realistically solved. however, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  can</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> implement make shift work arounds. ideas: <br>
a)the most obvious i can think of, is to make pets indifferent to all mobs. if the pet gets sucked up to the 2nd floor of hate... who cares? he wont aggro anything.<br>
b) make it so when pets are feared they only <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  stop attacking</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and dont actually physically run anywhere.<br>
c) change it so that once pets are a certain distance away from their target, both parties lose all aggro for each other (both the pet and the mob).<br>
<br>
2) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  make spells more common</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. spells arent like gear. once gear is used, it can be sold. once a spell is scribed, its gone forever. if that player quits the game? the spell is almost wasted. ideas:<br>
a) make spell drops more common than gear drops. like i said, gear can be resold. spells cannot, therefore it makes sense that spells should drop more often.<br>
b) leave the drop rates alone, but change it so spells are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  unscribeable</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> and can be sold once the user is done with it.<br>
<br>
3) <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> reestablish mages as the 2nd best offensive spellcaster</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. this title has been awarded to druids post 50, and frankly makes absolutely zero sense to me. mage dses should be made longer to compensate for slows (longer duration than the druid ds), and our nukes should once again be markedly superior to druid nukes.<br>
<br>
4) i know we are supposed to only put 3, but that just isnt enough. <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  address the low level game mudflation issue</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->. casters have lost <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  alot</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> of power in the pre 45 game. this is because melee weapons are useable at any level, whereas caster weapons are level restricted. ideas:<br>
a) change the &quot;anti-twink&quot; damage cap code. to my knowledge it was designed when melees were far less powerful than they are now. it is simply unacceptable that a L34 <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  warrior</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> crits for half as much damage with an easily aquired centi weapon, than a L34 wizard nukes for.<br>
b) impose level requirements for weapons. just as caster weapons are level restricted, so should be melee weapons.<br>

top 3 mage issues<br>
<br>
1. Pet attack and ac levels 51+. They just dont scale like they should and did before 50. Verant says they are supposed to be like a warrior with their disadvantage being th lack of total control. Well not 50+. Also why dothey take so long to buff themselves, and why dont they taunt at any regular rate?<br>
<br>
2. Some of the AA abilities &quot;suck ass&quot;, &quot;suck ass&quot; is an official scientific term. And some dont work.<br>
<br>
3. Nukes. Why dont we get other elemental based nukes and why cant we get one lure type nuke spell. Can be bad mana/damage ratio and doesnt have to rival wizards power, but plz let us land something on Venril Sathir and other mobs that we cant even touch at the moment.<br>

<br>
First (and most pressing) issue-<br>
<br>
our class AAXP skills are AWFUL.  For a look at a int caster class with good AAXP class skills, look at wizards.  Enchanter skills are OK.  I don't have enough high level necro friends to have a good opinion on their skills.  But Magician skills are the worst.  Elemental Pact, Frenzied Burnout, and Improved Reclaim Energy are broken (or were, last I checked).  Turn Summoned isn't as advertised.  Elemental illusions not only don't last as long as the recast, by far, they are all tied to the same refresh timer.  Mass Group Buff costs 9 points, but we only have one spell that uses it (Aegis of Ro), and that spell lasts a very short period of time.  Pet Hold is the only one I'd consider getting.  Quick Summoning doesn't actually speed up anything *useful*.  Mend Companion I don't have anything to say about.  That should cover it.<br>
<br>
Totals:<br>
Broken/misadvertised: 4<br>
Underpowered/useless: 7<br>
Useful: 1<br>
<br>
Now, I know most of the other classes have a lot of &quot;underpowered/useless&quot; skills.  So that category isn't what I'm focusing on.  I'm mainly concerned about the broken ones.<br>
<br>
Other, minor things-<br>
<br>
It shouldn't take forever for our pets to DS themselves, but sometimes it does.<br>
<br>
CoH being nerfed in Luclin.  This was a bigger issue before, but they re-enabled it in Ssra, which was the biggest problem.  A raid can always &quot;ghetto CoH,&quot; but it's a major pain in the butt.  VI should realize we're going to do that anyways, and disabling CoH just makes raids take longer and have way more downtime when adding people.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well, that's my 3 things.  I'd like to address some of the other people's concerns though.<br>
<br>
problem: mages have no defense without pet.  <br>
solution: have a pet up.  if pet's gonna die, chain another pet, run like hell, or gate.<br>
<br>
problem: mages have no defining role on raids<br>
solution: modrod2 doesn't count as one?  having a cleric/mage group with a cleric pumping out group CH and mages dropping rods nonstop does wonders for Luclin mobs that take FOREVER to kill, otherwise everyone runs out of mana.  Necros are the one who should have this complaint.  The only thing they were really useful for (twitching), we're now better at.<br>
<br>
problem: quality caster loot<br>
solution: well, it's getting better slowly.  FT items are helping somewhat.  I'd say that this is less of an issue now than it was with Velious though<br>
<br>
problem: wizard envy (different elements, lures)<br>
solution: make a wizard.  we get pets instead of diverse nukes and lures.<br>
<br>
problem: bad pathing<br>
solution: the entire way pathing works in EQ sucks.  I don't think there is a real solution.  Just a large set of hackish pathing patches.  It's a neverending struggle, but I don't think it ever really can be fixed without reworking pathing altogether.<br>
<br>
problem: druid envy<br>
solution: spell-wise, we're no longer the second best nukers.  but, how much do your guild druids get to nuke?  our guild druids always end up buffing and healing on raids, and solo, quad kiting, which has more to do with their snare ability than nuke ability.<br>

At leave 60, the best pre-ancient nukes (none harder to get than a) kunark drops b) velious drops c) 56-60 SoL drops)<br>
<br>
Note: Of course wizards would have their spell damage of some of their spells to be upgraded also.<br>
<br>
Biggest problem I see with nukes ATM is the small increase in damage from pre 51 nukes, some 10 or more levels lower than some of our 51+ nukes.  51+ levels are also roughly 5X harder than pre 51 levels, and the increase in nuke damage would suggest that post 51 levels would be easier than pre 51 levels.<br>
<br>
Highest Fire Bolt (seeking flame) - 1500-1600ish (should be noticably stronger than a level 49 wizards bolt)<br>
Highest Semi-Fast Fire DD (fiery blades) - 1200ish (a DD slightly stronger than a wizards 49 bolt)<br>
Highest Magic DD (SoS) - 1200ish (same as fire DD)<br>
Highest Fast Cast Fire Bolt (Upgrade to Scars at 59 or 60) - 800 (fast cast version of the level 49 mage bolt)<br>
Low 50s Semi-Fast Fire DD (Char) - 800-900ish (the same or slightly better damage than the 49 bolt.  This DD needs to last us till level 57)<br>
Low 50s Fast Cast Fire Bolt (Scars) - 600 (Equal to the mage 44 magic DD)<br>
<br>
An upgrade of somesort to Scintilation at 59 or 60 would also nice.  Even if it did the same damage for the same mana but didnt have the long recast time.<br>
<br>
And to compare the upgraded mage nukes to what I think 60 druids should be doing...<br>
<br>
Highest Cold DD (Moonfire or whatever) - 1200ish<br>
Highest Fire DD (starfire or whatever) - 1200ish<br>
Of course these spells would also have longer casting time and not quite as good a ratio as the mages 1200ish fire/magic DDs. Their DDs should do no more damage than the highest mage DD (now they do as much as the highest mage bolt IIRC).<br>
<br>
These numbers were generated with raids in mind.  The question is how would these upgrades effect soloing and grouping.  If they would give us too good of an increase, make the upgraded spell damages only work on mobs that are flagged &quot;raid&quot; mobs.  Any mob that isnt killed by one group with XP as their primary focus should be flaged raid, or at least any mob that takes more than one group to kill.<br>

My big three are as follows:<br>
<br>
1: Offensive niche--I think we should get an upgrade to Scintilation and give us a niche is some aspect of the game (in this case PB AE).<br>
<br>
2: Pet Melee-- Out pets melee has fallen WAY off post 50, I think a simple fix to this would be summoned procing spells/weapons for pets ONLY.<br>
<br>
3: Pet control--making /pet hold an Arch AA is insulting.  I personally would like to see the addition of an eye of zomm like capability with our pets.  I am also pretty upset over the whole Neco/Ench Dire Charm capability, which is WAY better than any pet we have.  They should offer that capability to Magicians as well, maybe making it a Summon Mastery like ability where as we Summon the creature as apposed to charming it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub6.ezboard.com/uvenytir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Venytir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mage</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#333333>(3/12/02 8:28:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=113.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Survey: Top Three Mage Issues...</span><hr size=1> Wertwert Wert<br>
55 Mage<br>
Guild = 1, maybe 2<br>
Exp = 4<br>
Raid = 2 <br>
(Our server's only killed tunare once and we're KOS to that guild..)<br>
<br>
I'd first like to respond to the above poster who said an upgrade to Scintillation. While I agree that is an excellent idea, on my sever (pvp), PBAE's are pretty much useless except for AE grouping.<br>
<br>
1. Lack of a defined role:<br>
<br>
In the past few months, I've raided several locations in Luclin and Velious (notably ToV and Ssra). Throughout that time, I've found my role has shifted from being a DD to a person who CotH's people. My role as a Mod Rod Distributor is not as valueble to the raid as if I was another tank or cleric. In any case, I have found it is more valuble to camp out in a location in ToV and then, when needed, I could log on and CoH people to that location. This isn't what I what the mage class was supposed to be about. <br>
<br>
2. Weak Damage, High Resists:<br>
<br>
I play on a PVP server where resists are crucial. When in PVP, I must kill the pet because it is more of a liability  (training is pretty much legal) then anything. As a result, Im left to nuking to do damage.<br>
<br>
Where a tank can defend themselves against me (by getting FR and MR) I have absolutely no way of protecting myself against a tank. Where I can nuke for 300dmg (with resists) every 6 or so seconds, a tank can hit for 500+ in that time. <br>
<br>
Resist values must be decreased. Mage's must be given better  options (I liked the idea of the physical damage based nuke)<br>
<br>
3. AAXP: Useless. This is a joke. We have one valuble skill, /pet hold, which should be given anyway. Bad pathing and pet aggro are a problem with the game mechanics, not the skill of the caster (obviously a good mage can get them off the mob, by that time you're usually dead anyway). Why are mages penilized for using a pet, which is supposed to be their defined role? <br>
<br>
Moreover, tanks were given disc's which upp'd their damage and their utility 50+. Now, with Luclin, tanks are given another upgrade on damage and utitlity. Casters are given a few skills (such as fury and faster casting time) which make them on par with the moderate damage of a tank. <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> HOWEVER!</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> tanks do not pay the price for this damage in the form of downtime! Casters do. Which leads me to my final point...<br>
<br>
4. Items which increase mana regen:<br>
<br>
To create sustained damage, casters use items (such as BoBC). To even out the damage of melee's without increasing short term damage of casters, more items which create sustained damage need to be added.<br>
<br>

60 Mage<br>
Guild = 1<br>
Exp = 3<br>
Raid = 1<br>
<br>
(Killed everything except for highest luclin mobs such as emperor)<br>
<br>
I feel for the mage poster above, however I disagree about not changing the game due to PVP concerns.  There are 4 pvp servers among many others, and while bugs should be fixed IE Charm, our nuke upgrades should not be hindered by PVP.  All my concerns directly relate to our damage in fights, nothing is as important as our damage since as mages that was our primary role<br>
<br>
1 - Loss of pet damage.  Pre 50 our pets raised 8 max damage per spell level and around 5 levels, they were very close to the mob level.  However in kunark and in velious/luclin our pets have not scaled at all relative to mobs, they barely hit and do low damage vs luclin while melees continue to get weapon uprades.  The AE on mobs destroy makes, make them almost useless as well.  Pets need to be revamped for magicians and possibly necros to a lesser degree to include a higher level base, possibly inclusion of AA skill to negate AE's, high AC and atk.  The damage cap of pets seems decent to me since they have a  much larger minimum damage compared to PCs, however if they don't hit the mob or survive it's a moot point<br>
<br>
2 - Loss of Nuke power in relation ot Wizards and Druids.  Pre 50 our nukes did roughly 70% (sorta averaging our 2 best vs wizard 2 best).  And about 95% of druid nuke, however our bolt spells are almost useless on raids so we are forced to use less damage/mana ratio nukes.  In kunark our damage ratio dropped to around 55% of wizards and 85%ish to druids, and in Luclin it dropped to 38% of wizards, however stayed the same vs druids.  If mages are supposed to be a primary damage dealer, i do not understand why our nukes are pathetic and our pets cant hit mobs<br>
<br>
3 - AA skills - None of our CLASS skills directly affect our damage dealing potential.  KEY point - Frenzied burnout IS bugged, HOWEVER even unbugged it does not increase damage by any noticable amount.  The skill should add some base damage to the pet and last atleast 5 minutes, to 10 minutes to even have this skill worth 6 points.  At this moment I wouldnt buy it for 1 point.  We're masters of pets yet recieve no pet skills<br>
<br>
I sternly believe concentrating on our lack of offensive ability is the way to go <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60178"> Ylaine D'esibour- Archmage</a><br>
