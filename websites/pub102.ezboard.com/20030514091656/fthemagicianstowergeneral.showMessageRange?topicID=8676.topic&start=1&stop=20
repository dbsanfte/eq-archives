On the other hand I see plenty of Mages, Rogues, Wizzies, Rangers, etc in zone LFG until the point where they give up and try the next zone.<br>
<br>
The problem is that fast damage should be a good enough mitagation of damage that a slower is not needed. A dead mob makes no more damage, however as good as our new damage potential is it doesn't drop these mobs fast enough to mitagate enough damage. I believe there should be a decrease in mob hps in much of PoP to the point where offensive power is as useable as defensive (slows). This would allow secondary healers to be more valuable, this would make high DPS characters more valuable, and would make average tanks more valuable (as they will only need to tank for so long per fight). The fights on regular xp mobs should be short enough where slow is only useful when you are LACKING the dps you should have. Slow is still valuable in a offensive poor group, and certainly still valuable in larger longer fights. <br>
<br>
The other alternative is for DPS dependant classes to get upgrades, however that would clearly have far reaching repurcussions in old zones, raids, pvp, etc. <br>
<br>
I see no problems with xp yardtrash having thier hps dropped (and perhaps a portion of their xp dropped as well), while leaving tougher mobs (with xp fully intact) for the groups who have it all in terms of offense and defense. This fixes grouping problems and allows for the occassional soloing. The only other change I can see that might need to be made is adding in a few more non snareable mobs so that all of the new lower hp mobs don't just become quadder fodder. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heofmanyfals>HeOfManyFals</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 65<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 5:39:33 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Doesn't work that way</span><hr size=1> The problem is, you are trying to examine a single kill.

The problem is in many situations that you can't kill at all without slow. The best you can do is try kiting, but I think any mage who has tried knows that when the mob does turn to your pet during a kite, it won't live long enough for you to regain aggro.<br>
<br>
With slow yiou can kill a steady stream of mobs, which adding dps to will speed up the stream. All I'm asking for is the ability for us to kill the same number of kills without a slower, and then suffer the downtime. They kill steady, we kill a lot fast, then sit and recoop. Sounds like an even trade to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=heofmanyfals>HeOfManyFals</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 66<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 5:55:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Ermm, that's the problem</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>They kill steady, we kill a lot fast, then sit and recoop.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's what I was getting at.  Groups don't do this, at least not in my experience.  They will continue to seek out a slower until they find one.  Noone wants to sit in an xp group.<br>
<br>
Maybe your xp group experience is different than mine, though.  IME, if mobs die faster, the puller pulls faster. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celanxev>CelanXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 254<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 6:03:20 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re:</span><hr size=1> If you got rid of slows then some things could become more difficult.

<br>
Would be something along the lines of Elemental Curse<br>
<br>
The fire pet (*edit, 50+ fire pets) would randomly cast it, along with its normal useless spells, and would cause the mob to miss normal hits 30-50% of the time randomly<br>
<br>
This is not a slow per say but making the mob miss 50% is similar to being slowed 50%.<br>
<br>
The length could vary but I would say no longer than 30 seconds max.<br>
<br>
If one were to give the spell to mages and wizards, it would have to be a high mana cost, high taunt spell with a longer recast time than the spell would last imo.  Not so much mana that it would prevent one from casting any spells but maybe just casting it once per mob.<br>
<br>
Not very likely that either will happen but we can dream right?<br>
*edit<br>
<br>
Oy this would not stack with slow for obvious reasons and slow would override this spell 50+ <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wrathen@themagicianstower>Wrathen</A> at: 2/3/03 6:30:18 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=celanxev>CelanXev</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 258<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 10:44:46 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: how about...</span><hr size=1> That would be pretty uber on slow, but hard hitting mobs, Wrathen. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tenner>tenner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(2/3/03 11:14:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   ..</span><hr size=1> Just make our useless fire pet cast that cure instead of it's useless DD/dispell/root/stuns.<br>
<br>
Since fire pet doesn't cast at constant interval, it sholdn't be too overpowering for him to cast it. <br>
(in order for him to cast it, make it a buff spell that we can cast on him to change him to cast that spell instead.)<br>
<br>
and why slow is better than damage, because you only need 1 slower to have slow's max effect (namely slow) <br>
and if you only have 1 damage dealer he would go oom after the first few mobs or if it's a rog, the damage doesn't out-weight the migitation as slow. <br>
Slow takes relatively little mana(may be not to BL's but they are a hybrid) <br>
<br>
So in terms of usefulness, slow &gt; damage because it can be cast over and over and over and over..etc. <br>
but a single dmg dealer-- if he needs a mob to die fast enough .. enough that to have the tank take the same damage as a slower is present, he would go OOM fast.(and if it's a rog, he probably can't do it) <br>
<br>
Not to metion slower <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>can</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> do damage too.(shaman/chanter(without charm) can keep a 60 dps no problem on top of slow each fight)<br>
<br>
But a damage dealer can't slow.(so if the damage deal can do a 30-40% slow on top of their dps, it would be more balance)<br>

  A poster in an earlier thread had the best idea I've read.  His idea was to have a pet only, summoned item that would proc a short duration slow on a mob only when it hit the pet.<br>
<br>
  Our pets aren't hit normally when any other melee is in range.  So it would be useful only when pet is in melee.  Short duration would mean if pet started fight, slow would drop when other melee went in.  <br>
<br>
  This would let our pets last long enough in fights to be useful to the mage again against PoP mobs.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=kassinova>Kassinova</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 208<br> <font color=#333333>(2/4/03 1:47:03 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Earlier idea best I've read</span><hr size=1> a slow proc would be a cool idea.

If fights were short enough, slows value would be considerably less.<br>
<br>
My main point was a group with a slower might be able to take a mob every 4 minutes (for example, I know it would be more often). A very offensive oriented group should be able to take a mob every 2 minutes until they needed a med break, at which point they would med for approximately 2 minutes for each mob they had killed, making the number of kills equal in both groups. This is not how it is in reality, but how a balanced game would likely work in ideal terms. The question is, can we think of a way that would allow this reality, not just for us, but for all classes that are offense oriented? In my opinion high damage low hp xp mobs it would be as valuable to burn them down quick and med, as it would be to slow and then kill them in a constant stream of kills (each kill taking longer, but with less downtime). <br>

<br>
When modelling fights, I keep coming across the formula:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>Power = Hit Points * Damage Per Second</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
A 65-75% slow reduces the mob DPS to a third to a quarter.<br>
Or seen another way, it is equivalent to multiplying the main tank's hitpoints by 3-4 times, AND multiplying all heals by 3-4 times.<br>
In order for offense to be equivalent to that kind of slow, it would have to reduce the mob's hitpoints by 65-75% in a very short amount of time.  Only manaburn comes close.<br>
<br>
Slow is one of the most powerful abilities in the game.  It outstrips both healing and damage dealing.<br>
The only saving grace is that slows do not stack, while damage dealing does.<br>
<br>
It is futile to seek to make damage dealing comparable to slow.<br>

na.. ideal group depends on situation .. if things can be sigle pulled 90% of the time.. then take the chanter out and put in a ranger/rog/mage instead. <br>

If not .. keep the chanter and get him to play with charm.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sithril>Sithril</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Magician</span><br>  Posts: 33<br> <font color=#333333>(2/4/03 11:20:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowergeneral.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=8676.topic&index=16>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.rgv.net/~bburns/EQ/sithrilonhead.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: ..</span><hr size=1> Or even better, take out the shaman and use a fully booked beastlord.<br>

I can slow 65% and on top of that add on DPS between and monk and rogue.  I bring some candy also, such as Spiritual Dominion (9 hp 9 mana regen to group per tick) and Spirtiual Vigor (225hps and 53 atk to group).

Slows certainly helped when you didn't have the damage to take something out quickly, at  which point slows saved a ton of healing mana, however most groups just didn't need slow if you could kill quickly. That no longer seems to be true in PoP.<br>
<br>
I remember initial thoughts on PoP when it came out was that this expansion was a damage dealers dream, as mobs needed to be taken out quickly, however I think that  damage dealers just can't dish out enough damage quick enough to make up for no slow. There are plenty of ways Verant could support different types of encounters. Instead of all mobs hitting very hard, and slows being king, they could make many mobs regen very quickly but not hit as hard. This would make slow less valuable as you don't WANT to kill something slowly, you want it dead as fast as possible. They could also (as I've mentioned) reduce hps on mobs so that fights are short enough that slows value is lessened. <br>
<br>
Slow doesn't HAVE to always be the best way to do things, that's just how things are now. I also don't think a nerf of slow is in any way needed, we just need different types of encounters. <p><!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:red;font-family:helvetica;font-size:small;"><!--EZCODE CENTER START--><div style="text-align:center"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>I don't want it - I just need it.<br>

<br>
the problem is that if BL needs to be doing the soloing all the time, he would have to just sit through the fights for mana just to slow. <br>
<br>
While shaman's mana regen is ... ... .... notorious. <br>
<br>

<br>
is BL even capable of &gt; monk damage? <br>
I have no idea. <br>
<br>
Thought if they have to do slow, their dps would be much lower (from what i've heard).<br>
<br>
Also, even if they don't have to do slow, doesn't monks have triple attack? <br>
While BL can only dual weild.<br>

Which BL buff give better stat than shaman buff? <br>
sta? cha? str? agi?<br>
I thought all the BL stats buffs are inferiors to shaman. <br>
I mean BL doesn't even have avatar. <br>

Bards are good pullers, great mana, great support.  I've been in some cave groups where we had bard, mage, cleric, warrior, SK, ranger.  Ranger or bard pulled, bard handled any crowd control, warrior tanked, SK did dps and their little hp/mana thing (I love being in a group with 2 SKs), my pet and DS, cleric mark of retribution/retaliation whatever it is now.<br>
<br>
Of course, the warrior was very well-geared with a lot of AA (high AC, defensive skills, he's a real stickler on tweaking his DPS and stats) and everyone else was pretty well stacked in the gear department, so this setup might not be best for pickup groups of people with velious armor and holes filled in by bazaar items. <p><a href="http://home.elp.rr.com/scythek/everquest/">Tuis Kagato</a> - Arch Convoker of Karana (<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=175764">Profile</a>) - <a href="http://www.pandemonium.cc/">Deloth's Dudes</a><br>
