I read this drops from sirens in CS. Now I am not too familiar with that zone. I only know of one siren camp, which is at the zone to Sirens Grotto. I looked there and saw four of them, all green or light blue to me at 61.<br>
<br>
I set up near the zone to SG, then moved ahead carefully, until I got aggro from the closest siren. Then quickly retreated to my pet, however there seems to be a pathing bug, the siren never came. When I moved ahead a bit, she casted, but just didnt follow me. Finally I got hit with two 500+ nukes, and decided to better zone. Directly at the zone, I got hit by the siren! Still didnt see her, think she was under the ground.<br>
<br>
Next time I tried to set up my camp outside of that tunnel. Didnt work out too well, this time the siren charmed my pet (&quot;ouch, stop that Karantik!&quot;).<br>
<br>
I would really appreciate some info on how to best (solo) fight the sirens, and if there are other camps which may be easier. Thanks in advance!<br>

<br>
What you do is to run all the way out the peninsula with the wywerns and kill the one at the very end. You should preferrably be at full mana and without the pet, because you risk it being charmed. Mem a good nuke that isn't line of sight, like char or shock of swords. On the right side of the peninsula there are three sireens over the water that should be deep green to you. You just target and burn them down, all three. On the other side of the peninsula there is a rock sticking out. Under this and above the water there is another sireen. Use the eye for target. Last, standing where this last sireen was, looking out over the water, there is two more sireens by a rock to the right and under the water. You need to get into the water to get these and there is a good chance you aggro both. Rince - repeat. For safety, bring another nuker.<br>

You should be able to rock them at your lvl with the 61 stun pet. <br>
<br>
Park your pet at the ramp to SS. Go to end of rocks, target a siren and hit it with malosini or cancel magic. After your spell hits the siren, run back to your pet and spam your /pet back off button. If the siren comes over the rock, sick pet in. If the siren is still somewhere below the rocks and keeps nuking you, just run a bit farther away. <br>
<br>
Ask one of the local druids for a resist magic and keep levi on you all the time. Easy.<br>

By standing near the edge on pennisula, use the overhead camera view and you can easily target the ones below.<br>
I always used air pet for the stuns and wore plenty of resist gear.  When the siren gets up to the top, send in pet and them just chain-nuke like crazy.  I used a rain spell and then DD nuke, did as much damage as possible quickly.  Oh, and do NOT give your pet velocity, just in case you need to run away <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

You don't need to kill the wyvern if you are +CoV factioned.  Also, besides the 3 on right, there is a 4th one one the left which you can just barely target from above.<br>

I'm pretty sure this was before Luclin, so I was using what are now fairly old spells. There are three types of sirens and you can tell them apart by their names. Enchantress is the highest one if I remember correctly and I've forgotten the names of the other two. The weakest one has 2200ish HP, if memory serves. I'd pull with seeking flame of seukor, then follow up with two chars and it would be dead. The middle difficulty siren had more HP, but weren't that difficult. I would solo these without a pet due to fear of being Goner's snack (once a LOOONG time ago while I was 53 and in Mistmoore, an enchanter NPC charmed my new 53 pet and fed me to it. been scared of NPC enchanters since). I pulled with my biggest nuke rather than a dispell or debuff because their resisting me was never a problem and when fighting without a pet, it is nice to get in a big hit before the mob even starts chasing/nuking you. I suspect at 61 with a focused FoT, you could insta kill the low sirens or cause them to death walk with just one blast.<br>
<br>
Now I only once or twice solo'd an enchantress and I don't remember if I gave in and used a pet or not. They do have a lot more HP than either of the other two types.<br>
<br>
The spot I hunted was near the Skyshrine tower, at the end of the pennisula. There are three visible ones at the edge of the water. There are also two more under the water, floating above small rocks (think I remember two, might have just been one). I tried the camp by SG once, but found it much more difficult to reliably pull.<br>
<br>
Good luck with the shawl quests. The reward is certainly worth it.  <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=108671">Varia Darselai</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> Arch Convoker</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izudin@themagicianstower>Izudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#333333>(1/13/03 8:36:25 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Thanks</span><hr size=1> Thanks for the answers so far, seems I started off at the hardest possible spot <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  will try those near SS tomorrow. I also noticed different types of sirens, I think one enchantress was light blue to me and had about 4-5k hp (estimating from a SoFB hit), the enticers were green (didnt get to see a hit on those to check hp's). Didnt see a third type yet.<br>
<br>
On a side note...wouldnt it be a good idea to use a fire pet for the sirens? More nuking power, if the pet decides so... Guess I will just try it <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

SoFB and Moonfire was good enough in those days to chainnuke them down. FoT and/or Black Steel and/or Sun Vortex would make mincemeat out of the silly buggers.<br>

<br>
There are indeed three sirens on the north side of the land. I used FBoT, it killed most of them with one shot. There is one more on that side a bit in the water (on an underwater rock), easy to pull with a bolt spell (once the first three were dead and I could go down to loot them). On the south side I found one above the water, and two more under the surface (easy to target with Eye of Zomm). I didnt try to get these two, saw no real good pull spot for them. Could maybe work to swim around from the north side then pull with a bolt.<br>
<br>
I saw siren enticers mostly, but twice I had to fight an enchantress. These are really much tougher than the enticers. The seductress' are quite inbetween the two in difficulty, but they also were rare here.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the info, now I only need to get lucky in the next days collecting hairs (got one so far).<br>

<br>
The technique I used was:<br>
<br>
Invis and lev to just North of the Siren camp (the ones by SS). Make a pet over the water. There will probably be Sirens below you in the water, but they don't aggro due to the water (I think). From then on, I just sent the pet onto the 3 Sirens on land and chained Sirocco and Sunstorm on them. To be honest, the pet could have soloed all three, but I wanted to make sure my pet didn't get charmed. Once the camp was broken, I just let my pet do all the work...<br>
<br>
There are also two more Sirens in the water for a total of 5 Sirens at this camp, much better than the camp near SG imo.<br>
<br>
Note: I did get charmed once, but thankfully I had an Enduring Breath item on.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=60465">Xerphanis</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END-->Arch Convoker</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=izudin@themagicianstower>Izudin</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 263<br> <font color=#333333>(1/16/03 10:12:12 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerequipmentandquests.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1142.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Amazing</span><hr size=1> I REALLY got lucky today <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

First I thought all was bad...I had collected two wolf whiskers earlier, and when I looked in my bank they were gone. Probably put them in a summoned bag accidentaly...no idea. Anyway I proceeded to look for another sirens hair first. Got it fairly quickly, then headed back to GD. Very lucky here, ran into a bunch of wolves, and within one min had two whiskers again!<br>
<br>
Succeeded to make the coldain thread, headed to Thurgadin to grab the shawl pattern from bank, prayed...and it must have worked, cause I made my 6th shawl at the first attempt! WOOT! (158 tailoring btw.)<br>
<br>
A good day. Indeed.<br>

Always ran down to the shore with my epic pet, sent pet in  on one of the sirens, nuked once and dead.  Would kill the 3 on the North side, swim underwater to kill the 2 on the north side, then come up to kill the one that is out of the water on the north side.  Go kill Wyverns for awhile after that, rinse and repeat.  <br>

<br>
I cast my MR spell on myself, give pet two elemental blankets and two daggers of symbols. Buff up pet and then inch up to the edge of the cliff.<br>
<br>
I send my pet in then back up to the cliff edge.  From there, I can nuke the sirens but they are not close enough to really notice me.  Don't sit there though until pet has firm aggro on all the mobs.<br>
<br>
Pet can solo all of them.  But they are all blue to me ( or light blue) so I typically send in one nuke for each mob to get exp.<br>
<br>
If there is an enchantress, I'll send in a few nukes, just to reduce the chance of my pet getting charmed.<br>
<br>
If your pet gets charmed, he will run off, and mobs will follow him.  He will run along the cliff end.  So what I've been doing is backing off and hovering over the water a bit on the other side of the bluff until my pet loses his charm.  Once his charm is off, i'll summon him back to my side.  From there, the sirens will either walk back to their spot or come back for the pet, who will run in to attack as soon as they are in range.  <br>
<br>
I've only been hit with a couple nukes during my whole experience soloing them.  If I don't sit, the pet seems to take all the damage.<br>
<br>
I also keep my air pet spell ready in case my pet does end up dying.  I also have sow at all times in case I need to run (which I haven't yet). Oh and lev too.<br>
<br>
It is a 20min. respawn time on the sirens.  Plenty of time to med up and let peat heal, and to kill the single wyvern spawn on the end of the cliff. <br>
<br>
Nothing wanders that direction, so there are no worries about adds.<br>
<br>
I was really scared of CS and even died once trying to kill the sirens near SG (they are all green, so they are easier right!? HA!)  But now that I have a system, CS is no threat at all.  <br>
<br>
Good luck to you!<br>
