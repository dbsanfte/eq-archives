Warrior says &quot;I can't believe that you just got Scars of Veeshan now.&quot;<br>
Shaman sighs.<br>
Shaman looks annoyed.<br>
Shaman says &quot;And to top it off, I have an issue with a raised area on the cover of the box.&quot;<br>
Wizard sighs.<br>
Wizard says &quot;Sheesh! Look Firiona is obviously wearing Vs. Cold jewelry and High Elves look better on average than humans so-&quot;<br>
Shaman says &quot;No, that's not what I mean.&quot;<br>
Shaman holds up a copy of The Scars of Velious.<br>
Shaman shouts &quot;Look at these giants, just showing their legs with no care for morality or taste. As a tall Barbarian person myself it offends me that they-Geeze! This one even has a slit in his kilt, has he NO SHAME?!?!?!&quot;<br>
GroupaPlayers look at Shaman oddly.<br>

Veeshan says &quot;Just got my copy of Velious.&quot;<br>
RandomDragon says &quot;Yeah, Verant has been wondering why you aren't spawning.&quot;<br>
Veeshan shrugs.<br>
Veeshan says &quot;I'm not too happy with Verant right now, I have issues with a raised portion on the cover of the Velious box.&quot;<br>
MaleDragons groan.<br>
Pink-Colored Dragon scratches her head, which is not easy for a dragon to do, mind you.<br>
Sky-Blue Dragon says &quot;Your majesty, the useless elvish female-&quot;<br>
Veeshan roars &quot;NO!&quot;<br>
The chamber quiets.<br>
Tumbleweed blows across the tomb.<br>
Veeshan shouts &quot;Look at the dragon on here! Can you believe they actually put this 'art' out?!?!? The dragon on the cover is TOTALLY NUDE! I mean if a dragon isn't wearing a breastplate or some manna robe it is at least covering itself with a cloak of flames. By drawing this picture Verant is saying that all Dragons are hussies and they are cheapening us as a people!&quot;<br>
Pink-Colored Dragon nods.<br>
Sky-Blue Dragon says &quot;It is true I guess, we are noble creatures and they cheapen us all...&quot;<br>
Woushi, The Forest Dragon says &quot;Well, except for-&quot;<br>
Woushi makes quotation marks in the air with his claws.<br>

Venril Sathir poofs in.<br>
Venril says &quot;Well technically I do-&quot;<br>
Veeshan deathtouches Venril Sathir.<br>
Veeshan gives the room the evil-eye.<br>
Eye Of Veeshan's AOE stun has frozen GroupOfDragons.<br>
Pink-Colored Dragon hides her face in her hands, which is not easy for a dragon to do mind you.<br>
Veeshan says &quot;Good, and now that we've finished with this random exposition I think we have a story to get back to.&quot;<br>
Sky-Blue Dragon says &quot;What you just said doesn't even make sense in the context of-&quot;<br>

Monk says &quot;What are you so happy about?&quot;<br>
Paladin says &quot;New exp system.&quot;<br>
Monk says &quot;Yeah that really went your way, huh?&quot;<br>
Paladin and Shadow Knight smile.<br>
Bard says &quot;Just one more example that shows that if the players complain long enough, it's probably because it's Verant's fault to begin with...&quot;<br>
Magician says &quot;Which brings me to my epic quest and the crappiness of post-50 pe-&quot;<br>

Rogue slaps Enchanter.<br>
GnomeNecro says &quot;Well with the way winds are blowing, I don't think anyone can argue that I'm the best class anymore.&quot;<br>
GroupOfPlayers nod.<br>
GnomeNecro smiles, being accepted for a change.<br>
Warrior says &quot;Well, we have to pick some other class that is obviously overpowered now.&quot;<br>
Classes look around, suspicious of each other.<br>
Ranger hums a merry tune, all in the clear.<br>
13People look at Rogue.<br>
Rogue looks around and says &quot;What?&quot;<br>
Druid says quickly &quot;Yeah, yeah, it's the Rogue that is the most overpowered, the Rogue. We should nerf him, nerf the Rogue, or make us all better...&quot;<br>
Druid looks around uneasily.<br>
Monk says &quot;But we're still gonna have to hate you Necro cause you're a Gnome.&quot;<br>

Masked Bard jumps down from the ledge.<br>
Masked Bard says &quot;Time to die, A_Verant_Creation_342,343,AND_344!&quot;<br>
Before the heroic group of 12 can react, the masked person dispatches the dragons.<br>
Magician steps up to Masked Bard in awe.<br>
Magician stammers &quot;OMG...OMG!! You're that person who is--um...you know...&quot;<br>
Cleric says &quot;It's Groll-&quot;<br>
Masked Bard says &quot;No I'm not.&quot;<br>

Rogue slaps Enchanter.<br>
Cleric wonders if the author is ever going to let people finish their senten-<br>
Bard says &quot;I can't believe I'm really talking with you.&quot;<br>
Masked Bard says &quot;Look, I am certainly not the person you think I am, but if I were I would tell you that the League of Antonican Bards already has a spy amongst the dragons, and you must seek her out if you are to succeed in your travels.&quot;<br>
Cleric resses Wizard and Druid.<br>
Paladin says &quot;Gro---Masked Bard, will you be joining us on our crudely-satirical yet somewhat entertaining adventures?&quot;<br>
Masked Bard says &quot;Alas, no. Unfortunatly your author has neither the intellectual wit nor the decisive timing that has endeared me to the readers of the Message Boards and the Everquest Community as a whole.&quot;<br>
PoorAuthor sighs and nods in agreement, then poofs away.<br>
Masked Bard poofs away.<br>

Necromancer says &quot;Speak for yourself.&quot;<br>
Necromancer's staff quacks.<br>
&lt;Two sky raids later (That's 50 hours in Earth time) the group reaches the inner sanctum of the dragons, deep within The Sleeper's Tomb&gt;<br>

Wizard says &quot;I can't believe I got this far without Enchanter and with all you crappy non-raid classes.&quot;<br>
OtherClasses sigh.<br>
Magician says &quot;I don't see you getting the experience for Velketor.&quot;<br>
Wizard sighs, equally Velious-crappy.<br>

Back at the Inner Sanctum<br>
Veeshan says &quot;Alan Canadianguy, you're charged with attempting to balance the classes in Everquest.&quot;<br>
HumanMale says &quot;What's wrong with that?&quot;<br>
Veeshan says &quot;Silence, we are in Everquest, in the middle of a courtroom, this is certainly neither the time nor the place for logic.&quot;<br>
HumanMale sighs.<br>
Veeshan says &quot;Furthermore, if the classes become balanced and everyone is happy, how will this peon here make a living?&quot;<br>
Author steps out of the shadows, dressed in newbie rags with hair so ragged it would make a Halfling retch.<br>
HumanMale bursts into tears.<br>
Veeshan roars, &quot;Take him away, put him with the Ogre who likes pickles and the drunken elf.&quot;<br>
Drake Guards bow and take HumanMale away.<br>
Veeshan turns and spreads her talons.<br>
Veeshan says &quot;Do you think Ruby is a good claw-color on me?&quot;<br>
Pink-Colored Dragon shrugs, which is not an easy thing for a dragon to do, mind you.<br>

Rogue slaps Magician.<br>
Magician sighs.<br>
Cleric starts to cast buffs.<br>
Warrior, Monk, Rogue, Paladin, and Shadowknight begin to cast buffs.<br>
Cleric sighs, and wonders when she is gonna be given fighting skills if tanks can cast now.<br>
Magician and Druid smile, since tanks still need damage shields.<br>
Warrior activates the Velium Coldain Ring.<br>

Cleric steals that.<br>
Magician pulls out his stalves of elemental mastery earth, water, and air.<br>
Cleric grabs those too.<br>
Magician pulls out his Temple of Sol Ro focus items.<br>
Cleric takes them as well.<br>
Magician scribes Reclaim Energy and casts it.<br>
Cleric sighs and gives the Plane of Growth armor back.<br>
Cleric says &quot;What does it focus anyway?&quot;<br>
Magician says &quot;Nothing, Verant just feels like giving us completely useless effects we already have 10 times over.&quot;<br>
Cleric says &quot;Cry me a river.&quot;<br>
Bard summons some water from his armor and gives it to Cleric.<br>
Cleric says sarcastically &quot;Funny.&quot;<br>
Magician smiles.<br>
Magician says &quot;Well, although summoning is our class ability, I guess it doesn't matter that bards can summon food and water.&quot;<br>
Cleric says &quot;And clerics.&quot;<br>
Magician says &quot;Well at least we can make bandages.&quot;<br>
Warrior pulls out the knife from The Tower of Frozen Shadow.<br>

Magician says &quot;I can make light sources.&quot;<br>
Wizard, Cleric and Druid begin to cast spells.<br>
Magician sighs.<br>
Necromancer pats Magician &quot;At least you can summon monsters now.&quot;<br>
Magician says &quot;That's just a random non-focused pet. It doesn't even get faction adjustments or special abilities that the monster it copies has, when is Verant going to realize that they just can't throw tokens at us and make our class problems go away.&quot;<br>
RandomMage walks up.<br>
RandomMage says &quot;Look, I have Aegis of Ro! It was a kunark spell which they finally fixed the drop for a year after it was out! It certainly is a &quot;new&quot; spell just like they advertised. Now if you'll excuse me I'll go away.&quot;<br>

Bard says &quot;Britnay Spearsman! I know all your songs, 'Hit That Gryphon One More Time' is my favorite!&quot;<br>
Shaman says &quot;Wow she's hot!&quot;<br>

Rogue raises his hand.<br>
Enchanter covers his head.<br>
