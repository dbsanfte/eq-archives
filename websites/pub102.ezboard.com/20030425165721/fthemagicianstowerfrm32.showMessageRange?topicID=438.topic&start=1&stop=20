The last 4 days I have been keeping track of how long it takes for me and other magicians to get a group in PoS and PoV.  For going on 4 weeks I have had access to PoS, PoV and BoT.  Haven't spent a log of time there with trying to run a small guild and get people geared and though trials.<br>
<br>
I'm more or less the &quot;Common Mage&quot;, I belong to the vast group of semi-casual players who for the most part pay the bills and keep the servers running.  After a week of starting my exp hunt there I must say I have been shocked and reminded of how things were back in RoK days.<br>
<br>
My findings after polling 9 other mages of various guilds is that 8 of us are experiencing LFG wait times greater then 1 hour.  Generally Druids and Necros also seem to be having these issues however they can quad in tier 1 PoP zones and do not need groups as much as we do.<br>
<br>
To me PoP seems like a bring your own group type of place or a place where you need to be a Slower, Monk/SK for pulling, or a Warrior.  If your not then you can also get experice by soloing in the tier 1 and 2 zones.  Well that is if you are a: Necro, Druid, Wizard, Shaman, and a uber geard Ranger.<br>
<br>
Mages can also solo if they are content with burning all their mana on 1 tier 1 MOB then medding for 20 min.  Kei is a requirment as well.  For most mages thatmeans 1/2 a blue solo exp per hour at level 65.<br>
<br>
So unless your in an uber guild and loved in that guild expect your group wait times to exceed an hour (thats the average somm folks never got groups and loged on a twink).  Expect that soloing will be many times slower then that of even an uber Ranger.  Snare and Slow are major things in PoP and since mages lack these spells we are basiclly out of luck when it comes to soloing.<br>
<br>
I want to understand badly how anyone felt it was a good idea back at SoE to take away massive utility strength of MOD ROD 2 and then insure that soloing post 61 for mages would be nearly impossible.  I really want to understand this.<br>
Maybe at the very least giving us pet weapons that proced a 40% slow might have helped.  To expect the magician class to be suddenly desired by all exp groups was and is a bit off base to say the least.<br>
<br>
There are lots of pre 60 mages that are in for some tough times and a seriously sad awakening when they get to 61+ levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
Mages have always been able to find a corner of an expansion and solo there effectively, this has ended with PoP.<br>
<br>
I doubt anything will be done however if anyone is listening here are my reccomendaitons, do one or a bit of all of the following:<br>
<br>
1.  A pet summoned weapon spell that procs a slow..maybe 30-40%.<br>
2.  Increase the levels but not the hps or difficulty of some MOBs in ME, FG, and other older zones.<br>
3.  Introduce quest based exp (more of the PoH item turn in quest for exp type stuff, make the items eaiser to obtain).<br>
<br>
<br>
Well those are my thoughts on the Soloability situation for Magicians.<br>

<br>
#1 is out of the question because slow does not fit our class.  Not even on a summoned item.  Bluring of the classes is bad because there is supposed to be inter-class dependency.  This will never happen unless a developer is smoking from the happy tree.<br>
<br>
#2: so you want more exp from easy kills?  Honestly, when we all had 30+AA points at level 60 with Luclin gear in sebilis, we were overpowered for our environment.  To remain a fun game, there must be some challenge to overcome.<br>
<br>
#3 is an excellent idea and something they should have implemented a long time ago.  However, I do not agree that the quests should be able to be repeated.  A character flag should be given for each quest so that you can not be rewarded repeatedly for the same quest, and so that the best way to earn exp does not become monotonous.  Remember, games must have some sort of challenge to them :)  Being able to solve many quests for exp should be a challenge of the mind and of your personal versatility.  <br>
<br>
Don't forget, you still can solo in PoP.  If you kill light blues in innovation or in Justice, for example, you will earn about the same rate of exp as you did pre-PoP in sebilis.  The kills will be tougher, but youll need less of them.  I personally believe that it is selfish to think that we deserve to be able to earn the best rate of exp in the game (or something close) on our own without any help and without any challenge. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://www.lehigh.edu/~dsf3/EQ/rhionsligo.jpg"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--> <br>

<br>
Mages are a balanced class, but yeah, we suffer a bit from the game being so sucky.<br>
<br>
In an ideal world they'd combine classes down to about 8, but it's not gonna happen.<br>
<br>
If you seriously want slow, I seriously recommend you start a beastlord.<br>
<br>
Personally, when I'm feeling down about my mage, I play my twink cleric. Once in a group, I quickly realize how much I miss my mage... as I sit helplessly watching 4 shamelessly twinked melees take FOREVER to kill a single mob, compared to how quickly I'm accostomed to killifying them with my mage.<br>
<br>
Then again, it sux not being able to get groups easily unless there's a friend in them or I make them myself. But it's not a balance problem with the mage, it's just the game itself. Upgrading mages probably isn't the answer-- that'd make us overpowered for when we DO get in groups &gt;) <p>Happy trails.</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=iblisthemage>IblisTheMage</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Conjurer</span><br>  Posts: 201<br> <font color=#333333>(12/9/02 9:52:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.decara.com/eq/Federico6060.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mage Looking For Group</span><hr size=1> - More quest based xp is a good idea.

<br>
- Also on Karana we have a channel (/join plane I think) that we use to find pick up groups in planes.<br>
<br>
- The bottleneck in PoP is slowers. With a shaman, I can duo 500 hitting mobs... <br>
<br>
So the idea that more classes should have slow I am all for. Only thing is that it should not be mages, to far away from class. <br>
<br>
When I think about it, SK could perhaps be my best bet for a new class with slow... they do not have the resurrection the pally counterparts have, and their dps is less than uber. Also the slow and dotting seems to be somewhat close to each other...<br>
<br>
But again I would say, there are just to many classes in EQ. <p>Iblis<br>

Soloing in the planes as a magician is not necessarily easy, but that particular description is very distorted.  Reclaim chaining and aggro kiting are doable, but risky, but neither method is a mana hog.  Pet canni is also a magician's best friend.  KEI is something I regard as a luxury, not a necessity, and has very little impact on my downtime.<br>
<br>
When grouping in the Planes, sometimes a little creativity is in order.  I'm not immune to long lfg times, but I am working toward making it less of an issue.<br>

If you are a well known player (not casual !) no problems. Lots of people will invite you, because mages are great DPS, and they know they can trust you.<br>
<br>
If you are a casual player, raiding with your guild and having - from time to time - 2 or 3 hours only for XP, then with POP you are in trouble. There are not much places where you can really solo, and yes solo is much more difficult than when you were 59/60 in the grey or in ME. If you don't have the 61 pet it is even more difficult. <br>
<br>
May be you should try and learn the 'root tecnic' to solo...<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm47.showMessage?topicID=13.topic">pub102.ezboard.com/fthema...D=13.topic</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
another thing : getting a group in POV or POS is rather long if your friends are not up. YES, BUT : when you've got a group, XP is really big big. <br>
I tried my own test :<br>
you've got only 2 hours.<br>
1/ LFG ON, go to POD and solo rats (better have Epic or 61 pet). If 2 come, I prefer to zone out...<br>
2/ LFG ON, go to POV and shout. Wait one hour more or less and get a group for one hour.<br>
<br>
XP is same more or less (well, I must admit I am not a good soloer, it is too boring for me, then I am not well trained)<br>
<br>
if you've got more than 2 hours, then grouping is, of course, much much better, even with loosing one hour LFG.<br>
<br>
Now, i met mages who enjoy solo, who are good at it and can solo 5 hours in a row without falling asleep, and they say XP is same than group, and parchment drop better (.. you are  sure to win roll)<br>

An enchie or shaman would not have significantly added to our xp rate. <br>

As to the original issue of being /lfg I have one bad night every fortnight where its tough to find anything, thats OK though because everyone else is having the same problem that night.

Those 3 steps, and you got a group. Usually I never get to step 3... Also, sending all those tells gets you in contact of a lot of people, making you a well known mage<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now lately tho, I havent bothered with making a group, its just as fun to solo in PoV. Yes I use a lot of mana (about 50 % per kill) but that is regened with canning in no time. One mob dead every 5 or 6 min, thats not too bad.<br>
<br>
You cant say soloing is imposseble when several mages have posted how we solo in PoV. All you need is the 61 air. Its a lot of work, but the exp beats any soloing exp I have had pre pop, and its just a little behind PoV groups. Its a great way of spending that 1 hour LFG.<br>
<br>
I hate soloing, but this way is fun, because the challange is still there, fight after fight<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
One question tho... Would you rather have the necro way? they can solo just fine, if they are in the right place, but they have a LOT harder time getting a group then we do. They cant stay 1 hour lfg and get a group, they HAVE to build a group to get one. And when I have been in a group, the people in that group like to invite me again, due to my high DPS. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=227830">Rabids Arch Mage</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zurfinator>Zurfinator</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Elementalist</span><br>  Posts: 130<br> <font color=#333333>(12/9/02 12:27:09 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mage Looking For Group</span><hr size=1> My LFG message:<br>

It gets the job done almost every time and it brings out a few good laughs or teases. After a good session the groups are astonished about the damage I can do, and they just love the 4k+ crits. They also tend to invite me back.<br>
<br>
I miss the old days when I could solo with decent efficiency. You just cannot get into a group and announce after an hour, that you have to leave. It is not courteous behavior. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=zurfinator>Zurfinator</A> at: 12/9/02 12:28:14 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub102.ezboard.com/bthemagicianstower.showUserPublicProfile?gid=jayteebushwacker>Jaytee Bushwacker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Summoner Da'FoH</span><br>  Posts: 1317<br> <font color=#333333>(12/9/02 1:49:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub102.ezboard.com/fthemagicianstowerfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=438.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Mage Looking For Group</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>This will never happen unless a developer is smoking from the happy tree.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

We have situational charm and mez.<br>

We have a pet that roots<br>

We have a 2 pets that stun<br>

We have a mana transfer spell/item<br>

IMO at this point in the game, there really isn't anything that is too far out of character, especially if it comes in the form of a summoned item or a native pet ability. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=381929"> Naladini </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

START YOUR OWN GROUPS.<br>
<br>
Begin experimenting with non-standard groups, and you will discover fun in the game again. You can make do without a slower in the group, as you can make do without a cleric, or a tank. I have been in some of the most bizarre group makeups in the world since PoP hit, and it's been a blast. Some are more effective than others, but all have been viable thus far. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27498">www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=27498</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

In PoV with 5 mages and one shammy we kill faster then any other &quot;balanced&quot; group around. Many of us mages are use to being the puller too with leading off with malo as the pull tool.  If we get a bad pull we can handle up to 3 mobs but takes alot of mana.  In tier one planes we can do with less in the group. I group with just a Cleric and with cleric buffs on pet I can nuke 2 times and cleric will normally heal 2 times 3 at most and with kei I can pull with no down time.  Cleric stays close to FM the total time and exp is great. <br>
<br>
So I have found the cleric/mage combo or the full mage one slower groups as the best exp I've seen.  Try and setup a mage channel and give the no melee group a try. Five stun pets is so fun to watch and cleric or shammy never take argo from healing them and if one dies you just make another. Shammies love this group to with malo already on their slows stick alot more and they take alot less argo then normal.<br>

<br>
Best advice is if you wait over 30 minutes go to pot and do /who lfg and start trying to gather a core group usually if you can get a couple people together you can finish up the group and start rolling very quickly.<br>
