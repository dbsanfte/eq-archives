We entered VP today, and little did we realize that we entered a little
pre-mature.  It seemed that some of the dragons from our last raid hadn't
re-spawned yet so we were left with a partially empty zone.<BR><BR>
Silverwing showed his face, so we dusted him real quick.  Hoshkar wasn't
around, so we moved up the ladder and made mince meat of Xygoz.  After a
little more time, Druushk took his first death on Vazaelle.<BR><BR>
People were getting tired, and due to it being a sunday we decided to cut
the raid short and finish up Phara Dar, Hoshkar, and Nexona tomorrow.<BR><BR>
Nexona is the only thing that remains from Agony being the first guild to
clear Veeshans Peak on Vazaelle...  RAWR peeps!<BR><BR>

Thats right, Agony stepped into Veeshans Peak tonight and layed down some
law.  It was a LONG day as many folks had never been to the zone, so there
was a lot of time spent explaining how the zone worked and what needed to be
done.<BR><BR>
Agony held strong, buckled down and kicked the shit out of all the dragons
they could get their hands on before getting too tired and needing
sleep.<BR><BR>
4 out of 6 died.   Silvering,  Hoshkar,  Xygoz,  Phara Dar ... we will get the other 2 in a day or so...<BR><BR>
Now that the guild is familiar with the turf... future visits will be fast
and smooth.<BR><BR>

Agony is pushing hard to finish off sets of armor so that we can put the
"farming" days behind us and move on.  We have chased after Dain and some
ToV dragons during the last week and its been interesting to say the
least.<BR><BR>
Agony recently lost some members due to some disagreements and
misunderstandings, along with some lack of communication.
These folks have started a new guild on Vazaelle, and are off doing their
own things now.  Even though the terms of seperation were less than appealing, I, as well as Agony would like to wish you all the best,

But I won't leave you with just that...  Tonight Agony decided it was time
to wage war against the brothers of Zek.   Tonight we took our first shot at
The Statue of Rallos Zek.<BR><BR>
We cleared the path, prepared for the battle and in came the Statue.
However something wierd happened with the pathing and aggro and 3 adds
dropped in on us at the start of the fight.   So we were up against the
Statue, 2 Armors of Zek, and another Giant.  Agony held strong, listened to
directions and we pulled out of the mess and STILL took the Statue down on
our first attempt ever!<BR><BR>

Agony has finally recovered from the Christmas holiday, and as we approach
the new year we decided to crank out some more gear to try and finish up
some long over due suits of armor.<BR><BR>
Tonight we embarked on a new era of Agony, where we distribute the load of
our pull team across multiple monks as a collective machine, the point man
for the entire operation was Akethadar.  It worked very
well however, Akethadar had some things to say about it...<BR><BR>

We've made a few attempts at this guy in the past and got him down REAL

Tonight, we caught this rat bastage up, hanging out in his home town Icewell
Keep when we decided it was time to lynch this son of a bitch for all the

The troops were rallied and in a short time we kicked this mo-faka's ass up

Ohhhh waitttt... there's more ...  not only did we swing this bitch ass
around like a rag doll, but we did it with NO CLARITY during the entire
fight.  That's right folks,  none of our casters had clarity or clarity 2
for the fight... just to make the mana regen a bit more interesting.<BR><BR>
To top it off even one step further, our shamans got ganked early on due to
an unexpected arrival of the Dain.  Sitting guildies prepping for the pull =
Dead guildies, we lost a few before we even engaged, unfortunatly our
shamans were in that mix.  The mighty Dain was regenning like a 2 bit ho trying to make a buck.... but it didn't matter, the bish was going down.<BR><BR>
When we come back for revenge... we make sure we rub it in

With the release of Luclin, Agony anticipated many MANY problems would

for a week and gather the new ability points and push the final group of
lower levels up towards 60.<BR><BR>
After a week of non-stop exp, we decided to just go out and rock some mobs
that are trivial to us.  Dracolich, Fear Mini's, mobs like that..  We have
killed Dracolich 4 times in 4 days, thanks for the patches Verant!!<BR><BR>
We're splitting our time between exp and ghetto mobs, while we let Verant

THIS JUST IN!  Shortly after the release of the latest news regarding Ogre

around naked chanting "Oh where oh where can my little Taiseth be..."<BR><BR>
After a little time thinking about the situation, we at Agony finally
realized why Oxox was chanting these mysterious words...  (take note that
Baps is lying down next to the Vindicator... she gets turned on by mass
slaughtering of beasties).<BR><BR>

November 11th, Not 1, Not 2, Not 3, but 4 Warrior Epics in one day!

</td>

<tr>
<td align=left>
<br>
Agony put somewhat of a hold on epics for a while, as we suffered a few
losses of members once epics were obtained.  Well, unfortunatly things just
didn't feel right so we decided it was time to strike back on the epics
hardcore.<BR><BR>

However, there is somewhat of a story regarding this particular days
events...  read on to hear it.<BR><BR>

-----<BR><BR>

Oxox and Prybutok (Twin brothers) were on a quest to finish their light
sabers, when they came across Baps.  After a few attempts at hitting on Baps
(failed attempts mind you), they found out that Baps too was on a quest to
finish her light sabers.  Knowing that Baps could not finish this task on
her own, she requested the assistance of the twin brothers.<BR><BR>

After a short discussion, the twins decided that they would assist Baps in
her quest, as they too were seeking the power of the light sabers, however
in order for Baps to obtain thier assistance she had to perform a task for
them.<BR><BR>

Baps inquired about the task, and found that it was somewhat sexual in
nature.  The brothers requested some three-way sex0ring.  Baps, being new to
the 2-ogres at once idea, decided that it was a small price to pay for the
ultimate goal of a warrior... the light sabers.<BR><BR>

The journey continued, and while passing through Skyfire they ran into a
hobbit by the name of Taiseth.  The first thought was to eat the little
hobbit, but after a close examination they noticed this was not your
ordinary hobbit... this was a warhobbitz!  Warriors have a silent code that
they follow, and much respect was instantly gained for the warhobbit after a
short discussion between the group.<BR><BR>

After a short while, the ogres found out that the warhobbit too was seeking
the quest for the light sabers and requsted to join the party in their
journeys.  After a small discussion between the brothers (whom were leading
the quest) they decided that the warhobbit could tag along, under one
condition.<BR><BR>

The warhobbit inquired, and found out that he must partake in the three-way
sex0ring.  After a slight pause and minor puking (the thought alone gave the
hobbit a migraine), he commited to the conditions as he too was thirsty for
the ultimate warrior prize, the light sabers.<BR><BR>

Off the party went into the depths of Chardok to claim their prizes.  Down
goes the Prince, Down goes the King, and Down goes the wretched Queen...
only to leave the remains of the Ancient Blade for the warriors.<BR><BR>

Success was theirs, the final pieces to their light sabers was in their
grasp!  After a short time of magical arts to combine the light sabers and
the blades were completed, the ogres grinned evily at the hobbit and the
female ogre and decided it was time to commence the commitments made
beforehand.<BR><BR>

Not wasting anytime at all, the ogres began stripping the armor from lady
Baps's body...  Baps had but one request, that she get it from behind, the
twins, not being picky agreed to the terms...<BR><BR>

Little did Baps know, the twins had ideas of their own for lady Baps.
Quickly Oxox grabs the hobbit and flings him about his body...  little did
the warhobbitz know that Oxox was a master of tailoring, and had a special
black leather strap in the lining of his armor....  oh my, the sounds that
echo'd through the dungeon... still to this day leaves members of other
guilds filled with horrid thoughts from the lack of mercy shed to the
warhobbitz.<BR><BR>

Baps, a little uncomfortable during the process (as she's had many ogre-men
in her life) wasn't quite sure why things were different and painful this
time...  and is left with only a soreness undescribable by man. (Notice the
shinyness of the hobbitz helm?)<BR><BR>

We managed to get some photos from the aftermath...  clearly you can see the
pain Baps is still in at this moment.<BR><BR>

When the warhobbitz was questioned later to validate the rumors that had
been spreading about, we were left with a blushing hobbitz.  True event?
You decide.<BR><BR>

Morale of the story:  Twin male ogres + warhobbitz strap on = Sore female
ogre.<BR><BR>
