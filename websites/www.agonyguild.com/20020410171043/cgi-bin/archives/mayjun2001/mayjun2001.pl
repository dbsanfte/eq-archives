Well today started off a planned epic day for a few members but unfortunatly
due to RL circumstances they had to log out and so we cancelled one of our
raids.  So with 2 of our rogues being at the "General" part of their epics
we decided to head over to Kithicor and punk down some DE butt.  When we
zoned in we noticed Hope's Beginning was there prepping up to kill the
undead for robes and so we asked if they would mind if we spawned and wasted
the General.  They were cool with it, so that's exactly what we did.

WOW, I must admit that some of the greatest rumors Ive ever heard have been
coming out lately.  Today I decided I would try and clear them up...  I was
informed that "the community" thinks we sell all of our DRAGON LOOT.  I
about died in my chair laughing when I heard this one ... so here is a
screenshot of the current guild banked/unusable items that we of course
"sold".  (No, we didn't sell it ..)  Have you ever thought of looking
through our raid news, it's listed what members received what items.<BR><BR>
<IMG SRC=http://www.agonyguild.com/images/misc/guildbank.jpg border=0><BR><BR>
The next rumor I heard was that folks believe that we have given away high
value items (this example was an RBB: Runed Bolster Belt from Lady Vox), a
Dragon HASTE item, to folks on the server that are not in Agony, when Agony
members needed it.  This is false (another funny one).  Agony has received 4
RBB's in their Lady Vox days, all 4 are accounted for on Trueblade,
Prybutok, Oxox, and Tress.  If you run into them, inspect them :) Im sure
you'll see the belts tightly attached to their waists.<BR><BR>
The next rumor going around is about the recent "Agony Rescue" we did for an
Ex-Celestae Member.  He requested our help, so we gathered a small team to
help him out, end of story nothing more, nothing less.  However it appears
that someone changed a Vazaelle IRC channel topic in regards to the incident
(We have a Vazaelle IRC Channel???) and of course Agony got blamed for
making that topic change.  Whatever.. guilty by association I suppose... :)<BR><BR>
The next rumor I heard was that since Agony was founded by RL friends, that
they hoard all the LOOT and don't give anything to their members... Hrm I
suppose that's why im still holding a Crude Stein and wearing a Braided
Cinch Cord while other members have been awarded items like Bone Clasped Girdles out of
Fear?  Our guild is based on a point system to prevent favortism.  Our first
guild epic went to a Ranger (A non-rl friend of the founders) but I could
see how we play favorites and give all our RL friends items right?  For
people that have NEVER even grouped with or attended an Agony raid it's
simple to pass judgement on us.   Oh did I forget to mention we usually don't invite
non-guild members to raids to begin with, so how would you even know?
Simple, you wouldn't.  :)<BR><BR>
It seems there is a lot of "negative" rumors floating around about Agony,
when the simple fact is most of it is perception and heresay.  I know that many folks do
not like a particular member of our guild, and thats ok you have every right
to not like him.<BR><BR>
My message is quite simple, if the community doesn't like a member of Agony .. ok
that's their opinion and right.  However, starting falsified rumors and
allegations about our guild really isn't necessary.  Agony does not go
around slandering, bashing, or creating falsified rumors about other guilds,
and we would appreciate the same in return.<BR><BR>
I am very open about almost everything Agony does, if you feel compelled to
address a "rumor" with me, please feel free to do so, Ill be more than happy
to clear up whatever allegation has been made about us.<BR><BR>

Braindrop made me do it!!!  Alright so here's the deal.. no news has been
updated for a while, just been playing way too much.  Things we've
accomplished, Serafina (Enc), Krialis (Monk), Incarnate (Ranger), all
completed their epics..  Fear/Hate mini-bosses died a few times, we did
Plane of Growth 2 times and learned a lot about bad pathing and warping mobs
that we had never seen before.<BR><BR>
The guild was purged, we decided the time had come for a complete guild
wipeout and re-built it fresh with the active primary users.  We also added
some new members to the guild, great additions thanks for joining us you
guys.<BR><BR>
No photo's to post at this time, except I did come across these that I
thought Id share with everyone (keke).<BR><BR>

Agony doing what they do best... being bored and just grabbing the guild and
making a raid. Tonight we hit Fear (the first guild trip) and it was an
amazingly great run. We cleared nearly every mob in the zone except Terror,
Dracolich and Cazic himself. Fright and Dread died by our hands and kicked
down ZERO loot... yes CRAP, NOTHING, ZILCH, NADA... but we had fun owning
them anyways :)
