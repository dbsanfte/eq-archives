<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">1) No spam.<br>
<br>
2) No personal attacks, flames or abuse even in Rants.<br>
<br>
3) No excessive swearing out of context, except in the Rants Forum.<br>
<br>
4) No trading of virtual or real items and information for real money.<br>
<br>
5) No posting of scams, exploits or in game cheats that would not be allowed by 
SOE.<br>
<br>
6) No pornography (Breaking this rule will result in an immediate IP ban).<br>
<br>
7) No malicious code, either in your post or signature (Breaking this rule will 
result in an immediate suspension of your posting rights and a ban pending 
investigation of the malicious code).<br>
<br>
8) Do not create posts questioning a Moderator's or Administrator's actions 
(This will result in your plea being ignored), take up your issues in private 
(If you publicly undermine the authority or publicly attack the Moderators or 
Administrators on my boards you will lose any chance of a fair hearing).<br>
<br>
9) Advertising is not allowed.<br>
<br>
10) Signature testing is frowned upon, please use the preview button.<br>
<br>
11) Your forum signature and avatar images must follow specific guidelines: <BR>
<UL>A) Your avatar and your signature images combined may not exceed 40 kb in size. 
If they do, the larger of the two will be removed, and the user contacted to let 
them know what has happened. You are more than welcome to add a new one within 
the rules. <br>
<BR>
B) Excessively large signatures or avatars (in excess of 200kb) will result in signature and avatar privilidges being removed.</UL>
<br>
Note: You are actively encouraged to use the smallest file size possible for signature images. Please avoid BMP and animated GIFs.<BR>
<BR>
Note : Avatars may be no larger than 150x150 pixels, as anything larger will 
distort the layout of the forums. <br>
<br>
Note : Repeatedly breaking this rule will result in the removal of your ability 
to use an avatar and a signature.<br>
<br>
If you see a person breaking any of the above rules, please private message any 
moderator as abuse of these rules spoils the community forums for all.<br>

<H2>First Offense :</H2>

Post edited or moved to Administration Forum for reference and review, warning 
E-Mailed to poster. Note placed in Administration Forum. Warnings will be 
deleted after 1 month.<br>

In an extreme circumstance, you can have your posting privileges suspended or be 
banned on your first offence (For example see Rule 6).<br>

<H2>Third Offence :</h2>

<br>
If for any reason someone else is using your account or has used it to break 
these rules, appeals will be considered providing you can get an upstanding 
member of the community to vouch for you.<br>
<br>
