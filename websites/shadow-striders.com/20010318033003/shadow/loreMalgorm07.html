                      <B>Dawn</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Quite by mistake, Malgorm received a letter that Lord Faileas planned to
                      give Sugan back to the Wind Riders. Enraged by this, a tempest of fury
                      entered him. Why would he do this? A divine gift from the gods, and Lord
                      Faileas merely gives back the victory. He knew Sugan's fall was the key to
                      Malgorm's emotions; giving her back would make him the monster he once
                      was. It was to happen in the elven land of Greater Faydark. With a word
                      Malgorm appeared there, almost too late. They stood, the Wind Riders,
                      holding their leader Sugan. Malgorm's thoughts seethed with black rage.
                      They would not have his soul.. they would not take her from him, not Terina..
                      they would not take this from him. The first to step forward was Sugan's
                      protector, her guardian Ralnia. She fell to her knees as the power of
                      Malgorm's will slammed against her. The hell fire poured from his soul in an
                      effort to keep his beloved Terina. As the deathblow came, he watched with
                      anger as they healed her and attacked his shields with their magick. He
                      could not take them all, though they would all pay for this. He felt the mace
                      of Ralnia slam against him. Then he felt his son's magick upon him healing
                      his wounds and giving him strength. Lord Faileas spoke, sounding angry
                      and tired. "Let her go Malgorm, this is driving you both insane."
<BR><BR>
                      "No!!" he screamed as a rage of great power took him. He would fight every
                      one of these monsters if he had to. How could his Lord do this to him, as
                      many times as he protected him guided him? But he heard the words of
                      Silverann, "please father, let her go" Malgorm looked at Sugan on the
                      ground, screaming with the same madness he felt. Silverann's voice brought
                      him back. "Please father! I will join you.. I accept you." With one last blast
                      upon Ralnia, Malgorm reluctantly let go. With a word he appeared in the
                      plains of Karana. Lord Faileas, Stormangell, and Silverann followed. He
                      knew all the feelings, whatever love he felt, were gone forever. He looked at
                      his sons. "I did love you" With those words he was gone….
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Monster Returns</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Everything returned to normal; Malgorm's evil plans and his dark will were
                      once again in full force. Sugan had made her attack upon the shadows and
                      a war had begun. Malgorm was happy with this and during the war he killed
                      many of the Wind Riders. Like a dark storm he raged over them, Sugan
                      herself had almost met death by his magick more then once. They feared
                      him, they hated him; he was a demon. This was what they wanted him to
                      be, so they would have it. Thoughts of Terina, like flitting shadows ate at him
                      slowly. He had not seen her in over a month and he could not bear to find
                      her. But during this time he heard that his son Stormangell was in love with
                      the witch Cattiebrie. He would not let his son fall to the pain of that. She
                      was evil in Malgorm's eyes, just using his son like Envy used so many. The
                      wizard's son had met with him and asked the way to free himself from the
                      demons. Malgorm knew it was he who'd given those to his son. And that
                      there was nothing he could do to save him unless he was mortal again. But
                      Malgorm's emotions were shadows inside him; he could still feel. Lord
                      Faileas was growing cold, perhaps Malgorm was drawing the emotions from
                      him, or perhaps one of his sons. That day he told Stormangell the way to
                      their freedom was to kill Sugan and give the hunger what it came for. What
                      belonged to it. Then perhaps Malgorm could be free ….
<BR><BR>
                      <B>Sugan's Greatest Defeat</B>
<BR><BR>
                      The battle raged, and Sugan had escaped Malgorm yet again. But this time
                      it was his son's fault. Stormangell had healed her at the last moment. At the
                      gates of the vast city Freeport, Malgorm became a dark god of vengeance.
                      "How dare you take that from me! how dare you take my.. no, Our freedom!
                      You deserve your demons, I hope you go insane for what you have done."
<BR><BR>
                      Stormangell only looked down. "Perhaps you have a soul. Perhaps she is
                      the one with no soul.." he said quietly. Malgorm looked confused and angry,
                      "what….?" Stormangell spoke softly, "Your lessons, father. The reflections-
                      you appear as the monster, perhaps she is."
<BR><BR>
                      Many words were scrambled in the mind of the wizard. He only sought
                      vengeance upon his son, but all he really wanted was death. For the pain to
                      stop. The shadows of Terina crept like a demon stronger then himself.
                      Malgorm dropped to ground as the knowledge of what he was here to do
                      overwhelmed him. He was the plague. He was here to destroy everything.
                      The hunger raged inside, saying he was a slave, a puppet just like he had
                      made so many. Malgorm gazed toward the sky, making Terina his only
                      thought. "I am a monster.. a virus. A soulless beast…."
<BR><BR>
                      Hell fire rained down on him over and over as Malgorm called his own
                      magick against himself. As he lay on the ground, seeking death but too
                      weak to bring it, the hated Sugan appeared to look down on him. "kill me,
                      Sugan. kill me while you can! kill me while I am weak" She looked strangely
                      lost in this madness, as if it was a trap. The paladin froze as Malgorm
                      stood, glaring at her. "Do it Sugan, while you can. If you do not I will destroy
                      this world and everything here.. all your loved ones.. all your Wind Riders.
                      Your brother, Your lover- everyone."
<BR><BR>
                      Sugan looked confused and afraid as she watched a tear of energy drip from
                      the eye of the wizard. All Malgorm could think of was that he would be
                      killing Terina. Sugan whispered lightly, "you.. can feel."
<BR><BR>
                      "Do it you fool!" Malgorm drew strength from somewhere and blasted her.
                      "do it!" Sugan staggered and looked helplessly at Stormangell. Storm
                      screamed with wisdom of truth, "do it!! kill him!" Malgorm lashed out, "You
                      do not believe me? Then die!" He lunged forward with his blade, cutting her.
                      She jumped back in pain from his cursed blade. Malgorm wouldn't let up. "IF
                      you do not believe me, then…" He stabbed at Stormangell with all his might,
                      and the boy dropped in pain. Malgorm's eyes glowed. "Save him Sugan. kill
                      me." In a divine storm Sugan's temper erupted. She swung her sword with
                      all her might but the blows were hitting only air. Malgorm laughed and
                      dropped to the ground. As he lay there the hunger spoke, "Now you see
                      why they all failed, Azzothoth. They felt mortal weakness. You understand
                      how to fight it. You do not need them any longer."
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm stood up, and with a word he disappeared into the shadows. The
                      hunger gave him the power to move again, filled with the rage and despair
                      that was now his comfort. "Bring the weak to death and take the strong"
<BR><BR>
                      He came back to Stormangell's side, cloaked by his magick. Before them
                      stood Sugan, Silverann, and Raenewae. Bertoxxulous raged in Malgorm's
                      mind. He was powerless to break it, and he watched as Stormangell was
                      taken by the rage also. Storm lunged forward like a mad beast, attacking
                      everyone in sight. Sugan ran as Raenewae tried to defend himself and was
                      eaten alive. Malgorm forced his own rage down as he screamed a warning,
                      "Silverann, run from him!! The madness of Bertoxxulous has taken him"
                      Silverann stood there like a statue and merely smiled as his brother began
                      to attack. Stormangell stopped in agony, struggling to regain control, and
                      copied his father's actions. Sugan returned to find Stormangell casting on
                      himself, and finally feeling the pleasure of death. Malgorm sensed the evil
                      from Silverann, the strong one. Deep inside, under the hunger, he felt for
                      those shadows of Stormangell. Under the hunger he loved him. He must be
                      saved. "Kill Sugan, Silverann." Malgorm said. The child only smiled. With
                      bitter words of magick Malgorm was gone. For he no longer needed them,
                      the voice spoke. "The Book of Azzothoth" it whispered. And he then
                      understood all his plans. All those Malgorm used, they were there to teach
                      him. To give him the power to gain the book. He was the plague bringer.
