                      There are times in one’s unlife where the needs of one’s Deity, one’s own guild
                      and one’s own soul differ. It is not a comfortable time for any creature.
                      Especially when your soul is not your own.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann stood before Laele, his strong hand outstretched in offer, and time
                      froze for Laele into a crystalline shard of eternity. She could feel her breast
                      heave with lust, her heart beat rattling against her ribs, but it was still strangely
                      distant.
<BR><BR>
                      Innoruuk, the god of hate, was her deity due to a promise that cost her
                      immortal soul. He had placed her on this planet to spread hate. He had chosen
                      for her the Shadow Striders guild for her to join, she found out later, and had
                      gained her entry. More capacity for hate.
<BR><BR>
                      And now, frozen in this moment of time, she looked at the young pale one, and
                      knew once again that her blood-lust, her sexual-lust made her just a pawn in
                      the game of the Gods.
<BR><BR>
                      Her ebon nostrils flared, taking in Silverann’s blood-rich scent, and the slightly
                      spicy undertone of his power. She licked at her lips, her pink tongue caressing
                      her touch-sensitive fangs. He smelled much as Malgorm did, that spicy scent…
                      Malgorm had said once that she always sounded like she was in heat… it had
                      offended her at the time, but perhaps he was not so far off. Such are the wills of
                      the Gods.
<BR><BR>
                      The most important thing that happened in that shard of time was the
                      realization that Silverann was not hers to take. His death was not hers to
                      create… or perhaps she just did not want it. It made her almost sad; for her to
                      do so would spread such great Hatred. Laele knew she could take his life
                      easily, sucking in his power and his life in the Great Embrace… she could even
                      set it up so that others were blamed. She could make it into a thing for the
                      guilds to war over.
<BR><BR>
                      But, looking into Silverann’s young/old face, she knew she could not. He was
                      a creature like she, created for greater purpose.
<BR><BR>
                      "But how deep a relationship do you ask for?" Laele asked, still not trusting the
                      offer in that out-stretched hand. "Do you want to be a pet or…?" She trailed
                      off blindly, not knowing what else to say.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann smiled at her, his eyes glinting dangerously. "Now, Laele, you know
                      pets have no rights."
<BR><BR>
                      Laele smiled because her heart was pounding too greatly with eagerness to do
                      otherwise. The perfume of the power in his blood was intoxicating, invading
                      her mind, her mouth, her sex…
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann looked her over with the bold eye of one used to such liberties.
                      Though covered with her bronze armor, she felt naked before his gaze. It was
                      a fascinating physical feeling. "Yes, Silver? Looking at my equipment?" Laele
                      asked, trying to sound in control of herself.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann smirked at her. "Good, I found something you may like as a gift… it
                      was not easy to get though."
<BR><BR>
                      The large bundle he pulled from his pack clanked when he handed it to her. It
                      was dead weight in her arms. Unwrapping it with the eagerness of a child, the
                      armor quickly surfaced. 
<BR><BR>
                      Laele looked at the metallic cloak with a flutter in her stomach. More armor
                      could mean more killing. More killing meant more blood… Oh, and the blood,
                      the waves, the oceans, the throbbing of blood… "Oh my." Laele breathed,
                      nostrils flaring again as she pulled the cloak onto her shoulders. It fit her like a
                      perfect metal skin, like a pair of unpinned wings. "Oh, thank you!"
<BR><BR>
                      She leaned forward to hug Silverann, feeling his heat against her like an almost
                      irresistible fire. She pulled away with effort.
<BR><BR>
                      "Do I look good in it?" she asked, knowing that her eyes were flaring the
                      dangerous crimson they held when she fed.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann, still smiling that knowing smile, nodded slowly. "You wear it well,
                      Laele, with the strength you should.'
<BR><BR>
                      She beamed a smile up at him and whispered her thanks, turning slow circles
                      to feel the almost serpentine feeling of the cloak curl around her as she moved.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele could smell Silverann’s blood on the very air around her, churned up by
                      the movements of the cloak. It made her want to beg. She did not, but
                      Silverann’s next words did not surprise her: "I have another gift for you but I’m
                      not sure you would take it." Laele felt herself quiver with eagerness, but tried
                      to hold herself still. "Or if you’d even want it…'
<BR><BR>
                      He looked up at her with that little-boy look. "Yes, Silver?" she purred.
<BR><BR>
                      His gaze grew hungry like her own. No more games. "Do you want it?' he
                      breathed, looking almost in pain.
<BR><BR>
                      Looking at the crowd hunting around them that Laele had already forgotten,
                      Silverann took her hand and walked away from the camp with her a short
                      ways.
<BR><BR>
                      He turned to face her, his body pressing against her armor. "Kiss me, Laele."
                      He breathed, his lips mere moments from her own.
<BR><BR>
                      She felt surprised at his directness, then responded gladly. She leaned forward
                      to lightly touch his lips with her own, feeling the softness and strength of his
                      body against hers.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele teased his tongue with her own, past her own needle-sharp fangs, feeling
                      him respond with a fierceness that made her fangs even more sensitive. He
                      quickly turned the embrace into something savage, crushing her to him, slicing
                      his own tongue on her fangs.
<BR><BR>
                      The shudder that coursed through her was uncontrolled, as the thick sweetness
                      of his taste exploded in her mouth. She drank deeply, feeling the heat of his
                      blood slide down her throat.
<BR><BR>
                      The kiss ended all to soon, but she still was captive in his crushing embrace…
                      he ran his teeth down her neck in nibbles, then into hard nips as he moved
                      towards the artery on her neck, never breaking her ebon skin.
<BR><BR>
                      He breathed to her softly: "Bite me."
<BR><BR>
                      Almost powerless under the blood-seduction, this order still roused her to life.
                      Fangs bared, she turned in his embrace, almost weeping her need as she sunk
                      her teeth into the soft flesh of his neck. It was with less gentleness than she
                      would have preferred, but she quickly forgot such thoughts as the taste of his
                      life’s-blood flooded her mouth and her senses.
<BR><BR>
                      His blood took little sucking to remove… as if he was a creature created to be
                      fed upon. The heat and the power of his blood exploded upon her with all the
                      power of life, and then some. It was the power of some foreign creature… and
                      ever so sweet.
<BR><BR>
                      Silverann sighed softly as she fed. Knowing that this union pleasured him too
                      made her knees weaken… she wanted to die again, feeling such pleasure…
<BR><BR>
                      Death.
<BR><BR>
                      Remembrance of death made her stop, she would realize later. ‘I will not curse
                      him to the Unlife like I am, if he is not already cursed." Though Silverann did
                      not ask her to stop, she whimpered and pulled away.
<BR><BR>
                      He looked at her with pleasure-hazed eyes and whispered: "Keep going,
                      Laele."
<BR><BR>
                      It almost tore her self-control in two to see him asking her to continue. With a
                      shaking hand she wiped at her mouth to clean his blood from her lips. "Nau,
                      Silver... I have drank my fill for now. I do not like to... gorge on the first date."
                      She laughed shakily.
<BR><BR>
                      He laughed with much more self-control and pulled away, putting a hand to his
                      neck to put pressure on her bite. "’Tis hardly a gorge, Lady Laele. 'tis part of
                      the gift I had for you." Silverann sighed at her, appearing disappointed.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele, half-fed, felt the sparkling power of his blood curling through her like a
                      powerful mist. 
<BR><BR>
                      "But, Lady, you have not even taken the edge of what I had for you!" he
                      growled, obviously still as needy as she was for her to continue the embrace.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele growled silently at the heavens, feeling her hunger only grow, hearing him
                      beg so. "Um, Silverann,’ Laele said, trying to keep control of her voice. "I
                      know my... tastes are not your own... but do you want to meet me at my
                      chambers later?"
<BR><BR>
                      He shook his head, slowly. "I don’t like power/pain trips, we do pain for
                      pleasure fine, pain for friendship fine, nothing else.'
<BR><BR>
                      Laele looked at him with something akin to respect: it was a painful feeling.
                      "You ask to take things so slowly..." she pouted.
<BR><BR>
                      Smirking, he reached forward to paint her lips with his blood. "The wait is
                      always worth it, Laele." He breathed at her.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele licked at his blood with a quick tongue. She felt her body heat up at the
                      taste. Blood-frenzy, ever the danger, began to cloud her mind, but she pushed
                      it back, and him back with a silent cry.
<BR><BR>
                      She whimpered with more frustration, fangs ripping her own lower lip to
                      ribbons, she turned her back on him, pulling in deep breaths of clear air,
                      forcing herself to regain control.
<BR><BR>
                      "Perhaps, someday, after this… Envy business is through," she spat, "we will
                      be able to continue this, Silver." She turned around and showed the raw
                      hunger in her eyes to him. "Until then, do not expect me to wait… but know
                      that I will hope to hear from you."
<BR><BR>
                      She leaned forward to kiss him lightly, then jogged off towards Neriak,
                      knowing she was a coward.
