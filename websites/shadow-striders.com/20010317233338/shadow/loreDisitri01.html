The Miller family was Disitri's latest obsession. He had been watching them for
months. Once he scared their little girl by summoning his form right in front of
her and stamping his feet. What fun that had been, drinking in her frightened
and terrified aura, becoming human in his ability to change others for another
blissful moment. However, his time with the Miller's were finished. He had
learned enough about him, he grew weary. He knew how Chanda enjoyed
weaving the furs of animals, how she stretched her left foot first every morning
out of bed, how she liked to rub her husband Baobob's stomach while they
made love or were close. He knew how Baobob liked to scratch his nose,
how he hated what his feet looked like, and how he shifted to his left foot
whenever his wife rubbed his stomach. 
<BR><BR>
Disitri knew the Millers.
<BR><BR>
The time for one last climax of events had come, for Disitri had all but became
a part of the Miller's every day life, although they did not know it. He had
conquered them in the sense that he could predic their every move to normal
situations -- But not to something so completely alien to them that they would
never see it coming or have any idea as to what to expect from it.
<BR><BR>
Disitri approached the couple at their usual campsight in front of Surefall Glade
in the form of a brown bear. They killed the bears for their fur, and so,
predictably, Baobob drew his bow and let an arrow fly into the heart of Bear
Disitri. Disitri let himself fall to the ground, feigning death and hurt, as he knew
animals should. Baobob and Chanda both drug him back to their campsight to
skin him, and so Disitri began his nightmare for them.
<BR><BR>
When Chanda peeled the skin from the bear with her sharp cutting knife, inside
she found not a bear, but a small child, screaming and wailing inside the blood
and internal organs of the bear. The child was, of course, Disitri. 
Chanda, in fright, dropped her work and ran from the abomination before her.
Baobob ran to her side, and so the Child Disitri stood out of the slaughtered
corpse, picked up the knife, and walked on unusually strong legs over to the
quivering couple. He preferred Chanda to Baobob, as he usually preferred
women to men, women being more complex in emotion as a generality. He
wanted to see Chanda's reactions as he tore her husband limb from limb. And
so he did.
<BR><BR>
He savored every moment of this more intimate bonding with the both of them,
wishing he could have a repeat performance but knowning that this would
destroy both of them. The Child Disitri changed to fit his killing -- It grew
unpreportionally long legs and arms, though kept the general form of the child.
He began his work and went on with it relentlessly in a frenzy of Knowing and
Learning, the two things which kept Disitri fueled. 
<BR><BR>
He ended his act of defilement by throwing the now mad body of Chanda
Miller onto the pile of dismembered Baobob parts, and willing them to close
around her, suffocating her within her own husband.
<BR><BR>
These things are disgusting and horrifying to most people, and Disitri knows it,
but disgust and fear are unknown to him. All there is is to learn. Not all things
that Disitri does are nearly as morbid, but this was one that most clearly
defined his character in its need to learn.
