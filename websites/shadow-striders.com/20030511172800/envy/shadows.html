<P><B>Shadows.</B>
<P>So many fools casually place the shadows and darkness in the same group, and so many fools are wrong.
 There is not a place that the light does not touch, and therefore no true darkness. I can agree that
  darkness and light are true opposites, but not shadow and light. Shadow's true other is actually
  Reflection. Matter - <I>things</I> - are the middle ground. Things both reflect light and cast a shadow;
  and almost always do both. As for darkness… darkness is nothingness. Darkness cannot serve my goals,
  for it is devoid of Hate as well as light, love, and well… me. Dark is easy to bring forth; all one
  must do is destroy everything, and then destroy self.
<P>Devotion to darkness = Madness.</P>
<P>I recall a time
  once, long ago, when I was stricken with such insanity… but we'll speak of that later. As of now I
  prefer a much more sophisticated approach to my existence, molding matter and shadow to create in my
  image. True power is not in darkness, but in Shadow. As for reflection… well, that is only to be
  manipulated as well.</P>
