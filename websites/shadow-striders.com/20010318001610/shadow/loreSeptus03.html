                      T'was one fine night in Neriak, and after several hours of hunting, Septus
                      decided that he should forget his troubles and wash them out with some kind
                      of beverage. As he walked towards the bar closest to him, he could not hear a
                      thing. Now, Septus may not have been the most world wise person in the
                      Shadow Striders, but he knew something was wrong. Normally, you would
                      hear the sound of drunkards yelling that they had just lost a game of King's
                      Court, or the serene conversations between lightwalkers of how they looked
                      down to watch the sunset the previous day. 
<BR><BR>
                      When he opened the door to this abandoned inn, he was slightly relieved to
                      see a barmaid, thanking the Gods that he wasn't going to be alone. However,
                      the young Tier'Dal seemed rather distant. Her eyes staring out into the horizon.
                      Shaking his head, he walked over to a table and sat down, to examine the
                      riches he had found, bought, and stolen. He would probably use them as gifts
                      for the Mistress. After a while, he stood up, and realised he had been there for
                      quite a while, as the sun was no longer wearily looking down at Neriak, it was
                      completely dark. Bewildered, Septus sat down again, trying to understand
                      how he could have been there that long. It just didn't make sense. 
<BR><BR>
                      Suddenly, out of nowhere, he heard breathing. Heavy breathing. And not soon
                      after, he could tell it was near him, for he could feel it on the back of his neck.
                      Confused, he turned around, to see what was happening, and there it
                      was...The head of 
                      Morticus the damned. It's face, more horrid than he ever imagined. It began to
                      laugh at him. Septus could no longer take this, so he ran as far as he could
                      away from the inn...To a library. He was delighted to see that there were many
                      there, all reading what they could. He saw a book there, labeled 'Revolution'.
                      As he took a quick glimpse at the pages, he saw that it was documenting the
                      great and infamous bloodlines across Norrath. He showed no interest in this,
                      until , he saw the word 'Renegade'. That page read 'Arthur Renegade married
                      Pryde K'Nen, only to embrace a curse, where they accidentaly had two
                      children rather than one, the forbidden act. The two children Tritus and -----
                      were to be born. Tritus was to be the child of light, and -----, the Dark
                      Chosen.' Septus didn't understand why his name had been inked out, and
                      looking away from the book, he saw that everyone there appeared to be
                      'frozen'. It reminded him of the time he heard Sapphon say 'When time freezes,
                      so no one can hear you scream'. When he looked down at the book again, all
                      the ink had dissapeared, and the same image, on every page was slowly
                      coming into vision. It was the face. The face of Morticus. Septus closed the
                      book tightly and dropped it onto the ground, only to see the spectre of
                      Morticus the damned, also known as The Carnage standing before him. The
                      spectre spoke the words 'Come child...You are mine now'. At that, Septus
                      fainted. Upon reaching conciousness, Septus stood up and ran. He ran all the
                      way to Nektulos forest, and waited there, for Envy T'Druis to come. Only, he
                      couldnt push what he had just seen out of his mind...He couldn't help but think
                      that this was only the beginning...
