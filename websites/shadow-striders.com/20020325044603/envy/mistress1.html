<P><B>Mistress of Shadows I</B>
<P>An ebon hand moved, disturbing the sand covering it. Her entire form rose then like a zombie of the desert. Sand ran off her in rivulets, exposing blackened armour. Coughing and sputtering, Envy peered through the predawn darkness for anyone who would notice her. Namely, Wind Riders.
<P>They had treated her relatively well during the time she was captured, considering. The biggest threat came when Sugan herself arrived at the tower. The Teir'Dal had heard the enemy's leader outside, adamantly refusing to enter on the risk that she might run a sword through her rather than look at her. Envy had cackled at that, and was amused at the silence outside afterwards. Other than that, the Lightwalkers were nearly hospitable; allowing Envy visitors even. At dusk, one had brought her a most interesting gift; a plain looking book called the Tome of Shadows. She'd only briefly gotten to read from it at the time.
<P>Night brought their advantage. The moment the Shadow Striders ambushed the base, Envy had stepped casually into the midst of the chaos outside. She'd heard the hiss of Shannyn's voice, chanting into what was probably certain death for some unfortunate victim. A large dark wolf howled from the dunes above, and Envy had smiled at the bloodthirsty glow in the wolf's eyes... Mayana. Shadows drifted in and out of the black desert, striking and fading away like the waves of some nightmarish ocean. The dark elf stretched lazily, and pulled hidden daggers she carried in places not often searched. She flipped the blades expertly in her grasp, taking in the battle scene one last time. Blending back into the shadows of night, Envy had disappeared.
<P>And here she came out of her hiding, cut off from the rest of the guild. Envy didn't dare ask herself why she waited so long; that was dangerous thought. Instead she snuck closer to civilization, cringing at the sand in her armour. While peering around a corner in the dark tunnel to the Commonlands, a soft male voice startled her.
<P>"My Lady Envy," it said. "Finally you've been found."
<P>Envy bristled and flipped around, guarding with the daggers. Relief flooded her as the figure in black robes pulled back his cloak's hood to reveal Tdaael's face. Envy was about to speak but stopped at the necromancer's expression. Tdaael looked around him, as if expecting someone to have followed.
<P>"Lord Faileas has been captured." he said quietly, speaking in the Teir'Dal language.
<P>The shadow knight put her daggers away so Tdaael couldn't see her sudden trembling. Envy's face paled to a cool blue gray, but she tried to draw attention from that by shaking sand out of her hair. 
<P>Envy cursed as she did this, and paced the hall like it was a cage. "And of his amulet? Did the Wind Riders take it?" she growled.
<P>"Sugan did, and she released the soul trapped inside." Tdaael sighed. The shadow knight cursed once more, and lashed out at the air in anger.
<P>Landing in a crouch, she gripped her temple and hissed, "How could she have that knowledge...?" 
<P>The necromancer shook his head. "I don't know, Dark Lady, but when it was taken from him, Lord Faileas started spouting insanity's, madness... he went catatonic shortly after.
<P>"His last orders were to find you," Tdaael finished.
<P>Just then several other Shadow Striders appeared. She stood as Ayna the pale darkness, Phyr the fallen goddess, and Laele the vampire approached. Envy winced, seeing the scores of wounds on the vampire's flesh as Laele knelt gingerly. Noticing the other woman's ashen expression, Laele flashed a bloodstained smile; her delicate yet deadly fangs reassuring. Envy nodded at the group of them and turned back to Tdaael.
<P>"So." Envy began, "He's his sister's property now?" She leaned on the wall to cover her shock of the news.
<P>Tdaael nodded. For a moment, Envy's eyes iced over with rage and she gritted her teeth. Then strangely she blinked it off, and offered a disarmingly civil smile.
<P>"Good." she said to their amazement. After briefly judging each of her companions in turn, Envy drew them closer to speak in whispers.
<P>She strode away from the group after they'd nodded uneasy agreeance to her words. Looking back with the dawn's first light glinting off a feral smile, Envy said, "Oh yes... And since Faileas has proven himself unworthy, I am now Mistress of the Shadows. Anyone who wishes to challenge that can speak to me."
<P>The shadow knight laughed and disappeared.
<P>In Neriak, the first thing Envy did was strip off her sand-filled armour and dive into the cool dark waters that flowed silently through the underground city. She glided along the pool's floor, washing away the rest of the uncomfortable grit. Resurfacing, the Teir'Dal once again noticed the Tome of Shadows peeking from her backpack.
<P>She went quickly to her house to dress; and took the infamous scythe, Pestilence, from it's place near her altar. Wrapping the Tome in heavy waxed paper, Envy then tucked it into the pocket of a soft leather cloak that covered her face well. She left for Freeport.
<P>Morning was leaving when she arrived at West Gate. The guards watched her dark figure carefully but made no move to intervene, after being hit with a strong blue-green gaze. Though it wasn't them she was hiding from. The militia patrolling East and West Freeport were loosely controlled by organizations Envy was associated with... it was the Paladins and Mages she had to look out for. North Freeport was the last haven of the city for true and pure hearted Lightwalkers. North Freeport was where Faileas was being held.
<P>Drifting quietly past the arched doorway to the Academy of Arcane Science's courtyard, Envy joined a crowd and entered North Freeport. She inconspicuously slipped past buildings and shops when suddenly a hand shot forth and pulled back her hood. The shadow knight heard a familiar sliding of metal as the guard drew his sword.
<P>"Dark elf!!" he shouted triumphantly, "Your foul deeds have..." He paused and glanced around.
<P>Envy was gone.
<P>Having dashed inside a convenient inn and up the stairs before the owner could protest, she quickly swung herself out a window to the rooftop. Here, Envy watched the streets below and the guards searching through the throngs of people for her in vain. A sudden gust of wind billowed out her black cloak, drawing her eyes skyward. Black clouds of a coming storm mottled the sunshine, coating the city with eerily sharp areas of brilliant light and dark shadow. The Teir'Dal covered her face again and matched the speed of the shadows, leaping with feline ease from roof to roof.
<P>She stopped on a white wall overlooking the precinct known as the Temple of Marr. Sensing something from a room close to her, Envy waited for the paladin sentry to move on and then dropped quietly to the balcony. She peeked in and gasped, seeing a dark figure standing inside. Faileas' black armour nearly sucked in the very light around it, the cape wisping slightly in a breeze. But there was no Faileas in it. The T'Druis family sword hung nearby on a rack, partially wrapped in strange cloth. With a smirk, Envy realized the paladins probably wouldn't deign touching it themselves. '<I>Innoruuk knows how many of their brethren coat that sword,</I>' she thought, laughing.
<P>A noise startled her from such pleasant thoughts, and she made haste for the wall outside. Frowning, Envy wondered if they were holding him in the Hall of Truth. She turned and crouched to jump, but suddenly a voice came from her left... almost causing her to fall.
<P>"Envy," it whispered.
<P>She sniffed the air and searched warily, but found nothing. Eyes narrowed with suspicion, the Teir'Dal slithered in the direction, ready to attack. She found nothing of the whisperer, but gathered around a building in the alley opposing her was a small group of about six onlookers. They appeared to be spying through a small barred window; belonging to a room that was probably half underground. The basement cell of some guild house?
<P>The building was at least two stories above ground, so Envy looked for guards before dropping to the street. Joining the group, she listened to their subdued chatter while trying to get a look in the ground-level window. Envy's heartbeat sped up, definitely sensing the presence of Faileas' bloodline nearby.
<P>"... and good riddance, too, I say." a half elf with hair almost as white as Envy's quietly murmured. "About time they did something. Only wish half the militia and those scoundrels sneaking about underground were executed with him..." 
<P>She spoke hastily and looked behind her as she did it; shifting in her dark blue armour. They were all speaking with utmost care, as if something dangerous would catch them.
<P>"Are you sure he's down there? That it's really THE Lord Faileas?" asked a human dressed in plain brown robes.
<P>"Aye," the half elf answered. "Saw him arrested just last night. Wasn't a bit happy about it, either. Threw some sort of fit, and got all quiet. Downright disturbing, it was." 
<P>Another human nodded, his chainmail tinkling slightly. "Course it's him!" he frowned. "Look for yourself! But watch out, I wouldn'a meet 'is eyes if I were you... he knows black magick, an' el prolly take your soul for it."
<P>The bunch of them looked wide-eyed at each other for a silent uneasy moment. The sound of a door opening in the front of the building sent them scuttling to look busy or as if just passing. Envy ducked behind a large barrel and watched. A patch of sunlight played harbinger to a red headed girl in full steel plate. She walked slowly, reading a letter and shaking her head in gentle exasperation. She stretched in the sunlight, accentuated by a light breeze. The Teir'Dal cringed further behind the barrel and hissed at the sight. Sugan. There was no way she'd stand a chance if Sugan spotted her here…
