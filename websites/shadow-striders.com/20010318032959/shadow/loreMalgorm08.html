<P><P>
                      Terina tracked down Malgorm in the plains of Karana. Nothing escaped her.
                      She looked at him with her fiery eyes, not showing any sign of weakness,
                      only asking what he been up to. Malgorm wondered if she had felt the
                      emptiness he felt with out her. "My lady, my guild was at war. I did not want
                      to risk your life with you being at my side." She only smiled, seeing the
                      truth he disguised with lies. Malgorm grew troubled. "My lady.. I am a
                      demon, a monster. A Bloodsaber, I am…"
<BR><BR>
                      She smiled. "I love you," no one had ever spoken to him in such words..
                      "and I know you are not." she said. Malgorm shook his head. "My lady, the
                      love.. the person you saw was a reflection. I am soulless. Only with Sugan's
                      death will I be that again." Terina's eyes flared with strength. "Then I will kill
                      her and take back your soul." She smiled and hugged Malgorm, and handed
                      him a golden band as a symbol of her promise. Terina had given him
                      strength to fight the hunger, and Sugan and her Wind Riders again. That
                      night he made her magick rings of strength to represent the strength she
                      had given him. But he knew that it all had to be part of Bertoxxulous' plan,
                      everything was or it did not happen. That night Malgorm dreamed of the
                      past, a life that was not this one. He saw her face, the lovely Terina. But
                      who was she why was he drawn to her….?
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Voices</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Everyday Malgorm dealt with his responsibilities as a leader of the Shadow
                      Striders, and then left to hunt beside Terina. He would follow her to anyplace
                      she wished to go to fight evil, but she had join his side in the shadows. He
                      knew together there was nothing they could not kill; no foe they could not
                      defeat. Then one day in rage she called to Tunare as she destroyed the dark
                      elves of Mistmoore. The words enraged the hunger inside him. Without
                      thought he screamed "Tunare will die!! The plague will cleanse this world of
                      everything, bringing it back to the truth of what the universe was before the
                      illusion of life."
<BR><BR>
                      Terina looked stunned. "How can you say that about Tunare?" Malgorm was
                      shocked that he could say such things to her. She blazed at him in anger
                      and pain that he could say that to her. He felt as if he could die that
                      moment. Malgorm turn away, ashamed for what he was when she said that.
                      The look on her face hurt him more then any blade or spell. He thought for
                      sure he would lose her for those words. "My lady, I am sorry. Bertoxxulous
                      enslaves me; his words become mine. I am sorry. I told you that this would
                      happen.. I am what I told you. I am a demon.. I am Azzothoth. I am here to
                      destroy it all." Terina sounded defiant, 'No my love, we will beat it. We will
                      defeat Bertoxxulous but never speak of Tunare again in that manner." He felt
                      suddenly jealous that perhaps she loved her goddess more then he... The
                      hunger enraged the shadows inside him.

                      <B>The Shadows Weaken and Turn to Darkness</B>
<BR><BR>
                      After the war, the pathetic Wind Rider Laraden had been resurrected and
                      enslaved as Malgorm's pet, but to him it was more of a gift for Envy to
                      torture. He felt that the guild was growing weak in mind and heart. The war
                      had shown the true colors of many. Their fear of spilling blood; the untested
                      proven weak. He had spoken to Faileas about it more then once, but his
                      Lord always seemed lost in something else. The king of shadows was
                      occupied with some other plan so Malgorm had been trying to strengthen
                      the guild himself. Malgorm knew it had to do with Lord Faileas' sister- a
                      weakness that he would soon cleanse just like Faileas had done for him.
                      The Book of Azzothoth would be his soon, and he had told Faileas of it at
                      last. The hunt for it was on; he knew that past disciples of Azzothoth had
                      written the book, and still existed today with the knowledge of where it was
                      hidden. But Malgorm would need only the strong to stand at his side, and
                      he had grown tired of his son Silverann's lack of evil. So he met him in the
                      Greater Fay and relayed that he no longer needed him or Stormangell. If
                      Silverann wanted to stand at his side, he would have to go kill and bring
                      back the bodies of Wind Riders as proof. Silverann told his father of
                      Stormangell's marriage to Cattiebrie. He also brought back the bodies of two
                      spies in the Shadow Striders.. Malgorm's son was growing fast. He had
                      accepted the curse. For the first time, the child had shown respect and
                      loyalty to his father. They would search for the book together. Silverann was
                      guilty of killing Wind Riders, he was cleansed of his old life.
