<B>The Plague is Born</B>
<BR><BR>
Deep in the darkness of the sewers of Qeynos, a wizard stood staring into
the water at his reflection. Gazing at a face that he did not know, a body he
had never seen, with a name he did not understand. All he felt was an
aching of rage and despair. A void that ate him inside- a hunger of
unimaginable pain. Then he heard it: a "squeak" coming from some small
rat hugging the damp wall. Malgorm turned in rage at life and the hunger
shot forth from his finger tips. He watched as the rat's blood froze in pain
and the slow death the animal experienced somehow gave him comfort from
the hunger.
<BR><BR>
The timid natives of the sewers cringe as an unnatural scream fills the
darkness, "I need more !!!!! Do you hear me?! More!!!!" Then Malgorm turns
back to the watery refection of himself. Not for one moment did he consider
where the power came from or how he had did it, only that he must use it
again to feed his hunger for death. Looking up, Malgorm saw a man in deep
purple robes with dark eyes and hair. A young man of wicked ambition. "My
name is Terreon Callust. Follow me, Bertoxxulous calls you to his temple."
<BR><BR>
The first word Malgorm understood was Bertoxxulous, as that was the name
of the hunger.
<BR><BR>
<B>The Reflection of a Soul</B>
<BR><BR>
The poor beggar ran to the wall. He could hear the monster so near; he had
only wanted a copper to get some cheap ale, but that man was no man. The
beggar turned the corner, and felt the cold steel of a blade cut into him from
the side. Blood poured onto the sewer floor. The beggar watched in terror as
the man in the purple robes spoke a word- "Bertoxxulous" -and fire burst
forth. The beggar screamed in pain as his skin blistered. At the edge of
death he looked up, whimpering "what are you and why…." The man smiled
evilly and tossed a copper to the beggar. He turned to walk away. The
beggar gagged in pain and relief; believing his life spared. That realization
left as soon as it came, with a dark sword swiftly placed in his skull.
<BR><BR>
"Malgorm," said a voice from the shadows.
<BR><BR>
Malgorm turned to see a man in dark leather with the same face as his own.
A stunning female dark elf was by the man's side. He spoke again, "My
brother, I am Lord Faileas." Malgorm smirks in understanding as the
knowledge floods his mind.
<BR><BR>
Faileas continued, "This is Envy. She is my apprentice, and will aid you
while you grow to power. We have much to do." Envy only smiled at
Malgorm, appreciating the display of the evil he had just shown. What terror
they would bring….
<BR><BR>
<B>The Soulless Beast "Sugan"</B>
<BR><BR>
Hours had passed. Envy spoke many truths to Malgorm as they hunted the
sewers for blood. She taught him there was more than the blind rage; she
taught him the power to control others. A single lesson he would never
forget- if a being wants something, then they could be controlled. And
everyone wanted something. The words of her lessons echoed across his
soul; Envy had given him his greatest gift. But it was time for him to leave
the sewers. Envy was to show him secret ways in and out of the city to be
safe from those who wanted to stomp the virus before it infected the world.
Malgorm waited to meet Lord Faileas outside the city gates, so Envy left
him there.
<BR><BR>
For the first time the sun touched Malgorm, beating down upon the being's
skin and burning his eyes like the pain of birth. He was born from the
sewers; it was his mother. Making his way to the gates of the city, Malgorm
saw Faileas in the distance. To his shock a blade was swung at him. A
group of well armed knights stood by as a female with red hair fought Lord
Faileas in an epic battle. As he drew closer, a rage entered Malgorm. He
knew he was here on this man's behalf to protect to advise him… and to kill
that woman. Then the voice came. Malgorm heard her thoughts; the love
she felt, the passion and life. She was a divine storm. A storm that gave
Malgorm power. As he stood over the defeated Lord Faileas, he felt his pain
and knew that would be the last time she would ever best him. In despair,
Sugan felt Malgorm's thoughts and his will for the first time as well. Malgorm
blasted her with all his will and magick but like a goddess she was immune,
merely looking confused. Already in emotional turmoil for hurting her brother,
she seemed stunned seeing Faileas in another man.
<BR><BR>
Malgorm fled to his mother the sewers, the place where they could not get
to him. The power he had just gained- it all fit into place. In her rage and
despair over her brother, Sugan let Malgorm in. It all fit; it was suppose to
happen. Her victory here was her defeat and he knew it. The hunger told him
so.
