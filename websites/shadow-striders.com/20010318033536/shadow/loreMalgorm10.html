                      <B>The Dark Trine</B>
<BR><BR>
                      Malgorm appeared on the shores of West Karana. Waiting for him was his
                      dark rose, covered in black armor and carrying her praised scythe,
                      Pestilence. Envy gave an evil smile, filled with desire for chaos, and
                      Malgorm only returned it. Within a few words they had conjured a dark plot
                      to display their power and kingdom to the weak mortals that made up
                      Qeynos. 
<BR><BR>
                      For hours they sat along the outside roads of the city, where Envy taunted
                      the followers of light and life into a frightful rage, while Malgorm offered
                      money for the help of those without a faith to harrass. Then they entered the
                      city itself and sparked a riot of great proportion. The streets were filled with
                      hateful screams, arguments of whose god was stronger. The guards were
                      doing all they could do to contain the city. As the war made it's way to the
                      great gates of the arena, the guards pushed in all that wanted to shed blood.
<BR><BR>
                      The chaos began. Holy men of different faiths wet their hands with blood
                      from one another… and out of the shadows approached the three dark
                      figures behind it all. A trine of great wickedness. The two men stood as
                      twins; one in darkest armor and the other in black flowing robes, each
                      appearing as a dark avatar of evil. Then rushing forward with a bloodlusted
                      scream, the mistress of death carved her scythe Pestilence it's place inside
                      a paladin. His blood flooded the earth as the crushing power of Lord Faileas'
                      dark blade finished his life. But he didn't stop there. 
<BR><BR>
                      As the battle raged, Lord Faileas changed from his usual cold calm fighting
                      style to the vision of an uncontrollable plague. He attacked everyone he
                      saw, as if he were fighting the light within himself, cutting down paladin after
                      paladin. Envy looked shocked by his recklessness; Malgorm stood cloaked
                      in the shadows of magick, observing. The chaos continued, with Lord
                      Faileas fighting all that lived. He had caused wounds to so many, that in fear
                      and realization they had all begun to turn on him. Alarmed, Envy took a
                      protective stance, turning her offense to defend him. Malgorm felt the rage
                      burning inside Faileas, one of the first displays of emotion from him in a long
                      time. 
<BR><BR>
                      The greatest Paladin of the match then turned to Faileas. He was a man of
                      great power and reputation, but nameless to the demon. They all looked like
                      gnolls to him. In acrimonious rage for life, Malgorm summoned a force that
                      stopped the great light bearer in his tracks, and then went on to turn pure
                      hell fire loose upon him. Without remorse, the wizard watched the man
                      struggle and drop before he even had a chance to place his blade in
                      defense. 
<BR><BR>
                      By then Lord Faileas had taken many mortal wounds, only to keep
                      fighting… with blood-slicked armor and sword he still sliced through any
                      man foolish or unlucky enough to cross him. Finally exhausted, Faileas
                      sank to the ground with all but one man dead or quickly getting there. As
                      the lone paladin approached he was suddenly blocked by a menacing
                      Teir'Dal with flashing eyes and a scythe bigger than herself. With passion,
                      Envy dueled him in what could have been called suicidal intent. Malgorm
                      knew the man was of greater skill than Envy, but she showed no fear. When
                      the fight was over she stood alive, mocking the corpse of a great knight that
                      dared battle the dark mistress of death. 
<BR><BR>
                      The Dark Trine merely walked away from the scene, stepping casually over
                      the bodies littering the arena and streets of the city. Malgorm smiled in
                      delight with reflection; the three of them had fooled the light bearers into
                      battling themselves, and their own egos had finished them off. Perhaps he
                      would use this in the future… why waste all his energy and time killing an
                      enemy, when he can have more fun getting his enemies to kill each other?
                      The demon laughed. 
<BR><BR>
                      <B>Bertoxxulous' Love</B>
<BR><BR>
                      In the dark woods surrounding the Lavastorm Mountains, Malgorm stood
                      recovering from his teleport and and saw her there waiting for him. Her deep
                      purple eyes were lit alive with with divine fire and freedom. The sight of
                      Terina was all inspiring, a perfect beauty. She was the only light in the dark
                      forest. What had brought her here was unknown to Malgorm, all he cared for
                      was that she was here. The hunger and the plots and the evil were once
                      again washed away in the bright purple flames that were her eyes. 
<BR><BR>
                      He followed her without words as they marched up the mountains of
                      lavastorm. They spent the night killing off the goblins that lived around the
                      lava, as well as the newly formed men of the shadows… some kind of spirit.
                      Malgorm killed them at her will with no thought of where they came from;
                      only knowing that they swung their weapons of magick against her. Of
                      course, any that dare stood to harm her were soon met with an all-cleansing
                      release from life. 
<BR><BR>
                      As the night grew darker they made camp in the black forest. Malgorm
                      gazed at the lovely goddess of freedom. In him, something deeper than
                      Azzothoth, something deeper then Bertoxxulous called for freedom.
                      Malgorm was the opposite of Terina, he was the slave and the enslaver. She
                      stared back into his eyes; or rather, the dark soulless pupils that were
                      Malgom's eyes as if she knew what he felt. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Do not fear. I will free you from Bertoxxulous." The words felt like daggers
                      to his heart and an inner fire lit up. 
<BR><BR>
                      "My lady……" he muttered. The words he wanted to say came into his
                      mind, "I am a demon. You can not save me; I love you because
                      Bertoxxulous wishes it. He wishes to use you for some reason. I do not
                      know what for, but I knew you from lifetimes long ago… I have dreams of
                      you from a different age." 
<BR><BR>
                      At his thought, The Hunger screamed in outrage and servants of the undead
                      arose from nowhere to attack the wizard. They were not sent to kill but
                      served as warning. Terina looked shocked and she hacked them down with
                      ease. After several moments he tried to speak again, and as the words
                      rolled off his tongue more servants arose from the dead. 
<BR><BR>
                      Terina screamed, "Leave him alone!!" Her words sounded liking breaking
                      glass. 
<BR><BR>
                      For the first time The Hunger attacked Malgorm. He watched her eyes go
                      from bright purple to the dark violet of the robes of the Bloodsabers. Her skin
                      reflected the skin of a dark elf and her smile became Envy's, taunting his
                      weakness. Then he felt the madness creep inside him.. the voice laughing
                      was his own voice.. 
<BR><BR>
                      "Weakling…" it said, mocking him the way he had said it to so many. The
                      mental lashings of his own making fought against him. He struggled not to
                      let a tear fall in front of Terina, swearing not to let her see that he was weak.
                      For the fist time, the wizard shielded himself from her. All he could see was
                      a dark elf staring at him; one that used him and laughed about it in front of
                      her sisters. Bertoxxulous too laughed from inside, taunting and laughing as
                      he slept. Had his enslaver taken her from him as well? 
<BR><BR>
                      <B>The Guilt and Greed</B>
<BR><BR>
                      For many days the Wind Rider Silveril had been tortured by Malgorms
                      mocking thoughts. Finally she had went to face him. She began her attack
                      with the same flirting nature that followed her blade in most battles. She
                      snapped angry questions about how he had two children with her, and yet
                      now had a different lover, some "Terina". This outraged the demon, just with
                      her knowing that angered him. Silverann must have told her all. Oh, how the
                      rat was going to die. What fate the stupid child had brought upon himself. 
<BR><BR>
                      Silveril's attacks were at first bold, but the abuse the demon had taken
                      nights before only fueled his attacks upon her mind. The whipping was
                      fierce, and the mighty warrior was falling to the pain that Malgorm and
                      Faileas had caused her. Malgorm taunted her with this mercilessly… the
                      dark rituals used to hold her dear lover had drained his spirit. The great
                      teacher Stormangel was dead, drained of life and soul- and another now
                      took his place. As for Silveril during that time, she had bore the unholy
                      offspring of the dark ritual; the half-breed and the freaks she called children
                      echoed pain in her mind and heart. Malgorm instilled in her mind that even
                      she was a freak, and for that her friends would never trust her. 
<BR><BR>
                      The pain was not enough. He sensed a deeper, darker guilt was behind her
                      tones. What other pain was she carrying? What madness had the birth left
                      her with? The mental raping of her soul ended with Malgorm feeling fear and
                      remorse… Not for Silveril, but what if this could happen to Terina? The truth
                      of the monster he was came in mind once again. Malgorm shook it off as a
                      question of where Silveril and his guilt was coming from. He left the Estate
                      of Unrest where Silveril stayed much of the time, fighting the endless legions
                      of undead. Perhaps to hide the pain that she fought each time she swung
                      that axe. 
<BR><BR>
                      As Malgorm making his way out, a small halfling that he recognized
                      crossed his path. A cleric of the great god of thieves, named Glendale. He
                      had saved the halfling from the Divine Intervention, a holy guild that Glendale
                      had stolen and escaped from. Malgorm had offered him the protection of the
                      shadows long ago. The halfling only smiled with gleam of greed. The halfling,
                      like most Striders had learn not to gain the attention of the demon. And the
                      halfling was clever, he only bowed. Malgorm looked at the impish creature
                      and handled him a letter. 
<BR><BR>
                      "I promise this will be a profitable task." The wizard hinted. The halfling
                      glowed in happiness at those words, and ran forward in excitement.
