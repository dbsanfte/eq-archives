								<B>History:</B> "Why doess sshe get to live in Cabiliss, when we must rot here, Kesssora?" a small, piping
								voice demanded imperiously.  "It's not fair!"
								<BR><BR>
								Kesora, the nurse, made soothing shusssshing sounds as she glanced nervously around the dim corridor.
								"There iss a reasson for ssuch thingsss, broodling.  Do not asssk sso many quesstionsss," she replied,
								trying to keep her small charge moving.  A small sound in the corridor ahead froze her blood as she looked
								up.  The very subject of their conversation stood blocking the hallway, her eyes glinting dangerously in
								the torchlight.
								<BR><BR>
								"Neglecting your dutiess again, Kessora?" the Shaman asked, moving forward to take the broodling's arm in
								her claws.  "I sshall have to inform the Favored Mother that you are refussing to educate her children yet
								again."
								<BR><BR>
								"B...but, Honored One...I...." the nurse stammered.
								<BR><BR>
								"But nothing," the Shaman snapped.  "You have been warned before.  You no longer desserve leniencce.
								Return to your chambersss.  I sshall take charge of thiss little one."
								<BR><BR>
								Without another word, the Shaman pushed past the terrified nurse, dragging the frightened broodling along
								beside her.  They passed a few doors, then turned suddenly and entered a door in a recessed corner of the
								corridor.  The Shaman pushed the child inside ahead of her, then turned and closed the door, releasing the
								broodling in the process.
								<BR><BR>
								The room was sparsely furnished, with only a bed, a table and stool, and a drum, all illuminated by the
								fire that burned brightly in the hearth.  The Shaman swept past the wide-eyed youngster and seated herself
								on the stool.  "You wanted to know why Tsssoreth has gone to Cabiliss, did you not, youngling?" he asked.
								<BR><BR>
								"I...I...yesss," the broodling replied, drawing his chin up.  "That iss what I assked."
								<BR><BR>
								The Shaman nodded and gestured toward the hearthrug.  "Then ssit, and lissten to the tale."  The tip of his
								tail swung up to rest on the top of the drum as he laid his claws on his knees.  His tail began to tap the
								drum, restlessly at first, then settled into the measured cadence of a Shaman Song, the chant the shaman
								use to tell the Iksar History Tales.  The broodling hurriedly dropped into a crouch on the hearthrug as he
								had been bidden, and the Shaman began to sway a little in time to her drumming.  Then he began the tale.
								<BR><BR>
									"In the time following the End Days, the Clan Cuis'Eagail of the Kunzar Tribe found itself sorely
									afflicted by the loss of many members of its broods," he chanted, losing all trace of the sibilance
									in his speech.  "Still, the Clan remained strong, blessed with many monks, shaman, and shadow knights
									who still held favor with the great Cazic Thule.  We hoarded our strength, making and breaking
									alliances as the chaos made it necessary.    At last, the chaos settled into the time of Silence, when
									all the Clans of the Tribes found places of safety and gathered the ruins of their former glory about
									them as they would a tattered cloak.  This was a time of cowards, during which only a few of the
									strongest of the Clans dared venture forth to wrest the land that had been theirs from the vermin that had infested it since the End Days."
									Cuis'Eagail, the Feared Ones, was one such clan.  We easily reclaimed that which had been ours and
									quickly conquered our neighbors, bringing them under our dominion as soldiers and servants, and taking
									their slaves as our own.  A fortunate few were brought into the Clan itself as consorts or spouses.
									So did we gather our strength and foster new hatchings of ever more cunning, ever stronger broodlings.
									These grew into the fullness of maturity, the strongest and most intelligent culling the weak and the
									stupid out of each hatching, for generations.  At last the ClanChief and the Favored Mother saw that
									Cuis'Eagail had fulfilled their expectations, and they set about finding new ways to increase the
									Clan's greatness."
								<BR><BR>
								It was at this time that the ClanChief and the Favored Mother turned their gaze to a Tribe farther
								south, to a Clan called Cuarad'Bheir.  The Pain-Bringers had been doing much as had the Feared Ones,
								and so had become nearly as strong.  They had amassed more wealth than had Cuis'Eagail, but their power
								was limited by the lack of lands.  Cuis'Eagail had lands aplenty, and was limited only by lack of
								wealth.  So it was determined that emissaries would be sent to Cuarad'Bheir to negotiate an alliance
								sealed with the Joining of a pair, one from each Clan.  Lands and wealth would be combined, strength
								and power compounded, and Cuis'Eagail and Cuarad'Bheir become as one Clan."
								<BR><BR>
								The emissaries were well-received, the negotiations proceeded with only a few assassinations, and it
								was decided that one broodling from each of the hatchings which sat in each Clanhome at that time would
								be chosen to represent their Clan in this new alliance.  Cuis'Eagail would give a female, and
								Cuarad'Bheir would give a male.  The Feared Ones had four hatchings pending at the time of Choosing,
								and so the Feared Shaman set aside the life in one egg of each of the hatchings, forming a new hatching.
								Of these four, only one must survive to be the tie to Cuarad'Bheir, and the survivor would be determined
								by the machinations of the broodlings themselves."
								<BR><BR>
								Time passed, and the hatching produced four strong broodlings.  They were named Shena, Tsoreth, Niaal, and
								Biset, and their education began with an explanation of their role in the alliance between Cuis'Eagail and
								Cuarad'Bheir.  Thus were the sisters taught almost from hatching that they must kill each other, or they
								would die.  Biset did not survive her second season, for Niall fell upon her in presumed play and tore her
								throat out.  Then was Niall raised in the favor of the ClanChief and Favored Mother, and Shena and Tsoreth
								plotted against her.  Shena did not realize, however, the duplicity her sister harbored in secrecy: Tsoreth
								also plotted with Niall against Shena.  In her eighth season, Tsoreth was being trained as a Shaman.  She
								mixed a poison, and told Niall to give it to Shena in her feasting cup.  She did the same for Shena,
								telling her to give it to Niall in the same manner.  Thus it was that both Shena and Niall perished at the
								Clan feasting table, with Tsoreth seated proudly and innocently far away from both."
								<BR><BR>
								None could prove with certainty that Tsoreth had been the one who killed her sisters, but as she was the
								only remaining female from her hatching, she was the one who was promised to Cuarad'Bheir as cement for the
								alliance.  In Tsoreth's tenth season, news was received from Cuarad'Bheir that they had chosen the male who
								would be Joined with Tsoreth: his name was Tsoral, and he had survived six brothers to attain his place.
								It was agreed that the two would meet for the first time when they were sent to be tutored under one who
								had been contracted by the Clans for their education and protection.  That teacher was to arrive in Kunark
								in Tsoreth's twentieth season; his name was Talisson BoneDancer."
								<BR><BR>
								The rhythm of the drum continued on for several heartbeats, then began to slow.  The Shaman's swaying
								slowed with the drum's beat, and at last the two ended as one.  Silence dominated the room for a long
								moment.  At last, a respectful tap on the door broke the tale's spell.  The Shaman nodded to the broodling
								on the hearthrug, motioning to him to answer the knock.
								<BR><BR>
								Still a bit muddled from the tale, the youngling hurried to do as he was bid.  He lurched to his feet and
								moved to the door, stumbling in his haste.  As the door swung wide, he froze, his mouth slightly open, his
								eyes wide with shock.  A froglok slave stood in the doorway, eyes lowered respectfully, with an awkward
								lump held carefully in its hands.  When no word was spoken, he held the lump out, bringing it into the
								light from the hearth.
								<BR><BR>
								Kesora's head, carefully mounted on a wooden plaque, stared sightlessly at her former charge.  In panic,
								the broodling stepped away from the door and swung to stare at the Shaman with disbelief brimming in his
								eyes.
								<BR><BR>
								"Witnesss the folly of your loosse tongue, broodling," the Shaman said dispassionately.  "Your very word
								can kill ssomeone, true, but it could alsso kill you.  Next time you have the urge to blurt your
								frusstrationss to the world, think to Tssoreth, and how her ssilencce killed her ssissterss and ssaved her
								own life.  Information can be found without public dissplayss of frusstration."
								<BR><BR>
								The Shaman shifted his gaze to the slave.  "Esscort this broodling to hiss quarters, and hang that in hiss
								rooms to sserve ass a reminder.  I sshall find him a new nursse.  Now go, both of you."
								<BR><BR>
								The froglok stepped back and waited respectfully for the broodling to exit the room.  When at last he did,
								with only a small backward glance to show his fear, the slave was quick to move in behind him.  The Shaman
								gestured then, and the door to his chamber swung slowly shut, dropping into its place in the jamb with a
								sound like the closing of a tomb.
