								<B>History:</B> The beginning...
<BR><BR>
"I have sat within these blackened granite halls for countless lifetimes," The ancile's
crystalline voice echoed softly through the empty shrine, "Sent to you here by my lady, to
serve you as you saw me fit to serve." 
<BR><BR>
The majestic sapphire eyes of the Teir`Dal woman danced beneath the shimmering lights of
the candle's blackened flames while she glanced coldly upon the faded painting of her
master. For moments she kneeled in silence before the grand, ancient painting, her body
trembling with respect and fear as she looked almost longingly upon the cold, green eyes of
the painting that had leaped from their lifeless threads and bound her very soul in chains.
Closing her eyes to the world around her, the ancile lowered her head, allowing the soft,
unearthly wind to brush over her body in an almost soothing blanket of forgiveness. 
<BR><BR>
"Why are you gone to us, master? Why must your absence to us be timeless? Perhaps you do
not see how needed, how desired and worshiped you are." Her words were barely audible
through the veil of pleasure that had overtaken her senses with the caressing wind, the
soft currents brushing warmly over her face and dancing playfully through her silken hair. 
<BR><BR>
Her eyes swelled with disdain, turning back to gaze upon the Teir`Dal's painted emerald
eyes, "Have you forgotten us beneath the shroud of wonders that has been unmasked to your
eyes, my lord? Your loyal servants, some of us your very children, my lord, ache for your
return as we are lost without you."
<BR><BR>
A gentle moan escaped her indigo lips as she tilted her head back, her consciousness being
scorched by the living breath of the Castle. Closing her eyes, allowing the winds to
overpower her mind, the ancile's lips moved in the motion of her master's name but her
voice was strangled by the searing pleasure rising within her. The soft hands of the wind
caressed every sleek, slender curve of the woman's small, yet strong figure, their gentle
unearthly fingers slipping beneath the silvered steel armor that shielded her body, playing
gracefully upon her flesh. The world around the ancile had faded beneath the shielding
warmth of the winds, her consciousness now souring through an endless harmony of pleasures
and wavering shrouds of blissful torments. For what seemed to be an eternity, the Castle's
breath, her master's breath, had shown her pleasures that would have easily destroyed a
mortal and torments that could have willfully submitted Saryrn herself. 
<BR><BR>
Again, the ancile's trembling lips softly whimpered the name of her master beneath her
quivering breath, "Mistmoore..." each syllable throbbing with the desperate longing within
her heart that had slowly begun to eat away at her withering sanity. 
<BR><BR>
Within moments of her plea, of her acceptance to her master, a low voiceless echo softly
washed through her mind, "We have seen your apparent lack of enthusiasm with this dry,
lifeless realm. We are pleased to know that your eyes are opened, child, to the truth of
this eternal life."  
<BR><BR>
The winds continued to caress her being, her physical body and the one that now
passionately engaged with the words and visions that invaded her mind, "You are now more
like him than any. You are his child now, you are our child; his Tseraje, his desires, his
passions; our Tseraje, our lover, our sinner."
<BR><BR>
A single crimson tear fell from the ancile's eyes as she heard her name spoken through the
mists of immeasurable pleasure; her spine arching and head falling limply back as she
silently continued to give herself to the realm. The echo slowly faded into a strong,
baritone voice as it's almost tender words continued to pierce through Tseraje's mind, "My
dear, know that your service here has ended. We have a small task for you, acceptance shall
lead you to the fulfillment of your wishes."
<BR><BR>
Tseraje felt the breath nearly torn from her chest as the sensual voice rang deeply into
her soul, her throat grasping for the words to return to him, words that were quickly
silenced by the tones of the realm. "For nearly five hundred years, our lord has been
vacant from his lands. There are mortals who believe him dead, while there are some who
believe he was a mere fantasy of an elfin cult upon Faydwer." There was a brief pause as
the voice allowed the realm's desires of the woman to continue, the gentle currents forcing
themselves into her body. 
<BR><BR>
Tseraje threw her head back as every muscle within her body tensed beneath the unbearable
sensations that arose within her. The streams of blood continued to flow gently from her
eyes, which remained tightly closed, as she speechlessly continued to be subjected to the
realm's desires and tortures. A faint laughter burst through the waves of pleasure as the
masculine voice began to softly whisper within her ear, "Some have claimed that he has
bestowed to them the gift of his secrets and that they are now his children. Others have
claimed that they were created by another, whose abilities are that of our lord's."
<BR><BR>
The winds softly died away from the ancile's body, taking the fruitful waves of pleasure
with them and leaving behind only the soft touches of his fingers against her throat and
cheek. Tseraje gasped in shock and despair as the air quickly filled her lungs and the
muscles in her body relaxed within his cold, gentle embrace. Feeling his smooth, almost
stone-like hands run across her brow, the long nails upon his thin, wiry fingers gently
brushing the hair away from her eyes, Tseraje released a gentle moan of comfort as she
rested her head upon his shoulder, her eyes remaining closed as she concentrated upon the
sensations of his touch.
<BR><BR>
Another faint snicker echoed in her ear, shortly followed by his lovely, tender,
breathless voice, "We ask that you seek those who claim to be of our lord's power and find
their truths. If they prove false, their minds diluted with the hunger for his power," His
cold tongue softly caressed her jaw, slowly slipping around the smooth flesh of her throat,
his fangs dragging lightly upon her skin as he hissed, "destroy them."
<BR><BR>
Tseraje opened her eyes at the cruel, hateful, and amusement struck tones of his voice,
turning her head upon his steel armored shoulder so that she could see who was granting to
her this opportunity. The ancile turned a faint smile as she took in the beauty of her
master's image, her eyes wincing slightly in disbelief as the crimson tears continued to
steadily crawl down her cheeks. His emerald eyes, shimmering brilliantly beneath the veil
of shadows and flickering blackened lights of the shrine, glazed quickly with adoration as
he returned her smile, his thin lips parting slightly to reveal the fading stains of her
blood upon his extended canines. The paled skin, tinted with tones of his mortal gray, was
flawless, stretched across the thick bone structure of his unspeakably beautiful face.
Framing his broad, well-defined cheeks and his stone-thick neck was a thick, lovely mass of
white hair, tinted with the soft highlights of gold and silver, draping down his back and
broad shoulders as it coiled upon the stone floor. 
<BR><BR>
Tseraje reached one of her thin, graceful hands to his brow, taking in a deep
breath as she slowly ran her quivering fingers through his soft hair, her eyes swelling
with disbelief as she continued to gaze upon his gorgeous figure. The smile upon his face
widening at Tseraje's reactions to him, he extended his hands up to her moistened cheeks,
drawing her closer to him. Brushing his lips across the streams of blood that had run from
her eyes in her madness, he slowly stood to his feet, carefully leading her with him.
Gently caressing her cheeks, lips and brow with his tongue and fangs, he lowered his hands
to her waste, embracing her tightly to him.
<BR><BR>
"Tseraje," his voice was barely an audible whisper as he spoke between his gasps of
pleasure with the taste of her vitae, "Do you accept our quest?"
<BR><BR>
The ancile moaned softly as he raised her chin, leaning down so that his lips would
reach the tender skin of her throat. He continued to softly kiss her, splitting her tender,
youthful flesh with the tips of his fangs, gently lapping up the small drops of blood that
came from her wounds with his cold, satin tongue. Tseraje opened her eyes, her mind
centering upon the moment that had engulfed her emotions, her wants, and desires from the
depths of her unspoken soul. 
<BR><BR>
"My lord," Her words were spoken softly into his ear, her own voice masked by the
veil of pleasure that had enshrouded her body, "What if I do come across one who is of your
power?"
<BR><BR>
Ignoring her words for a moment, he slowly deepened his fangs into Tseraje's
throat, penetrating deep into her blood-rich vein. Wincing for the brief moment of pain, a
gasp of terror escaped Tseraje's breast, her hands quickly driven up to his shoulders as
she held fast to him. As the ancile's voice pierced through the thin blanket of silence
that had descended upon the shrine, her master quickly tightened his grip upon her, being
careful as not to shatter her figure beneath the immeasurable strength of his body. The
metal figures of her breasts brushed against his bare chest with her heaves of excitement
as he cradled her within his arms, continuing to slowly draw forth her sweet blood from the
small wound in her neck, two thin streams of blood escaping his lips and slowly running
down her back.
<BR><BR>
Tseraje closed her eyes as she felt her consciousness slowly being carried away
upon the flow of blood that escaped her body, into his embrace. Brushing her lips around
the fine edges of his ear, the ancile softly sighed, "Take me to you, my lord, take me to
you and forever I shall serve with my undying soul."
<BR><BR>
Through his clamped teeth, he released a faint smile as he increased his strength
upon her, holding her tightly as he felt the breath nearly escape her lungs. Tseraje
released another pain-filled moan, masked with intense pleasure as her body quickly fell
limp within his arms. Feeling the dissipating pace of her heart against his still chest, he
slowly pulled himself from her throat, his muscles tightening for a moment as the brief jet
of pain grasped his own lifeless heart. His lips and chin dripping with the crimson liquid
from Tseraje's body, he grinned a wicked grin as he shifted her weight to a single arm,
raising the now freed hand to his jaw as he gracefully wiped away the scarlet liquid. His
smile widening in amusement as he looked silently upon the rich, darkened blood upon his
paled skin, he raised his hand back to his lips and drank the rest of her.
<BR><BR>
Swallowing a large gulp of the crisp, still air as the strength quickly began to
return to her body, her eyes slightly opened as she watched the image of her master's
motions through blurred vision, Tseraje released a faint sigh of comfort as she remained
cradled to his chest. His hand now clean, he turned his smile to Tseraje, his eyes a solid
shade of shimmering white as he looked almost lovingly upon her, "If they are truly
children of his likeness," His voice was gentle, endearing as he lifted Tseraje to her
feet, carefully steadying her balance, "then you are to find their secrets, as his lord as
not given his blood since his departure of us. Find who has stolen our lord's abilities and
if they are of any value, then we shall perhaps make use of them."
<BR><BR>
Tseraje raised her brow as his words slowly rattled within her thoughts, her body
still recovering from the second time it had been snatched so quickly into pleasure and
just as easily stolen away. "If they are not of any value to us then, my lord?"
<BR><BR>
A faint smile dawned upon his lips once more as he slowly raised his hand to
Tseraje's brow, gently brushing away the small strand of hair that had fallen over her
eyes, "Those of no worth are not fit to slither upon this earth, my dear. Do with them as
you wish, so far as that their unlife is no more."
<BR><BR>
His voice had retained its majestic and alluring tones of endearment as he spoke
with such loathing displeasure. Taking in another deep breath, closing her eyes while her
body whimpered in pain for the torment that being away from his embrace had seemed, Tseraje
softly nodded, raising her hand to her temple in her attempts to slow the spinning of the
world around her. 
<BR><BR>
"Dearest Tseraje," He had wrapped his arm around her thin waist, his hand gently
pressing her head to rest upon his chest, "Do you accept our offer to you?"
<BR><BR>
She remained in his arms; her face buried deep into his cloak of velvet and silk
which he had drawn around her. His long, sharpened nailed continued to brush slowly through
her hair, his arms loosely holding her to him while he patiently waited for her answer.
After countless moments of their silent embrace, Tseraje slowly lifted herself from him,
her eyes gleaming with confidence and a desire that she knew could only be quenched by the
figure that stood before her now. 
<BR><BR>
"Yes, my lord." Tseraje's voice was bold and confident, trembling with excitement
and an undying desire to remain forever in this creature's arms, but the disappointing
truth had turned her desires to nothing more than unreachable fantasies.
<BR><BR>
A sadistic smile quickly dawned upon his face, his whitened eyes shimmered with
satisfaction as he took a step back from the girl, "We are so pleased that you have
accepted, dearest Tseraje." His words were struck with loving tones laced with intense
sadistic pleasure.
<BR><BR>
Extending his arm out to Tseraje, the smile upon his face fading slightly behind
the rising glimmer of satisfaction within his eyes, "Come, Tseraje, there is much that we
must prepare you for, our love."
<BR><BR>
Tseraje's hand had already met that of her master's before his words had even
reached her ears, her brow wrinkled in confusion as she looked upon her hand encased within
his own pale, gray flesh. His soft chuckle caught Tseraje's attentions as she raised her
eyes to his, the faint smile painted across his lips forcing the concern from her thoughts.
Her heart racing in excitement and an almost girlish anticipation, Tseraje followed his
steps to the large pool of water in the center of the shrine, imbedded within the blackened
marble floor. Four steps around the rectangle pool led down to the calm, crystalline
waters, the smooth silken surface of the water reflecting the soft lights of the blackened
candles that lined the edges of the pool. He led her to the edge of the waters, softly
placing his hand upon her shoulders as he turned her towards him, his long fingers slowly
wrapping around the steel hooks that kept the armor upon her body.
<BR><BR>
His eyes reflected the soft lights of the water as he began to unlatch the metal
hooks from her armor, the chime of her vambraces loosening rang sharply within her ears,
snapping her attentions from the unfulfilled fantasies of her master. Her eyes winced again
in disbelief as her expectations arose within her body, her heart racing as she felt her
impossible dreams slowly growing closer to becoming her realities.
<BR><BR>
Tseraje allowed him to slowly remove the vambraces from her arms, leaving behind
the thick padded cloth that protected her soft, delicate deep gray blue flesh from the
wrath of a would-be hero's blade. With the vambraces now in his hands he flashed a gentle,
playful smile to Tseraje as he tossed them into the pool of water, the faint splashes of
the water sung eerily through the deafening silence of the shrine. Continuing to remove the
armor from Tseraje's body, each piece being lightly tossed into the pool of water, his eyes
did not stir from hers and his face continued to bear the constant sadistically warm smile.
Tseraje closed her eyes as she silently wished for his touch to forever be upon her, for
this one serene moment to never escape her grasps. 
<BR><BR>
The pressure of his hands upon her shin as he carefully lifted her leg, slowly
removing the steel boot from her foot, had invoked the tears from her eyes as she placed
her hand upon his brow, softly running her nails through the silken strands. Her lips had
begun to softly motion the words that she had so dearly wished to speak but her voice
refused to rise from her throat. The sound of the final piece of armor hitting the surface
of the water forced her eyes to open, her heart beating quickly within her chest as she
felt herself growing closer to the end of her life within her master's arms. 
<BR><BR>
"Do not fear that which you desire, Tseraje." He had pulled himself to her ear, his
hands carefully turning her towards the water.
<BR><BR>
Tseraje obeyed her master's silent commands, slowly turning to the waters as she
gave herself completely to his control. His soft lips gently grazed over the elegant point
of her ear, his breathless whispers bringing chills over her skin, "You are one to us,
Tseraje. Let us guide you to your destiny, allow us to pave your path to your desires." He
slowly began to untie the silken cord that ran up the chest of her tunic, his soft hands
caressing the newly exposed flesh, "Let us guide you on the road of your pleasures."
<BR><BR>
He slowly slid his hands down her arms; his nails gently gliding across her skin as
he slowly removed the tunic from her body. The soft padded cloth fell to the ground, his
hands continuing to gently graze across her skin as he slowly untied the cloth cord around
her waist. Tseraje's hands glided their way down her belly, lightly caressing the edges of
his fingertips as he slowly removed the cloth pants from her legs. Tseraje arched her back
as he stood from her ankles, the tip of his nails lightly brushing against her spine,
"There is one last thing that must be reclaimed, dearest Tseraje." He had taken a step from
her, lightly wrapping his hand around the back of her neck as he slowly stepped forward,
towards the pool.
<BR><BR>
Tseraje obediently followed his movements, allowing him to guide her to the steps
leading into the pool. His voice sung softly again within her ear as he motioned her to the
first step, "You know the properties of these waters, Tseraje. Welcome their powers,
welcome your destiny."
<BR><BR>
Closing her eyes, Tseraje took the first step into the cool, refreshing waters, her
master slowly pushing her forward, his touch guiding her to the center of the pool. The
waters had wrapped around her naked flesh like a sheet of satin, softly caressing each
curve of her body with the tender waves of the her movements. As she looked down into the
crystal clear waters, Tseraje saw no sign of her armor, which was tossed into the water
only moments past. While looking into the waters a brief wave of fear enshrouded her body
as thousands of needles piercing into her gut. Unnerved by the brief yet alarming
sensation, Tseraje turned her glance to the shrine her eyes widening in sorrow and fear as
she glanced upon the figure of her master.
<BR><BR>
His head was lowered, his broad face shrouded in a cascade of shadows cast from the
light of his blazing eyes.  A soft breeze had began to blow through the shrine, forcing his
golden and silver hair to waver seductively through the folds of his cloak, the tips of his
hair blending into the light cloud of mist that had begun to rise through the room. His
arms were straight at his sides, peering in and out through his dancing cloak. The
expression upon his face, twisted into a hideous sneer over his large, razor-sharp fangs,
brought an immeasurable wave of fear through Tseraje, her body beginning to tremble
uncontrollably as she stared upon the shadowed monster. The sneer upon his face faded into
a brief smile as he looked satisfied upon the horror twisted into Tseraje's brow. 
<BR><BR>
"You will walk among the rays of light that have banished us. Your blood, our
blood; must be striped for you to complete our duties. We take back into ourselves his
blood, his weakness and we leave only to you his strengths." The voice coming from the
image had turned into a thousand voiceless echoes that pounded in her mind, retaining in
the satisfied grin as he glared sadistically into her eyes.
<BR><BR>
The unnatural wind began to swarm around the room; its currents now thrashing
through the thick blanket of mist that had engulfed his image. Upon the wings of the
currents a thousand whispers all screamed out in warning to Tseraje, their voices pleading
in a chaotic symphony for her to flee, that danger was near. They screamed for her soul but
she did not adhere to their songs, finding herself strapped within her master's gaze.
Staring curiously into his illuminated eyes a dread arose within her belly, her soul
screaming in terror as she found herself rendered breathless by the grotesque beauty that
reflected from his mind into her own.
<BR><BR>
The mists quickly dodged around her master's image, the edges of his cloak and hair
blending curiously with the flowing silver blanket as it quickly enshrouded the waters of
the pool. Tseraje's body began to shiver beneath the dropping temperature of the water,
chilled as the rivers of the frozen north. Her breath began to grow short as her body
trembled violently, her royal blue flesh quickly darkening to shades of indigo as her body
quickly fell into the grasps of hypothermia. The breath from her quivering lips blended
with the mists as they softly brushed against her body, their own droplets of water burning
their frozen touch into her body. 
<BR><BR>
Tseraje released a muted cry of terror, her chest burning as the cold worked its
way into her heart, its life giving pace quickly slowing. Holding her eyes upon her master,
his image growing more distorted by the continuing rise of the mists, Tseraje forced a bold
glance from her eyes, quickly hazing with the thickening of the mists. His lips curled back
once more to reveal the sadistic smirk of pleasure as he saw Tseraje's pathetic attempts at
pushing back her apparent fear.
<BR><BR>
Feeling no disappointment, only pain and a rising hatred for the being that stood
before her with each passing moment she remained within the scorching cold of the waters,
Tseraje lowered her eyes from his image. Attempting to take a step forward as she felt
herself not being able to bear the burning cold of the waters and mist, Tseraje felt
nothing but numbness within the nerves of her legs. Shifting her pain glazed eyes quickly
to her master, her lips trembling as she attempted to speak again with her muted voice.
<BR><BR>
Breaking the veil of shade from his features as he raised his face to her, "Trust
in us, Tseraje. Your pain is soon at its end." Again his words were voiceless, shadowed
beneath the veil of faded whispers. 
<BR><BR>
The ancile winced in pain as she continued to stare emotionlessly upon her master,
her body trembling violently beneath the rising bitter coldness. As she peered out to her
master's hauntingly beautiful face, Tseraje forced her eyes to focus upon the soft
impurities that seemed to be penetrating the thick, velvet mist. Light specs of scarlet
began to rise into the mist, the distorted coloration growing thicker within the dense
veils of milky gray and whites. 
<BR><BR>
Reaching out one of her hands to the discolored particles within the air, Tseraje
found that her own flesh had been covered in a light film of the same scarlet colored
liquid. Looking closely at her stained hand and wrist as she brought it closer to her lips
and nose, the ancile found the true nature of the new substance - blood. Lowering her eyes
to the waters, seeing the light trail of blood being absorbed from the waters and into the
mist, Tseraje's body quivered heavily as stabbing pains began to engulf her body, every
inch of her flesh twitching in the same sharp, stabbing sensations. 
<BR><BR>
The pains increasing with each second, each fragment of a moment that passed,
Tseraje found herself wanting to cry out, her silent lips pleading to scream in terror and
pain as to release the chains that were strangling her soul. The scarlet droplets had begun
to increase in their volume and quantity within the mist, Tseraje's body expelling her own
vitae into the water into a continuous river from each pour of her body. Her lips parted as
she heaved over, her belly retching with the steady flow of blood her body.
<BR><BR>
She closed her eyes tightly as she attempted to shut out the pain, the unbearable
searing pain of the scorching cold and the stabbing bites of the mist, Tseraje had forced
more of her blood to flow forth from her eyes, her crimson tears being swept away into the
vampiric blanket. The blood trailed from her body in countless extended veins through the
living mists, their scarlet arms fading beneath the darkened shroud that surrounded the
image of her lord and master. 
<BR><BR>
After nearly three hours of this torment, of Tseraje's life slowly being drained
from every inch of her body, the bitter cold released its shackles, lifting away into the
quickly descending cover of warmth. Tseraje's indigo and frostbitten-black skin quickly
returned to its natural, vibrant hues beneath the film of crimson that remained upon her
unsoaked body. As the cold died away, a horrid screech escaped Tseraje's lips, a cry that
had for too long been kept silent within her strangling torture. Her high-pitched voice
echoed violently upon the walls of the shrine, the tones of horror and anguish sung
beautifully through the haunting loneliness of the Castle. 
<BR><BR>
Her body falling limply into the water, her eyes opening to catch a final glimpse
of her master before her mind slipped away into the realm of dreams, Tseraje softly
whispered his name towards the fading, scarlet stained image of her master, "My lord... my
Mistmoore."
<BR><BR>
As her eyes closed to the world around her, her body quickly falling beneath the
calm waters of the shrine with the soft, voiceless echo of her master, "We are one."<BR><BR>
