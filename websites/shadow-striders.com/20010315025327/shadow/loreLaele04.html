                     Laele heard the story for the first time from a young bard in Freeport. 
                      Sitting in the Inn, a tiny silver glass in front of her on the table, the 
                      wine and blood memories from Nauria's gift were almost enough to keep her 
                      fed for the night.
<BR><BR>
                      Then the handsome young bard began to tell the tale, in a weak but pleasant 
                      tenor. His mandolin was a battered relic, but it's sound was pure beauty.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele listened, and wanted to laugh. She knew without a doubt who they 
                      nameless men in the tale were. She could almost smell them. One, she had 
                      tasted as a blood-price for another's freedom. The other, she had only 
                      longed to be allowed so close.
<BR><BR>
                      Serenade was a friend, though Laele had few that she would ever call such. A 
                      wise, intelligent friend, as untouchable by her lust and her hunger as a 
                      rock would be. His love for Sugan was a shield that she could not penetrate.
<BR><BR>
                      He had told her of his love for the blindingly-pure Sugan and had felt 
                      something akin to regret that she would never be cared for in such a way. 
                      Serenade's soft voice, so able to carry when he chose, spoke gently of her 
                      beauty, his long wait and his longing. To hear such reverence in his tone, 
                      it was enough to make even a vampire wonder what such a feeling would be 
                      like.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele drank another draught of the blood and wine mixed, feeling the power 
                      of both liquids slide down her throat to a belly already full of the 
                      mixture.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele froze as another of Nauria's memories flashed like lightning onto her 
                      senses. Laele 'remembered' a scene of Nauria's childhood, the first time 
                      Nauria was taught how to fight. She felt the fear and the eagerness of the 
                      young Nauria as her own.
<BR><BR>
                      Then the scene ended, leaving Laele a little drained. This had been going on 
                      all eve, this memory-feeding. So much to assimilate. It was painful, and 
                      glorious.
<BR><BR>
                      And now the bard was ending his tale, giving the victory in the arena of 
                      romance to Serenade. She smiled. 'So, he succeeded,' she thought to herself, 
                      smiling like she was pleased at the outcome, but it felt false.
<BR><BR>
                      Laele remembered a scene of her own. The last time she had seen Serenade. 
                      She had been scared of what she was going to say, Laele remembered, but
                      fear 
                      had long ago stopped being of importance to her. "Forgive me, noble bard, 
                      for being so forward..." she said, looking up at Serenade in all 
                      seriousness, no seduction in her pose nor her tone. "allow me to say that I 
                      think Sugan is a lucky woman."
<BR><BR>
                      The bard had looked at her, confused at Laele's intent, and Laele made sure 
                      as to give no clues on her motivation. She smiled, respectful for once, and 
                      left.
<BR><BR>
                      Vampires may have no beating heart, but it doesn't keep them from feeling. 
                      She had known her fascination for Serenade was doomed, as was her
                      adoration 
                      for her Master Faileas. There was a kind of rightness in only liking the 
                      doomed... Laele was, so why shouldn't her attractions be. She did follow the 
                      Diety of Hate, after all.
<BR><BR>
                      Standing slowly from the table, she tucked the vial of Nauria's blood in a 
                      spider-silk side pouch, gently. Then she pulled a gem from her pouch and 
                      gave it to the young bard, silently. It worth was more money than most young 
                      bards would see in a year. He didn't look at the gem, to her luck, entranced 
                      by her crimson gaze. "Tell the tale wherever your feet take you, young one."
<BR><BR>
                      With a slight bow, she pulled up the cowl of her cloak and disappeared out 
                      the front door. Sniffing at the night air, Laele chuckled a dark laugh and 
                      went to find Nauria. She knew her relationship with the woman was doomed
                      as well, but at least it was not half so puritanical as the others...
<BR><BR>
                      Tucking the new heartbreak in with the handful of others in her past, she 
                      hoped this one would fade in time.
