<DIV CLASS="title">Welcome to Lord Faileas' Asslaynt Dileab, or rather his Legacy of Disease</div>
<P>
You find yourself in a stone room, lined with bookshelves filled with varying sized books ranging in the colors of the spectrum. In one corner is a comfortable looking red chair. It is obvious this is someone's private library. After snooping around some more, you discover strange green glowing circles in the other three corners. Each has glyphs and ancient symbols glowing a lighter green upon the larger circular design. It finally dons on you that this room has no doors. How did you get here? Not knowing what else to do, you grab a book resting upon the red chair and begin to read:<BR><BR>
<DIV STYLE="line-height: 16 px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Times; font-style: italic">
Life was so much simpler when I was a child growing up in the plains of Karana. I had very few cares in the world. I watched over Sugan, and she kept me on my toes. We tended the farm, and helped mother. It was a memorable time, despite it being too brief. I will be the first to admit that my childhood was cut short. At least what most people would consider a traditional childhood. Now, years after my fate started taking shape, my life is not simple.
<P>
I have duties to perform, people to lead, and goals to meet. Each day becomes more complex than the one previous. Envy is always scheming. I am too, I suppose. Bertoxxulous watches all my actions. I know he approves. I"m not sure who's downfall that will be. And then there is Sugan. I don't think I'll get into that tonight. She consumes too much time in just thinking of her.
<P>
Yes, my life is now riddled with complexities that even I can barely fathom. I suppose that is why I am writing this. No bard will ever sing my tale correctly, but perhaps in my journals, someone will be able to glean the truth from my accounts.
<P>
I believe that is all I can afford to write at this moment. Honor dictates I tend to my responsiblities.
<P>
- Lord Faileas Imshee'Cro
</DIV>
<P>
You lift your eyes from the journal, realizing who wrote the words. This is the first entry in the journal of the Lord of Shadows. . . will you dare read more or find a way to escape?
