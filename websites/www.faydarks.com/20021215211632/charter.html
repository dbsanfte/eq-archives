I. LEADERSHIP 
<p>A. The Guild Leader (GL) will have all final say in anything concerning the 
  <br>
  guild or any of its members. The GL reserves the right to edit this charter 
  as<br>
  to accomadate anything not foreseen herein. <br>
  <br>
  B. The Ruling Council (RC) will be much the same as Guild Officers as far as<br>
  invites. The Ruling Council has authority over Guild Officers. The RC's basic<br>
  duties include recruitment, organizing guild events, and answering questions 
  from<br>
  Guild Officers or members if no Guild Officers or Class Leaders are available.<br>
</p>
<p>C. The Guild Officers (GO) will have the same basic functions as the RC but<br>
  will not have quite the authority. They will have the authority to invite members<br>
  but do answer to the RC. If a GO can not answer a question it will be forwarded<br>
  to a RC.<br>
  <br>
  D. Each class will have an appointed Class Leader (CL). The Class Leaders will 
  <br>
  be in charge of answering any class specific questions but will not have the 
  authority<br>
  to invite. If a CL can not answer a question they will forward the question 
  on to a GO.<br>
  Class Leaders will be chosen by the Guild Officers and are subject to a monthly 
  review. <br>
  Class Leaders will be chosen after we have more of a member base.<br>
</p>
<p>1) The guild's minimum level requirement for new members is level 20. The officers 
  will<br>
  choose when to invite alts though there is not minimum level. If your main has 
  been a long<br>
  time guild member they may decide to invite your alt at level 1, if your fairly 
  new to the guild<br>
  you may have to wait a bit longer to get an alt invited. That decision is up 
  to the officers.<br>
  However, alts will not be listed on the member's list until they reach level 
  20.<br>
</p>
<p>2) The maximum amount of recruits for each month is 4. Exceptions to this rule 
  may<br>
  apply in extraordinary situations but only with the consent of the GL or the 
  RC. <br>
</p>
<p>3) All class specific questions should be directed toward your CL. If your 
  CL<br>
  is not on at the time ask a GO. If no GO's are on at the time ask a RC member.<br>
  If your question is class specific ask a GO, if no GO's are on ask a RC member.</p>
<p><br>
  II. MERIT SYSTEM</p>
<p>The merity system is no longer being used.</p>
<p><br>
  III. LOOT<br>
  <br>
  1) All loot on raids will be rolled on based on need before greed. We ask that 
  players<br>
  do not roll on an item unless their character present at the raid needs it. 
  If no one needs<br>
  the particular item there will be an open roll in which everyone can roll. Items 
  will be rolled<br>
  on after the raid is over. All no drop items will be rolled for at the time 
  by members who<br>
  need them. Any items that no one wants will be used to fund the Dragon of the 
  Month<br>
  and Active Dragon of the Month awards.<br>
</p>
<p>2) If people from other guilds are in the raid they can roll on items they 
  need unless<br>
  stated otherwise by the raid leader.<br>
</p>
<p>3) All spells/songs that drop on raids will be given to the highest level player 
  who <br>
  can use the spell/song. If there is a tie between levels it will be rolled upon 
  by those <br>
  members. </p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
  IV. RAIDS<br>
  <br>
  1) If you wish to invite someone to a raid that is not in our a guild you must 
  check<br>
  with the GL, RC, or a GO first.</p>
<p>2) Come prepared to the raid. Peridots, gate potions and things of that nature 
  are <br>
  to be taken care of before joining in on a raid.</p>
<p>3) Any questions or concerns about a raid will be directed to the GL. <br>
</p>
<p>4) GL unless not present will be the main authority over the raid. If the GL 
  is not present<br>
  it will be announced who the main authority of the raid is.</p>
<p>5) Most raids will be announced at least 1 week in advance. If you can not 
  participate<br>
  in the raid for at least 2 hours please do not come. If you will be attending 
  a raid there<br>
  will be a raid sign up on the web page. Please sign up at least one day before 
  the raid.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>V. CONDUCT</p>
<p>1) No Kill Stealing (KSing) is allowed.</p>
<p>2) There will be no flames in guild chat or on the message boards unless in 
  a designated<br>
  flame forum. </p>
<p>3) We are a guild created around making Norrath a better place for all. We 
  will not <br>
  tolerate abuse of any kind toward other members or non-guild members.<br>
</p>
<p>4) Selecting a new main requires the member's alt to be at least level 30. 
  To declare a <br>
  new main you must get approval from the GL, RC or a GO.</p>
<p>5) Respect your fellow guild members as well as players not in the guild.</p>
<p>6) All persons clicking yes upon a guild invite agree to this charter and trust 
  the judgement<br>
  of the GL and appointed RC and GO's of this guild.</p>
