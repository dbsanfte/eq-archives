            <p><font size="2"> Each month the officers will give out two awards 
              to the members. For June we will only select an Active Dragon of 
              the Month as June will be ending shortly. The &quot;prizes&quot; 
              for each award are not set in stone yet so I won't go into exactly 
              what the prizes are but the winners will be receiving some platinum 
              and will be shown on the web page.</font><br>

            <p><font size="3" class="mash2">Active Dragon of the Month</font><br>
              <font size="2">Active Dragon of the Month, will be awarded to the 
              member who attended the most guild events. Such as raids, buffing 
              stations, guild meetings, etc. The officers will keep track of who 
              was at each event and at the end of the month will see which member 
              attended the most events.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2"><span class="mash2">Dragon of the Month</span><br>
              Dragon of the Month, will go to the member who the officers deem 
              as the most helpful member of the month. Each member is asked to 
              submit other members for going above and beyond their duties to 
              the guild. If a fellow member has done something extremely great 
              and you would like to submit who the player is and what they have 
              done, enter the information in the box below. The officers will 
              choose who the award goes to by your nominations.</font><br>
