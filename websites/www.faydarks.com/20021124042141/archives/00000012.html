Now that the forums are up and working again I would really like everyone to register and become active on them.  Now instead of an events page there is an events forum where I will post upcoming events and you guys can sign up there.  In order for the raids to happen I'll need everyone to sign up as soon as they know they can be there.  It makes it much easier to plan a raid if we know at least a day or two in advance who will be there.  I also posted a subject about the basics of raids in the events forum.  Since the normal events page is being replaced by the events forum I will be deleting the events page but adding a link to the events calendar on the main/news page.  Attendance and planning is important on every raid so starting after our Sunday Wurm raid if not enough people sign up for events they just won't happen.  If you need help registering for the forums email me at Barliman@faydarks.com or send me a tell in game and I'll get you set up.
