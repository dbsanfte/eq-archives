            <p><font size=2> A reminder to everyone that guild reformation is 
              Sunday (June 9th) at 8pm eastern / 7 central / 6 mountain / 5 pacific, 
              if your able please attend. At the guild meeting tonite we voted 
              5 to 2 to change the name of our guild. Tomorrow before reformation 
              we will decide on two or three guild names we really like and hold 
              a vote. If you have any ideas please let us know, we want everyone's 
              input and ideas. Also I have added a link at the top of a rough 
              draft of our new guild charter. I would like everyone to read over 
              this before the reformation. I will be on at least 1-2 hours before 
              reformation if you have any questions about the charter. I'll see 
              you all tomorrow on or before 8pm eastern in west commons. <br>

              <font size=1> Posted by <a href="mailto:barliman@faydarks.com">Barliman</a>, 
              on June 7th, 2002</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>I'm sorry for all of the news updates lately but they 
              have been needed. If you haven't been to the website in a while 
              please read all of the news on the reformation. There will be a 
              guild meeting Saturday night (June 8th) at 8pm eastern / 5pm pacific. 
              We are not meeting in a specific place we will use the chat channel 
              (/join faydarks).We will decide whether or not to change the name 
              of our guild. If we do decide to change it we will also be choosing 
              a new name. So think up some good guild names and pick your best 
              one in case. When thinking of names try to keep the first word as 
              Faydarks since our domain name is www.faydarks.com Please attend 
              if you can, the meeting should only last an hour or so at most. 
              On another note I hope to see you all there Sunday (June 9th) at 
              8pm eastern / 5pm pacific for reformation. I'm extremely excited 
              to get this guild back together. We are in the process of creating 
              a new guild charter and it's looking very promising. Over the last 
              few months I have seen our guild grow weaker in terms of organization 
              and events and this charter should take care of both. It is very 
              unfortunate the way in which our guild disbanded and why but in 
              the end our guild will be much stronger because of it. I can't wait 
              to get this started with you all and grow as a guild family. <br>

            <p><font size=2>Don't worry I don't have too much more information 
              :) The only thing I need to add is we will be meeting at the druid 
              rings in West Commons for the reformation. If you can get on and 
              be at the druid rings by 8pm eastern that would be great but we 
              can pick you up if you can't find a ride. Thats all the news for 
              now. If you haven't read below please do for more info on the reformation.

              <font size=1> Posted by <a href="mailto:barliman@faydarks.com">Barliman</a>, 
              on June 6th, 2002</font></p>
            <p><font size=2>Plans for the reformation of our guild are underway. 
              Lasslie has accepted our offer to lead the guild but will be without 
              internet for up to a month. In the mean time we have offered Talnakk 
              the leader title until Lasslie can return. The reformation will 
              take place this Sunday, June 9th, at 8pm eastern / 5pm pacific time. 
              Also, there will be an officer meeting this Friday, June 7th, at 
              9pm eastern / 6pm pacific. We'd like to get as many people on for 
              the reformation as possible so if you can make it please do come. 
              The whole process could take up to 2 hours so make sure you can 
              be on for a bit if you do show. We will all try to get online at 
              8pm eastern and join our chat channel (/join faydarks). When we 
              have at least 10-15 people in the channel we will give out the password 
              needed to join the private channel as well as the channel name. 
              From there we will go over what needs to be done next and then Talnakk 
              will log to sign into the chat. After that we will all need to log 
              and go into the chat on the server sign on screen. Basically at 
              this point the 10 or more people in the channel will have to enter 
              a command. Talnakk will enter the guild charter and he will receive 
              an email shortly after notifying him that our guild was approved. 
              Talnakk would then need to get on to petition a gm to actually create 
              our guild. Talnakk is the only person that needs to be present for 
              the petition. That pretty much sums it up but we will go over it 
              again at 8pm eastern / 5pm pacific when everyone is on the in game 
              chat channel faydarks. For more in depth info on what we'll need 
              to do and guild creation in general follow this link <a href="http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_guilds.jsp"> 
              Guild Info</a> </font>
            <p><font size=2> Ok now on to a few more things. For the officer meeting 
              at 9pm eastern / 6pm pacific Friday, Talnakk will create a private 
              chat called meeting. Talnakk will set the password so you officers 
              will need to send Talnakk a tell on how to join the channel when 
              you get on. Talnakk has quite a few things to go over including 
              the guild charter so if you officers can make it please do. As far 
              as the talks of changing the guild name I have emailed Lasslie about 
              it and she is going to get back to me. She is very busy with real 
              life so if she doesn't get time to respond we will probably hold 
              a vote on keeping or changing the name on Sunday when everyone gets 
              on. Ok I think I have covered everything, sorry for the long news 
              update. <br>

            <p><font size=2>I don't really know what to say or how to say it but 
              here goes. Today our former guild leader, Graderr, disbanded our 
              guild. I obviously do not know the complete story so I won't get 
              into exactly what happened. I do know that Graderr is gone and will 
              not be back. We will be reforming as soon as possible but we need 
              to figure out some things including what time and day we can get 
              at least 10 of us on for an hour or two and in the same place. As 
              of now we would all like to see Lasslie lead us and we hope that 
              she will accept our offer but that remains to be seen. Look for 
              more updates tomorrow on the page. For now when your in game type 
              (/join faydarks) to join our current chat channel. Then type (/1 
              [message]) to talk, (/list 1) will tell you who is currently on 
              the channel. Lasslie we all love you and do remember, this is a 
              game, real life comes first so whatever happens we completely understand. 
              But as far as this game goes we will reform Faydarks Order of Peace 
              and become closer as a family. Just please, please be patient as 
              we get this all figured out. <br>

            <p><font size=2>First I want to congratulate Cryingwolf on getting 
              married in real life. I thought I had added this in the news last 
              week but I somehow missed it. Congratulations and the best wishes 
              to you Cry! Next let me congratulate Youngleaf on his engagement 
              to Scarlatti Bladedancer in game. The wedding will take place this 
              coming Tuesday. More info about the wedding and other upcoming events 
              can be found on the events page, just follow the link at the top. 
              Well now that we have all the sappy stuff out of the way :) <br>
              I want to congratulate my roommate Faldyar on reaching level 60! 
              I can remember once upon a time when we hunted in Nro and we were 
              both amazed when someone over level 30 would pass by us! So congratuations 
              to the 3 of you as well as the two, ummm, lucky ladies ;) Now lets 
              get together and do something as a guild! Oh in case you didn't 
              notice I did add an events page and a pics page, links up top. <br>

            <p><font size=2>We are planning quite a few events in the near future 
              so I'll be adding an events page soon. It looks like the next event 
              will be finally getting that ivy etched quest for our rangers. I'm 
              not sure who all would like to do this quest but I know Ripfang 
              and Elevenknight would like to complete it. Elevenknight is available 
              from 7-11 pm eastern on the weekdays and 4-11 pm on the weekends. 
              So we should probably start it at 7 or 8 eastern on weekdays or 
              4 or 5 if we do it on the weekend. So first we need to figure out 
              exactly when we'll do this and who will be there. Please send me 
              an email at <a href="mailto:barliman@faydarks.com">Barliman@faydarks.com</a> 
              if you'd like to help out or if you'd also like to complete it. 
              Also, please let me know what days and times are good for you. If 
              anyone gets some info in guild chat send me an email if I'm not 
              on.<br>

            It was a close vote but in the end green was triumphant. Green beat 
            out blue/red 9 votes to 8. The forum will still be orange for a little 
            while because I don't have the time to change it's color today but 
            it will probably be green by next week. I also made quite a few changes 
            to the members page. For a complete list of changes, future changes 
            and to make any suggestions check out the suggestions link at the 
            top. For the first time we have reached 100 members listed on the 
            members page! I'm sure we have had more than 100 for a while but I'm 
            probably missing a few members. Also, I apologize to the people listed 
            without classes. I know I should know most of the classes I couldn't 
            remember. If I missed your class email me at Barliman@faydarks.com 
            and let me know what class you are. In case anyone wanted to see the
