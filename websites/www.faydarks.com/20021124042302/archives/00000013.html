<u><b>Thurgadin Rejoices!</b></u></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The crowds cheered as the triumphant heroes of Faydark's Lost Dragons returned to Thurgadin after their slaughter of Wurms.  </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"We condemn any action against the Shardwurms of the Great Divide" the mayor of Thurgadin, Durgan Bottlenip told reporters as he poured Fingles another Dwarven Ale with a smile.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"Wurms bad!" Fingles replied with a hicup.  Fingles was last seen leaving the party with Kyla Frostbeard.  Best of luck to you Fingles, great beard on that chick!</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"You're not writing this down right?  Good.  None of us like the wurms in Thurg but the mayor thinks they are too strong to formally declare war on.  Your not going to quote me on that though right?  Thank god." Tobart Dirkins was quoted saying after his 14th Dwarven Ale.  Abalene told me not to print that but it was opposite day so it wasn't opposite day, or was it?</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"I want to thank that crazy couple Shatner and Gwenurthur for saving my cat Ralphe," -Yates the Butler<BR> <BR>"Kantry and Arura are shorter than me!" -Mordin the Short</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Ripfang and Eenea were hoisted onto the dwarves shoulders and carried around town.  Sokath was muttering something about those blasted chat channels and that key next to L but cheered up once he saw Fingles fall off his table.  Aluiene showed up a bit late but no one minded once they got their hug.  I watched from the back quietly.  You know me, always the quiet one.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Anyway, I'm very proud of those who showed up.  We did a great job and more events are in the works.  The officers are getting together Tuesday night for a meeting and we'll set up some bigger and better raids.  Check back Wednesday for upcoming events.<BR>
