Wow, where to begin.  We've been a busy guild lately.  First, congrats to Talnakk on becoming the first Faydark's Lost Dragon to reach level 60!  It's one hell of an accomplishment.  Also, congrats to Arura on getting her epic!  She is only the second one in the guild to achieve this and did it only about a week after Talnakk.  Very impressive considering she's level 51.  It looks like we have 4 or 5 others actively working on their epics so more congrats should be coming soon.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
We had a guild party at the Nro docks complete with a pet duel, troll death charge and a scavenger hunt.  For more info and pics from the guild party check out the pics link at the top.  There is also a picture of Arura's group taking down the dragon Faydedar.  </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
We have 2 big events coming up.  We are raiding the Ry'Gorr Fort in Eastern Wastes on Sunday, September 1st.  For more info on that check out the events forum on the message board.  If you can make it please sign up on the events forum.  We also have a raid on Kael on Wednesday, September 4th.  Also, Rip and Fingles need a group or two for epic pieces and have posted the date and time in the events forum.  So, for the love of god, check out the events forum and sign up! :)
