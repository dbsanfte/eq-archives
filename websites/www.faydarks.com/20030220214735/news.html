For those of you that don't know Faydark's Lost Dragons under went a pretty big change last Tuesday.  Most of the officer's and many others in the guild decided it was time to move on including myself (Barliman).  In the 14 months I was apart of Faydarks Order of Peace and Faydark's Lost Dragons I had a great time.  The only thing I regret was that I did not get enough pictures.  Even though I only have fond memories I felt it was time to move on and experience some of the higher end game.  I put  thousands of hours into trying to get Faydark's Lost Dragons to the high end game but in the end saw little to no improvement.  Many officers just didn't have the time and I too don't have the time anymore.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
I don't know of everyone that left but I know for sure that Talnakk, Tansor, Youngleaf, and myself have moved on.  I am not certain who else is leaving but if I remember correctly Aluiene, Ely, Gwen, Shatner, and Ripfang are among some of the others leaving soon.  I'm not certain of the new officer line up since Lasslie is the only officer left.  Cryingwolf is now the guild leader and I'm sure he'll appoint some good officers.  In a couple of days I'll be temporarily replacing the intro movie with a video of some pics of the old and current guildees, going all the way back to when I first joined the guild.  Well this is good bye for me though I'm still in the game and you can always send me a tell and ask for anything.

<u><b>Some News</b></u></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Not a lot of news at the moment but some exciting news nonetheless.  Our old friend Dalimar is back but with a new character.  His new character is Riukie, currently a level 15 Monk.  Even more exciting is that his second child is on the way!  No events are scheduled as of yet but some should be coming up soon.  In the events forum there is a place where you can vote for where the next raid will be.

<u><b>Too Much News!</b></u></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Wow, where to begin.  We've been a busy guild lately.  First, congrats to Talnakk on becoming the first Faydark's Lost Dragon to reach level 60!  It's one hell of an accomplishment.  Also, congrats to Arura on getting her epic!  She is only the second one in the guild to achieve this and did it only about a week after Talnakk.  Very impressive considering she's level 51.  It looks like we have 4 or 5 others actively working on their epics so more congrats should be coming soon.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
We had a guild party at the Nro docks complete with a pet duel, troll death charge and a scavenger hunt.  For more info and pics from the guild party check out the pics link at the top.  There is also a picture of Arura's group taking down the dragon Faydedar.  </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
We have 2 big events coming up.  We are raiding the Ry'Gorr Fort in Eastern Wastes on Sunday, September 1st.  For more info on that check out the events forum on the message board.  If you can make it please sign up on the events forum.  We also have a raid on Kael on Wednesday, September 4th.  Also, Rip and Fingles need a group or two for epic pieces and have posted the date and time in the events forum.  So, for the love of god, check out the events forum and sign up! :)

<u><b>Thurgadin Rejoices!</b></u></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
The crowds cheered as the triumphant heroes of Faydark's Lost Dragons returned to Thurgadin after their slaughter of Wurms.  </P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"We condemn any action against the Shardwurms of the Great Divide" the mayor of Thurgadin, Durgan Bottlenip told reporters as he poured Fingles another Dwarven Ale with a smile.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"Wurms bad!" Fingles replied with a hicup.  Fingles was last seen leaving the party with Kyla Frostbeard.  Best of luck to you Fingles, great beard on that chick!</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"You're not writing this down right?  Good.  None of us like the wurms in Thurg but the mayor thinks they are too strong to formally declare war on.  Your not going to quote me on that though right?  Thank god." Tobart Dirkins was quoted saying after his 14th Dwarven Ale.  Abalene told me not to print that but it was opposite day so it wasn't opposite day, or was it?</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
"I want to thank that crazy couple Shatner and Gwenurthur for saving my cat Ralphe," -Yates the Butler<BR> <BR>"Kantry and Arura are shorter than me!" -Mordin the Short</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Ripfang and Eenea were hoisted onto the dwarves shoulders and carried around town.  Sokath was muttering something about those blasted chat channels and that key next to L but cheered up once he saw Fingles fall off his table.  Aluiene showed up a bit late but no one minded once they got their hug.  I watched from the back quietly.  You know me, always the quiet one.</P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Anyway, I'm very proud of those who showed up.  We did a great job and more events are in the works.  The officers are getting together Tuesday night for a meeting and we'll set up some bigger and better raids.  Check back Wednesday for upcoming events.<BR>

<u><b>Events</b></u></P><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Now that the forums are up and working again I would really like everyone to register and become active on them.  Now instead of an events page there is an events forum where I will post upcoming events and you guys can sign up there.  In order for the raids to happen I'll need everyone to sign up as soon as they know they can be there.  It makes it much easier to plan a raid if we know at least a day or two in advance who will be there.  I also posted a subject about the basics of raids in the events forum.  Since the normal events page is being replaced by the events forum I will be deleting the events page but adding a link to the events calendar on the main/news page.  Attendance and planning is important on every raid so starting after our Sunday Wurm raid if not enough people sign up for events they just won't happen.  If you need help registering for the forums email me at Barliman@faydarks.com or send me a tell in game and I'll get you set up.
