<br>
Fuck you VI... really, you guys are totally clueless, It's only the friendship that still keep people playing for most of the time. You've already fucked up EQ enough with your rooted mob's and bugged zones, and crappy pathing, and warping mob's.. and... and..<br>
<br>
You expect a zone that was untouched for like 5 months to at least be working properly... But hey, this is EQ .. And all the sane/good/nice programmers left VI for a long time ago. Just look at your damn stupid actions.<br>
<br>
I say it again, as I've said at so many other places.<br>
<br>
If Velious was un finished when it came out. Then Shadows of Luclin wasn't even began to getting worked on when it was released.<br>
<br>
You release products being like 20% finished, at least in the working parts, the mechanisms, seriously why are you so fucking retarded and dosent realise this NEED to work in order for players to be able to ENJOY and get anything out of the game instead of watching stuff bug the fuck out all the time and loose countless hours to that.<br>
<br>
Oh and btw, this move was a very stupid one. Just read what the gm is saying. He's so obvious he's wrong -- but I guess he didnt watch porn or eat pizza that moment and had his BF (yes bf) broke up with him that day and had to lash out some on a random guild. With a sorry excuse for what its worth.<br>

here is his response to my email, this is FAR from over btw.<br>
<br>
I would like to thank you for you emailing your concerns however the matter has been settled to the best of my knowledge.  While you may think that pulling that mob to that location is a valid tactic, it is in fact an exploit.  There is at least 5 more uber mobs between Kaas Thox Xi Ans Dyek and Va Xi Aten Ha Ra not to mention a solid 3 to 4 hours of clearing common mobs to get to Va Xi Aten Ha Ra.  The &quot;technique&quot; you refer to on Dain pulling is valid for one underlying fact, That is where he was designed to be fought.  Va Xi Aten Ha Ra(one of the final four uber mobs in Vex Thal) were not designed to be pulled to the same room as the first real uber mob in Vex Thal.   The only way that mob would be there is through use of a Z Axis exploit.  Again a comparison to the Dain, there is not a solid 10 hours or more of work clearing mobs from the zone line in Icewell Keep to get to the Dain.  Not to mention it makes sense to fight the Dain where his proc throws people.  So please do not compare this to the Dain Frostreaver IV fight as they are very different.<br>
 <br>
I am sorry you feel that bypassing content through the use of gravity fluxing and clerics using heals on monks or other feigned classes levels above them is a solid tactic. I assure you the zone was not designed to be fought in this way.  &quot;Because everyone else is doing it is not a valid argument either&quot;, those who are caught do this will face similar results.  Our stance will continue to be harsh on players who abuse in game mechanics to further their own ends.  As I informed the officers any future repeats of this type of behavior will lead to much harsher action against them than a 7 day suspension.  Any further questions I would be happy to answer as I assure you I am more than qualified.  Safe travels.<br>

<br>
As far as Customer Service goes, it's no surprise that SOE outdoes itself with stunts such as this. Look at how the company operates, you have executives who started out as GM's or early developers. No where will you see them with MBA's let alone simple 4 year degrees for any kind of business. These are people who were hired off the street to sit infront of a PC taking replies from whiney inept players while hauling in $7-9/hr. Random probability dictates that a few good ones will slip through the cracks, as quite a few players I have met have one GM that always stood out, but overall you are getting what you pay for.<br>
<br>
Turn things around however and look at who is playing. While a large portion of EQ players are in college, another significant chunk have graduated and moved on to professional careers that don't require uniforms and nametags. As such, it is logical that the average EQ player has better reasoning abilities then the average GM. Having greater GM contact on SH then normal servers, it is obvious that they really don't understand how customer service works. It is not uncommon to hear of no communication, no standardization, no guidance from management, inability to act on their own, and a flat out lack of desire to please the people who pay their salaries. Companies who want to stay in business in a competitive market often succeed through superior CS.  SOE's greatest appeal right now is that their competition as a whole is even worse then them.<br>
<br>
When you go to work today, or school, or out for the day, think of the places you go and how you would be affected by them if they treated you like SOE does. They know they have a monopoly over players and could just remove all of their CS staff tomorrow, raise the price another $2 a month, and people would continue to play. Until the day you hit cancel, you are nothing but a credit card number to them, right Smed?<br>

Thats silly to let people Z axis on one mob and not the other. Then to suspend them like you guys were supposed to some how know that you were not allowed to do Z axis Aten but its ok on dain. <br>
<br>
Did the GM who was obviously there from the beginning if he saw you do it, not stop you guys before the pull and say &quot;Hey look guys your not supposed to do the Z axis thing on this mob. I know it sucks but you have to do the 10 hours of clearing thing.&quot; I mean that would have been a better option would it not? Unless they were just watching you do the sploit so they can feed some info to developers so it can be fixed in the next patch? Well now thats pretty low.<br>
<br>
You need to write an E-mail back to that guy and ask him why the GM didn't point out that was a sploit? He had to be there beginning to end, yet he let you do something against the rules? I think they owe you all an explanation about that. I don't see many police departments that let the guy with the ski mask go walking into the bank and Finnish robbing it before they do something. Logic says stop that guy while hes in the parking lot.<br>

I mean, clearly we're going about this the wrong way making our own strageties.<br>
<br>
Or whenever a guild makes a first attempt on a mob, a GM-Admin (No &quot;Guide&quot;...no &quot;GM&quot;, I mean one with a hyphen) explains how to fight a mob.  Position warrior here.  Position clerics here.  Yadda, yadda...<br>
<br>
And as far as I'm concerned, if there's a way for PCs to get from point A to point B, there sure as hell some way for NPCs to get from point B to point A.  (Unless, of course, they're rooted, but that's different anyway)<br>
<br>
If you want Harvey the Two Million HP Fire Beetle fought at -562.03, 2273.12, 113.98...*root him there* and don't expect us to guess that's where you want him when he's over at -102.34, 2004.1, -203.11.  We're rocket scientists, not mind readers.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
They know just about every guild in VT is doing this pull and they made an &quot;example&quot; out of you.. (Wonder if the fact that LoS has players who *allegedly* work for Blizzard influenced VI decision to choose LoS to be made the example..hmm.. you petty fucking cocklickers)<br>
<br>
Thats why no warnings to ANYONE..  no dev coming down coming down and saying &quot;Hey.. we know its possible..  but we really dont want you to do that anymore..  this time was cool.. but in the future we would consider it an exploit&quot;<br>
