That modification is simple.. the use of an auction in the case that more than 1 person wants and can afford the same item.<br>
<br>
Set a minimum value for each item. If more than 1 person wants an item, it is auctioned                      off. Whoever wants the item the most AND has the points to pay for it gets the item. In case of a tie, random and the winner pays the points. Auction can be done in guildchat or even over the *gasp* auction channel . If noone will pay the minimum, the item rots and the next time the minimum is lowered by 25% or .5 point, whichever is greater. This is to prevent people from not bidding on items until the price is dropped in order to get a cheaper price than what they are willing to pay for it..<br>
<br>
So UberDruid04 has 160 points saved up and UberPaladin has 130 points saved up. An All/All item drops worth 10 points normally. They both want the item however the paladin wants the item more. Under your system, the Druid would get the item and would be at 150 points while the paladin would be at 130. However if it was auctioned, the paladin might be willing to pay 15 points while the druid only 12. The item would get sold at 12.5 points to the paladin leaving the druid with 160 points and the paladin at 117.5. that extra 2.5 points that was spent on the item is the inefficiency of setting a price before the item drops.<br>
<br>
This system works because each point is equivalent.. much like cash, the druid has saved up 160 dollars and the paladin only 130. However they can both afford the item and the paladin is willing to pay more so he gets it. If some uber uber item drops and 20 people all want it, the person who is willing to pay the most gets the item.. not the person who has the most points. The mere fact that 20 people are willing to pay the same price for an item means that they are willing to pay more than that price.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I tried to convince my guild to go this route but they are deciding to go for a socialist like point system where everyone who puts in enough effort last week gets to roll this week. &quot;enough&quot; is arbitrary and its not as fair as a pure points system imho but what can you do *shrug*<br>

Then I thought about the reason behind the system in the first place.  You have this system so that the people that are at the most raids are the best equipped.  In that way you guild becomes stronger and you can do more things.<br>
<br>
Now lets say you go to a auction system.  UberItemA drops.  Normally this items was set at 20points.  But now you auction it.  You have one guy at 60pts who has been doing all the guild raids and taking items that would help him help the guild.  Then you have another person with 50pts who hasn't been on many raids but never auctions on anything because he knows someday that UberItemA will drop and that is all he wants.  So now he uses all his points and the guy who really sould have it has to pay 50pts to get an item that is worth 20pts.<br>
<br>
Next case. There aren't many SK.  SK item drops.  Who is he going to bid against?  No one.  So he will be getting good stuff for hisself but not losing as many points as those that bid against each other (ie warriors).  So when that all/all item drops that everyone wants the SK has far more points than anyone else.  That isn't what I would call fair to the other people.<br>
<br>
<br>
At any rate.  My guild has taken up a modified version of this.  HOw do you deal with the fact that some classes aren't as needed on raids as others?  2-3 shaman is max for typical raids.  But you need tons of clerics and tons of mellee.  So the needed classes end up getting more points.  That leaves the other less needed classes out to dry.  HOw do you handle this?  Do you just say tough you aren't as needed thus aren't as important and won't get as many points as the needed classes?  That seems rather rude.  <br>
<br>
We had alot of people complaining that class_x will always have more points than class_y and that some way of normalizing the values between the two classes is needed to see who should get the item.  (ie 1 class_x point != 1 class_y point) Have you dealt with this at all? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucelandrospellsongtriton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celandro Spellsong     Triton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(3/9/01 4:56:34 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DKNY</span><hr size=1> <br>

Smartass answer: well obviously if someone is willing to hoard and spend 50 points on an item worth 20 points then that item is really worth 50 points and not 20. If the person with more money doesnt want to pay the points that someone else wants to pay they do not deserve the item.<br>
Bit more logical answer: the person with 60 points has been collecting lots of items that help him. getting 1 more uber item over someone will fewer points will not help the guild any more than him getting a bunch of smaller items instead. And of course an item is worth whatever someone is willing to pay..<br>
<br>

Well the SK items arent worth as much because they are class limited and not many people play SKs so of course he wont pay as much. As for when the all/all item drops, the SK will have fewer points than anyone else because he has been able to get every SK item that has dropped while others have gotten 0 items. Also the all/all item would have to be better than the SK specific item he probably has already. <br>
<br>
<br>

This is exactly what Im talking about above. Those neccessary classes will be the ones who are most able to rack up the points because not enough items drop for them. This means they will be able to spend the most points on the uber uber items that drop. The &quot;unneeded&quot; classes will get plenty of their class specific items, lowering their points below a needed class who comes on every raid simply because the unneeded classes get the most loot.<br>
<br>
I think the analogy of points as money makes the most ammount of sense.. Set prices only work when there is a large enough supply that you can find what the true price of an item is. Auctions are designed by nature to handle those cases where items are relatively rare and determining a price for them is difficult (Just how much money is a red square painted on a white canvas worth? to me 0 but to an art collector.. probably in the millions). Supply and Demand IRL is solved by $. Really expensive and/or rare items are sold at auctions. There are also blind auctions and people bidding for other people in auctions. So long as the method of obtaining points is fair for all people, using auctions with DKP will be fair. Those with the most points can get the items if they really want it NO MATTER WHAT. However those with fewer points may have an opportunity to get an item they really want by bidding higher than those with more points.<br>

<br>
And since the thread resurfaced I saw some questions that never got answered... regarding &quot;time spent&quot; at a raid: most of our raids are 1 shot deals... you show up any time before the kill and you get DKP.  This give ppl usually about a 1 hour window to get to a raid... with most people showing up on time or ~10-15 minutes late.  No one really complains about the ppl that might show up right before the dain pull... or that get a last second summon up to Yel.  However, if we notice a trend that one person seems to always show up at the last second...there would be repercussions.  For longer raids, like ToV farming or CT (where you need to clear the whole zone), DKP is broken down into segments.  ToV raids get DKP every 2 hours that we are there based on what had dropped in the those 2 hours. CT gives 0.7 DKP... and a clearing bonus was added for 0.3 if you were present from the time we zone in.<br>
<br>
Also, we have IDKP...which is incentive DKP.  This is awarded to ppl at raids where DKP might not normally have been given out... like Klandicar.  In order to provide a &quot;reason&quot; to come to raids like Klandicar, where no DKP loot drops, we give out IDKP to ppl that gets added to DKP total for lotto purposes.  <br>
<br>
Finally, we also give out special case DKP... in Sleeper's for example.  Not everyone has a key... and it's not fair that someone should miss out on raid DKP due how slow we obtain keys.  So when we go into Sleepers Tomb for raids, anyone that is online doing something productive for the guild (farming gems, trade components for guild, etc) will get DKP for each kill.  <br>
<br>
DKP is constantly evolving... it reacts much like an economy for item pricing... and it changes accordingly to game and raid dynamics. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uphaethondarkreaper.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Phaethon Darkreaper</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/18/01 9:49:26 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=54>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Issues...</span><hr size=1> How do you handle dkp for epic pieces Off big mobs? <p>I dunno, I just root & nuke...</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwendolynkeplegrobal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wendolyn KeplegrobAL</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendhead.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 42<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/18/01 11:43:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=55>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Issues...</span><hr size=1> You pay 20 DKP for your epic... with that 20 DKP you are guaranteed guild support to finish the &quot;harder&quot; parts of the epic quest.

<br>
The three main problems with the DKP system as Wendolyn describes it are a) item rot, b) determination of fair pricing, and c) point hording. Auctioning with reserve would do much to address both of those issues.<br>
<br>
a.) Everyone cringes when items rot, we know it's a waste. But it isn't fair to let someone get an item for &quot;free&quot; either. Placing a low &quot;reserve&quot; (minimum price) on items can help induce people to spend a small amount of points on something that they would watch decay under the currently dicussed DKP system. There can't really be any arguement that this would allow that one X class player in a guild to stock up on lots of class specific crap and still save up for the big stuff because if it's something that he would otherwise let rot, then it really has no value anyway. However, although the amount of points might be trivial in any specific circumstance, they would not be trivial in the aggregate. Thus, this player might actually find himself LESS able to horde under this system than if he watched a lot of items rot because of unreasonably high DKP cost. If it's truely something valuable, the reserve could be set somewhat higher.<br>
<br>
b) There's no fairer way to set prices than matching supply/demand through auction. This would mean that newer items might sell for a huge markup to their reserve as all the point horders cashed in their piggy banks, but prices would settle down once these players get what they want. This is a good thing as this just reflects the players with the most active participation getting the neat new toys first. At any rate, there could never be any arguements over the fairness of prices assigned to items. The person who places the highest value on an item, and has the participation to merit it, will get it.<br>
<br>
c) The problem with point hording, as I see it, isn't that people will skip items they might otherwise buy in order to save up for that one item they *really* want. This just means that the price on that one item is set too low (automatically corrected via auction.) If looting rights to the Dain's head are worth saving up say 150 DKP or more, then it's certainly worth spending a whole lot more than 20. The problem is that there is no mechanism to take those excessive points away. Think EQ's platinum economy. One problem this can create is that they are able to build up essentially permanent loot rights over newer members. No, it's not fair if a new member beats out an old hand for uber_item01, but it's not fair either if that new member faces the prospect of never being able to close the gap between himself and that older member. No matter how active a newer member is, he will always be inferior to longer serving members, even only slightly longer serving members, if they maintain the same level of raid participation. The prosect of upward mobility is a tremendous incentive. The auction system would drain those extra DKP's from the system, while at the same time retaining the reward for active participation. People are already in essence auctioning for the best items by saving up to see who can get the most DKP's. Why not make them actually spend those points too? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/umorektherogue.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Morek the rogue</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(4/20/01 1:02:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=58>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Economic Theory</span><hr size=1> How would you go about giving points out to non-guilded members?

The whole purpose of DKP is to ensure those that participate the most get the items they want 1st.   Members don't attend every single raid to accumulate the most points just so they can lose out on an item to a over-zealous loot monger or be forced to spend more than they should.  They attend every raid so they can be guaranteed the item they want when it drops.  For example, the gnome illusion mask dropped in Sleepers for us.  Thott had around 160 DKP... the most DKP of any member by around +50.  Thott wants the mask.  It costs 1 DKP.  Looks like Thott will get the mask.  But wait! Another member wants the mask too... they have been in the guild 2 months and only have 30 DKP... but they are willing to spend ALL 30 on it for the mask! This would cause Thott to either a) lose the mask or b) spend 31 to get it.  There's no way this is ever going to be acceptable (in AL at least).  Thott wants the mask... Thott has the most DKP... thus Thott has earned and deserves the mask... without exception.  Our guild would not support a policy or system which allowed anything different from that.  <br>
<br>
IDKP is simple.  You get IDKP as compensation for your time at raids when there's no real &quot;loot&quot; or reason to give out DKP.  DKP is based entirely on loot... you can only receive DKP at an event where DKP was spent by a member.  So for example lets say we go to Zlandicar... and he drops 2 claws, gloves, heart, fraka, and zland talis.  Every twink has a claw that wants one so they both rot... no one in their right mind would pay DKP for the gloves so those are free... no one wants a heart that doesn't have one... no one has the faction to make shround from harla... and zland talis is a key to sleepers which is awarded free to a member.  The end result is that we just brought 30+ ppl to an event and no one spent any DKP.. thus no DKP can be give to those 30+ for attending.   This is a problem... and it started happening a LOT.  Also, there were some raids which no one wanted to go to but were needed to further the guild's cause... like Klandicar.  We needed sleeper's keys... but Kland doesn't drop any loot that would warrant DKP being spent... so there was low motivation for some members to attend an event that they would not be compensated for.  Thus, the birth of IDKP.  Failed raids where we kill nothing but learned something in the process... IDKP... exploration and testing of new zones as an entire guild... IDKP...  anything productive which didn't yield loot... IDKP.  <br>
<br>
When we run lottos, DKP + IDKP = Total points you get to enter a lotto with... and the original intent of the system still holds true:  Your loot, and how soon you get loot, is directly corrolated to how often you attend events.  <br>
<br>
EDIT: guests (i.e. potential members who have applied via email and have a sponsor), are added to the guild for /gu purposes at the start of raids.  They are often greeted with &quot;/gu Welcome gimp labor&quot; or &quot;/gu Hi fodder&quot;.  They receive DKP and IDKP just like any other player at a raid.  They are free to use that DKP to enter lottos and buy items.  However, non-dkp loot is not available to them... WW armor for example =&gt; guild only.... even if it's only going to a twink.  Sweat-shop workers must then /guildremove at the end of the night and thank us for all the DT's they took.   <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwendolynkeplegrobal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wendolyn KeplegrobAL</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendhead.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10> at: 4/20/01 6:08:53 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b> <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=891.topic&start=121&stop=133>7</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showPrevMessage?topicID=891.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showNextMessage?topicID=891.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=60><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.threadControl?topicID=891.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=891.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=891.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub114.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="legacyofsteel43089general">General Discussion<option value="legacyofsteel43089tradingpost">Trading Post<option value="legacyofsteel43089strategy">Private Discussion<option value="legacyofsteel43089prospectivemembers">Prospective Members<option value="legacyofsteel43089rantsandflames">Drama Hall<option value="legacyofsteel43089officersonly">Officer's Lounge<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm13">LOSERS<option value="legacyofsteel43089officialeventstrategies">F.Y.I.<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm17">Karl Malone Vs.
