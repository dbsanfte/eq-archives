I have to say I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when I read all of this because of how unbelievably similar the AL system is to the one I developed for Paradigm about 4 months ago.  <br>
<br>
For nearly two years Paradigm had been using a lotto system based simply on whether members were active or not, and whether an item was deemed 'meant for' their class, and was an upgrade, etc.  It was  very clean system and it served us well since pre-Velious most uber mobs were spawned often enough that the randomness of the lotto was countered by the fact that everyone was eventually getting what they needed.<br>
<br>
But then with Veeshan's Peak rare loots like Tronsmargs, and with Velious rare loots, /lotto just did not work so a change was necessary.<br>
<br>
I chilled over Christmas talking with my brother about it, and we developed a CP system for contest points similar to AL's DK stuff.  It had the same basic structure as AL's in that points (CPs) were awarded for uber kills, and the method for determining who got an item was that only those within 10 CPs of the person with the most CPs would enter the lotto for it.  The system has worked extremely well for us, but given its youth, it is now undergoing some growing pains, such as everyone's unease at the amassing of CPs by pointhogs.<br>
<br>
However, the rationales I used to defend the system were so verbatim to what Wendolyn used that I had to laugh, like when she said the thing about the system being a way to avoid having to tell newer members that, yeah, older members deserve the best loots before them. =)<br>
<br>
Cool of AL to come over and spend so much time sharing their system with others.  It looks like a great system, provided you have a guild where folks show good faith in their officers(otherwise the brawls about point values would be epic) and where you have officers who are willing to put the time to keep the spreadsheet going. <p>Retired Boss Mob<br>

My guild came up with a similar point system about a year ago.  Actually, it started out very dissimilar, but through the months we've discovered the exact same flaws and problems as DKP seems to have.  However, we've got it tuned to work fairly well, and to anyone who doubts the value of a point-based system, let me say this: We have FAR more arguments over non-pointed stuff (Like Lodizal) than we ever have with pointed loot. <br>
<br>
Another side-note, regarding rotting loot.  We let loot rot quite often, but we noticed a bad trend of people letting items that were obvious upgrades to what they had, rot, because the points didn't justify it.  For example, player A has a Tolan's BP.  A ranger BP drops in Hate 2nd level.  The ranger (only one there) declines to spend the points on it, since while it's an upgrade, it's not worth the points (They would be better spent at ToV on a Kael Ranger BP).  The ranger bp rotted in this case.  However, we             decided that sometimes rotting loot doesn't further the guild as a whole.  Thus, when a nodrop item would rot, now the Loot Officer dictates what happens to it (This unenviable job happens to be mine).  The Officer then has discretion to either outright give it to someone, let it go for a discount, or just let it rot.  If I had the ranger BP situation happen again, I would let the ranger claim the BP for half-points, assuming she gave the old Tolans back to the guild. <br>
<br>
The biggest problem we seem to have in our point system is the inter-class dynamics.  Namely, the high number of warriors and clerics, and the relatively low number of rangers paladins and SKs.  I mean, we have so many clerics we still have some who don't have Donals BP, but we have Tolans and DW bps going to twinks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon2.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uuggmopho.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uggmo Pho</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/23/01 10:14:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=104>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.san.rr.com/monkboy/CaliNorml.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DKNY</span><hr size=1> Specific Question:<br>
<br>
In one of the examples listed here you were comparing a person with 300+ DKP to a new member with 30 DKP with regard to purchasing a mask that cost 1 DKP. For the sake of this question can we assume the item is tradeable.<br>
<br>
My question is this. They guy with 300 DKP gets the pick because he's got the points and proved his time. So he buys the item and now he has 299 DKP or whatever.<br>
<br>
The next day, another mask drops. Does he get the pick again? Maybe he want one for twink, or to trade for an item. If he DOES get to pick again and continue to pick as long as his DKP are 5 more than the next person who wants it that seems a bit off but maybe I'm missing something.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the info.<br>

But how are the follow scenarios dealt with. Do they happen at all much.. Is this kind of thing frowned upon within your system..<br>
<br>
As members acquire points, there is surely a time where at some point a member has been approached by a non member who is seeking an item.. Eg. unguilded player x really wants his VS legs or something, and asks player y in your guild if he will spend his points on them on his behalf, then sell them to the player. So a person is basically spending his accrued points to auction on items in exchange for plat from the player he will hand them off to. How many plat would you suspect a point is worth? Given the fact items have different points, and theres almost certainly going to be disparity between point and plat value of items.. This brings up the next point.<br>
<br>
Along the same lines of thought, if items that no one wants go into the guild vault, is there ever times when people attempt to launder themselves points. As in they see something with low points in the vault they can buy, which they then take and sell/trade to their advantage for something worth more vault points when they turn it back into the vault. Net result the guild vault ends up with different items and the trader has done nothing but exploit the value of items vs the plat market value of items to further there own point tally.<br>
<br>
Similarly is there objections when say a caster pulls out a specifically tank class item from the vault, using their points specifically to trade it for a caster item for themselves.. <br>
<br>
Ultimately points are meant to be spent acquiring items from guild raids, but theres a lot of potential for them to be used in less direct ways.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I doubt its things believers in the system would try to do, but its interesting i think to consider how this kind of activity would be looked upon, should someone try to do it. <br>

We have a level 55 warrior actually secondary of a druid who has been saving up, he won vind bp, yelinak gloves, tov armor and some nice weapons all really quick as soon as he hit 55, he is a regular warrior on our raids now though. <br>
<br>
This works fine since everyone understands the rules and there is no such thing as twink in our system. No one bitches because its just what happens. We got another player who plays 2 comps, one cleric 60, and one monk 60. This person rolls on items for both, has full tov for monk and near full for cleric, he has rolled against me and won tov legs in past. Do i hold hard feelings? nope he earned em he has the points. <br>
<br>
The system works itself out if the points are distributed properly. Of course investing in one character will yield a more powerful character in the end.<br>
