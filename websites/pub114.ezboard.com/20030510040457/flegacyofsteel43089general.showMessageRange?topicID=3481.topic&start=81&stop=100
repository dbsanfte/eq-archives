The word &quot;karma&quot; comes to mind, yes it does, as I recall a certain rogue halfling going on about getting others &quot;Conquested&quot; way back when...<br>
After your rant there on your web page Mr. Tork, I must say you will be a complete embarrassment to yourself if you continue playing this game.  Your rant basically said &quot;Hi VI, I don't appreciate how you fuck me and my friends in the ass.&quot;<br>
But next month, when we find you and yours still playing, what it will really have said is &quot;Hi VI, I don't appreciate how you fuck me and my friends in the ass, but well, we are addicted to that ass fucking at this point, and can't seem to get enough, but hear us hopelessly scream and rant about it.&quot;<br>
Or maybe you can put your money where your mouth is and exhibit the class Itzlegend, Ketsui and Conquest showed when they followed their protests by actually quitting and moving on to a new game.<br>
My guess?<br>
KY Jelly around the horn a month from now.<br>
ps - keep the references to me on your web site going, please do.  nothing flatters more than knowing you are still verklempt six months after the fact. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/usepnir.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sepnir</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/29/02 3:35:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3481.topic&index=84>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://sepnir.homestead.com/files/image3.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: About VT, Your Suspensions, and VI's Ineptitude</span><hr size=1> LOL you'd think that they would learn after what they did to us.

&quot;Look at Conquest, half of em are still playing now.&quot;<br>

Errr no. Maybe 3 people are still playing but most of the guild still has a sick feeling in their stomache everytime they think about playing another sony/verant game.<br>

Actually, that's not quite true.

EQ has had a monopoly on a fairly unique idea for too long.  They can get away with leaving bugs in code and then blaming people for using them to an advantage even when there are no plans to fix them.  The Z-axis code has been fried probably since day 1, mobs can zone-warp through miles of rock, mobs can reach up their *arse* and pull YOU out at will.  The list of nonsense that exists ingame to prevent &quot;trivialization&quot; is truly nauseating and goes well beyond summoning, zone-warping, and z-axis flaws but they'll never be fixed.  God forbid, the developers would then actually have to create an encounter that isn't trivial to begin with rather than have the game engine compensate for their lack of skill.<br>
<br>
The EQ subscriber base is already starting to speak towards PoP with doubt.  Verant is obviously escalating the ever-increasing spiral of &quot;better gear, harder mobs&quot; even as player stats approach (or surpass) the 255 limits.  They've already admitted they have to make Druids into Clerics in order for players to have a chance at PoP.  This is truly absurd.  Customers will likely buy PoP with the EXPECTATION that most of what is on the box is an out-and-out lie, hoping that it will be fixed/finished &quot;eventually&quot;.  This is simply because the competition really isn't there yet -- Everquest is still, effectively, the &quot;only game in town&quot;.<br>
<br>
Those with the original &quot;vision&quot; of Everquest left.  If they would leave, what does that say for the state and future of the game?  The atrocity we see being done to LoS is just one small indication of the festering sores at the core of EQ CS.  Sores that the competition are WELL aware of and are learning from.  Historically, true competition promotes innovation and fairness.  Companies who accomodate their customers and treat them with respect flourish and those who don't fail.  Its that simple.  EQ won't go out in a blaze of glory -- it's subscriber base will gradually shrink as more and more products without brainless &quot;anti-trivialization&quot; code and &quot;rules&quot; (which change per GM) and with true customer *service* backing enter the marketplace.  <br>
<br>
EQ is the &quot;Pong&quot; of the MMORPG genre, and is rapidly earning the same fate.<br>
<br>
It is sad to see something as original as EQ founder because bureaucrats have crept in, ousted the artists, and turned responsibility over to individuals more interested in weilding their illusionary &quot;power&quot; than in the satisfaction and loyalty of their customers.<br>

Keep in mind seru was pulled to join useing many different exploits and killing a lot of the challanges that the fight offers. To my knowledge a GM watched it.

<br>
As far as the Gm`s are concerned...<br>
GM`s are required to reside in California ( i guess VI likes to keep an eye  on them) Guides are different. Most guides have pretty little to no experience within EQ and that shows over and over again. Have you ever looked at a Guide App? its a joke ...Gm`s are choosen within Verant.<br>
Most GM`s use quotes , old cases etc for comparison to punish  us or Guilds for reaching the High end games that they thought no one could reach. When EQ first came out the never thought people would reach 60 that qick.<br>
<br>
Your Guild and other High end raiding guilds are a mere drop in the bucket to the massive player base and why would they care? think about it....<br>
<br>
I allways think of Gm`s like that of a 18 year old rookie cop with a Gun. I bet that just gave him a raging hardon to throw a big word around like that.<br>
<br>
I dont know.....I hink the whole situation shows once again ..Verant does not care and never will about players or content of the game .Its alot easier to just shut us out than fixing something THEY know is wrong. Its easier to add grass and a new noobie mob in EC than fixing pathing  and game content. <br>
<br>
bend over and get lubed up..Verant is at it again .<br>

LoS, glad the suspensions are lifted, but am wondering what will happen in the future. I had bad flashbacks of the Conquest bannings on Lanys when I first read about this.<br>
<br>
<br>
Whatever GM gave you this trouble, needs to go <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> conk</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> their hollow-fucking-coconut on a black iron kettle somewhere.<br>
