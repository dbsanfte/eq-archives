It's net participation.  Look at Thott's Total Raid DKP Earned: 340.03.  Hobben is next in line at 309.5.  That has nothing to do with spending power... it's a DIRECT indication of how much effort they have put into the guild. The whole premise of our DKP system is to make sure that if you attend raids, night after night, you will get the loot you want.  An auction at lottos defeats that.  The ppl that are up in the 300's of DKP earned have been around since the beginning of AL... and they got that high because of continuted dedication to the guild for over 18 months, and have not slacked off.  You are right in saying that Thott's 30 DKP is &quot;worth&quot; no more than the 1st 30 DKP a new member earns.  What is different however, is that Thott (or anything else for that matter with high total earned raid DKP) continues to prove they deserves loot 1st.  You can view DKP as a seniority system in some regards I suppose... except you only keep your seniorty by actively participating.  You cannot slack off and expect to keep looting the items you want before everyone else... because the numbers will show the truth.  <br>
<br>
The main problem with allowing discretionary DKP spending on an item is that DKP, while it displays some economic trends, is not based on capitalism.  We don't WANT someone to be able to earn 30 DKP their 1st month with the guild (as a side note, I think hobben said that 96 DKP could be earned in the month of April by attending everything) and then, just because they REALLY want an item, go overboard and spend a ton on it...which drives up the price and forces the person who deserves it to spend more.  It just doesn't jive with how we want to see our loot distributed... that person doesn't deserve xyz brand-new uber item over Thott, Hobben, or anyone else who has been putting in just as much effort for the same 30 points they just earned.  History matters... you put in a ton of time with AL... and you deserve certain items before other ppl who came after you.  This is quantitatively shown by DKP.  Allowing auctions can defeat this principle.  Of course, those who spend their DKP on twinks become exceptions to this rule... because although they may have learned a lot of DKP, their total DKP available for spending doesn't necessarily afford them the luxury of taking items 1st.  <br>
<br>
All this doesn't mean an auction system wouldn't work for other guilds... it just means it will never be implemented in our own system. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/ucelandrospellsongtriton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Celandro Spellsong     Triton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/2/01 5:29:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=82>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: DKNY</span><hr size=1> Like I said its your system you can do whatever the hell you want <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
Your system is certainly not a pure capitalist system, I am merely arguing it would be more fair to everyone in the guild if it were that way. I am a very hard core capitalist and I love economic systems and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. <br>
<br>
A few systems (these are merely sample implementations, there are other equally &quot;fair&quot;):<br>
<br>
Pure socialism -  There would be a queue for items and each item would go to whoever is next in the queue, then that person would go to the bottom of the list.  Every person in the guild would get the same number of items and is fair in that respect. Every member of the guild is seen as equally valuable and deserving of loot.  Differences between different members participation are not taken into account.<br>
<br>
Pure capitalism - Basically what I advocate. Give points to all raid attenders based on time spent (1 hour = 1 point), possible bonuses for special efforts (coming up with a new strategy, etc). When items drop they are sold to the highest bidder.  Every hour a member spends is seen as equally valuable.  Items can be sold back to the guild for points, points lended to friends, points pooled among friends. Long term participation in the system is not taken into account other than the fact that long term members have had more time to allow points to accrue.<br>
<br>
Monarchy - *cough cough Harmonium*. Guild leader decides who gets each item when it drops. Guild leader gets first drops in all cases, then guild leaders friends, etc. Fair because the monarch is the person who keeps the guild together, leads the guild, etc. Without the monarch there would be no guild in the first place.<br>
<br>
Oligarchy - Same as monarchy but with the guild officers all equal, and non officers not equal.<br>
<br>
DKP - This is a form of oligarchy. Basically the larger the difference between what you put into the guild and what you take from the guild, the higher your rank in the guild. You gain rank when an item that someone else gets drops, you lose rank when you get an item. Highest rank who wants the item, gets the item when it drops. In order to keep at the highest ranks, you must obtain points faster than you use them. Hoarding of points is encouraged and the obtaining of middle end items is severely discouraged.  For best results in this system, put lots into the guild at the very start and take no loot no matter how good. Once you are on top, keep yourself there by only obtaining the very best items. Fair because those who have put the most into the guild for the least return have first dibs on items when they drop.<br>
<br>
Chaos: /random 1 1000. No overhead! Screw systems! People roll on items they would use. All non-no drop items go back to the guild upon winning of a new item. Long term is fair as everyone gets their items and the speed of item obtaining is proportional to time spent raiding. Does not take into account that some classes have more competition for items/less items that benifit them/etc. <br>
<br>
Anyhow this post could be a lot longer.. perhaps I will post again. Pros and cons of each method I leave as an exercise to the reader. Note that all methods are &quot;fair&quot; depending on your definition of the word. Does fair mean that all members get the same number of items over time? That they get the same number of items over time spent? That those who have been most dedicated to the guild get their pick of items? That noone has to waste time keeping up to date a stupid system? That essential classes get the best items since they affect overall guild power most?<br>
<br>
Most important thing is to have fun of course <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .

In Afterlife's DKP system, how do you handle determining DKP value for quest components with unknown rewards.  For instance when AL went to sky first time, or if AL were still on CoV, how would DKP be assigned to the Tears.  <br>
<br>
Or more generally, when you kill a mob for the first time and something never before seen drops, how do you assign a DKP value on the spot?<br>

I seem to have missed something.  You made an example in your first explaination post about a person with 5 dk points, one with 30 and one with 50 (similar numbers at least) but it was for an item worth 20 dk points. how was the person with only 5 dk points able to try and buy this item? im assuming you can dip into the negatives but that would scream abuse.  Also, is there a link to a typically used list of standard raids or specific mobs and there generally accepted point values?<br>

<br>
The points we use are not hard to figure out if you dig around a little bit on our website, but we don't have a nicely formatted table for everyone to read anymore.  We had that in the past... and another guild copied the whole page (word for word including the html format) and put it on their website.  /shrug.  If you are going to implement a system, IMO you need to think about what the points actually mean and how they corrolate to your guild size specifically.  Copying another guild's values might be less work, but what is &quot;generally accepted&quot; has no meaning from one guild to the next.  <br>
<br>
My only advice about a point system is.... do not think short term.  Plan ahead, and incorporate mechanisms for adjustment as EQ and your guild changes.  Something worth X today will not be worth X tomorrow when an upgrade for that slot is discovered. How are your guild members going to deal with that?  Change the point value? Retroactively for everyone who has X already? Or keep it the same and just make the new item Y worth 1 point more? Is the value of Y going to piss off the person who looted X yesterday?  What happens when X drops tomorrow, but ppl now don't want it because Y is better? Is X going to rot now? Will the guild get mad at members who don't want to loot X because those members are waiting for Y now?  But what about Z? I heard it's 5 times better than Y... should I wait for that instead?  If you were holding a gun, and I was 10 feet across from you, how many times would you pull the trigger right now?<br>
<br>
Yes... this crap will make your head spin, and for most it seems more like work than a game.  The answers are not easy ones and they are all guild specific.

How do you deal with the guys who have -5, -1, 0, 5 and 10 points, though.

<br>
Actually your *subtle* reference to me is a bit inaccurate while retaining some accuracy at the same time. Little known even Harmonium has become an Afterlife plagerizer with the introduction of the UMP (UberMe Points) system roughly 3 months ago.<br>
<br>
We have two key differences with the implementation of our system however. The big thing was that since Harmonium was formed about a month after the game came out we had alot of old old members who didnt want to start from scratch due to past investments, justifiably. That being said we initially started a prorating system to compensate for this which consisted of alot of record look ups and guesstimates in the mediary until everyone was happy.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we dont use the system like AL or Talisman do, its not a &quot;WalMart&quot; atmosphere for us. We implemented it as a simple numeric tool for myself and other officers to use in order to better determine where the loot goes. What that means is yes, as Celandro said, the iron fisted Joseph Stalin of a Gnome still reigns terror <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I think its a good system because it lets everyone know roughly where they stand and this allows us alot of give in terms of preventing &quot;misallocations&quot; of items. The other major thing you might find is that in a &quot;monarchy&quot; system as Celandro outlined there is really no reason to award Guild Leaders and officers moreso because the simple truth of the matter is that those people will acrew the most points due to their zealous attendance. A good siting for example is Hobben's or Thott's DKP rating are normally the highest for Afterlife because they attend every single raid or the vast majority. This gives them the most raw points and also the most used points, normally leaving them with a normal net.<br>
<br>
Good systems that really help to calm alot of fights that would normally have happened. I must give credit to Afterlife for the original conception of this idea and kudos to keeping so much of it public for so many guilds to use as a reference source to build their systems.<br>

Only ways to transfer no drop items are hacks or exploits. <p>Dwyer, 60 Rogue <p>

You kill the mob for the loot, and having the loot rot, even if it would be an upgrade for a member because of a silly system doesn't seem very fruitful to me.  As long as lootings are friendly I suppose the system is fine, when people start aruging or feel cheated then your system and guild are about to fall apart...  <p><center><img src="http://www.rubberrooms.net/rooms/karim/files/Zenias.jpg"></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub14.ezboard.com/uwendolynkeplegrobal.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wendolyn KeplegrobAL</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendhead.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/15/01 5:36:50 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=96>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.wired-cafe.com/images/wendside.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: No drop items dont need to rot...</span><hr size=1> Nodrop loot has been rotting for quite some time now.  Our guild doesn't seem to be falling apart... no one argues, if you don't want it, don't take it.  If a mob has nodrop loot that sucks or no one wants (read: Velk), then we just don't bother with that mob anymore.<br>

Deathbuu, not sure what server you are from but NFP is MM's auction zone. And yes the spam sucks.<br>
<br>
Emil you can only have 1 &quot;primary&quot; character in AL.  Primary characters get to lotto/loot over any secondary character, even if the primary char has 1 DKP and the secondary char has 100.  You can change your primary character as long as it meets the level requirements of joining AL, and once you make a switch there is generally no going back.<br>

<br>
Wow 2 posts responding to Baven in 1 day.. the world is coming to an end!<br>
<br>
The reference to Harmonium and by association Czar Baven (get it?) was meant mostly as an example of a system which works and is fair in its own way. Its pretty well established that the best economic system in the world is benevolant monarch.. I mean if god was running the world wouldnt that be best? Systems such as DKP, socialism, capitalism, etc all replace the benevolant monarch with some entity that makes a close approximation to god. In the case of DKP it would be the point system, in socialism it would be the queue, in capitalism it is the free market, etc. The other part was mostly a reference to the hostility all us old Povar guilds hold towards each other, even now that you have moved on to rule Xev with an iron fist :P.<br>
<br>
As for the system you describe, it is much like the one we are using now (horrors agreeing with you in 2 posts in a day). Merely a tool used by the oligarchy (officers) to help in the distribution of loot.  It works, its fair in its own way (just like every other system), but has its down sides.  And yes, DKP is a very close approximation to the old seniority based loot system so its a good fit with your guild.<br>

<br>
Yea, didnt want the &quot;WalMart of EQ&quot; forming overnight with purchasing items per se, but instead wanted to focus on more of a visual system of seniority.<br>
<br>
Frankly, officers and leaders see alot of things via numbers you dont see just from attending raids, which helps alot. Of course there are downsides and alot of maintenence involved, but I need something to do from work <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

SO its up to the person that it can upgrade to decide if they want to spend their points or not.  im not sure bout people in negative, but this is just my understanding of dkp.  If your saying if no one wants the item and you could use the upgrade but don't wanna spend the points, then thats unfair for others.  <br>
<br>
quick example<br>
mob X drops no_drop item woth 7 points for rogue<br>
rogue_001 has 75 points<br>
rogue_002 has 30 points<br>
rogue_003 has 5 points<br>
<br>
if rogue 1 and 2 don't want item, then rogue 3 can use his points to get item, else it rots... seems fair<br>
