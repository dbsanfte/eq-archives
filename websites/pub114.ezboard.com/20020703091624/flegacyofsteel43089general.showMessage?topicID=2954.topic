Bowled over. <br>
Dear Word Detective: What does the word &quot;overwhelm&quot; come from? Can you &quot;underwhelm&quot;? Can you &quot;whelm&quot;? -- Ken Rudkin, via the internet.<br>
Of course I can whelm. In fact, I'll have you know that I was captain of the whelming team in high school. We were an inspiring sight back then, clad in our conical fur hats and water wings, a dry-cell battery clutched in each hand, shod in shiny roller skates. The lads and I still get together every few years to hoist a few buffalo wings and compare arrest records. Once a whelmer, I say, always a whelmer. I still have my water wings.<br>
The gist of your question seems to be whether &quot;whelm&quot; is a real word in its own right, and the answer is yes, and a very old one at that. First recorded in English around 1300 A.D., &quot;whelm&quot; is probably rooted in the Old English word &quot;hwelman,&quot; meaning &quot;to overturn,&quot; &quot;to cover&quot; or &quot;to capsize,&quot; and is closely related to the obsolete English word &quot;whelve,&quot; which meant &quot;to cover over or to hide.&quot; Although the word &quot;whelm&quot; is rarely used by itself today, it can describe events both prosaic (as in preserving food by &quot;whelming&quot; -- covering it -- with an overturned bowl) and catastrophic (as in a village being &quot;whelmed&quot; by a flash flood).<br>
In the verb &quot;overwhelm,&quot; the &quot;over&quot; intensifies the action of &quot;whelm.&quot; When you are &quot;overwhelmed,&quot; you are completely covered, turned over and rendered helpless by something. &quot;Overwhelm&quot; first appeared in English around 1300, but the more figurative sense of &quot;drowning in work&quot; or &quot;overcome by circumstances&quot; first arose in the 16th century.<br>
The modern use of &quot;overwhelmed&quot; to mean &quot;very impressed&quot; led, in the mid-1950s, to the invention of its opposite, &quot;underwhelmed,&quot; meaning &quot;not impressed at all&quot; or &quot;not interested.&quot; &quot;Underwhelm&quot; is a perfectly respectable, and very useful, word. With so many people striving to overwhelm us with flashy folderol today, from the latest Hollywood blockbuster to fervent political crusades, being &quot;underwhelmed&quot; often seems the hallmark of sanity. <br>
