Do you think shooting someone 47 times is to much? I mean for god sakes  WHY DOES IT TAKE 7 COPS TO SHOOT A GUY? why did they shoot 6 times each? ( assuming that it was only 7 cops) If  the man has 7 cops pointing guns in his face why would he &quot;Try&quot; and pull out a gun? that doesn't make much sense that is murder simple and plan, and god will see each of those cops one day<br>

Just today I heard on the radio of a woman, having taken X (Ecstasy) and drinking booze, getting behind the wheel of a car and striking a man who was simply walking along the side of the road.  Half-trapped in and outside of the car's windshield, be begged her for mercy as the glass of the windshield held him from freeing himself.  She ignored the man, drove home and parked her car, with him still trapped, in her garage.  He lingered there for two whole days before he died of blood-loss and shock-trauma.<br>
Tell me again how people are always thinking clearly and would never put their lives or the lives of others in danger just because seven policemen are pointing loaded weapons at them.<br>
Simply put, it strikes me as common sense to do as the police tell you when in that situation.  Do you disagree?<br>

It was 1992, and &quot;Malcom X&quot;, had just been released in theaters and there was also a huge uproar about the hanging of &quot;rebel&quot; flags outside of fraternity houses.   My history class held about 300 students in an auditorium and this certain day, almost every black male was wearing a &quot;X&quot; shirt.  Racism came up in the lecture and a couple of &quot;X&quot; wearing guys shouted out some stuff about being discreminated.  <br>
    At this point my history professor stopped his lecture from the stage and said, &quot;everyone with an &quot;X&quot; shirt on, come up here for a bit.  Well about 30 black males made there way to the stage.  At this point my professor instructed them all to get in a line behind the podium, and each take a turn giving a 30 second synopsis of Malcolm X's life.  Well 30 black males sat down without saying a word, showing there true ignorance in not having a clue of what they &quot;so-called&quot; believed in.<br>
     THEN, at this point about 15-20 Kappa Alpha frat members shouted some stuff back at the black men, about being &quot;shown up&quot;.  SO, my professor then says, &quot;Aren't you the guys from that frat that keeps fighting with the college about hanging your rebel flags out for all to see?&quot;  So then he makes THEM get up and come to the podium for a 30 second synopsis of &quot;Southern Heritage&quot;.  As you would expect, 15-20 white males also showed there ignorance of not knowing a damn thing about what they &quot;so-called&quot; believed in.<br>
     Reading these posts is almost amusing in a way as a majority of peep's keep making posts as if they were experts in racial relationships, and were actually standing next to Rodney King years ago.   Please keep it up cause I am getting a kick out of all of these, LOL.<br>

I dont like saying there is an oppresive majority because i find it as shocking and revolting as you (Eomer) do.<br>
<br>
But all it takes is one look at the statistics that compare the average jail setence for blacks vs. whites that commit the same crimes.  The disproportionally large amount of blacks that are sent to front lines in combat vs the number of officers.  And compare that to the numbers for white soldiers.<br>
<br>
On average, you will serve 2x as long in jail, and are 10x as likely to recieve the death penalty for commiting the SAME CRIME if you are black vs if you were white.<br>
<br>
You are 10x times more likely to be victimized by the police.<br>
<br>
The numbers are widely publish. CNN/HEALTH just did an article that showed that doctors give less, and poorer health care to people of color.<br>
<br>
Ect ect.  <br>
All of the numbers are there.<br>
This example about the wrong doer going free in the king/oj trials is a very obvious example.<br>
You dont hear anyone bitching about those 3 white cops in NY that sodomized a man with a broken broom stick getting off scott free do ya?  Noooo.... everyone is perfectly happy with that.<br>
<br>
Im not saying its nearly impossible to succeed as a minority in america, far from it.  But to ignore that a problem exists is an invitation to let it get worse.  <br>
<br>
Racism and biggotry are like infections.  You cant just ignore it and hope it goes away, you have to take active, agressive steps to combat it.<br>

Also, I could give a fuck less about someone calling me a frog, a wop, or a polack (call me frogwopski). Racial slurs don't really bother me, hell, I like a good polish joke as much as anyone. Obviously, there are slurs that are a lot more offensive simply cause of the stigma attached to them (nigger is one, cause of all the wonderful things that have happened to black people with slavery and all that), but for the most part I think people over react a lot to names. I get a lot more pissed off when someone makes a sweeping generalization than someone saying some meaningless (there are some that do have lots of meaning, see above) cuss to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=2897.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showMessageRange?topicID=2897.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> <b>3</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showPrevMessage?topicID=2897.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showNextMessage?topicID=2897.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2897.topic&index=53><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"><a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.threadControl?topicID=2897.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/blueMoon/deleteThread.jpg border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2897.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2897.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub114.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="legacyofsteel43089general">General Discussion<option value="legacyofsteel43089tradingpost">Trading Post<option value="legacyofsteel43089strategy">Private Discussion<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm12">Strategy Hall<option value="legacyofsteel43089prospectivemembers">Prospective Members<option value="legacyofsteel43089rantsandflames">Drama Hall<option value="legacyofsteel43089officersonly">Officer's Lounge<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm13">LOSERS<option value="legacyofsteel43089officialeventstrategies">F.Y.I.<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm9">Velious Information<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm16">Luclin Information<option value="legacyofsteel43089frm17">Karl Malone Vs.
