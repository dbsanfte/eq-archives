Here we go:<br><br>1st of all, DKP (Dragon Kill Points as it was originally named back when all there was to do was Nag and Vox) was a loot system developed by the leaders of AL.  Basically, it was designed to assure that the people who are most deserving (defined as those who have participated the most) get the items they want, without having one or two ppl in the guild &quot;choosing&quot; who gets what. The primary focus of the system is to promote fairness while at the same time minimizing any doubts about partial decisions... because as we all know, there will certainly be a time you think you deserved some loot over someone else, and if a guild leader didn't choose you to get it, there WILL be some sort of hard feelings even if you never say anything and know you will eventually get the item.<br><br>That being said, DKP is awarded to each member who attends a given raid.  Each mob is assigned a point value and when the mob dies everyone who was at the raid receives points (usually anywhere from 0.1 to 2.0).  In addition, all loot is assigned a certain number of points by the officers. The value of an item usually follows certain rules:<br><br>Haste items are extremely high in points.<br>Weapons are usually higher points than armor.<br>No drop items cost less than items which can be traded.<br><br>So for example... a tradable weapon with 40% haste is gonna cost quite a bit.<br><br>After the loot is called in /gu, the officers lotto each item one by one and it goes like this:<br><br>Hobben tells the guild, 'Tell me for head'  (sorry hobb couldn't resist).<br><br>Hobben then receives tells from anyone who wanted, in this case, Dain's head.  Dain's head costs 20 DKP.  Hobben then looks at the total DKP for each person who sent him a /tell.  In the old days, a &quot;weighted&quot; /random would then occur.  Lets say I had 5 DKP, Denzalo had 20 DKP, and Thott had 50 DKP. A /random 1 75 would be rolled and 1-5 I would win, 6-25 Denz would win, and 26-75 Thott would win.  This was adjusted later because the guild felt the most &quot;deserving&quot; were losing many lottos... ppl with 20 DKP could lose to someone with 1 DKP based on luck.  We then introduced the Tier system, which has evolved today into a simple &quot;if you have 5 or more DKP than the closest person who is also in the lotto, you win automatically&quot;.  Meaning if Thott has 50 DKP, and Denz has 45, Thott wins with no roll.  However, if Thott has 50 DKP and Denz has 46 DKP, then there is a random 1 96 with Thott 1-50 and Denz 51-96. The winner then has the amount of points that was assigned to the item deducted from their total DKP.<br><br>That is the basic premise of the system.  There are some exceptions and rules.  Normally you cannot enter a lotto on an item if you don't have positive DKP.  This is to say &quot;you cannot win an item you have not earned through participation&quot;.  However, you may enter on a no drop item if you have negative DKP and want the item, but you will not win unless there is no one that is positive DKP in the lotto.  Hence the &quot;5 or more DKP&quot; rule does not apply to ppl in the negative.  Someone with -1 DKP will not be able to enter a lotto with someone who has 2 DKP for an item.  Furthermore, certain items will go to certain classes 1st regardless of DKP.  Any piercing weapon, rogues have 1st dibs.  Any low weight armor will usually go to monks 1st.  Etc.<br><br>The system works well... there is rarely any arguing over someone not getting an item they deserve.  Or a person getting a good item &quot;just because they wanted it&quot;.  You come to raids... you earn points... you spend the points.  Ideally, the number of points entering the system (total points given out to ppl at the raid) is INTENDED to equal the number of points leaving the system (people spending points on items).  However, this system is VERY much like a real economy... and eventually inflation occurred.  For example, Innoruuk was worth 1 DKP if you attended the raid.  Inno had a lot of nice items back in his time... necro focus... sunderfury... etc.  However as time went on, no one wanted those items, or everyone that did want them already had them.  So we had 30 people on the raid... each person getting 1.0 DKP... and sometimes NO DKP being spent at the raid on Inno's items... which then all rotted.  Some people are horrified at this...&quot;Items rotted?!! ARE YOU INSANE?&quot;.  But when you look at it objectively, they were items no one wanted anyway... items that would not benefit anyone to have over what they currently own.  So yes loot rots... and being the lootwhores we are... we pine a little bit over the waste, but we get over it.  The same thing eventually happens to ALL no drop loot. VP? Yes.  Dragon Claw Main Gouche... tons of them rot.  Exe Blade... rot. Even Zland claws today... rot. But like I said... those items are not missed.  They wouldn't be increasing the power of any one character over what they currently have.  And the system stays in tact... you receive what you earn and pay for.<br><br>Now, I will also share another flaw in the system.  Hoarding DKP.  You rack up DKP after DKP... you spend nothing.  An items drops that you might actually like... an item that would help you play your class better... improve your effectiveness.... but you don't take it.  Why? Because the DKP system has one important dynamic to it.  The cost of an item relative to your total DKP has no bearing on whether you will get that item.  What matters most is your current DKP total relative to another member's current DKP total who wants the same item you do.  Example: Lets say I have 50 DKP.  Dain's head costs 20 DKP.  Well pshit I should win that lotto easily I have 2.5 time the amount of DKP I need! Wrong.  Because Denzalo has 70 DKP, Hobben has 80 DKP, and Thott has 90 DKP.  I wouldn't see any head from Dain *chuckle* for about a month at the minimum.  This causes ppl to hoard points, and &quot;save up&quot; for that 1 item they really want... regardless of what else drops along the way.  Zland's hearts... gonna start sitting in the bank soon <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->            Manna robe + heart? Yum.  But that costs 20 DKP total... and xyz caster wants phara dar's robe which costs 22 (highest cost item in the game).  Heart sits in bank.  Yes tragic... but alas that is the price we pay for keeping things quantitatively fair.  <br><br>New members join AL with 0 DKP, and probably look at the points list of everyone above them thinking &quot;dear lord I am never going to get any loot&quot;.  But then you must remember... DKP totals are (generally) an indication of how much effort a person has put into the guild.  Does a new member really deserve loot before an older member who has contributed more time and energy? No.  And the point system is an easier way of saying that :P  Member seniority basically holds true, as long as that senior member has been participating at the same level they always have... which is another nice thing: you can't slack off as a senior member and still expect to get all the loot you want.  And slacking off is QUANTIFIABLEY noticable.  So if you are a new member, who is motivated and attends all raids, you WILL get loot.  Especially when hoarding occurs with people who have high amounts of points and never enter lottos for the &quot;mid level&quot; nice items.  New members can also see, &quot;hey... I'm the only wiz without a PoG or VP robe... I only have 2 DKP but it looks like I will get the next robe&quot;.  Yep... exactly.  So there is a nice balance of motivation and reward.<br><br>On to vault items and trade ins! As I am sure is the case with any large guild, there is a lot of loot which no one needs or takes.  It used to just sit in the vault.  And when members wanted to &quot;purchase&quot; an item, they paid the corresponding DKP value for it and they received the item.  Items that sit in the vault long enough (usually a couple weeks just to make sure no primary character wants it) can be bought for twinks if a member wants to.  Also, if find yourself with some items you no longer use, you can trade them in to the vault, and if someone else in the guild wants that item, you get as many points back and the person buying it spends.  Sometimes you won't get back as many points as you originally spent, because items depreciate. This usually happens a TON shortly after a new expansion. Example: Trak BPs cost 20 DKP back when they 1st came out.  Now, PoG BPs cost 4 DKP.  We couldn't justify 20 DKP for trak BPs still right now, so they have been lowered to 8 (remember Trak BPs are tradable... thus worth more and give you more options later than a no drop item would to receive points back).  However this is huge problem with no drop items... because once you spend points on a no drop item, you can never get those points back from a trade in.  Since we realized this problem occurs, no drop items have been scaled back somewhat in cost relative to other loot.  Of course there are exceptions... Azure Sky used to cost less than 22, then we saw the robe off Yel. Thx crap. Azure Sky then became more valuable/desirable because it's stats still make it the best robe in the game.  Furthermore, you pay for the &quot;newness&quot; factor of items.  When new rare loot drops, everyone who can use it says &quot;wow I want that&quot;.  So you end up paying points to be the one to &quot;have&quot; it.  Next month you might find something better, but when that no drop item which is replaced ends up in the bank, no one can say &quot;dammit what a waste&quot;.  Because it wasn't a waste... the item was bought and that person has less points to spend on the next item they want.  <br><br>The system is constantly evolving and changing.  Item prices are adjusted (but not retroactively for items that have already been bought) to reflect the new loot coming out in each expansion and zone.  Uber mobs become worth less points as they become easier and drop loot no one wants anymore.  And the cycle continues...<br><br>So that is our system... in all it's glory and darkness.  Many people laugh at it, but we've held together a strong guild since mid-December of 1999 using DKP.  Obviously it wouldn't work for a guild who is not used to points.  I like it... but I might be biased since I get to attend many raids and I have a lot of points.  People who can't attend many raids might end up complaining about the system, but like I said in the end it boils down to one thing: How much are you participating relative to another player.  The answer, which ends up being a single number, is usually very clear.<br><br>Let the arguments begin! /evades various FoH DKP-bashers...<br><br>EDIT: Tig an RSSS costs 8... When I got the pre-upgrade version (15 26 no stats) it cost 7.  But to give you an idea of depreciation... my 15 26 now sits in the bank forever.  And priceless Velium spears in Sleepers cost 0 DKP. I think I have over 50 points in no drop weapons and items that I just don't have the heart to destroy even though I will never use them again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's only points, err I mean time I could have spent in RL... :P Thx addiction.<br><br>EDIT2: Pecks receive no extra points for race. In fact we deduct DKP from any peck who is not wearing leather type boots or higher.

You guys have been kicking ass and taking names for ages -- who cares what anyone thinks.<br><br>It's funny because when the guild sees some AMAZINGLY AWESOME piece of loot that turns out to be ALL/ALL everyone gets excited and starts drooling.  At the same time the officers let out a collective sigh and head for the Tylenol.<br><br>Actually, in a way the all/all stuff is great.  The mass rot-fests of VP, Inny, CT etc. . .won't be so common.  It's also *motivation* for everyone to show up to raids.  But I could see how any class could argue why a Belt of Dorf Slaying would be the best for them.<br><br>Ultimately, I don't think there is any fool-proof system for awarding loot in a guild which does raid after raid, nightly.

It might make sense to drop the price so that an RSSS won't rot next time, but in order to keep some amount of integrity and fairness to the system it will most likely just rot.  Twinks that have VP keys but no sleepers keys might decide to pay and loot it... however I see most VP weapons as novelty now and unless it costs 1 or 2 points it's prolly gonna poof on the corpse.

We decided to go to a system like DKP.  I basically used your rules and made a few adjustments here and there... also went through the past histories of your members to get some starting points values.<br><br>First, I want to commend your officers on the system.  I think it's really great.  Loot on Tunare in the old days (5 weeks ago, hehehe) was done by the raid leader in a loot council.  It was a big pain in the arse as there would be a lot of upset people all the time.<br><br>The biggest problem I've seen is the unwillingness of people to let things rot.   They may not want to pay even a single point for an item, but if you give it to them for free then they end up using it.  There is this big stigma to letting somethign rot right now so if we dont' give it away for free then people are shocked, and if I do I feel we have created a system that is abusable.  We have one SK for example.  He could concievably get every SK item for free just by insisting that he doesn't want to pay for it.<br><br>We've also done a couple of Western Wastes raids and people dont' want to pay anything for anythign that isn't at Peerless or Matchless.  Even though some of the Worked stuff is worth tons on the open market, and would be big upgrades for people.  I don't want to let stuff like that go for free because then there are people that have 3 twinks that love those sorts of items and then there are folks that have no twinks and would never take it.  I don't even know what to do w/ it.<br><br>Our guild vault already has a lot of high end items....

If a ranger item dropped and he didn't want to pay for it... it would rot.  People would prolly frown at him for it but it's his decision.  We all respect the fact that you earn every point and as a result you earn the right to spend those points however you want.<br><br>As for WW loot, anything that is not matchless is not DKP.  I think like 1 matchless item has dropped... a mask I think and it was 0.5 DKP just cuz it was &quot;the best&quot; if for no other reason.  All the WW loot goes to our twinks now basically.  I think some ppl just created characters so they could outfit a twink in full WW armor, except for the breastplates.  They cost 1 for worked, 2 for reinforced, 3 or for heavy I think.  We haven't gotten peerless or matchless BPs yet but I think they will cost anywhere between 5 and 8.<br><br>We have a trade forum on our board which ppl use to sell and buy items on Mith Marr.  Among those threads is a post from Hobben which lists all the guild items we have for sale... various Trak BPs and VS legs... old cazic nag vox loot... etc.  People contact him via email and purchase what they want.  Prices are not listed, since they are subject to market changes.  Hobb has easily over 1 Million plat in his bank right now...he basically holds the guild vault but I swear he skims off the top!  Guess we are just saving up for a rainy day... who knows.  At any rate, that's what happens to most of our high end excess loot that no guild members want. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub78.ezboard.com/ufaelagund.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faelagund</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#ffffff>(2/20/01 10:49:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=891.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/j_koutoulas/fael_face.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Issues...</span><hr size=1> DKP really makes a lot of sense and seems like a great way of showing in writing why people deserve stuff and seems like it does a good job of keeping people who are already decked out active.
