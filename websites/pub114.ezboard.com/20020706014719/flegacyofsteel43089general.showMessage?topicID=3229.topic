Because the game is completely and utterly non-linear outside of the quests (which you don't have to do if you do not want to), each individual experiences the game differently.<br><br>I for one took the route of a wood elven thief.  Around level sixteen or so I found my way to an island to the very far north, a place I had never been before.  The sky was overcast and run down shacks made up most of what could hardly be called a village.  The locals were mostly fishermen and house wives and in the way of services there were almost none existant.  No blacksmiths to mend my armor should I stay and adventure upon the remote island and no apothecary should I need one to tend to a disease or curse of sorts.<br><br>I probably should have taken that for a sign and just turned around and found somewhere else a bit more hospitable for a young thief that was looking for a new dagger as the older glass ones were losing their edge and not very effective against foes that I faced nowadays.  But after casting the Marker spell that would allow me to teleport back to the village inn when I needed to I was feeling both carefree and ready to take on whatever came my way.<br><br>As a thief I had initially started out sticking mostly to the light armors like chitin or leather but I had given into an impulse when an opportunity presented itself to have some glass armor 'fall' into my lap so I was now looking like more of a warrior than a thief.  The green transparent armor covered my head, chest, shoulders, forearms and feet, as a pair of greaves hadn't been found when I had quietly sacked a blacksmiths supply closet.  For weapons I kept three glass daggers on me at all times as they tended to deteriorate rather quickly.  One was fairly run of the mill and had no magical enchantments while the another had the effect of ice shards and the other of paralyzing those foes that were not very magically resistant.<br><br>So before I bore you further with my past exploits, let me continue on with my story.  The dwarven ruins caught my interests when the natives told me of the islands most prominent landmark and I proceeded to head towards the long abandoned structures.  With a brisk pace I set off towards my chosen destination, pondering upon what dwarven artifacts I might discover within the confines.  I had twice before ventured deep below the surface into the strangely modern cities that the dwarfs had constructed more than a millenia ago and had disappeared from since.  I felt fairly prepared to deal with the tinkered contraptions that still roamed the halls, powered by some central power source remotely as my studies had found through the various books I had discovered.<br><br>The path that had at first headed straight towards the dwarven ruins now deviated northward as imposing cliffs blocked the way and I hoped that a way could be found through in short time.  Within a few short minutes I spotted a doorway, partially concealed by several budding mushrooms.  For those of you who aren't familiar with this variety of fungi, the mushrooms grow to be about sixty or seventy feet high.  A script was scrawled on the doorway in a language unknown to me but I hardly paused to question whether this was indeed the right way.<br><br>Torches were lit and spaced evenly through the narrow hallways, the sides of which had been expertly hewn from the living stone, leaving no crevices for moisture to find its way in and cause it to crumble and eventually collapse.  Dwarven work I thought.  Doubt still seemed to elude me as I walked down the steps.  The first door of aged wood was locked, but I didn't even bother to pull out my journeyman lockpicks.  The mechanism was simple enough for a little magic to do its work.  Pulling out my Talisman of Opening, that is what the shady merchant had called it when I had inquired about such devices, and placed it over the metal box that served as lock.  I had expected the usual screech of rusted metal sliding slowly home, but instead there was nothing more than a quiet *click*, as it opened.<br><br>I pulled the heavy iron handle and the door opened on wooden hinges.  Those instincts that had all but abandoned me for my uncaring nature earlier returned quite quickly as I surveyed the tunnels ahead.  More torches, and clearnly swept.  Recently too.<br><br>I heard her footsteps before I caught sight of the tall high elven woman who appeared down the hallway to my left.  Her robes of gray seemed plain enough, if not a little dirty around the collar.  While words were still forming in my mouth I stopped myself suddenly.  No shadow was cast on the far wall where the torch light should have placed it, easily visible.  <br><br>A vampire was about the last thing I expected, recalling my first days upon arriving in this land and hearing the folks talk about them as though they not only existed but had their own small society spread over vast land of Morrowind.<br><br>While I had been told that any weapon would work I felt for the silver dagger I always kept in my boot leg.  With a grimace I remembered losing it in a game of chance the night before when I had indulged in more brandy than I had cared to remember until I had to pay the tab the morning after.  I guess I would have to see if they were vulnerable to regular weapons.  Even as her head turned and a gaze that showed the complete absence of a soul caught mine beneath my solid glass mask I had propelled myself forward and closing quickly with a vicious decision to go for the throat.  <br><br>Where I was fast, she was like a flash of light.  Bearing her teeth and drawing short axe from its harness she caught my initial attack with the handle.  She shot out with her free hand, with finger nails like claws tearing through my outer shirt like wet paper and only being stopped by the glass curiass beneath to my great relief.  I slamed my shield against the vampires head and she staggered backwards, her horrid mouth of sharp teeth turned from eagerness to feed to that of a grimace of pain.  Flows of magic flew out from her hands as she fell backwards and with the axe out of harms way I turned my glass dagger of paralysis towards my quarry once more.  The flows of magic blew past my head even as my blade found home.  I pushed down and hard, and then severed the head with the thin edge of my shield.<br><br>------------<br><br>Yes I was a bit wordy but not very far from the truth (of the game).  I proceeded to continue through the dungeon killing about eight-nine vampires total.  After which I found my strength and endurance were almost completely gone and retrieving a very nice ebony short sword from the corpse of the head mistress vampire I triggered my ride home with an amulet and sold some of what I had found.  With no healers or apothecaries around I found myself a bed beneath the villages main trader's house and decided to rest until I was fully healed.  Usually this might only take nine-ten hours tops...this time I slept for ninety hours.  <br><br>I knew something was wrong then but it was confirmed when I headed up the ladder to the main store room.  I was immediately jumped by the store owner and his guard.  For once I hadn't actually stolen anything from this guy so I was a little surprised.  Changing to third person however answered my question.<br><br>Apparently in my series of fights killing the vampires one or more had gotten lucky...and I was one of them now.  No joke.  This just blew me away that in this game they could implement such things as this and doing subsequent research about it I've found that indeed it was something found in other games by Bethesda (who made Morrowind).  So now most npc's hate me, but I can suck blood for hp, have to avoid day-time, and have some seriously boosted stats.<br><br>All in the day of........Morrowind.<br><br>*bows and falls off the soap box Zyphria had been standing on*<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/ufalhiem.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Falhiem</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/13/02 1:34:51 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3229.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morrowind Moment...</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/jeffk/tomorrowind/">www.somethingawful.com/je...morrowind/</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> <p><center>Falhiem<br>60 enchanter<br><a href="http://www.y2khai.com/khai06.html">Like WOW</a></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/uwtfwtfwtf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Wtf Wtf Wtf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 98<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/13/02 5:24:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3229.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://sux0r.jeeran.com/friend.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Morrowind Moment...</span><hr size=1> Why does Jeffk's cyclops have two eyes <p><img src="http://sux0r.jeeran.com/llamawalk.gif" border="0"><br><B>ICQ:151730117</B></br>Don't touch my Llamma plz</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/uboggiessz.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BoggiesSZ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#ffffff>(5/13/02 8:42:48 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3229.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Oldschool</span><hr size=1> I swear to god I did the EXACT same thing in Daggerfall back in the day, only instead of getting an ebony shortsword at the end, I got fangs or something to prove its death.
