<br>
First of all, I don't think that GM would know what a z-axis exploit was if it bit him in the ass. As a matter of fact, I don't think he even knows what z-axis means. He was obviously parroting some imbecile sitting behind him barking orders.<br>
<br>
Let me just say, the precedent you used of Dain is right on, and let me add, did we ever see ONE suspension from people gimping Vulak? OH YES, VULAK. Remember him? Skipping content didn't seem to be a problem in those days. As a matter of fact, I DO believe a massive, huge stink was made because people had found a way to gank Vulak without killing all of his stopgaps. Suspensions? Zero. Number of times any person playing EQ has been suspended for pulling the Dain down the well and effectively reducing his ability to knock a player out of combat to nil? Zero. Warping out Vindicator, Statue of Zek, Idol of Zek; suspensions? Zero. Splitting Tormax from his guards and managing to nullify his call to help, resulting in a solo pull; suspensions? Zero. Do I need to go on about what a completely idiotic move this was?<br>
<br>
It's no secret that VT is bugged. Warders get bugged even after you clear ALL the mobs that are required to depop said warders. This becomes increasingly HORRIFYING as the stability of the zone deteriorates due to never being reset via the now non-existant patches. If that zone is up for longer than a week, something happens with server load issues (read: a memory leak or some nerdspeak type thing) causing spawns to go bonkers. See our latest one hour and forty minute kill of a twenty-five minute kill mob. The mobs hit points increased TEN FOLD. I guess my entire guild should be banned for this gem: <a href="http://fohguild.org/news/WardersOMG.jpg">http://fohguild.org/news/WardersOMG.jpg</a>. Gee, I wonder how the fuck anything in that picture happened? Wanna know how? YOUR ZONE IS FUCKED UP AND WE HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU AS MUCH FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS. <br>

To: Waters, Rich<br>
Subject: Vex Thal Progress Notes<br>
<br>
<br>
Hello Rich,<br>
<br>
Took a stab at Vex Thal last night (Saturday) and<br>
gathered some information that may be of some use to<br>
you and the team.<br>
<br>
Pathing:<br>
<br>
Pathing appears to be decent. We pulled and killed<br>
maybe two dozen mobs to the left courtyard before the<br>
palace and there was nothing odd about their pathing<br>
movements. We pulled from inside the palace as well<br>
and those mobs pathed out fairly effortlessly. We have<br>
yet to check out the pathing deeper inside.<br>
<br>
MOB AI/Abilities/Behavior:<br>
<br>
We killed a pretty good variety of mobs. Having some<br>
of them Dazzle/Glamour/Raptureable is nice and gives<br>
the enchanters something to do. The resistances on the<br>
mobs seemed to be about average. The AC/Mitigation on<br>
mobs was average to low. The abilities some of them<br>
have are fun. The Mark of Darkness is a real nice<br>
touch, though it would have been nicer to see that<br>
effect on some uber mobs outside of VT. A note here,<br>
it seems a bit unreasonable for yard trash to be<br>
processing Black Winds (1500pt dd, 180 mana tap AOE).<br>
I understand the range is low but this is a targetted<br>
AOE and when you get a few mobs piled into one pull<br>
that arent messable, it puts down entire raids fast.<br>
Faster than is reasonable in my opinion. I would<br>
suggest saving that for the Ubers in the zone and<br>
perhaps giving them something a BIT more manageable. <br>
<br>
Miscellaneous:<br>
<br>
First, the Palace Key is no rent. I understand this is<br>
by design, but then it makes no sense that the key<br>
dropping mob respawns in 50 minutes. No-rent is fine,<br>
if you don't leave a key corpse it requires you to<br>
actually have to kill the Key Dropping mob everytime<br>
to have access to the palace but the key dropper spawn<br>
rate needs to be adjusted. Perhaps to a 24/48/72 hour<br>
spawn.<br>
<br>
Now, I estimate that there are some 400 mobs in that<br>
place, if not more. Combine that with the Centiens and<br>
their splitting ability and other things unknown to me<br>
at this time and you may end up with 800-1000 mobs in<br>
one zone. That is a LOT. This causes some problems.<br>
The respawn time on these mobs is 50 minutes as far as<br>
I can tell, combined with the fact that mundanes do<br>
not drop any loot/plat and you have a VERY low ratio<br>
of mobs:loot. This is fine for the first time you<br>
clear the zone, but after that, it just becomes a<br>
massive annoyance/headache. Annoyance causes people to<br>
look for workarounds to skip the 'middle man.' CoH<br>
works in the zone, as does Conjuring Corpses - put<br>
Conjure at zone in only and remove CoH is my advice. I<br>
personally think the respawn on mundane mobs should be<br>
much longer, upwards of 6 hours. I also think mundanes<br>
should drop some form of loot a la Planes or Sleeper's<br>
Tomb (more on this later).<br>
<br>
Zone geometry is buggy.<br>
<a href="http://fohguild.org/news/VTBOSS.jpg">http://fohguild.org/news/VTBOSS.jpg</a>. If you really<br>
wanted to, you could get anywhere. If you have<br>
questions on this stuff, please feel free to ask. My<br>
suggestion would be to immediately put traps UNDER the<br>
palace. Warders/Wave of Death mobs/etc... I know<br>
fixing Geometry ain't easy, but it's just super easy<br>
to get around in VT.<br>
<br>
Loot/Itemization:<br>
<br>
I don't have enough information to tell you if the<br>
loot sucks or is too good or just right. I do have<br>
some suggestions, though, that could be helpful. Why<br>
not take the incredible number of mundane mobs in the<br>
zone and put END GAME class armors on them? Up their<br>
respawn time to cut down on farming, make it fairly<br>
rare, and give the people that worked their asses off<br>
to get their keys a reward for at least getting to the<br>
zone. As I said before the MoB:Loot ratio is extremely<br>
low at the moment. It would be a good way to use the<br>
high number of mobs in the zone to the benefit of the<br>
player. It would help the crawl NOT be unreasonable,<br>
boring, and tedious. It would allow you to reward<br>
players in the end game with complete sets of armor so<br>
they don't all look like patchwork hack jobs and when<br>
they step out of VT, others looking at them would be<br>
able to see what it means to be 'that guy.' It would<br>
create the upward progression you so badly need to<br>
allow making PoP end game hard for those that do not<br>
have VT loot (i.e. content skippers). This creates the<br>
funnel you need.<br>
<br>
Anyways, this has been a long ramble of an e-mail.<br>
I'll try and send you more information as it comes to<br>
me. <br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
<br>
Alex  <br>

See the date on that e-mail? Yea.... guess what? It took me all of ONE trip to VT to nail that fucker down and call for fixes - FIVE MONTHS AGO. FIVE. See that picture of us that I sent to Rich. Yes, the one of me standing BEHIND Mini-Aten? Taken the first day we had a force enter VT. Mind you, all of this information was sent to VI. They have known about any and all problems with the zone for months and you know what they've done to remedy said problems? JACK SHIT. <br>
<br>
With the current state of VT, the total lack of any retooling, and the requirements to get into the zone in the first place, a zone that was kept locked and unuseable for nearly 6 months; the boss mobs in VT should be LINED UP AT THE FUCKING ZONE AND COME AT YOU ONE BY ONE LIKE PEZ FROM A FUCKING TWEETY BIRD DISPENSER WHILE TRASH MOBS WITH ONE HIT POINT SWARM UPON YOUR RAID PARTY DROPPING VULAK LOOT AND ANCIENT SPELLS TO KEEP YOU FROM REALIZING JUST HOW MUCH FUCKING TIME YOU WASTED PLAYING THIS GAME. <br>
<br>
For once in your miserable lives admit you made a mistake and fix the wrong doings of this moronic GM and whatever dumbass that had his hand up the GM's ass playing the puppeteer. You've wasted MORE time than any company should legally be allowed to waste of their customer's time. Grow some balls and apologize.<br>
<br>
Let me pull a quote from a former developer to end this post: &quot;In a lot of ways, Luclin was the &quot;Fuck if it works, it LOOKS good&quot; expansion,&quot; Your own people were so fed up with the hack job being laid out that they up and left on their own accord. What does that tell you about your company? You fuckers have burned so many bridges that you're now sitting on an island and using a row boat to get provisions.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/uabru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Abru</A> at: 8/28/02 2:12:25 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#212141><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/ufurorplanedefiler.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Furor Planedefiler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#ffffff>(8/28/02 1:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3481.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> RE: Links</span><hr size=1> Whoever moderates the board please fix my pic links.

While thats basically true, I'd like to see Ford or Chevy try something like that, give up on a product completely and focus only on next year's lineup.  <br>

Maybe if you all did, then they would up the amount of loot drops... :P<br>

The whole POINT Of this game is reward for effort, people who start the game see level 60's who have put effort in get rewarded and want to do the same... Sigh<br>

So, you all spent how many months in boring camps collecting Shards, Bane weapons, Ores, Emp keys, and we all get rewarded by Melee clerics;) cool!<br>

All their most intelligent compitent prospects for guides and GMs have been getting abused since day 1 because no one will listen to them. The number of arguments our officers have had with GMs because our main 'competition guild' has made petitions about spawns or races and the GMs honestly had no clue how the encounters worked is laughable ... it's beyond laughable it's innane. (eg. race to cursed, dispute over who killed which taskmasters, GM states that since we killed the rhags we get the spawn) (we didn't kill the rhags)<br>

A few reasons. Firstly, when I petitioned one of the Super Smart Verant GMs about bugged warders, their response was that they cannot respawn or mess with the spawn of any warders after the Sleeper had been released. OK!? <br>

That quote not being in direct relation to Legacy's dilemna, certainly goes to show u the ignorance and lack of knowledge GM's/Guides display.<br>

In so many ways Verant is like say.....Philip Morris inc.  ....knowing the clientele they provide are addicted, and because of that.....what would normaly seem destructive to the companies best interests, really isn't.<br>

If you crouch on a Gflux it will sometimes put you through the floor.  Also horse aggro is fucked.  Regardless, shadow came down on us, and not being prepared she wiped us.<br>
We did get her to 80% for a surprise attack on us.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying this strat, tactic, whatever is right or wrong.<br>
<br>
but....<br>
Knowing GM's don't always see things correctly.  <br>
We opted to never do it again.<br>
<br>
Reading through the tirade on the LoS mainboard I failed to see if shadow warped down due to a gflux from blob bob or if you dueled a player and gfluxed them.<br>

As for the GMs and high level characters: as a former GM of UO I can tell you that most GMs do not even play the games at all, or very sparsely. Most are college age and are just doing it for the money.<br>
