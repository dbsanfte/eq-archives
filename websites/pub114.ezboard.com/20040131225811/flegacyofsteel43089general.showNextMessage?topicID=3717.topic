<br>
As a monk my epics very much in the same position as yours, as well as the warriors...becoming obsolete.  Sure mine is still in a pretty decent slot, and can remain their even with better weapons, but the effect of the epic, like yours, is a very class defining one and they slapped our epic effect on a less powerful version of the elemental armor and expect us to wear it.<br>
<br>
Lets consider this idea, that of a new epic quest in PoP.  Except what the end result is, is not a new item, but the absorbtion of the origonal epic into your characters innate abilities.  That is, every hp/ac/stat that you would normally get from wearing the epic, is instantly applied to your character permanently and the item dissapears.  Also what gets applied is a modified version of the effect.  <br>
<br>
Bards would get the song boost as an innate always on skill, Monks would get a modified version of Celestial Tranquility, say the atk bonus, the ac, and for the haste, well, either it would be changed to a permanent max-haste(41%) innate haste that would act like an item haste(That is no need to wear an item haste, and wearing one would not have any increased effect) or convert the effect to an ability button just like normal special attacks.  Warriors would absorb the stats as well as obtaining a permanent taunting proc on every weapon he wields, similar to the effect of a draconic rage potion(cept on all the time).  This would be in addition to his current weapons proc if any.  Rogues, the usual increase in atk that goes with the weapon, and the inate haste, similar to the monks, maybe toned down a little since the haste is more monkly defining...since most uber rogues dont use RB anymore anyway, it could maybe be changed to a gaping wound kinda proc dot like without the aggro. <br>
<br>
Where are the casters in all this? Well, im sure they could get similar 'upgrades' but without trying to insult pure casters, im not so sure they really need it. <br>
<br>
Lets look at the facts.  Necros are soloing Lodizel.  Necros are also soloing the sebilite protector.  Chanters can charm very powerful mobs, Mages have very powerful pets on par with equivilant warrior levels as well as powerful nukes.  Wizards...well they may still be a little screwed in this respect...sure the manaburn nerf isnt as hard as they make it sound but they can still do some impressive shit in a quick amount of time.  Beastlords and pets are putting out amazing damage.  Even clerics can stun,nuke to a decent degree.  Bottom line is after level 60, the meele classes are nowhere near balanced with the pure caster classes.  Im not asking for a nerf.  I will repeat myself.  I DO NOT want anyone to be nerfed.  But the pure meele classes, while appriciative of the uber weapons in each new expansion, are simply not balanced against pure casters.  They need to stop trying to balance us with items.  Unless they intend to go back to upgrade every pure meele item in the main game and in every expansion, the sudden leap to items having 155 hps and awesome stats on them is only helping to close the gap to the uberguilds who can get them.  <br>
<br>
For the meele classes to be really balanced, they would have to raise the stats on the high end PoP stuff up to more like 250-300hps on armor pieces and then go back and upgrade alot of the stuff that was uber several expansions ago.  <br>
<br>
Would applying the stats on everyones epic to themselves permanently (with a lot of hard work) really be overpowering?  (limit one guys...i can see everyone doing their epic 20 times already if that wasnt mentioned).<br>

<br>
the monk epic goes in the HANDS slot, not in a weapon slot. losing 25 hp and some stats because you cant equip a 125 hp item with better stats in the hands is nothing compared to having to equip a 16/26 ratio weapon with an outdated effect when you could be using a 17/19 one with a useful effect.<br>
<br>
Personally I support the solution of having the epic useable in the ranged slot because I dont think being chained to a 100 hp and other stats ranged item is nearly as bad as having it chained to a weapon slot. I can live with missing 60 hp and some stamina when CT hits tier 4, but when bard weapons keep scaling up, having to use a 16/26 ratio item in the offhand when there are 20/19 ones (look at the ulak for monks off xegony) available hurts.<br>

<br>
The idea i proposed in the first post is filling a need that i think verant is still missing out on.  That of basic character advancement that's not item based.  Permanent innate abilities that make us really feel like our character has improved.  the hitpoints we get or ac/atk we get from skills is only marginally important compared to the equipment that is needed to make us good, great, or uber.  Its an equipment based game, and always has been.  Letting us do something more permanent and non-item related would reduce this somewhat.  Id love to have some use for my unused skill points for instance.  Thats a permanent part of my character thats not getting any use.<br>

The ornate gloves have crap stats and the effect sucks now.<br>
<br>
The monk epic situation however is different from the bard.  Monks have been using their epic 3 expansions later because with the exception of a couple items (VT glove, elemental glove), there has been NO glove with enough boost in stats to warrent the outright replacement of our epic...read: the stats on potential upgrades sucked ass in comparison.  POP, however, forced us to look for changes as almost no atk buffing spells in POP stack with our epic and soloing was no longer an option.<br>
<br>
The bard epic, however, is used 3 expansions later primarily for the intrument modifier.  VI -has- offered a few bones, but for whatever reason nerfed them to be sub epic (the VT drum modifier item is a good example).  They're a slave to their epic not because of stats, but because the epic is required to do their job efficiently.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, F bards and pulling.  It's a monk job.  Go play your banjo.  Those javelins only use is for pulling.  In any fight in the game requiring ranged attacks, monks basically sit on their butts unless they have a dusty sorez pouch handy (or they joust on their horse like me heheh).

<br>
you totally ignore the fact that being chained to a HANDS slot item (and a damn good one at that) is totally different from being forced to equip a shitty ratio weapon from 3 expansions ago.<br>
<br>
being forced to equip a glove slot with 100 hp instead of 125 or 150 (in PoP) and other good stats makes you lose a few hp and stats. being forced to equip a 16/26 ratio weapon as opposed to a 17/20 or 17/19 one costs you a lot of DPS, especially considering that bards dont get double attack so the offhand is more signifigant.<br>
<br>
Think about it this way-- the monk epic makes your fists 9/16 weapons, right? what if the monk epic was a 9/16 weapon that had an effect that made it so you HAD to have it equipped in the offhand to do your job correctly-- in essence drastically reducing monk DPS. Monks would be bitching up a storm, and it would have been changed long ago. The only reason the bard epic wasnt changed by now is that bards make up less than 5% of EQ players, so the dev team can ignore us without stirring up controversy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/blegacyofsteel43089.showUserPublicProfile?gid=azithevertoon>Azith Evertoon</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/12/03 7:39 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3716.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> First, im not trying to make this a monk vs bard post.

So please stop treating me like im trying to compare the two or get you nerfed.  <br>
<br>
Next, <br>
<br>
&quot;Think about it this way-- the monk epic makes your fists 9/16 weapons, right? what if the monk epic was a 9/16 weapon that had an effect that made it so you HAD to have it equipped in the offhand to do your job correctly-- in essence drastically reducing monk DPS. Monks would be bitching up a storm, and it would have been changed long ago. &quot;<br>
<br>
     I do want to explain to you something you may have missed.  Monk bare fists at level 65 are 15/20 weapons.  Better ratio then the epic effect.  This means monks wanting a better ratio fist would have to remove the epic.  Again, Im not trying to compare this disadvantage to your bard epic, Im simply saying that yes we have similar limitations.  <br>
<br>
     Im not going to pretend this disadvantage is a serious problem because we usually have better weapons then the 15/20...but its not a certainty of course.  There are lots of monks out their that arent uber enough to do any better.  My point is that the need for the bards epic effect can be just as important to you, as it would be for a 65th monk without better weapons using the monk epic effect.  Remember the monks fists are song haste, not item haste.  A 65th monk would have the same decision to make as you do, either go for the 15/20 fists without haste, without atk/ac buff as well as losing the stats on the epic. Or keep the lower dam/dly ratio 9/16 and get the haste buff and stats.  Haste to a monk after all, is just as important as song boosts are to your bard.  Im not trying to belittle your desire for change.  Just trying to find a way that everyone can benefit from.  <br>
<br>
BTW, yes monks bitched up a storm about this too, especially at the beginning of PoP where 65th fists were 18 21, not 15 20 (they were nerfed again).  However the bitching was mostly ignored due to the changeover of ownership of Monkly-business.com.  In case you were unaware, monkly-business is no longer on Sony's list of recommended sites, and to that end, they no longer post on our boards or really give a shit what we say there unless we post something that may sound overpowering (Such as the wu's fix...which even ill admit is fair now, but was fun before it was fixed).<br>

Or keep the lower dam/dly ratio 9/16 and get the haste buff and stats. Haste to a monk after all, is just as important as song boosts are to your bard. Im not trying to belittle your desire for change. Just trying to find a way that everyone can benefit from.[/quote]<br>
<br>
the difference is that its relatively easy to replace 41% song haste and a atk/ac buff that monks get with a haste spell or right click effect, and impossible until very recently with bard tier 4 quest armor to find another item or spell with a song boost effect equivalent to the bard epic. <br>
<br>
as far as the stats on monk epic fists go, there are other gloves in VT and PoP that have stats as good or nearly as good-- hell even gauntets of dragonslaying are 100 hp 40 ac stats etc. The bard epic has stats too, so when you replace it with another weapon, as a bard you also will lose stats unless that weapon has them also.<br>
<br>
the choice not to use the monk epic effect isnt a hard one-- 15/20 fists are almost as good a ratio without spell/song haste as 9/16.....and how hard is it to have your enchanter cast speed of vallon on you? <br>
<br>
the choice not to use the bard epic isnt a choice at all-- songs are straight up gimp<br>
sung without the epic as compared to with it. no bard in his right mind would replace the epic with a offhand weapon that didnt have the song effect, even if it was a 30/15 secondary only weapon, because the song effect is much more important than our low DPS.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#2f2f4f><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub114.ezboard.com/blegacyofsteel43089.showUserPublicProfile?gid=tork@legacyofsteel43089>Tork</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://users.erols.com/gww6e/eq/g.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Gay Bard</span><br>  Posts: 1516<br> <font color=#ffffff>(1/12/03 9:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub114.ezboard.com/flegacyofsteel43089general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3716.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Heh</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://us.st8.yimg.com/store4.yimg.com/I/wickedcoolstuff_1721_7448039"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--><br>

In regard to the Monk epic, it'll get banked. Vallon is better haste and I get it at every raid. Nothing for a monk to get solo exp from in PooP, so it's all really a non-issue(Did I say <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>exp</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->? Shit, I'm still 63, don't tell my guild!).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In regard to the bard epic, it sucks. Hopefully they'll get some sort of fix that actually works (without requiring three-four emergency patches).<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Kyntaro<br>
