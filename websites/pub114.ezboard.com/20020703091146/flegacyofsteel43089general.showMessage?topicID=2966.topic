I pretty sure you guys would want to know the general time it happened if you wanted to plan on killing him next spawn.  Sorry for any problems this might cause you guys, it was not our goal to anger you guys in any way, I personally know a few of your members from a previous guild and consider them friends and would not want to gain any negative feelings between them or our guilds.

He was moved.  He yet again came back.  <br><br>He was up the night before from what I understand,  yet no one took him out or prepared for an AoW raid.  <br><br>No one sent me a tell.  No one told me it was a problem.  We trained it away.   He aggrod us again up top.  Petitioning a GM would have been fine.  No suggestion was given to us to do just that.<br><br>I told Tigole that in the future, I would tell you guys to come move him if we experience this problem again.  This would NOT be a repeated incident.<br><br>Communciation helps.  I thought if it was really an issue I would get some tell from Tigole or anyone...I received none.<br><br>I find it pretty embarassing to say the least that I have to ask for permission to move a mob that is in the way because your guild may or may not want to try AoW this week.  I as I am sure many guilds who fight in Kael are more than willing to work with you so that everyone can enjoy the lag of Kael.<br><br>I am sure you have killed mobs in your way before trying to get to something else.  He seemed to be unavoidable. This is perhaps due to our inexperience with fighting in Kael with the buggy Idol.<br><br>We had no desire to kill him...well some after he beat us to a pulp trying to get to Vindi.  <br><br>We have no desire to continually kill a trigger mob to tick someone off.  <br><br>I apologize if this screwed up your plans for later this week. Hopefully Verant will fix the problem(.
