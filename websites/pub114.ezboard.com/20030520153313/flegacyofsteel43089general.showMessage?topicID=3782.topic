Suppose a guild like LoS were to move to the new server...but didn't want to pay the fee to have everyone move equipped.<br>
<br>
So, suppose you did this: a small number of people move characters designed to be the best for powerleveling others.  These people pay the $150, and they take the character for powerleveling and seven bank mules (or six bank mules if the powerleveler is not their main). The mules are stuffed full of the best droppable twink gear you can get.<br>
<br>
Everyone else in the guild starts new characters on the new server, and are powerleveled and twinked with the droppable stuff from the bank mules.<br>
<br>
Question: how long would it take, starting that way, for your guild to get to the point on the new server, in terms of strength and flagging and keys, that it is now on The Nameless?<br>

with no competition, you could probably get geared up in a couple months(minus all the nick nacks and doo dads from the old world that you just won't have time to get around to killing)<br>
<br>
<br>
with competition?  you'd be in a big uphill battle, and it'd probably take better part of 18 months to 2 years <p>Tikker Gimblestan<br>

They are a collection of lvl 60 Euros from several servers who started there as lvl 1's (non-split server).  Baldrik was my old buddy Hasu on 7th Hammer.  After Sanctuary-7th folded up and disbanded alot of us officers went to Vazaelle for a fresh start, he stayed and started CC<br>
<br>
They worked VERY hard and in 6 months where top guild and in a year Uber Guild.  BUT, like Arielia said, attrition slowed it down and I would say added 3 months to the rebuilding plan.<br>
<br>
In a nut shell -- from scratch an Uber Guild can become elemental capable within 9 months if it managed leveling/gearing properly and has a solid 40+ member core that levels hard and raids hardcore in that 9 months. <p><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=527298" target="top">Aethn Anvel</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

<br>
personally, i think the funnest part of eq was the leveling up. but it takes alot of dedication, and to get back up to &quot; uber &quot; status, if you go really fast and use every little qwirk to exp like a mofo + you have a really strong leader with knowledgeable officers backing you up + a strong core of about 25 ppl, you can be killing statue within the month.<br>
<br>
for tips on leveling: make absolutly posative you have enough enchanters as that when you hit level 35 you aren't forced to sit in overthere all day long. having a proportionate number of warriors / clerics is also neccisary. the warriors you start with are prolly going to be the ones main tanking, and the clerics the ones yelling in cleric channel how to not be retarded and keep warriors alive.<br>
<br>
while leveling up, you should also be looking for unguilded people, as these are going to be the guys / gals that will fill in the classes that the core people aren't playing ( SK, paladin, rogue, mage ) and also to beef up your melee / cleric population.<br>
<br>
while leveling up, untwinked, this is pretty much the fastest way to go. team playing so exp is coming in almost all the time, a group of warrior, cleric, necro, shaman, enchanter, and ranger can get level 60 and exploit PoV/ PoS trials pretty damn fast.<br>
1-4: exploit the bard delivery quest in south qeynos. if you group for it you'll have atleast 2 gold when done with it, if not you can get atleast a plat if you are lucky.<br>
<br>
4-6: should be grouping with guildies / friends by now, its easier then soloing. personally i like qeynos hills, but its kind of which zone you prefer for this. <br>
<br>
6-10: you can pretty much take 3 paths here. one is to start exping in paladual caverns. VERY dangerous, as getting to paladual from  shar ' val to end up on the newbie side requires running through about 50 billion things, some that run at sow speed. paladual is the fastest exp though, no doubts about it. the flip side is that you take a hit in exp to get your warrior gear, and go to qeynos sewers. you can kill bandits for a little money, and begger wilin ( whatever his ass is named ) to do the quest for leather armor. you can also go to misty thicket and do exp, although thats not feasable for evil races and its not as good exp as paladual is.<br>
<br>
10-23: welcome to paladual caverns. this is your home, along with everybody else your level. on VS the zone pop got to 180 at one time, yet the exp kept flowing. if you came here at level 6 you were killing at zone. now its time to move in and to the right, and kill underbulks / phlergs v.1. once your group is about level 15, go back to the zone, and this time follow the left wall leaving it. go into the first cave you come to ( basically the only one in the room you haven't been in yet ). go into the first cave not a dead end, watch out for the trap, and set up camp on the rock right at the opening. now you are killing only phlergs, which are really fucking nasty at this level. they have a disease proc which does about 5 hp for an hour, so try not to get casters hit.<br>

<br>
10-23: welcome to paladual caverns. this is your home, along with everybody else your level. on VS the zone pop got to 180 at one time, yet the exp kept flowing. if you came here at level 6 you were killing at zone. now its time to move in and to the right, and kill underbulks / phlergs v.1. once your group is about level 15, go back to the zone, and this time follow the left wall leaving it. go into the first cave you come to ( basically the only one in the room you haven't been in yet ). go into the first cave not a dead end, watch out for the trap, and set up camp on the rock right at the opening. now you are killing only phlergs, which are really fucking nasty at this level. they have a disease proc which does about 5 hp for an hour, so try not to get casters hit.<br>
   once you hit 20, its time to do bandits. run back to pok, and go back to paladual via the shadowhaven entrance. you can kill the bandits near the zone there, OR the bandits up the hill. either way, you will prolly need to lull pull them. they drop decent upgrades for weapons, and VERY nice cash compared to what you have been getting so far. if bandits are camped, you can kill shik'nars for pretty much the same exp, only they have shitty loot. or if you think you are hot shit you can camp the great rastafarisah, the big ass mushroom. he drops a nice monk weapon, and nice caster weapon, and something else that i can't remember. a named also spawns in his room which drops something else... but once again i don't care enough to try to remember what it was. like you should be camping loot at this level anyways, you'll get enough of that later.<br>
<br>
23-25: these levels will seem like an snail crawl compared to 10-23, as there are almost 0 good mobs for these levels. you can do runneyeye if you have an inviser, or if you have the perfect grp ( snare / mez / MT / cleric / shaman slow ) you can kill shit in upper guk or start killing in sol a.<br>
<br>
25-45: this is a hard path, but a fast one. basically you kill goblins until level 35, then you kill gnomes in the castle. a couple guildmates did this, no idea how they killed the gnomes.<br>
OR you can go<br>
25-31: upper guk / sola. if you feel inclined you can camp near goblin king in sola and hope to get a cleric epic piece, or anywhere else appropriate for level. or you can go to upper guk and try to find mobs your level that are feasable to kill. <br>
<br>
31-35: once 31, clear your way to the bedroom in lguk, its your home until 35. if you have a pretty good ench you can kill the icebones, otherwise pull spiders from the opposite direction ( icebones can drop small bronze some time but are mother fuckers to pull ).<br>
<br>
35-40: as usual, you can do diffrent things. goblins in highhold keep are the best exp, but any more then 1 grp and they are super shitty. you can kill things in crystal caverns when you get to 38. it yields pretty good caster robes / paladin weapon / melee axes and whips, but is not easy. or you can stay in lguk and kill everything in the tower ( ass / sup / cav / exe / sav ). this is the best path to take if you are the highest grp and in a guild imo, as you can outfit your group and guildies with gear they can use for awhile. exe axes are big upgrades to what they currently use, and if they are low level they will benefit from it even more, and can even give them the edge over other gprs their lvl.<br>
<br>
40-43: echo caverns, short ppl side entrance in shadowhaven. when you enter zone run straight until you reach alot of underbulks. kill all of these, maybe even the named for a pretty good monk weapon, and then facing back towards SH zone, take the first left and kill everything here, maybe even a snake for a decent whip. <br>
<br>
43-50: welcome back to lguk. make your way to safe hall in undead side, and start camping frenzy. once all your melees have haste / your group is about level 48, start camping king / hand / AM. <br>
<br>
43-53: Velk's lab. this place is jizownage exp, and when you can camp named its jizownage loot. <br>
<br>
50-53: karnors. and no this isn't going to be the train filled deathtrap karnors from your old server. this is going to be paradise karnors, assuming things turn out right. you have free reign to kill every and anything you want until second bridge, which should be more then enough to keep the exp flowing. <br>
<br>
53-60: if your grp is hoss, you can go to PoJ and kill prisoners / rats. if you have a high level enchanter with charm, you can go to pon and do charm group for GODLY exp. if you aren't hoss / have a high level enchanter with charm though, OS is good enough exp, and pretty decent for gems / spells. or if you are really desperate you can try to do dogs in velkators... but in your gear, its not going to be easy.<br>
<br>
congradulations, you are level 60. if you did it within 2 weeks you get to see samus in a 2 piece. you can stay in PoN and use charm to get to 65, or you can use charm to help you get level 63 in PoD and then PoN to 65. at this point in time your guild should start killing vindicator ( if you have 35 and a 65 tank this is no problem ), and if you have really good clerics you might be able to take statue down. hell, if you can kill statue should just bind at WL zone and bind rush tormax.  <br>
<br>
in closing, releveling is a HUGE pain in the ass, just as reading that above shit probably was.  if you do it with friends though, it can be alot of fun. just make sure that they don't move a guild killing elemental planes shit onto your server though, it will kinda kill your urge to play &gt;&lt;<br>

It's rewarding now, but even to this day re-acquiring all the AA's really blows goat cack.   <br>
