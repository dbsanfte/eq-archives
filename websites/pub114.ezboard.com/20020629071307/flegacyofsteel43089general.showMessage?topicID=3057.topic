The logic of this statement is, however, symbolic. The real world truth of the word-equation is false. All trees are, in fact, not purple; while logically sound, it's an absurd statement. Along those lines, a subjective statement cannot, unless impossible, be disproven. I like unicorns. Logically true. But the actual meaning of the sentence judged in the context of the living world is fallacious. Unicorns don't exist. Thus, my equation is merely a fantasy of liking the idea of unicorns. The myth of them. For a subjective statement to be meaningful, it MUST have context; it requires comparison.<br>
      &quot;To us, Xerxish &gt; AoW&quot; First, I'd like a link to the original post to validate that these are, in fact, your actual words. Nevertheless, either way, the statement, taken in the context in which it was said, is ridiculous. Here's why, and I'll repeat my earlier statement: any subjective statement said without comparative validation is meaningless. I like grasshopers. So what? It's an expression of inconsequence... unless I was talking to a friend about my favorite insect, etc. The reason your estimation is absurd is the context in which it was said, not the saying itself. You wrote it, if memory serves, on a &quot;Top Ten Uber Mobs&quot; list. The point of such a list is a collabaratory estimation of the hardest mobs in the game, taking into consideration both personal and general experience. The idea is to approximate a kind of equation, a gauge of relative difficulty of game encounters. Crucially, difficulty can only be proven in scale (context) with other difficulty worldwide. If you trained for twelve months and said, For me, running a marathon is easy. That doesn't make it trivial for a sloth like me. Grieg beat us the first time we fought him. Should we have placed him at the top of the Uber list? No, because the assumption is absurd given the ease of his defeat on all other servers. Likewise, your assumption that Creator &gt; AoW not only is absurd now, it was overestimated then because only you and FoH had attempted the encounter, and they had beat him. Not only had they won, they placed him low on the list, refuting your assumption. On top of that, any guild with keys could have killed him with ease after a couple tries, as we now know (and as most everyone did). Basically, your argument has become WE SUCKED AGAINST CREATOR AND YOU CAN'T PROVE WE DIDN'T. A valid statement. But because of this single defeat, you completely overestimated his difficulty, elevating him out of proportion. This is what everyone takes issue with because the absurdity of that equation has been proven. <br>
      Validated against all other facts, only two responses can result from your statement: a) my guild isn't strong or b) my estimation was wrong. I'm sure you don't believe A. And everyone's been only asking that you admit B. You formulated a hypothesis which received ridicule and continue to defend the ludicrous. You've mistaken logical validity for a SIGNIFICANT and MEANIGFUL statement. Arguments without context are void. If you had said on a different post, we had a hard time with Creator, this whole issue wouldn't have flared up. The fact that you completely overestimated him on a whim, in a particular forum addressing mob difficulty, invalidates the truth of your assumptions, or the meaning. Basically, you substituted fiction for fact; while the nature of fiction, of subjective opinion, makes it impossible to disprove logically, when applying a relationship, a comparison, a &gt; , the meaning and bearing are all too clear. <br>
      A personal note: when attempting a lucid and cogent argument, I recommend refraining from any mudslinging, slander, or otherwise &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; attitudes because they invoke only scorn and imply an immature intellect (I, myself, have been guilty of this. So sorry if I did anytime earlier). No one's a saint, but it helps to try and conceive of all sides of the issue. I understand why you felt attacked. But instead of shrugging it off as a quick remark, a slip, you made in passing once on a freaking virtual messageboard which has no significance in the real world anyway, you attempted to defend the absurd. Most of the posters, admittingly, have decided to attack you instead of your argument, but you (imitating the hypocrisy you pretend to scorn) have aggravated them as well. And please, no flames on this thread from either side, if it doesn't get locked. One more thing. Great minds can always be recognized by their humility before the truth. True genius stares unflinchingly at all the sorrows and failures of the self and at the oncoming dread of uncertain futures. Why is it so hard to live unabashedly with all flaws exposed? A question for the ages...<br>
