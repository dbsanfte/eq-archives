<i>I read your guilds Credo and was very impressed. Untill I got thoroughly disgusted with UO I belonged to a guild which had basically the same ethics as you have laid out. Gaming within a good guild adds a sense of secuity and shared knowledge. The GM's of the Black Knights assisted me and helped me through the early parts of the game and eventually to a GM Warrior with 3 large homes. Helping others in our guild was commonplace and helped us to grow quickly to a formidable strength and size quickly. Once I join an online game I tend to powergame to progress as quickly as possible and hope that, if accepted, I can make a positive addition to CLASH!</i><br>

<i>What is a guild?
A loosely organized, communicable horde of people wishing to communicate/relate/interact in some way.

From what I have read, I see CLASH! as more than a loosely organized multitudes, I see it as a guild that would be an almost nessary part to completely enjoy any roleplaying adventure and interaction in EverQuest.  Other guilds may offer some acceptance, adventuring, and excitement, although, not to the supremacy that I know CLASH! will.  I am looking forward to joining CLASH!
