I Finally got my Journeyman Boots!!!!  Drefan is now a magic user (sort of ;)<br>Took me 8 hrs. of camping Drelzna's room in Najena, but it was worth it!<br>All the 3 members of my group in there that needed the boots eventually got them (took 10 hrs. to get 3 boots)<br><br>Drefan - the speedy Monk<br>
