Greetings-<br><br>It must be this new level 14 getting to my brain...Im checking around the various websites, and it seems that I should be hunting Frogloks.  They seem to carry woven armor which is better than cloth (right?), and I need all sorts of woven stuff (Wizzes can use woven, right?).  So Im thinking...maybe I should take a run down to Innothule and Upper Guk...What do you think?  Am I over my head?  Of course, I'll have my ever faithful paladin companion, Garean, to guard my back (and any other that wants to come!).  Tell me, am I crazy?<br><br>Rag<br><br>Lvl 14 Wizzer (Geez I need lvl 16!)
