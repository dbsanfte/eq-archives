Greetings:<br><br>Bear Hide is made by Chandra Miller (Baobob Miller's sister).  The reside at a campfire outside the entrance to Surefall Glade. Chandra only makes boots, belt and cloak.  Talk to her (tell her Baobob sent me) and ask her how much for a belt, etc.  She will not make a cloak for you until you help her relatives out in North Karanas.  I haven't met these people and do not know where they are, so you are on your own.<br><br>The belt is 5 gp plus a low or lesser quality bear hide, the boots are 15 gp plus a medium quality bear hide, and I don't know about the cloak.  <br><br>Hope this helps.<br><br>Ragicnam<br>
