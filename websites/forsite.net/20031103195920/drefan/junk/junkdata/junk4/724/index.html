I think thats a Great idea, and i would love to do it, i suggest trying the Dungeon of Najena, since it sounds cool, and i have never been there... I Would also like to try it in Unrest, there are a Lot of people there, but if we get a Full group going, we can hopefully get some cool items, cya in the game.<br><br>Belix Murasame - lvl 19 WoodElf Ranger
