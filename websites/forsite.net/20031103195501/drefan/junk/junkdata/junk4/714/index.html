Allrighty, I've been discussing this Race war server thing with several members over the last week or so, and have come to a cuople conclusions.  First, I want to try a Troll warrior.  It's basically the only class and race I've never tried, so it would be alot of fun for me.  Also, I have tallied up about 11 people, Clash members and friends alike, that wouldn't mind being one of the evil race groups.  Eg Dark elves, Trolls, or Ogres.  I've never had to opportunity to roleplay an evil race, and think it'd be alot of fun to do it with alot of friends.  =)  Let me know if being one of the races in the evil group , and roleplaying stupid trolls and ogres, or hate-loving Dark elves sounds like fun!  =)  I think it would be!<br><br>-Styyle
