Since  I`m only an initiate I can`t ask to be a gm, but heres an idea for a quest if someone who is a gm likes it please feel free to use and distort it anyway you like=)<br><br>Here it goes, Have a specified time when everyone that wants to compete, can. Choose a rather confusing dungeon or other place. throw in anything you want, and the players are all trying to get an item youve hidden in the labrynth. People can team up to find it but in  the end there is only one winner, once the person gets it they win unless two people or more found it then they have to duel for it. opnions and comments welcome....<br>-Ug-Luk
