There are a FEW QUESTS out there.<br>One of the biggest and Hardest is the Dragon Quest - Smogg.<br>He has killed all whom have tried to slay him.<br>He roams the land without Fear of Human's feasting on their remains when he's burned them to a Crisp.<br>There is also her say that he can cast magic.<br>If you have seen him and wish to give others a Change on the Quest the please scribe what you can about it.<br><br>Marius - Founder of CLASH - GM of Server!
