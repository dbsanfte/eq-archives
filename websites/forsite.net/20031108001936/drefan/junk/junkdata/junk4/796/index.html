Just letting everyone know, a group of us are playing on the Test Server checking out the Race War code.<br>Look for Naazgul (Drefan), Nenir (Marrius), Degauss (Dworkin), Garean (Garean ;) ... and several other Clash members.<br>Oh - we are all Dark Elves.<br>In case anybody doesn't know how to play on the Test Server, run the testeverquest.exe file in your Everquest directory.<br>It's fun to play with other members in the same area - with all of us about the same lvl - newbies ;)<br><br>
