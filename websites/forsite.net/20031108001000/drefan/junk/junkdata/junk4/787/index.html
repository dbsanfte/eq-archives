Wow I can't believe I can still post when my account was erase, you gotta work on that Drefan.<br>Guys I love this guild, it was the greatest and ever will be I'd go back to this guild if I could, but now<br>some of you guys probably hate me for the reasons I left. Dworkin man, I would love to come back<br>but I don't think I have that chance anymore. Clash is a home of mine no matter what, if I can get back<br>I would love to come back. The reason I left was I had the chance to form my own guild, the guy name <br>Curar, convinced me, he convinced me good. I had a long thought about it, I wanted to try something new.<br>So I said yes and wanting to start a guild with him and some other guys. There was my opportunity, <br>something like this doesn't happen everyday guys. So plz don't hate me, if this guild thing doesn't work<br>out like it should, I wish in your hearts u guys can leave me a space and take me back. Sorry everyone...<br>Especially u Dworkin.<br><br>Sincerely, Archamis aka Undertow
