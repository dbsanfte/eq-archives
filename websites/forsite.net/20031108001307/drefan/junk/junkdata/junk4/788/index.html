Yup - you can and should wear woven as a Wiz - Much lighter than cloth.<br>All the frogloks at the entry way to guk can drop the woven, so don't go in too far - there is no need to do so.  Just watch out for the trains that get pulled to the zone.  Guk has some very narrow passageways and if a troll or 2  are blocking the way, you won't be able to get past them and zone to safety - be ready with the gate spell ;)<br>You shouldn't have a prob if you stay relatively close to the zone and root the little suckers - they run fast as hell!<br>Drefan
