Hail,<br>I want to thank all those who have come out and played. We are tring to make ot a event that all can enjoy!<br>Somethings some people are missing when they try and connect to our server or ask for access to the CLASH<br>ICQ account. <br><br>1) Please let me know whom you are are in the request for access to the ICQ. Sometimes your name is not what I have on<br>the list of Members and a lot of time is wasted pass notes backand forth on that issue.<br>2) YOU MUST BE RUNNING UO 1.25.33 <B>NOT</B> 1.25.34.<br>  a) If you are running 34 and not playing on OSI servers send be a Email or ICQ CLASH and we shall try and help.<br><br>That's about it.<br><br>Marius - FOUNDER OF CLASH -  GM of SERVER!
