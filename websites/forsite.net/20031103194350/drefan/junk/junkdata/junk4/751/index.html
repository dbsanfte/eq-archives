Ok I'll be binding the Evil race at Neriak at 5:30pm Eastern time, well I'll be there to bind anyway. Also on the Guild Armorer, Oaken I decided this last night so you would have no idea, but I plan on being the Guild Smith. I've got high intell so it will raise fast not to mention I've got 200pp I can dump into the skill right now and I'm starting out at a skill of 20.<br><br>Naeeldar 21 Level Dark Elf Necro
