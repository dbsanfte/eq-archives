It might be a good idea to build a self-sufficient town consisting of only guild members of the clash.  If we had a town, it would be a lot easier to have a rallying point adn to have a sanctuary that we would defend at all costs.  Access wouldl only be given to guild members.  We could afford this if our early earnings and treasure went to building it.  After that we could go back to normal guild taxes.
