Well, Some of you might be wondering why the NEW server is not up yet.<br>Well, we found some bugs that we could not live with. We are currently still playing with the .99 beta version.<br>We plan on changing over as soon as we have the newer version running a bit more stable.<br><br>We will post when this will happen. and give you 24-48 hours to gather your infomation for your server.<br><br>What you will need is your stats.<br>STR<br>INT<br>DEX<br>GOLD<br>SKILLS<br><br>We will not be setting anyone higher that 65% at and skill level even if you are already above that. The NEW code has a diffrent setuyp for skill advancement.<br><br>If you have any questions.
