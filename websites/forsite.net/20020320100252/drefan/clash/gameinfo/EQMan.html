<BR>EverQuest Manual Supplement - 3/15/99
<P>The following is a supplement to the printed EverQuest manual that comes
in the retail box.&nbsp; This document was compiled over time as the EverQuest
beta progressed, and may approach explaining the game from a different
perspective.&nbsp; Also, because EverQuest is a dynamic, evolving game,
we will be able to keep you updated with this document, in that it is downloaded
automatically whenever it changes via the patch server.

<P>&nbsp;EverQuest Manual Supplement
<BR>Step 1 - Creating Your First Character
<P>When you first enter the game, you will be prompted to create a new
character. Your first decisions will be race, class, gender, stats, facial
aspect and name.
<P>The race chosen will define the classes available to you.&nbsp; Certain
races have advantages that are fairly obvious when you go cycling through
the various combinations of race and class.&nbsp; As you select a race,
the picture changes, the classes available change, and the base stats change.&nbsp;
One of the differences between the characters is the use of infravision
or ultravision... i.e. the ability to see in the dark.&nbsp; Humans, Erudites,
and Barbarians do not have this ability, all other races do in some form
or another.
<P>The classes available vary with the race chosen.&nbsp; Not all classes
are available to every race.&nbsp; Changing the class chosen changes the
base stats of the character.&nbsp; A brief description of each class is
included in Appendix A below.
<P>Gender is a personal preference and has no bearing on any aspect of
the character beyond appearance.
<P>Statistics are broken into two categories, primary and secondary.&nbsp;
The primary stats are the brighter colored stats that are the most important
to the class chosen.&nbsp; The secondary stats are the less bright ones
that still effect your character, but are not as important to your class.&nbsp;
Once you've decided upon your race and class, you have a group of bonus
points to spend, located at the top of your stats, to increase selected
stats.&nbsp; The stats can not be lowered beyond their initial values,
but can be raised as high as desired.&nbsp; It is recommended that the
primary stats be focused on, as increasing those will be most beneficial
to your character's profession.
<P>A general view of the stats:
<P>Strength:
<BR>This is the physical power of the character.&nbsp; It determines how
much the character can carry without being encumbered and is figured into
the character's ability to do damage to an opponent in melee.
<P>Stamina:
<BR>This is your health and constitution.&nbsp; It reflects your ability
to perform strenuous tasks without becoming exhausted.&nbsp; It is also
used in calculating your hit points.
<P>Agility:
<BR>This is your physical dexterity and is used to determine your defensive
abilities.&nbsp; The higher your Agility, the less likely you are to be
hit by melee combat.
<P>Dexterity:
<BR>This is your hand/eye coordination and is used in combat accuracy and
spell casting capability.&nbsp; This is used in calculating your missile
combat skills and aids in determining if you are interrupted when you are
hit while casting a spell.
<P>Wisdom:
<BR>This is willpower and faith and is used to determine the casting abilities
of Shaman, Druids, Rangers, Clerics, and Paladins.&nbsp; It is also involved
in resisting magical spells that effect the mind.
<P>Intelligence:
<BR>This is intellect and is used to determine the casting abilities of
Wizards, Enchanters, Magicians, Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Bards.
<P>Charisma:
<BR>This is a combination of the physical beauty and charm of the character
and is used primarily to calculate how various NPC factions react to the
character.&nbsp; The higher the charisma, the less likely they will be
adversely effected by actions that will lower the characters standing with
a group, though this modification is very limited (i.e. a pretty and charming
murderer is still a murderer).&nbsp; Charisma also can cause merchants
to alter their pricing to the character, again depending upon the character's
standing in the merchant's faction.
<P>Spending the bonus points is the one and only time that a character's
stats change throughout the life of the character.&nbsp; Certain spells
and magical items may cause temporary changes to a character's stats, but
these initial values will otherwise remain the character's permanent stats
for their entire life.
<P>Pressing the Face button allows the player to change the character's
facial aspect, customizing the character's appearance somewhat.
<P>The character's name must be suitable to a fantasy genre and not be
a direct plagiarism of an existing literary character.&nbsp; The best solution
is to allow the character generator to create a name for the player, or
for the player to create a name on their own instead of borrowing from
an existing character.&nbsp; Creating an offensive name or a name that
is distracting or non-fantasy can result in the GM's changing the name
or deleting the character with or without notifying the player.
<P>After selecting the above characteristics, the player will be prompted
for a Deity. It is not required to pick a Deity, unless the character is
of a religious profession (Cleric, Shaman, etc).&nbsp; The choice of a
Deity is an important one, as the character will have this Deity for the
full of it's life, and that Deity brings with it certain faction assumptions.&nbsp;
For example, choosing Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate, will most certainly
not make your character popular around the temple Rodcet Nife, the Prime
Healer.&nbsp; And, being human and choosing Innoruuk will not necessarily
make you welcome in Neriak, the home of the Dark Elves.&nbsp; For further
discussion on the Deities, it is best do research on them at www.everquest.com.
<P>Step 2 - Customizing Your Playing
<P>After making a character and Entering the World, you will need to make
yourself "comfortable".&nbsp; You do this by adjusting your view and settings
to give you the greatest amount of flexibility to your style of playing.
<P>View
<P>You arrive in EverQuest with a small viewscreen boxed in by utility
keys, etc. They are mostly self-explanatory, but we will cover a couple
of them here.
<P>The first view you see is called "Windowed" and offers the best performance
on slower machines.&nbsp; In your upper left corner are your Options and
Persona buttons.&nbsp; Lower left has a rectangle of 6 empty buttons.&nbsp;
This is your Hot Button keypad.&nbsp; It allows you to have this view and
keep needed skill or function buttons readily available (more on this later).&nbsp;
The bottom center is your text box.&nbsp; This window or box is where you
interact with other players (by speaking), transact with NPCs, and receive
information about monsters (such as keeping track of your combat).&nbsp;
On the upper right hand side is your vital signs (hit points (red bar),
manna (blue bar) and stamina (yellow bar) ) and below that is the space
for your party member's vital signs.&nbsp; On the right hand side are a
series of menu buttons and below them are the menus that these buttons
bring up.
<P>Press F10 once, and you should have a full-screen view with your Hot
Button keypad in the bottom left hand corner, your text box is now translucent
in the bottom center, and your vital signs top right corner. This is the
"Half Screen" view.&nbsp; It allows you to keep track of your vital signs
and gives you a wider field of view, but can be a bit sluggish on slower
machines.&nbsp; In the upper left corner are 4 green numbers. The first
is your "ping" time to the EQ servers, the second is packet loss out, the
third is packet loss in, and the fourth is data throughput to the server.&nbsp;
When the 1st number goes up, your response time is slowed.&nbsp; If the
2nd and 3rd numbers turn yellow and then red, be prepared, your connection
could be in trouble (server down, ISP, etc.).
<P>Pressing F10 again gives you a full-screen view without any buttons,
bars, or text. Press F10 once more and you're back to the "Windowed" view.
<P>Pressing the Options button allows you to customize your game settings.
Here is a brief overview of the settings that can be adjusted:
<P>General:&nbsp; allows you to change the sound &amp; music volume of
the game.
<BR>Display:&nbsp; allows you to change display specific to your monitor,
as well as show PC and NPC names (see the /shownames command below). It
also allows you to alter your 3dfx Glide settings if your graphics drivers
are Glide3 3.0 compatible.
<P>Chat Filter: allows you to turn on or off things in your text box that
you do or do not want to see (such as /shouts and other peoples combat
information).
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Hot Button Keypad
<P>The rectangle in the lower left of your screen (in the first 2 views)
is a place to put skills or commands that you would like to use often.&nbsp;
To transfer buttons to the Hot Button Keypad, left click on the desired
button and hold the button down.&nbsp; A floating button will appear on
top of your cursor. Move it to the desired position on the Hot Button Keypad,
and left click again to secure it there.&nbsp; Left clicking on the left
and right arrows above the Hot Button Keypad will cycle through the 6 sets
of buttons.&nbsp; Pressing the numbers 1-6 will activate the buttons without
clicking on them, and pressing Shift-1-6 will change through the different
sets of buttons.
<P>To remove a button from the Keypad, left click on it and hold to pick
it up, move the button to the middle of your screen, then right click.&nbsp;
The button will vanish.
<P>A. Two basic command buttons that are usually transferred there are
the Sit/Stand button and the Run/Walk button.&nbsp; From the "windowed"
view, there are 3 of 4 buttons on the right hand side, Abilities, Combat,
Main, and Socials.&nbsp; If Main is on the list, press it.&nbsp; This brings
up the main menu.&nbsp; Move the button labeled "Walk" to the Keypad.
<P>B. To do this for secondary combat skills, click on the Combat button
in the middle right side of your screen.&nbsp; The Combat skill buttons
will appear to the right of the text box.&nbsp; The two buttons in the
bottom right corner of the screen are available for combat skill assignment.&nbsp;
Right clicking on either of these buttons will bring up a list of your
current available combat skills.&nbsp; Which skills appear is dependant
upon your Class.&nbsp; To choose a skill to be assigned, left click on
it.&nbsp; This places that skill on that button. Then move it as above.&nbsp;
These assigned skills are used in combat by clicking on them during combat.
Combat skills each have their own duration for re-use and the button will
stay depressed until you can use the skill again. Some of these skills
have a short duration of only a few moments, while others can remain depressed
for as long as a full game day (there are 4 game days in a real day).
<P>C. To use various other non-combat skills, press the Abilities button
on the center right of your "Windowed" view.&nbsp; Assign skills to these
buttons in the same way you do the combat skills.&nbsp; Skills that are
not listed in these areas are either not attainable by your current level
or are practiced automatically by other means.
<P>D. Spells can also be copied from the Spell Button bar to a Hot Button
Keypad in the same manner, allowing them to be used in the "Half Screen"
view.&nbsp; See the section on Magic below on how to memorize spells.
<P>E. The Persona button (the button that takes you to the inventory/skill
screen) can also be dragged to your Hot Button Keypad.&nbsp; This allows
the character's inventory to be brought up from the Keypad.
<P>F. Under the Socials menu, there are several pre-programmed text macros
with some of the more commonly used commands.&nbsp; These can be moved
like the above buttons to the Hotkey Button Bar.&nbsp; In addition, they
can be reprogrammed to provide your own customized text macros.&nbsp; Right
click on the button you want to program.&nbsp; A typing box will appear
in your text window; simply click on the top slot to rename the button,
and type below it what you want your character to say, using the appropriate
"/" commands (Appendix C below).&nbsp; Click Done and Control click to
move as above.
<P>Text Box
<P>Right click on the text that appears at the center bottom of your screen
in the Windowed and Half Screen views.&nbsp; This is your Language box
and your Current Language should say Common tongue. If it says anything
else, no one else except others who speak that language will understand
you and will perceive your speech as gibberish.&nbsp; Click on it to see
what other languages (if any) you know.&nbsp; Then right click again to
return to the text box.
<P>To speak to another character that is near by, hit Enter or "/" and
type your message.&nbsp; You are automatically defaulted to /say, which
means only people around you hear you.&nbsp; In the language box, you can
choose to default to Group, which means only people you are grouped with
hear you, or default to Tell, which targets only a specific person to hear
you. These allow you to set a default instead of typing /tell or /gsay
before every line of text.&nbsp; You can also default to speak Out of Character,
or to default to speak only to members of your Guild.
<P>Step 3 - First Play Session
<P>Now you have your character and are ready to play, but there are some
basics that need to be covered.&nbsp; How do you move around?&nbsp; How
do you buy things you need or interact with other players?&nbsp; What is
combat like?&nbsp; If you are a spellcaster, how do you get spells?&nbsp;
It's a lot easier to begin playing if you don't have to worry about answering
these questions, so they are provided here.
<BR>Navigation
<P>Use your arrow keys on the keyboard to move your character around the
world.&nbsp; A more detailed listing of the keys that are used to move
about are included in Appendix B below.
<P>A. Click the Run button on the bottom right of your screen (on the Main
menu of your "Windowed" view or on your Hot Button Keypad if you put it
there) to run and again to resume walking.&nbsp; If you have a long way
to go, you may want to Auto-Run.&nbsp; To start this, press on the Forward
arrow to run.&nbsp; Then press and hold the Alt key.&nbsp; Let up on the
Forward arrow key, then the Alt key.&nbsp; You are now running until you
press either the Forward or Backward arrows.&nbsp; You can adjust direction
with the Right or Left arrow while still running.
<P>The Page Up and Page Down buttons will allow you to look up and down,
and the Home key will center your view again.
<P>Holding down the Spacebar will allow your character to crouch, and releasing
the Spacebar will allow you to jump.&nbsp; To running broad jump, lightly
tap the space bar while running.
<P>B. Swimming is pretty much the same as running. Use the arrow keys to
move forward, back, right or left and the Page Up and Page Down to face
up and down.&nbsp; You will swim in the direction you are facing.&nbsp;
Remember to keep an eye on your air supply in the top left of your screen
while submerged or you may find yourself in a watery grave. It's sometimes
best to skim the surface while swimming. Tapping gently on the Page Up
key while pressing your Forward arrow key will create a nice dog paddle
effect and keep your head above water.&nbsp; You can Auto-Swim using the
same process as Auto-Run.
<P>C. While moving about, you may want to change camera views.&nbsp; You
enter the world with a first-person view.&nbsp; Pressing F9 will change
your camera view.&nbsp; You can view yourself from directly above, from
behind, and from various angles.&nbsp; There are 5 different possible views.
The first view is 1st person, as if looking from the character's eyes.&nbsp;
The 2nd is top down, from directly above the character's head.&nbsp; The
3rd view is Chase Camera, which follows from behind and turns when the
character does, looking over the character's shoulder.&nbsp; The other
two are static cameras that do not turn with the character but keep a constant
position (facing east, etc).
<P>D. To adjust your view, you can hold down the ALT key and then use the
arrow keys to move the camera to the right and left, and up and down.&nbsp;
To zoom the camera in and out, use the 7 and 1 key, respectively, on your
numeric keypad.&nbsp; These settings will remain throughout a playing session,
but will need to be reset after logging out and back in.
<P>Starting Equipment
<P>Your character starts with certain items, depending upon your character's
profession.&nbsp; To find out what you have, go to the "Windowed" view.&nbsp;
To view your inventory, click on either your Persona button on the left
of your screen or the animated icon underneath it. A front view of your
character appears in the upper right corner and underneath are the items
you are carrying. To view all the equipment you are currently wearing,
click on the front view of your character or click on the button above
it.&nbsp; Here is a basic outline of what these items are for.
<P>A. Most characters start with 2 notes, and spellcasters will usually
have a scroll of their 2 basic beginning spells.&nbsp; One note is a "tattered
note-rolled up".&nbsp; Right click on this to read it and find out the
name of the NPC to give it to.&nbsp; This is your first quest: to join
your profession's guild.
<P>[Note: Some PC's do not start with this note, as their Guildmaster has
not yet been added to the world.&nbsp; Not having a note does not is not
a disadvantage, as membership to your profession's Guild is not required
to receive training]
<P>Once you've read it, proceed to your guildhall, which may or may not
be somewhere in the vicinity of your starting point.&nbsp; To give the
note to them, left click on the note, then release, and it will float with
your cursor.&nbsp; Click on the NPC to give it to them.&nbsp; If you give
this note to anyone other than who it's intended for, they will say "Thank
You" and the note is irretrievable.&nbsp; When you give the note to the
correct NPC, you will receive a small amount of experience, and a usable
item of some sort.&nbsp; Put the item in your inventory, or on your person
by dropping it on the picture of yourself in the upper right hand corner.
<P>B. The second note is a PK note.&nbsp; If you want to be able to fight
other players, read this note and follow the instructions therein.&nbsp;
If you do not ever want to fight another player, click on the note, and
move it to the Destroy button right above your inventory items.&nbsp; Click
there, and the PK note is gone forever.&nbsp; Another option is to put
it in the bank for possible future use.
<P>C. If you are a spellcaster, you will begin with 2 basic spells which
you will need to scribe in your spellbook.&nbsp; Other spells are also
available to buy in or around your guildmaster.&nbsp; See section VII below
on Spells to find out more about preparing your spells for casting.
<P>D. When in the Guildhall, at first level, you have skill practice points
and can train with the Master or other NPC members of your guild.&nbsp;
Double clicking on the guildmaster or trainer will bring up a Training
Menu, with the skills available to you and their cost, if any.&nbsp; You
can come back to train at any time, spending practice points you have earned
by gaining levels.&nbsp; To spend your points, highlight the skill desired
on the left by clicking on it and click on the Practice button at the bottom
left of the skills list.
<P>Some skills are labeled with a level number and cannot be practiced
until you reach the level listed with that skill.&nbsp; Once this level
is reached, you will need to spend at least one practice on it to learn
the basics.
<P>Your first few practices in your skills are free, but more advanced
training will eventually require payment to the Trainer.&nbsp; To view
all of your skills and their rankings, click the animated icon or Persona
button on the left of the screen and then the Skills button at the top
left.&nbsp; As you move about the world and fight, the skills you use will
advance on their own, without training, as long as the basics of the skill
are known.&nbsp; The maximum a skill will rise on it's own is dependant
upon your level.&nbsp; As you advance in level, this "ceiling" will rise
as well.&nbsp; There is no "cap" or maximum total number of skills a character
can have.&nbsp; Each skill has it's own "ceiling", based solely upon the
character's race/class/level.
<P>E. Most towns will have a bank or Vault where you can deposit money,
make change, or store items you want to keep but don't want to carry. It
is strongly recommended that you cache your starting weapon, once you get
a better one.&nbsp; It is not worth any money at any merchant, and it's
always nice to have a back-up.
<P>PC Interaction - Inspecting, Trading and Grouping
<P>A. To target another player, click on them.&nbsp; You will see their
name on the middle right of your screen with a red hit points bar behind
their name.&nbsp; Double clicking on the player will /consider them, telling
you how difficult they would be for you to defeat, and will show you their
Inventory if you are close enough to inspect them. Underneath the view
of their character will be a brief player-generated description. To create
your own description, press F9 to change to a view that you can see yourself,
then inspect yourself by double clicking on you.&nbsp; Click on the box
that will contain the text and start typing.&nbsp; This text is visible
to anyone that inspects you.
<P>B. To trade with another player, click on the item you want to give
to them in your inventory to pick it up, then click on the other character
to "drop" it on them.&nbsp; The Trade Menu will come up and you will be
able to drop additional items for trade into one of the slots under your
name.&nbsp; To complete the trade, press the Trade button (your name will
turn bright green on the trade screen).&nbsp; The trade will be completed
when the target player also ok's the trade.&nbsp; You may also add other
items to the trade, but if you do it will reset the trade switch and both
members must ok the trade again.&nbsp; If more items are traded than the
recipient has empty slots (including within bags and backpacks), the excess
items will fall to the ground at the recipient's feet and need to be retrieved.
<P>C. To group with another player, target them and hit the Invite button
on the Main menu of the "Windowed" view.&nbsp; If the player accepts your
invitation, you will see the character's name and life gauge (red HP bar)
appear in the party window on the center right of your screen. If another
player invites you to join a group, the Invite button will change to say
"Follow".&nbsp; Clicking Follow will add you to that group.&nbsp; To leave
a group, hit the Disband button.&nbsp; If you are the leader of a group,
you can selectively remove group members by clicking on the member's name
in the party window screen and clicking on Disband.&nbsp; If you target
yourself or have no target and click Disband, the entire group will disband.
<P>While grouped, any experience gained from any member of the group killing
a monster is divided up among the party members, regardless of the amount
of participation of those members.&nbsp; If all of the characters are of
the same level, then the experience points are divided up evenly.&nbsp;
If there is some disparity in the levels of the characters, then the higher
level characters get a larger share than the lower level ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The important thing to note is higher level characters get more experience
points in a group than lower level ones.
<P>Note on Grouping: To prevent "twinking", or higher level players carrying
lower level players around and killing monsters for them to get experience
from, there is a limit to the maximum distance in levels between the highest
level player and the lowest level player in a group.&nbsp; At the lower
levels, (&lt; 10th or so), that maximum is around 3.&nbsp; So if a 10th
and a 7th level character are grouped, the 7th level will get some (but
a lot less than the 10th will get) experience from monsters killed.&nbsp;
However, if a 6th and a 10th level character are grouped, the 6th will
get little to no experience.&nbsp; The pretense for this is because the
lower level character is not experienced enough to even understand what
the higher level character is doing.&nbsp; As characters advance in levels,
this maximum increases, so that a 35th and a 27th could adventure together
and the 27th could still get experience.
<BR>NPC Interaction
<P>A. To target any NPC, click on them.&nbsp; Double clicking on Merchants
will bring up the Merchant menu and Guildmasters will bring up the Training
menu (see II.D above).&nbsp; When in the Merchant menu, you may buy any
equipment the Merchant offers in the left-hand menu, provided you have
enough money for it and space in your inventory. To make a purchase, click
on the item of interest and click the purchase button underneath.
<P>The price you are offered will be determined by many factors: How your
race is viewed by that of the merchant, your charisma, your "reputation"
based upon offenses you have committed.&nbsp; For example, Dark Elves may
be able to purchase items from a Human merchant, but the prices will be
extremely high as there is no love lost between Humans and Dark Elves.
<P>B. To sell an item to the Merchant, (such as loot taken off monsters
killed) click on it and then click the sell button underneath (if you agree
to his price).
<P>C. Double clicking on any other NPC or monster will give you a very
general assessment of its level of difficulty compared to you.&nbsp; In
the case of NPC's, these individuals may have information for you, or be
involved in some form of quest.&nbsp; Try to talk to them (using normal
/say text) and see what they offer.&nbsp; For monsters, the assessment
can be done at a range to allow you to decide whether or not you want to
engage it.&nbsp; The text of the messages gives an indicator the relative
danger of the monster and the color of the text represents the relative
amount of experience points you will gain by killing it. For example, Green
text indicates that no experience points will be gained, as the monster
is too easy for the character to kill.
<P>NPC Alignments and Factions
<P>A. Norrath is a world full of NPCs, and many are important members of
that world. Interacting with them will reveal the rich history of the world,
including the many factions that exist. NPCs will typically belong to a
faction, and that faction has both enemies and allies. If you do something
for an NPC (a quest, perhaps), that act will typically raise your standing
in their faction (as well as lower your standing in those factions opposed
to the NPC's). Similarly, killing that NPC can dramatically affect your
standing with that NPC's factions and other associated factions.
<P>B. When you enter the world of EverQuest with a new character, he or
she begins their journey with an initial faction standing -- these are
determined by the character's race, class, and deity. This is very important
to keep in mind -- for example, if you begin your life as a Human Shadowknight
in the city of Qeynos, you shouldn't expect most of its citizens to treat
you very well. In fact, several might attack you on sight. Qeynos, being
a city primarily of 'good' alignment, doesn't react well to Shadow Knights,
whom they consider 'evil'. Also, keep in mind that the world is dynamic
-- some NPCs only appear during the night, or after certain events. It
is important to be aware of this, in that an area might be safe to certain
classes or races at times, yet unsafe at others.
<P>C. After character creation, it is your character's deeds that modify
his or her factions. It is important to keep in mind that alignments in
EverQuest are relative, not absolute. Dark Elves do not view themselves
as evil, whereas Wood Elves certainly believe they are. It would therefore
be possible (albeit difficult) for a Troll to perform deeds and quests
for the Humans (let's say, for example, the Qeynos Guards, which are a
faction in and of themselves), and eventually gain their favor. And then,
while almost every Troll would be attacked on sight by those guards, that
Troll in particular wouldn't be.
<P>D. If a character is attacked by an NPC, it is typically due to one
of two reasons: either that NPC is just inherently aggressive, or that
NPC's factions are diametrically opposed to the character's. If it is because
of the latter, the NPC (if capable of speech) should say why he, she, or
it, is so upset. For example, an NPC Necromancer that hates Paladins should,
upon encountering a Paladin, both attack him and mutter something like
'I hate those holier than thou Paladins!' It is important to pay attention
to what the NPC says.
<P>E. If the player encounters an NPC and his or her character is not attacked,
it is still possible to ascertain how that NPC feels about the character,
based on factions. Double clicking on that NPC will display one of several
sentences, each describing to what severity the NPC either hates you or
likes you, or is indifferent (double clicking also reveals other information
not related to factions -- please see section IV above).&nbsp; After performing
quests, or attacking various NPCs, it is very useful to double click on
other NPCs to determine if your actions have changed the way they feel
about your character.
<P>F. Determining if an NPC is a Key Member of Norrathean society or not
is very important. Key Members almost always have proper names and/or titles,
while non-key NPCs have more generic names. An example would be B'ranick
Notai, a gnoll that is known to hang out in the vicinity of the Qeynos
Hills. He is a Key Member, while another gnoll called perhaps 'a patrolling
gnoll' or 'a gnoll scout' is not.&nbsp; Killing B'ranick will significantly
affect your faction standings, while killing a non-key member will either
affect your standings to a significantly lesser degree, or very often not
at all.
<P>G. EverQuest has a great deal of quests (and more and more are being
added every day). It is very important to understand the faction system,
as well as the concept of Key Members, if the player wishes to interact
with the game's quest system. In addition to determining whether an NPC
will attack a character, the faction system is also used to determine what,
if any, quest information an NPC will give to a character. The best way
to find quests is to interact with Key Members (a non-key member will rarely
if ever reveal quest information). First target the NPC, and then hit the
H key (or use the /hail command) to initiate conversation with the NPC.&nbsp;
If the NPC has a quest or other information, they will typically respond
to you with a sentence or two.&nbsp; In their response you will see 'key
words' with brackets around them (for example, in the sentence 'I am in
search of [fish]', fish is the keyword).&nbsp; Ask the NPC in a full sentence
about the key word, and they will often respond with additional information.&nbsp;
Note: not all quests and information are formatted with brackets around
the key words – this is simply because we are not done formatting the NPC
text, and you’ll find more and more NPC text formatted properly as we get
closer to releasing the game. Also remember that the NPC will consider
your factions, and might give a different quest to different character,
or perhaps no quest at all.
<P>G. Understanding the faction system, and using the double click method
of determining how an NPC feels about your character (or noting what the
NPC says if it's attacking your character) is clearly and for obvious reasons
an important part of playing EverQuest. If your play style is such that
you enjoy quests and learning about the history and details behind the
world of Norrath, then interacting with Key Members (NPCs with proper names
and/or titles) is essential. And if your play style is more focussed on
character advancement and combat, it is important that you avoid attacking
or otherwise interfering with Key Members, in that doing so can drastically
change your faction standings and significantly alter the way NPCs react
to your character's presence (for example, doing something to upset the
Guards of Qeynos could make it very difficult to enter the city, in that
they might attack you on sight).
<P>Equipping Yourself - Weapons, Armor &amp; Clothing
<P>A. To pick up a piece of equipment you see, simply left click on it,
then release.&nbsp; To add it to your inventory, either click on to an
inventory slot or just click on your player view window.&nbsp; When using
the player view window for adding equipment, the item will automatically
be equipped on the appropriate body position if your character can use
the selected item and that slot is empty.&nbsp; When picking up something
from the ground or while looting a body, you can right-click on it and
it will automatically be placed into your inventory.
<P>B. To inspect any item, right click on it and hold the button down to
bring up it's properties screen.&nbsp; This can be done anywhere, including
your inventory, a merchants inventory, in the trade window, etc.&nbsp;
The information available will include weight, classes/races that can use
it, damage and speed, etc.&nbsp; The amount of information gleaned will
vary based upon where the item is (i.e. looking at someone else's inventory
will give you less information than looking at your own.)
<P>C. If you're buying weapons or armor, you will need to equip yourself
after purchasing, which means removing the item from an inventory slot
and clicking on your character in the player view window to "put it on",
so to speak.&nbsp; Weapons, armor and clothing are all done this same way.&nbsp;
Before purchasing items, right-click on them and hold the button down to
inspect them and make sure that they are wearable/usable by members of
both your race and your class.&nbsp; Wearable items come in 3 sizes, Small,
Medium, and Large, and certain races are limited to certain sized items.
<P>D. To use any consumable item (potions, liquor, etc), right-click on
it. Caution must be used when consuming excessive amounts alcohol as the
results may be random and somewhat erratic...similar to real life.
<P>E. Food and Water are an important part of your adventuring life.&nbsp;
If you do not have food and water, you will become thirsty and starve.&nbsp;
Thirsty or starving characters do not regenerate stamina, health, or mana.&nbsp;
They move slower and are less effective in combat.&nbsp; To prevent this,
always have enough food and water in your inventory.
<P>Food comes in many forms: Rations, Iron Rations, Meat, Muffins, etc.
and can be found in many ways.&nbsp; It is purchasable from many types
of vendors, can be fished for with the Fishing skill (assuming you have
a fishing pole and bait), foraged for with the Foraging skill, or found
as loot on some animals (in the form of meat).
<P>Water comes in Flasks of Water that can be purchased or found through
foraging, and Globes of Water, which are summoned by casters for their
use..&nbsp; Contrary to some dwarven beliefs, Alcohol is not a substitute
for water in EverQuest ;)
<BR>Spells
<P>If you are capable of using spells, you will have a Spellbook symbol
underneath the animated icon on the left center of your screen in the "Windowed"
view.&nbsp; Click on this icon and you will be brought into the Spellbook
screen.
<P>A. Scribing - All spell casters start with a single spell scroll in
their inventory.&nbsp; To scribe the scroll into your spellbook, click
on the scroll to pick it up, then drop it onto one of the empty squares
in your spell book.&nbsp; The gauge on the bottom right of your spellbook
screen is the time it takes to scribe the scroll.
<P>B. Memorizing - Once you have the spell written in your book, you can
memorize it for use by clicking on it to pick it up and clicking to drop
it onto one of the 8 memory notches, which are the horseshoe shaped indentations
on the left side of the spellbook screen.&nbsp; The gauge on the bottom
left of the spellbook screen is the time it takes to memorize the spell.&nbsp;
Once the spell is memorized, it appears as a "spell gem" in one of the
horseshoe shaped notches.&nbsp; The gems are color coded to give a general
indication of the type of spell.&nbsp; Here is the legend:
<P>YELLOW: The spell will be cast on you.
<BR>RED: The spell will be cast on who you have targeted.
<BR>GREEN: The spell is area effect, and will radiate out from who you
have targeted.
<BR>BLUE: The spell has no range, and will radiate out from you.
<BR>ORANGE: The spell is area effect, and will radiate out from who you
have targeted. It will also effect everybody (usually for spells like Rain
of Fire)
<BR>PURPLE: The spell is area effect, but will only affect people in your
party.
<P>C. Casting - To cast the spell, click on the intended target, then click
on the spell icon in your memory slot (or on the Hotkey Button if it you
moved it there).&nbsp; A time gauge will appear in the upper lefthand corner
of your screen, indicating the casting time.&nbsp; If the caster is struck
or moves during this time, the spell can be interrupted, causing it to
fail.&nbsp; The Channeling skill gives the caster a chance of recovering
from such interruptions.&nbsp; Many casting classes do not get this skill
until later in their career, and the chance of success is VERY small at
the lower skill levels..
<P>Spells will cast successfully according to your skill in the appropriate
skill area.&nbsp; The better you get at the linked skill (Abjuration, Divination,
Evocation, etc), the more successful your casting will be.&nbsp; Failure
to cast a spell results in a fizzle, which costs mana and produces no effect.
<P>Once the spell is cast, it may or may not affect the target.&nbsp; If
the target is of a much higher level than the caster, or is especially
resistant to magic, they may resist the spell.&nbsp; Casting a spell upon
someone, seeing it successfully complete, but seeing no effect means they
resisted it.&nbsp; The greater the distance in levels between the caster
and the target, the greater the chance of resisting the spell each time
it is cast.
<P>To remove a spell from your memory, right click on it.&nbsp; To determine
what a memorized spell is, right click on the icon in the notch and hold
the button down.&nbsp; The Spell Properties box will appear in your text
box.
<P>D. Meditating - Clicking the Meditate button in the bottom center of
the Spellbook screen may speed up the scribing and memorizing process.&nbsp;
This is a skill-based ability and will speed up scribing, memorizing, and
mana regeneration as the Meditate skill rises.&nbsp; The longer a person
meditates, the faster things regenerate.&nbsp; This represents a "deeper
trance" and encourages players to meditate for longer periods instead of
"quick hit" meditations.&nbsp; While meditating, you can hear what's going
around, but cannot speak or do anything else.&nbsp; If the button will
not remain pressed down, that means that the character does not yet have
the meditate skill.
<BR>Combat
<P>To initiate combat, left click on what you want to attack to target
it, then press the Z key (or whatever key you've assigned to that function).&nbsp;
This will put you into attack mode using the weapon in your right hand.&nbsp;
If there is a weapon in your left hand (many combat classes get the Dual
Wield skill at higher levels), pressing the X key activates the attack
mode for that weapon as well.
<P>If you are out of range of your target you will be informed in the chat
window.&nbsp; You may move freely while engaged in combat, but you will
only make effective attacks while facing your target and staying within
attack range.&nbsp; Your attack will automatically stop once your target
is vanquished.&nbsp; If you are attacked by another creature during combat,
you must make sure that creature is targeted and again press the Z key
in order to take up battle anew.&nbsp; Most NPCs don't take being attacked
very kindly and if you target someone while in combat mode they will turn
on you.
<P>In addition to weapon attacks, many classes get non-weapon attacks,
such as Kick, Bash, Slam to name a few.&nbsp; These cause damage in addition
to the weapon attacks and require pressing the button for them each time
an attack needs to be made instead of being automatic, like the weapon
attacks.&nbsp; Taunt is also a Combat skill that has an important role
in protecting the more vulnerable casters in the party.&nbsp; By targeting
an opponent and using the Taunt skill, you attempt to enrage the monster
to force them to focus upon you instead of upon another player.&nbsp; This
is a critical skill for keeping the unarmored spell casters alive in a
group of adventurers.
<P>Trade (Craft) Skills
<P>Trade skills in EverQuest allow you to construct useful items from component
pieces.&nbsp; This will allow you to make materials which will help your
character in their profession, as well as providing a secondary source
of income.&nbsp; To get started with a trade skill visit a merchant of
the skill you wish to learn.&nbsp; They will have the books and kits which
you will need to begin your career.
<P>Once you have carefully read a book appropriate to your Trade Skill
and acquired the component pieces necessary to build the item, you may
attempt to construct it.&nbsp; Start by right clicking on the container
used for the trade skill.&nbsp; This will open a window to which you drag
the component parts from your inventory to the available slots in the container.&nbsp;
Double check that all of the correct parts have been placed in the container,
then click on the COMBINE button.&nbsp; If your character skillfully worked
their trade skill you will get a new item(s).&nbsp; If your character blundered,
you will usually lose all of the component pieces placed in to the container.

<P>&nbsp;APPENDIX A - CHARACTER CLASSES
<P>I.&nbsp;&nbsp; WARRIOR - Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in
all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are trained
to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit Points are the
highest of any class.
<P>II.&nbsp;&nbsp; CLERIC - The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron
deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon the wrath
of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the Cleric gains his ability.
<P>III.&nbsp;&nbsp; PALADIN - Paladins are the very picture of a holy knight,
fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of life.&nbsp; They share
some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal of the fighting ability
of a Warrior, but have a few powers all their own.&nbsp; Paladins have
the innate ability to Lay on Hands.
<P>IV.&nbsp;&nbsp; RANGER - The Ranger is a meld between a Warrior and
a Druid, sharing some of the skills of both.&nbsp; They are at home in
the outdoors.
<P>V.&nbsp;&nbsp; SHADOW KNIGHT - The dark reflection to the Paladin class,
Shadow Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom they
serve.&nbsp; They are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share some
of their abilities and spells.&nbsp; Shadow Knights have the innate ability
to Harm Touch.
<P>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp; DRUID - A Druid is the complete master of his domain:
the outdoors.&nbsp; He is a friend to all flora and fauna and due to this,
animals rarely ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid.&nbsp;
They are Clerical spellcasters whose focus are all things natural, allowing
them to call upon the forces of nature for their aid and defense.&nbsp;
They share some woodland skills with their Ranger brothers, but are much
more limited to their choice of equipment.
<P>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp; MONK - Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of honing
their bodies into a pure weapon, shunning nearly all weapons and most forms
of armor.&nbsp; They are very religious as well, and the gods are known
to bless them not by prayers and spells, but by magically enhancing their
attacks.
<P>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; BARD - The Bard's stock-in-trade is his ability to
play songs. His songs are actually spells of a sort, and their magical
affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and play the correct
instrument.&nbsp; They have some passing knowledge of the Warrior ways
(mainly for self-defense), but their main focus is always their art, and
so they will never be as skillful as Warriors.
<P>IX.&nbsp;&nbsp; ROGUE - Rogues are the secretive, mysterious class of
Norrath,.&nbsp; Some say they are assassins, others say that they are nothing
but common thieves, but the truth lies somewhere in the shadows between,
for they are capable of both.&nbsp; They are quite skilled with many weapons,
but they cannot stand toe to toe with a Warrior, preferring to make the
kill by a sudden attack from behind, at which they are extremely skilled.
They would rather not be discovered at all or if they are, not be there
when opponent's blows land. The shadier skills of picking locks and stealing
are also their forte.
<P>X.&nbsp;&nbsp; SHAMAN - Similar to the Cleric, but are more of a tribal
witch doctor, the Shaman are typically found amongst the more primitive
races.&nbsp; Their primary focus is the healing of Clerical renown, but
they also employ a variety of augmentation and offensive spells.
<P>XI.&nbsp;&nbsp; NECROMANCER - These are the dark brotherhood of the
arcane arts, dabbling in death.&nbsp; Through evil spiritually based spells,
they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do their bidding,
as well as having spells which leach life from their victims.
<P>XII.&nbsp;&nbsp; WIZARD -&nbsp; Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge,
and their talents and spells focus on this goal.&nbsp; They use powerful
spells to not only see things from afar, but to transport them there as
well.&nbsp; This thirst for arcane knowledge has also made them the true
masters of the strongest form of defense: offensive spells of pure destruction.
In their ability to do magical damage, they have no rival.
<P>XIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; MAGICIAN - Magicians are the summoner of the arcane
arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of bread
to a huge Fire Elemental to fight for them.&nbsp; While not as adept at
offensive spells as Wizards, Magicians still wield considerable power in
this area as well.
<P>XIV.&nbsp;&nbsp; ENCHANTER - The primary focus of this art can be summed
up by the name of the arcane order to which it belongs: Enchantment. Their
spells are crafted to enchant people, places, and things allowing them
to charm beings and make them fight for their new master, or magically
enhance the capabilities of a sword.&nbsp; They have some proficiency in
offensive spells, but cannot match a Wizard's skill.
