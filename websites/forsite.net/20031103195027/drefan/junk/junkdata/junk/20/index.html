Hello all Clash members. I have been so bloody busy that when I heard the words Everquest I had to slap myself (no no,<br>not that sick sort of slapping) a few times because me brain had a thought jam. So now once I figured out what it was <br>that Bane was talking to me about, I was back in the thinking game. I just wanted to say hi to all of our fine members and -<br>-------------- to say, lets kick some ARSE!!!!!!!!!!
