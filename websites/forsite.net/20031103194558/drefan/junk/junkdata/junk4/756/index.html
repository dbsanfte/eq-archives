Greetings:<br><br>Since I cannot make the dungeon run this weekend, I propose to gather some of the Clash from the Western part<br>of Antonica for a small event of our own.  What I propose is this - Lets get together next Saturday (June 19 or<br>a mutually agreed day and time) in Qeynos.  I know several Clash members (Garean, Niuqus, Familiar, Neobix,<br> Jietz, there may be others), are all currently there.  We can teach each other some languages, swap items, and<br>then make a run to Split Paw (Infected Paw).  Neo can tell us about it, he was there last night.  Alternatively, we can<br>go to Erud's Crossing and whack Willowisps (Familiar has the info on this).  What do you think?  <br><br>If some other Clash members want to come, that is great.  We'd love to meet some of our brethren from the East.<br><br>Also, all you in Qeynos area, give me a tell in the game and we can hunt together.  I've been hunting Elites in Blackburrow<br>and get some good loot occasionally (spiked collar, spiked shoulderpad, the odd bronze weapon).  If any of you want<br>something like that, let me know and the next time I get one, I'll hold it for you.<br><br>Anyway, email me or post here, or give me a tell, and lets do a Clash Fandango in Qeynos!!<br><br>Ragicnam<br><br>Lvl 11 (finally!), but on my way to 12!<br>
