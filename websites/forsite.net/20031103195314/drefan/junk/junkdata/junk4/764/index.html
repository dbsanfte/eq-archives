It seems a lot of the Guild wants to go back to Najena again on a second dungeon run. I know it's a little late notice but I'd like to organize a run on Najena this upcoming Sunday. Except this time I was thinking we could do this in the morning around 10-11am Eastern time. The reason for this is there will be less people here then and the dungeon will be ripe for the pickings. That or we can beging at 6pm eastern time. Anyway post here on your time prefrence.
