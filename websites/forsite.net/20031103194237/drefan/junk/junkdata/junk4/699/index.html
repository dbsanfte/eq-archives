Thanks Ragicnam...exactly what I was looking for..didnt know she only made three pieces..but is what I wanted..I also thank you Marius I knew about woven..just wasnt sure if that is what you higher level magic users used...answered another of my questions. I guess woven with the few bear hide pieces is the best armor for a wizard..except for the various robes of course.<br>Again..my thanks to you both.
