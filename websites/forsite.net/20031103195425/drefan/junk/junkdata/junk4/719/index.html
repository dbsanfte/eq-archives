OK well this all depends on how you want to do this. Personally I think Najena would be good we can get everybody in there with sow/invis. Jietz mentioned we should do befallen or paw I disagrre with this for two reasons. One if we want good items najena has the best source for these. Second in the beginning the real low levels can just kill greater skeletons. Or a good idea is for them to group up with the high levels. They'll get exp for things that are red for them but not even blue for the high levels which means low levels get all the exp. Naejena has a relartively close bind for evil and good not to mention it's got great items.<br><br>Naeeldar
