Garean and Niuqus both told me they are in.  Unfortunately, Saturday is my dad's birthday.  The party is at my house at 4:00 pm California time.  I suggest we do the run to Paw at say 12:00 noon California time.  Garean and Niuqus both say that time is OK.  All you others, let me know.  If you want to do it in the morning Saturday, that is OK with me.<br><br>Everybody Do a /tell to any Clash member that is in the area and let them know what is up for Saturday.  Some of them don't get to the website.<br><br>By the way...I MADE LEVEL 12!!!!...Sorry.  I just had to yell that to someone!  Im ready to bind!<br><br>Later.<br><br>Rag
