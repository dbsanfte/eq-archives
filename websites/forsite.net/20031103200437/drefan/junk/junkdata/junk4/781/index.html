I have spent this last week solely in Permafrost, and I just wanted to let everyone know that the place is awesome for EXP. I am averaging about a bar an hour, mainly because there are so few people in the dungeon. Last night my party of 6 were the only people in the entire place. Loot is decent - a lot of rawhide and the occasional chain. 1 person found a pair a magical chain gloves though. The minimum level for Perma is probably around 17 or so. Hope to see you there!<br><br>BTW - Do NOT go through the main entrance, which is guarded by 2 Ice Giants. There is a somewhat hidden passageway on the North edge of the zone which will let you bypass them. <br>
