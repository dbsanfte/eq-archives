Well, looks like the "new" server will be up this Friday.  We took the dying incident to go ahead and reset the server and upgrade to the newest FUSE engine and uoFuse dll.  Now all players that are running the newest patch (.35) will be able to join us.<br>New dungeons and challenges await.  All accounts are still intact; however, all characters had to be reset - at least everyone will be starting at the same level.<br>Marius should be posting shortly with more details.<br>Smog still lives...
