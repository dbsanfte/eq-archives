Looking at the geography of the teams, you will have the human team of barbarians, Erudites, and hummies primarily in Qeynos, with the ones in Freeport getting outnumbered and slaughtered by the Evil races.  The real reason that Evil is going to rock, though, is because of all the dungeons that they have control of!  Upper Guk, Lower Guk, Fearott, Befallen, Najena, Salusek A & B, access to Paw and Lake Rathe.  Out of all the teams, nobody has access to more goodies in their backyards than the evil one does.
