ok it has been decided... at 5:30pm est we will meet at the West Gate of Freeport. bindings will be avilibale to any who need it there. at 5:45 we proceed to Lavastorm mountains.. all the evil raaces may be bound to Neriak if they wish, and we have a binder with us that can go there<br>At 6-6:15pm we will proceed to Najena and start breaking off in groups. we will limit groups as such.. levels 15-20, levels 21-25, and levels 25 plus.. we will work around the number of ppl also when deciding the accual groupings.<br>By 6:30 i want to have the first group headed into Najena, the others will proceed every 5 mins... the lower levels will start at the entrace area to be excape guard.. ie just keep all the junk up front dead.. hehe<br>the higher leveles will be looking for the more rare and powerful stuff... those of us in the mid range will be wiping out the middle of the dungeon..<br>Now remember that this dungeon has some very good stuff, but most of it is VERY VERY RARE... i have heard of some of it not spawning the item for over 30 hours.. if we dont get much oh well, we will just have to do it again sometime... My plan is to save the really rare stuff for the next bazzar, and sell it off for the good of the guild.. to finace a guild armour, and such, and to have some initial funding for new players.. those of less than 5th level and on their 1st character. <br>but all otions will be discused as needed<br><br>Oaken Nightshade, guild Treasurer and Stand-in Events coordinator...
