Dark Elf Wizard!<br>Also, We do have full permission to create the Clash! on the new server.  We are not limited to just one server.  I should simply have to petition our guild be added shortly after the server is up... and our guild we be online in the new race war server! <br>It should be a blast due to the sheer number of us that will actually get to play together all in the same areas - and at about the same lvls!<br>Looking forward to it!<br>Drefan (Not sure what my Dark Elfs name will be yet ;)
