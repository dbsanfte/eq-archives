Drefans right race war is gonna be the coolest its damn fun actually getting to protect your city from swarms of real thinking people in a role playing atmosphare without having to worry about lvling at all, me drefan and marrius are all lvl 5 and we can get plenty of kills.  I got my first taste of action today in a guerilla operation of 12 de (2 groups of 6) entering freeport via the sewers to the docks where we tasted the blood of the "Pinkies", the new term for sissy humns ;).  I am happy to report that not once did i die and i slew 3 of the enemy (2 humans and a dwarf, why the dwarf was helping the humans i do not know) before having to use a fade hide med gate combo i made up myself ;) (am i good or what?).  once home i was called upon to protect the pass to the e commons from an attack, while i did not get any kills there i assisted in many.  All in all its a damn fun server if u chose to play i suggest a magic user of some kind belonging to one of the dark races (dark elf, troll, ogre) for sever reasons 1. Neriak is the best guarded city against attacks in the game, it has wondering guards and is so long from one end of the zone to the area most populated with hunters that word is called out that a human has entered the zone and a repelent party is formed before the human can even reach the hunting grounds plus the zone is damn dark and without atleaast infra vision you get lost quick.  2. We have the best area in teh game at our disposal, we have a hunting group that is good up to about lvl 12 (im assuming) and a dungeon that can only be accessed through our zone.  3. We are closest to the action and yet most cut off from attacks  (because of reasons previously stated) of any of the other races. and 4. We have all of spell casting classes AND the strongest warriors not to mention shadow knights, clerics, shamans, and rouges available to our team. Also i suggest using anon it is better that when you enter e freeport they cant just do a who dark elf and see if a dark elf is there ).  Well thats enough writting for now i probably wont go back on E'Ci unless i get damn bored of this (which i doubt) again (assuming the Race War server goes up immediatly after the race war code is removed from the test server). <br>Any typos or misspellings i apologize for now i leave you with my geneaology )<br>Benedict of CLASH begot Dworkin, Dwarven Paladin of E'CI begot Jullian, Barbarian Shaman of E'CI begot Flym, Gnome Wizard of E'CI begot Degauss, Dark Elf Wizard of the TEST SERVER soon to beget Degauss, Dark Elf Wizard of tthe RACE WAR SERVER ;) <br>Its almost like reading the Bible... <br>Disclaimer: Any persons who were offended by the last statement do not read on.  This is your only warning!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>... Only better )<br>see i think of the feelings of others!
