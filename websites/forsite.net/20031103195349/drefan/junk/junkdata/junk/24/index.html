Some may have noticed a few Dark Elven Clashmen have chosen to<br>move into the guildhall of DSoC. This is by no means a move to be<br>considered as abandonment, for CLASH and DSoC are essentially<br>one grand entity. The main reason for Dark Elves to reside in DSoC<br>is to allow the player to roleplay as a Dark Elf in a more traditional<br>enviroment. And more importantly, to gather all of our Father's<br>creations together to better serve him.<br><br>Vorn - Patriarch of DSoC
