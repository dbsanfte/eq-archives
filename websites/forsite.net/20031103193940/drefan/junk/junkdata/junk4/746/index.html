Well, i will be gone until Saturday Afternoon around 5:30pm EST right before the Raid, i will be at my Dad's house until then. <br><br>Please keep News and Posts updated, because all he has is the internet there, no IRC, ICQ, EQ! Nothing, so all i can do is Reply to Posts while i am there, so i will see you all then, and i hope to get some really sweet shit at the Najena Raid! Good Night.<br><br>Belix Murasame
