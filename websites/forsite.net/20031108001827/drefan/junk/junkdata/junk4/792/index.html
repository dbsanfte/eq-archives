We all know Race War will be up in a couple weeks now, and that it is being tested right now on the test server. I decided to see how cool race war will actually be so i decided to play a gnome warrior on the test server. I had one of the the funnest times ive ever had on EverQuest fighting the elves. It was awesome, like an all out 20 on 20 war, and then the server went down hehe. I just wanted to tell you guys how KICK ASS this server is gonna be. also a plus, people are WAY more generous, they will give you free weapons and charge you nearly nothing for things that cost alot because they want their team to be strong and kick ass.<br><br>Jietz, Warlord of CLASH
