A lot of people seem to want to have a dungeon run. I was thinking maybe we could do Najena again. A lot of people are actually perfect for this level and a lot of the lower levels will have a lot more fun this time around. We could always do Permafrost though, as of right now I think either of those would be good. So what do you guys think about a dungeon run this upcoming saturday around 2pm est or so in one of those dungeons. Although I need replies on what dungeon you would like.
