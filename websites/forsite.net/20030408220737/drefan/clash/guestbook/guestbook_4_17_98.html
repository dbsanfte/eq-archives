<i>Nice web page,  and always changing.   You need to know one thing.
I am not an "Initiate", and will not be subjected to "hazzing".
If you are truly a guild which is beyond rank, and most of your
members are carry overs from UO, then why subject anyone to 
"hazzing"  who has played with clash men after your UO guild broke 
up?  I don't care if I'm a member or not,you can take me off of 
your initiate column.   Thanks, Belay</i><br>
