   I just got back from my to week vacation in North Carolina and it seems while i was gone a lot happened. Can someone fill me in on what happened with that crusade thing. <br>   I am kinda sorry that Archamis left while i was gone, he was a decent guy. Well eventhough i missed all this stuff at least i got a tan cya all in everquest tommorrow or maybe the day after.<br><br>  Alexius, sunburned monk of Clash
