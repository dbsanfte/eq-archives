Just letting everyone know, I have been playing on the test server testing out the Race War software and have been having a blast!<br>Yesterday, a small group of us (Dark Elves) infiltrated the Freeport homeland and got our first taste of battle.  It was an absolute rush (much more so than simple fighting npc creatures ;)  Hunting, battle tactics completely change when fighting against real players - Enchanters are excellent assassins (with their ability to look like the enemy) and area effect spells now have a use (other than suicide for the caster - since players dont always realize who just nuked them with a spell until it is too late ;) (where npcs immediately swarm the caster of an area effect spell)<br>I took out about 5 hummies and I died about 3 times.  The humans were chicken and didn't want to fight on our turf or even neutral ground, they waited for us on their property and ran to the guards for help.<br>One really good battle had 7 DE's against about 14 humans.  We were outnumbered, out leveled and in their area.  Needless to say we got slaughtered, but we did put up a good battle and were not afraid to charge in and go up against superior numbers.  (we lost 4 - we killed about 5)<br>I encourage everybody to play on the test server and try it out.  Pump your char to around lvl 4 or 5 then head out player hunting ;)<br>Drefan (Naazgul - DE Wiz on the Test Server - soon to be Drefuse - DE Wiz on the Race War Server ;)<br>
