Awakening Project - http://www.dtcomputers.com/awaken/<br>Asheron's Call - http://www.turbinegames.com/asherons-call/<br><br>These two worlds may be worth a visit. Both are 1st person perspective.<br>They are going into beta-testing shortly. Check the beta sections there.<br><br>To get involved in Awakening Project, you need to mail your info in with<br>a $5 check. No other fees to be involved in the beta test. There will be<br>multiple races and classes in this game.<br><br>Asheron's Call has a simple online beta application. It appears AC will<br>be humans only, with 3 different heritage groups. I haven't spent to <br>much time looking at it.<br><br>Although we don't intend to be involved in other games besides <br>EverQuest (time and money considerations), we may want to <br>experiment with the beta tests. Check them out and see if you<br>might want to be involved. I would like to know what others think<br>of these games.<br><br>Vorn - Patriarch of DSoC
