You guys are killing me...I want to stay on E'ci because of my limited play time (cant' possibly play 2 chars at the same time) and I am beginning to grow fond of Rag!  But you guys are making it sound like sooo much fun to play on the Race War Server...Im beginning to waver, Doh!<br><br>Maybe I will try out the test server and just see.<br><br>Rag<br>
