<FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Beliefs:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>CLASH is a guild that believes 'Chaos'
is the one true path. It is that belief that allows us to accept any type
of adventurer that we feel can benefit CLASH.&nbsp; We desire to have members
for any situation that could confront us on Norrath.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Rank:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Rank within CLASH is non-existent,
except for labeling initiates. All active members will have a say in events,
with some members having particular functions within the guild which will
add weight to their input depending on the situation. Initiates MAY become
members shortly after adventuring with guild members online.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Multiple guild memberships:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>We will not be accepting members of
other guilds into CLASH. Joining other guilds while a member of CLASH is
also not acceptable. If a member has the desire to leave the guild, it
will be granted. However, the individual will not be accepted back at a
later time. We currently have no plans to use spies to infiltrate other
guilds.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Player killing:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>So far it appears there will be a switch
that allows for PKing, or for immunity from it. Most of us will have the
switch set to 'no PKing'. We are more concerned with roleplaying in Norrath.&nbsp;
Of course, exceptions may apply here if needed in a strictly roleplaying
aspect, not senseless slaughter.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Cheating:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Cheating in any manner is NOT roleplaying.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Real world outlook:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Most of the guild members here are
very busy with education and employment. We take the available time we
have very seriously, and do not wish to be burdened down with excessive
rules. We wish to have a guild that feels authentic to the fantasy era
(character names, roleplaying technique, etc...). To avoid any dissatisfaction
for anyone, we are currently looking for mature roleplayers that have the
same desires as we do. We are trying to make a large guild, so at least
some of us will be online most of the time.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Gaining membership:</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Applications will be screened for completeness
and content. Initiate status will be granted upon satisfactory review of
name, comments, and answered questions. Initiates may become Members after
adventuring awhile with Members online. Currently, three founding Members
must agree to accept the individual, without any adament objections.</FONT></FONT>
<P><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>Code of Clash! (in order of importance)</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>1. Loyalty to all Clash members regardless
of race, class, alignment, or sex.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>2. Loyalty to all DSoC members regardless
of race, class, alignment, or sex.</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (NO exceptions
- even to the extremes of Paladins and Shadow Knights)</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>3. To live adventurously. (we do not
believe in steady employment)</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>4. Loyalty to Clash allies. (unless
it interferes with 1 and/or 2)</FONT></FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Kelt"><FONT SIZE=+2>5. To NOT be involved in player-killing.
(exceptions may apply here if needed)</FONT></FONT>
