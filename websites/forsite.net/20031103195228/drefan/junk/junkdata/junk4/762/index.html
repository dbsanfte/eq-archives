Hail Everyone!<br><br>I'm posting this in hopes of getting some help here.  In order to further Mynar's functionality in the clan, I need to get the enchant silver spell from Neriak and my defense spell, Mircyl's Animation from High Pass.  I'm currently in Greater Faydark and don't have the ability to get into Neriak and Highpass without dying.  I believe both spells cost around 4.5pp each.  I'm willing to go broke and pay 12pp if someone will round up these two spells for me and deliver them ... I am willing to meet in Freeport instead of Faydwer.  I'm normally only online for an hour or two at night weekdays because of  my work schedule.  If anyone would be willing to assist me, I'd appreciate it.<br><br><br>Mynar - 8th lvl Enchanter and Officer of CLASH!<br>aka Argonn - 11th lvl Ranger
