          My title is Associate Cabana Boy. I am tasked with mixing frozen tropical 
          confections, changing towels, keeping the strange floating objects out 
          of the pool, and being extra nice to the female octogenarian guests. 
          Oh, wait. That was my old job. My NEW job is Associate Game Designer, 
          EQ Live. What that means is that instead of creating drinks and playing 
          a lot of shuffleboard, I create content and play a lot of shuffleboard. 
          </font></p>

          Now that the world of EQ has been stabilized for awhile, did the game 
          turn out the way you thought it would be? </font></p>

          I had a pretty clear picture how the game would be early in beta. I 
          didn't expect that it would be quite this popular, we're getting close 
          to half a million units sold now, which is pretty damned impressive. 
          Just like anyone else who plays the game, I can find things to fault 
          about EQ, but if you step back and look at the game as a whole, it's 
          a masterpiece. And we are working hard to correct a lot of those perceived 
          faults. EQ isn't done yet and that is one of the great things about 
          it. As long as we can keep power to the servers, we can improve the 
          game, and fully intend to. </font></p>

          Well, yes, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. I can say 
          that all the class quests are in the final stages of testing at this 
          time. That means they will be in..soon. </font></p>

          Do you agree that many of the planes items are quite underpowered with 
          the addition of so many easier to obtain Kunark items? Any chance that 
          any of these items might get an upgrade?</font></p>

          That's a given. We've got Velious to get out the door first, then we 
          fully intend to go back in and retune the Planes. That includes the 
          difficulty of the ultimate encounters in there, as well as revamping 
          the equipment. </font></p>

          Are there any plans to make 'Detect Traps' more applicable? For example, 
          identifying floor traps? </font></p>

          We've got an idea we're working on right now that will make Sense and 
          Disarm Traps work just like a player would expect. And traps to use 
          them on. Game wide. How's that for a teaser? ;) </font></p>

          Are you saying they are going to actually be ADDING traps to the current 
          world? Will they be changing the few current ones to actually do damage? 
          </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999"><b>[Kendrick]</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
          We've rethought the concept of traps, or rather, someone here had an 
          epiphany that should make traps do what they traditionally do in RPG's. 
          It's still in the concept stage at this point, but to partially answer 
          you question, Sense Traps will sense traps and disarm traps will disarm 
          traps, and traps will be a lot more..dynamic. </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFCC00"><b>[Safehouse 
          Enquirer]</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
          Would there ever be a chance to change the 'consideration' command to 
          accurately report if a mob can see you or not? For example, why would 
          a mob be 'scowling' at me if he can't even see me? </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999"><b>[Kendrick]</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
          It is a quirk with the way factions are set up. Factions work on yours 
          and the target's race, in addition to any faction assigned to the mob. 
          Any mob tagged &quot;no faction&quot; will tend to scowl even if they 
          can't see you. We can't go through and change all &quot;no faction&quot; 
          to some faction, for a number of reasons. Besides, to me, it's one of 
          the cooler parts of mastering the class, learning what can and can't 
          see you. There should be no absolutes. </font></p>

          Will 'apply poison' ever be changed to a 'time based' skill instead 
          of a 'failure' skill? </font></p>

          Any chance for having more than just the standard stat modifiers for 
          weapons or armor? I would enjoy seeing a weapon with a 'Attack + 15' 
          or a shield with 'Defense + 10'. Other suggestions could include 'Movement 
          + 15' or 'Piercing + 5'. </font></p>

          That is an idea I like too, and brought up a few times. The system doesn't 
          really support direct skill boosts via equipment, and would be very 
          difficult to implement. </font></p>

          Is everquest ever thinking about a 'Everquest Newsletter' or something 
          that will describe ongoing GM quests? I still don't understand the entire 
          storylines on the 'Lifting of the Veil' for Kunark, nor the connection 
          between the Plane of Fear, Lanys T'Vil and Kithicor Forest. And with 
          Velious coming up, I would like to understand what is happening. </font></p>

          I'm with you on that 100 percent. One of those faults I mentioned above, 
          to my mind, was the limited depth to the world, and no real place to 
          go for a good solid dose of backstory. Keep an eye on the Everquest.com 
          webpage, there should be more content in the near future that will address 
          a lot of the above. And we're working hard on making the world more 
          vivid while ingame, with expanded dialogues, more &quot;local color&quot;, 
          and an ever increasing staff of Quest Troupe members to further animate 
          the game. I feel strongly that if you &quot;live&quot; in Norrath, there 
          should be a wealth of information available for you to absorb, just 
          to ground you in the world. </font></p>
