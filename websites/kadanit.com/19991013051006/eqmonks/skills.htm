    use weapons, use your hand to hand skill</td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Bind wound</font> - As most everyone know, this
    skill allows you to bandage yourself (if you have bandages) and heal yourself up to 50% of
    your health. Each bandage takes about 10 seconds to use and with a high Bind wound skill
    it will heal about 20 hp. At low levels, you wont be able to afford enough bandages to
    make good use of this skill (a bandage costs about 6 silver). But at high levels bind
    wound is a nice hobby for Monks, though it wont add much to your character... just
    slightly reduce downtime. It can however save your life if you are seriously poisoned and
    losing hp while sitting. In that case it's good to have a few bandages and a high bind
    wound skill.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Dodge</font> - If this skill is successful, you
    will not take any damage from a blow that will otherwise hurt you. Although you get this
    skill at level 1, it will not improve unless you put one point into it at your guild.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Dual wield</font> - If this skill is successful,
    you will strike with your other hand as well. To give an example of how this skill works,
    at level 10 you should strike twice per round about 10% of the time. At level 14 you
    should strike twice per round at least 30% of the time. When your duel wield is 150, you
    will start getting two attacks on a regular basis, this is also true for Double attack.
    One thing that many newbies don't know is that if you carry something in your other hand
    (a light source for example), duel wield will not work, it will not improve and you wont
    strike twice. Not only your skill level in duel wield effects your success rate, your
    Dexterity has a huge influence on whether or not you duel wield and also the opponent you
    are attacking - You will duel wield more often against an opponent with a low AC.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Kick</font> - An extra attack just like the one
    Warriors get.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Mend</font> - One of the more useful skills Monks
    get. If successful, this skill will heal 25% of your maximum health at the moment. It
    recycles every 6 minutes. At low levels this skill will fail often and sometimes even
    worsen your wounds! So it's best not to use it during battle unless you're going to die
    anyway. When your skill reaches 100 (at level 20), it will never fail again.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Throwing</font> - This skill allows you to throw
    items at other creatures dealing a small amount of damage (usually). The only use this
    skill has for a Monk is to fetch monsters. At low levels, you can also finish off running
    mobs with this skill, however throwing daggers are quite expensive for low level Monks.
    You can not retrieve a thrown item, after you throw it - it's forever gone.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 3</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Safe fall</font> - If this skill is successful, you
    will not take damage from falling. A pretty useful skill when running from mobs. If you
    jump from a high cliff, you will gain a little speed while in the air, but you don't want
    to take damage from the fall!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 5</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Round kick</font> - The first of your special
    attacks. This attack and the rest of your special attacks are considered Magical, and can
    be used to hurt monsters that are invulnerable to regular attacks. Round kick will do
    around 13 hp damage with a skill of 50. It recycles at the same speed Kick does, every
    three rounds or so.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 8</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Sneak</font> - When successful, you will walk at
    1/4 your normal speed. Oh, you will also make no sound while moving. So you can sneak
    behind monsters without them knowing you are there and charging you, they will only attack
    you if they can see you. This skill is useful for getting the first hit in combat against
    aggressive monsters (you just sneak behind them and attack). It's very hard to use this
    skill to cross zones safely, I much rather run. It's also very useful in PvP. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 10</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Tiger Claw</font> - Another special move. This one
    does less damage then round kick. Only 11 at a skill of 50 compared to 13 by Round kick.
    However it recycles almost twice as fast. So it's definitely better then Round kick.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 12</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Block</font> - Warriors get Parry at level 12,
    Monks get Block. They are basically the same, if successful, you will not take damage from
    a blow that will otherwise hurt you (same as dodge, but not an upgrade to dodge, works in
    addition). However there is a small difference between the two skills, Block tends to work
    more often, so it's better. You cannot Block blows from creatures that are behind you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 15</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Double attack</font> - If this skill is successful,
    you will strike twice per round. Combined with dual wield, you can get four attack per
    round, however that is very rare. When you max double attack and duel wield (at around
    level 16) you will get 2.5 attack on average. When you get to level 20-25, your average
    will increase to 3. From level 25 you will not see a significant difference in the number
    of attack per round, although nearing level 50 you should be getting 4 attacks per round
    on a regular basis. Not only your skill level in double attack effects your success rate,
    your Dexterity has a huge influence on whether or not you double attack and also the
    opponent you are attacking - You will double attack more often against an opponent with a
    low AC.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 17</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Feign death</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - If this
    skill is successful, you will drop to the ground and play dead and any the monsters nearby
    will react to you as if you were dead - leave you alone. If you see the message 'Name has
    fallen to the ground' that means you FAILED! You will be successful more often if you stop
    attacking the monster for a few seconds before trying to Feign death. If you're low on
    health and have your back to the monster it also seems to work more often.</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 18</font></td>

  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF0000"></font><font color="#FF8000">Instill doubt</font><font color="#FF0000"> </font><font color="#FFFFFF">- This skill acts as a fear spell. If
    successful, it will cause your target to run away and also do 1-2 points of damage. Not a
    very useful skill as it hardly ever works. </font><font color="#FF0000"></font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 20</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Eagle strike</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - Another
    special move. This one also recycles as fast as Tiger claw, but does more damage. </font>Will
    hit around 23-25 if maxed before getting Dragon Punch.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Dragon punch</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> - Another
    special move. </font>Hits around 35 before getting Flying Kick. Looks like<br>
    Tiger Claw. It recycles as fast as Tiger Claw.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 27</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Disarm</font> - If successful, the monster you are
    fighting will drop the weapon it is using. You can't disarm magical weapons. Against mobs,
    this skill is sometimes useful. The way mobs use weapons is, they only use the damage or
    delay of the weapon if it's better than what they have naturally. Since you only get this
    skill at level 27, you will never fight mobs that have a lower damage base than the weapon
    they are using. But if you're fighting a mob that's holding a fine steel dagger, it will
    hit with a 19 delay for the same damage. In PvP this skill is skill is somewhat useful. As
    things are today, disarming someone in PvP will send their weapon to their inventory
    rather than drop it on the ground (if it's magical, which is always the case after level
    27). </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 30</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Flying kick</font> - The last of your special
    moves. I believe it recycles as fast as Round kick (which means slower then Tiger claw).
    However it does a huge amount of damage. Starts out doing 50, will go up a few points a
    level until maxing just a bit over 100.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" bgcolor="#00FF00"><font color="#FF0000">Level 35</font></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="100%"><font color="#FF8000">Riposte</font> - When you block a hit, riposte has
    a chance of working. If successful, you will not only not take any damage from a hit
    (because you blocked it), you will gain an extra punch. Will usually go off two-three
    times in a battle so it wont make a big difference. But if you get lucky you can punch
    four times than riposte and kick and make it seem like you've just punched 5 times and
    kicked in a row! gotta take a screenshot of that sometime...</td>
