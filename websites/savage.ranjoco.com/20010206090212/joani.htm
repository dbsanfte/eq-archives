<BR><B>Introduction</B><BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00">Who Am I?</FONT>:  The disgruntled generation of neuroticism, pessimism, and occasional psychoticism. <BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00">My Favorites</FONT>:  Eeyore, Marvin the Martian, The X-files, Photography, and spending time with my fiance, Jackson ;) <BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00">My Philosophy</FONT>:  Life sucks, but I can get by with a little positive pessimism.  It goes like this..."things will probably end up sucking, but at least it's predictable."  (The truth is, things usually don't suck, but lower expectations are easier to beat. :)<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00">The Existential Piece</FONT>:  Life is meaningless.  So, in order to create the illusion of happiness, I must create my own meaning.  That's the hard part, but I start by realizing that I'm free to choose my attitude in any given situation.  It makes an innately meaningless life a little more tolerable.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#CCFF00">Music</FONT>:  Currently, I really like Third Eye Blind and Blink 182.  Then there are those old favorites...NIN, Tori Amos, Nirvana, Depeche Mode, Disco, and Funk of the 70's.

<B>My Other Half</B><BR><BR>

This is my fiance, Jackson, posing with our cat, Mau.  We've been together since '94.  We met in our coed fraternity, Alpha Phi Omega.  After much stalking, he finally won me over.  We have fun watching cartoons such as The Simpsons, Ranma 1/2, and Southpark.  We occasionally do those mushy, romantic-type things, like walking in the park, in exchange for me playing Gran Tourismo with him on his Sony Playstation.

<B>Our Dependent</B><BR><br>

This is Mau.  He enjoys eating us out of house and home and "barking" at the squirrels outside.  He has other pastimes such as eating pieces of fuzz he finds on the floor, chasing his spider-on-a-string toy, and waking us up in the morning by sleeping on top of us.  (And he is NOT a small cat.)<BR>

Mau is affectionate and friendly, but there is the matter of the litter box.  We are seriously considering toilet-training him.  We will stop at nothing to make him human. :)  <BR>   

Check this <A HREF="http://www.rainfrog.com/mishacat/toilet.shtml">site</A> for toilet training your cat.

<B>The Real Eeyore</B><BR><BR>

I really like animals because they seem to be so loving, accepting, and approachable, (unlike many people).  Visiting Eeyore at Maymont Park in Richmond, Virginia is another way that I spend my days.  Eeyore seems to enjoy being fed by those passing by and scratching his hind parts on the fence.  Oh, the serenity! ;)
