<p align="center"><strong>We all knows that there are tons&nbsp; of good Playstation games
out there.&nbsp; And with that, tons of webpages out there for many of the domestic psx
games.&nbsp; As imported Japanese games starts to spread thru out the state, I thought
maybe I should put up a <a href="psx/psx.htm">Uncommon Imported Playstion Games page</a>.
&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; so far, I'm only going to put up the games that I've seen myself as
well as uncommon games.&nbsp; The goal is to generate enough interest to some of the games
that may've been overlooked because they are not put out by Squaresoft.&nbsp; Most of the
infomation are from the offical <a href="http://www.scei.co.jp/soft-fr.html">Sony
Playstation softwares</a> site in Japan.&nbsp; That's the best place to go, if you know
Japanese.&nbsp; I do not know ANY Japanese, so please correct any mistakes that I may have
made.</strong></p>

<h2 align="left">Music</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>We listen to diverse range of music.&nbsp; But it's pretty much
anything but country.&nbsp; Like one of the many <a
href="http://www.geocities.com/Area51/5920/country.html">anti-country</a> music page puts
it: Is country music a contradiction in terms?&nbsp; At anyrate, I won't bore you with
what everyone listens to here, you can click on member's biography if it is available on
the main Savage Gang page.&nbsp; There is, however a cool site called <a
href="http://www.kissthisguy.com">misheard lyrics</a>, just check it out. It's really
funny.</strong></p>
