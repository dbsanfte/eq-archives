river fish, sometimes also known as &quot;aroma fish&quot; in Chinese.&nbsp; In
Japan, the fishermen use a type of bird to catch these fishes.&nbsp; They would
tie a knot on the bird's neck so that the birds can't eat what they
caught.&nbsp; Somewhat opposite of foie gras.&nbsp; Here's a <a href="images/ryouri02.jpg">picture</a>

river fish, sometimes also known as &quot;grass fish&quot; in Chinese.&nbsp;
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe they are in the same family as
catfish.&nbsp; I do not care much for this fish as it does have some fishy
taste.&nbsp; This is a common river fish that can be purchased in any Asian
region.<br>

Basically eggs extracted from a cod during the right season.&nbsp; It is usually
dried and packed in a pine box.&nbsp; I believe in that form, the most popular
way to cook it is to roast it and then sliced and serve with draft beer.&nbsp;
My favorite roe will always be sliced shark's roe with sweet mayo.</font>

the order Anguilliformes, There are about 500 species of eel.&nbsp; <font class="f2unbold">Eels
are slender, elongated, usually scaleless fish with long dorsal and anal fins
that are continuous around the tail tip. Some, the snipe eels, have long jaws;
and others, the snake eels, have pointed tails that enable them to burrow
backward into sand or mud. Young eels are transparent, leaflike larvae totally
unlike the adults. Eels are found in all seas, from coastal regions to the
mid-depths. One group, the freshwater eels of the family Anguillidae, live in
freshwater but return to the sea to breed.</font></font><font class="f2unbold" size="3" face="Century Gothic">
Congers&nbsp; or <font color="#FF0000"><b>anago</b></font> are scaleless eels
with large heads, large gill slits, wide mouths, and strong teeth. They are
usually grayish to blackish, with paler bellies and black-edged fins.
Carnivorous fish found in all oceans, sometimes in deep water, conger eels may
grow to a length of about <!--index meters-->
1.8 meters (6 feet).</font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#000000">&nbsp;
Personally, I never had this before, but I imagine this would taste the same as
freshwater eel.&nbsp; Freshwater eel or </font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#FF0000"><b>unagi

in any Japanese restaurants here in the states.&nbsp; It is usually pre-grilled
with teriyaki sauce and used in sushi or unadon (eel over rice).&nbsp; I recommend
trying this if you never had it before.&nbsp; It is delicious well worth the
price.<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/frog1.bmp" width="126" height="87">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#000000">They are quite interesting
and not pleasant to look at for most people.&nbsp; I believe they are also
called angler fish.&nbsp; The thingy on its forehead is used to lure other
creatures close to its striking area.&nbsp; The proper way to clean this fish is
to hang it on the hook, gut it, and let the gravity remove all the
innards.&nbsp; This is to prevent a bitter aftertaste of the flesh that can
result for gutting it on the cutting board.&nbsp; I've never had this before nor
have I ever seen it in any restaurant.&nbsp; I'd rather own it as a pet instead
of eating it.

Chinese name for this fish is &quot;river pig&quot; because they make pig
sounds.&nbsp; This is an infamous fish that carries a poisonous toxin.&nbsp;
This fish has long been praised in Japan as the most delicious of all fishes, it
has also been feared, as improper preparation will kill in a short time.&nbsp;
There is no known cure to this toxin.&nbsp; I believe the Japanese royal family
is not allowed to eat any dish made with fugu.&nbsp; A fugu can fetch about $200
in a restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

not really a eel, but a very long fish.&nbsp; The name is actually referring to
the ones produced in a small region in Japan.&nbsp; There are many other similar
fish from other regions that is available in some Asian grocery stores.&nbsp; I
had this before, they are very easy to clean and they are very meaty.&nbsp; It
is quite good cut into sections and steamed or grilled with soy sauce.<br>
