</font>a number of swift-moving, streamlined food and sport fishes found in
temperate and tropical seas around the world, allied to tunas in the family
Scombridae (order Perciformes). Mackerels are rounded and torpedo-shaped, with a
slender, keeled tail base, a forked tail, and a row of small finlets behind the
dorsal and anal fins. They are carnivorous fishes and feed on plankton,
crustaceans, mollusks, fish eggs, and small fish. They congregate in schools and
swim actively in the upper 25-30 fathoms of the water in the warmer months and
then descend to as deep as 100 fathoms during the winter. They spawn during the
spring and early summer along coastlines. Their eggs average 1 mm (0.04 inch) in
diameter, are buoyant, and drift in the uppermost five fathoms of water.
Mackerels are mostly caught by nets, rather than by angling.&nbsp; Spanish
mackerel, a species of mackerel, is an Indo-Pacific fish said to weigh up to 45
kg (100 pounds).<br>
</font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#0000FF"><b>Scorpion fish</b>
- </font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">This fish looks more like a pet
than a fish.&nbsp; In fact, I believe a popular posionous pet fish,&nbsp; lion
fish belongs to the same family.&nbsp; It is a <font class="f2unbold">bottom-living
marine fish widely distributed in temperate and tropical waters. Sometimes also
called rockfish, or stonefish, because they commonly live among rocks, scorpion
fish are perchlike fish with large, spiny heads and strong, sometimes venomous,
fin spines. The fin spines, with or without venom, can produce deep and painful
wounds.<br>

Their flesh is sold fresh, pickled, or smoked. Caviar consists of salt for
preservation and the eggs, which are stripped from ripe females who are
subsequently released.&nbsp; The better grades of caviar are classified <i>malassol</i>,
Russian for &quot;lightly salted.&quot; Fresh caviar must be stored at between
32º and 45º F (0º and 7º C) or it deteriorates rapidly; for better storage
it is pasteurized. Most true caviar is produced in Russia and Iran, from fish
taken from the Caspian and Black seas.</font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3" color="#000000">
