<p align="left">The Basement is the home of <font color="#800000"><em>The Savage Gang</em></font>. Only the Elite have access to this
sacred shrine dedicated to us. Members of this elite organization
gather every weekend for various activities such as cornering the
real estate market, destroying several civilizations and
rebuilding it in our image, with enough time left to get exotic
Chinese, Italian, or Japanese food.</p>

<p align="left"><I><FONT COLOR="#993333">Where did the name come from?</font></I><BR>
It came from this old amiga game called "SAVAGE" made by Firebird.  It's a crude "Golden Axe" type of horizontal platform game. Jackson is currently experimenting with playing on his PC using an emulator.</P>

<P align="left"><I><FONT COLOR="#993333">When was the group formed?</font></i><BR>
Exact time of the formation is hard to pin point.  But it just happened.  We all sort of met via BBS community and we started to play games together at one of the many BBS parties.  The very first game that most of us remember playing, was Advanced Marvel Super Heros RPG.</p>

<P align="left"><I><FONT COLOR="#993333">What other games do you guys play?</font></i><BR>
Close to the order of appearance:  MSH, Shadowrun, Boulderdash, Shogun, Axis & Allies, Mah Jong, Advanced Civilization, Magic the Gathering, Monopoly, Hacker, Nuclear War, History of the World, Politika, Honors of the Samurai, Age of Renaissance, Cosmic Encounter, and many other games that we only play a few times and games on Super Nintendo, PSX, and PCs.  This may merit its own FAQ in the future.</p>
