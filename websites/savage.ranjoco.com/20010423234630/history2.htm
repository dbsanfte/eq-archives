  &quot;The jewel looks great on you and it probably feels great too
  right?&quot; says Konishki as he hands Mikaniko a Black Pearl Platinum
  Ring.&nbsp; <font color="#000000">As the ash of the burning Hulking Brute
  cooled,&nbsp; This is Mikaniko's first memory of Konishki's aid as she and
  Kashaan took down the orange ape.&nbsp; Being her first time in Frontier
  Mountains, the sight was unusual.&nbsp; The sweet scent of the burning entrails
  delights the savageness within her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Rubbing the precious ring, she remembers the first meeting with Kashaan the
  wise,&nbsp; &quot;The platinum is your friend and yet your worst enemy, tame
  the platinum, you tame the land of Norrath.... if you are quite good at it,
  you can shape the land as well.&quot;&nbsp; says Kashaan as he loaned Mikaniko
  a bag of coins for her skill training.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  The wound of another hulking brute cause a flood that dyed the land around its
  corpse.&nbsp; Mikaniko pulls her fist out of the torso, as her final blow was
  quite fierce and direct, it caused a gaping hole and bloodied her fist.&nbsp;
  The imagery of this fountain of blood numbed her sensation and has no greater
  impact on her as the first time, when wielding a club she bashed a deathfist
  orc pawn with a bone crunching sound that caused an instant death.<br>
  <br>
  The mountain giant tump's huge frame makes a gurgling sound as it fell from
  the assault of </font></span><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font color="#0000FF"><b>the
  three.&nbsp; </b></font>With a forest loop in sight, Konishki rips it off the
  dead giant's ear as another spoil of the war that's pits the giants with their
  small humanoid cousins.<br>
  <br>
  On the other side of the fort, a mountain giant craig and a mountain giant
  brae makes a daring offensive, crushing the first wave of the attack from the inhabitants
  of the Lake of Ill Omen.&nbsp; The carnage was beyond belief as the morale of
  the troops fell when craig pick up a bloody mangled body and using it like a
  morning star.&nbsp; The commander, a ranger of 24th season was knocked
  unconcious as the 'head' of the 'morning star' dislocated and slams into the
  ranger's own head.&nbsp; Brae then caught up with the helpless ranger and tore
  him in two.<br>
  <br>
  As more giants pour out of the fortress like a broken dam bursting open.&nbsp;
  It is apparent that the rest of the inhabitants of the Lake of Ill Omen would
  need to retreat for now.&nbsp; before Kashaan and Konishki gates and Mikaniko
  retreats to LOIO, they knew at that point, the were of SAVAGE.</span></p>
