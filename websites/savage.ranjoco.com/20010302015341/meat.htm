        <p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Beef</b></font>
- Beef is well, Beef.&nbsp; You can get different cuts of beef for different
        type of dish you are going to make.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Kobe beef</b></font> is well known worldwide as
        one of the most expensive beef you can buy.&nbsp; Kobe Beef is a
        legendary delicacy of Japan, a type of beef that is so well marbled that
        it goes right off the charts for Prime grading in any other country. The
        meat ends up looking like it has been left out in the snow because of
        the intensiveness of the white fat marbling, rivals foie gras for
        richness and caloric content, and costs an obscene amount, often $300 a
        pound or more for the real thing from Japan.&nbsp; Kobe beef comes from
        a breed of cattle called Wagyu. In order to earn the
        designation/appellation of &quot;Kobe Beef&quot;, the Wagyu beef must
        come from Kobe, Japan, and meet rigid production standards imposed in
        that prefecture.&nbsp; The &quot;Wagyu beef&quot; designation can
        legally be applied to the meat from any cattle of the Wagyu breed; it's
        a genetic thing, not a place appellation or a reference to how the
        cattle were raised and fed. This breed is genetically predisposed to
        intense marbling, and produces a higher percentage of oleaginous,
        unsaturated fat than any other breed of cattle known in the world.&nbsp;
        </font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3">How does Wagyu beef taste?
        If it's cooked wrong, lousy. Bland. Not too flavorful. Kind of boring.
        If you cook it right? Awesome. Beef foie gras. Smooth, velvety,
        incomparably sweet with a subtle tang of savor that lingers on the
        palate like a rare perfume. It's a Japanese thang, I guess, and a
        Westerner used to eating a huge plate of aged beef (which is also
        something I adore) might not be able to fully appreciate the subtlety of
        Wagyu.&nbsp; And true Kobe beef? Overrated. At ten times the price
        because the cow was raised on expensive land eating expensive Japanese
        grain and beer, the quality is not noticeably better than ordinary Wagyu
        beef that grades out to super-prime. About those legendary cow massages?
        It's in part because they don't have enough room to exercise in a normal
        paddock. American and Australian raised Wagyu cattle that get the
        oleaginous feed and a well designed exercise program grade out just
        fine, and I doubt even the most discerning palate could tell the
        difference if the grade was the same.&nbsp;<br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Mishima beef</b></font> is from the small
        island of Mishima in Japan.&nbsp; The beef is supposedly even more
        tastier then Kobe Beef, and costs even more.&nbsp; I think Mishima beef
        is the root of Wagyu beef.<br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Veal</b></font> comes from calves that's three
        weeks to six months old.&nbsp; The best type is the special fed veal
        which is also known as milk-fed that's about eight weeks old.&nbsp; The
        meat is usually light in color and is a nutrient dense meat which is low
        in fat and calories.<br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Beef cheek meat</font></b> is very tough
        because of all the chewing cows do.&nbsp; The meat needs to be cooked
        for a long time, but the result is an extremely tender and sweet
        tasting meat.<br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Oxtail</b></font> is one of the most economical
        and most flavorful cuts of meat, and one that takes well to marinating
        for days in a hearty mixture of red wine, herbs, and vegetables. The
        longer you marinate the mixture, the more flavorful it will be, but be
        sure it marinates at least 3 days. Oxtail is also a fatty cut -- give
        yourself plenty of time to allow the stew to cook and then cool, so all
        the fat can be skimmed off. Serve this with thick noodles in warmed soup
        bowls, accompanied by a tossed salad, and of course, a robust red wine.<br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Beef tongue</font></b> is an acquired taste,
        which I hope I will never acquire.&nbsp; I think they also serve cured
        tongue in a deli.&nbsp; The fresh tongue is used in other cuisine.&nbsp;
        I've seen recipes for Indonesian, Hungarian, and Mexican dishes.<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#0000FF"><b>Pork</b></font>
- Pork, aka the other white meat is not really a white meat.&nbsp; But I don't
        really care.&nbsp; Here's a list of some pork products featured on Iron
        Chef.<br>
        <br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Tokyo X</font></b> is a breed of pig with
        marbled meat.&nbsp; The hog has the combined features of three breeds
        from China, England and the United States.&nbsp; It is also quite
        expensive, perhaps it's like Kobe Beef but for people who don't eat
        beef.&nbsp; The actual pig itself looks like a breed of Chinese black
        pig which probably contributes the fatness to the Tokyo X breed.&nbsp;<br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Black Pig</b></font>, I believe originated from
        Asia.&nbsp; They are very large and high in fat content .&nbsp; With its
        fantastic lop ears it is often known as the ‘elephant pig’ because
        of the similarity the newly born piglets have to a very small black
        elephant. Viewed from behind, after just being born, their huge ears and
        little straight tail certainly make one think of a baby elephant.</font>&nbsp;
        <font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#000000">Despite its size it
        is both docile and an excellent mother capable of rearing large litters
        and producing excellent bacon for the table. Really much more of a bacon
        pig than the smaller rounder and much chunkier pork pigs.<br>
        </font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#FF0000"><b>Suckling
        Pig </b></font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#000000">is
        usually used for roasting.&nbsp; And usually the whole pig too.&nbsp;
        Personally, I've not had any.&nbsp; I believe they cost about $165 each,
        for a 40 lbs. size.&nbsp; The meat is probably quite tender.<br>
        </font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#FF0000"><b>Kinka
        (Ching Wah) Pig</b></font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#000000">
        is a breed of pig from China and It is small in size, which produce a
        good textured pork.&nbsp; </font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#000000">The
        famous Ching Wah ham is named after the pork and is very expensive if it
        is made authentically.&nbsp;<br>
        </font><font size="3" face="Century Gothic" color="#FF0000"><b>Spare
