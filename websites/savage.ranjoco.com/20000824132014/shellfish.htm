<p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><img border="0" src="images/abalone.gif" align="left" width="100" height="67"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Abalone</b></font>
- Marine snails of the subclass Prosobranchia (class Gastropoda).&nbsp; The
shell has a row of holes on its outer surface.&nbsp; Abalones are one-shelled
snails found in warm seas worldwide.&nbsp; The dishlike shell is perforated near
one edge by a single row of small holes that become progressively filled during
the animal's growth; the last five to nine holes remain open to serve as outlets
for the snail's waste products.&nbsp; The shell's lustrous, iridescent interior
is used in the manufacture of ornaments.&nbsp; The large muscular foot of the
abalone is eaten as a delicacy in several countries.&nbsp; They are quite
expensive; canned abalone can run you about $50 per can.&nbsp; Fresh abalones
are even more expensive.<br>

<b><font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/aoriika.jpg" align="left" width="139" height="67">Aori
Squid</font></b> -&nbsp;Squid is a cephalopod.&nbsp; They may be swift swimmers
or part of the drifting sea life.&nbsp; They range in size from about 1.5cm to
more then 20m.&nbsp; There are many different breeds and many different ways to
cook them.&nbsp; Dried squid is something I always remember eating.&nbsp; They
are usually roasted on top of an open flame and then pulled into strips before consuming.&nbsp; They also sell squid snacks in pouches that can be eaten
immediately.&nbsp; This is a somewhat expensive snack.&nbsp; visit the page at <a href="http://www.taiwansnacks.com">www.taiwansnacks.com</a>
if you want to buy some.&nbsp; Squid ink is known to be used in the making of
pasta.&nbsp; A less known usage, in Iron Chef, is Squid ink ice cream.&nbsp;
Hmmmmm, I
don't know about that.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF">Asyura Oyster</font></b> - They are named after Asyura,
a deity with many faces. The oysters naturally cluster
together and hence appear to have multiple faces. Thus, the
oyster's name.&nbsp; Since the oysters grow in a mix of fresh and salt
water, they are sweet and delicate and do not possess an overly fishy
smell.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b><img border="0" src="images/tiger.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="67">Black
Tiger Prawn</b></font> - The prawns are black and have tiger stripes although
they cook up to a bright red.&nbsp; They are bigger than regular shrimp and have
thicker shells.&nbsp; They are harder to peel, too.&nbsp; Tiger prawns feed
primarily at night.&nbsp; Their diet consists of mollusks, crustaceans, and
polychaete worms.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b><img border="0" src="images/botan.jpg" align="left" width="91" height="67">Botan
Shrimp </b>- </font><font color="#000000">The botan shrimp is a fairly sweet
shrimp and is good when eaten raw.&nbsp; The product usually comes from Hokkaido,
the northern Japanese province.&nbsp; The scientific name seems to be Decapoda
Pandalidae.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Crayfish</b></font> - Also called crawfish or
crawdad.&nbsp; </font><font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3">They
are closely related to the lobster. Over half of the more than 500 species occur
in North America.&nbsp; Nearly all live in fresh water, a few in brackish water
or salt water.&nbsp; It is also known as Ecrevisse in France.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Escargot</b></font> - Famous French snail appetizers
that can cost from $6 to $18&nbsp; for half dozen.&nbsp; The United States
imports $300 million worth of snails annually. 98% of these come in cans. Until
recently, the Europeans have monopolized the snail industry. Presently, the
raising of snails has become an increasingly lucrative and popular business.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b><img border="0" src="images/hamaguri.gif" align="left" width="77" height="67">Hamaguri
Clam </b></font>- also known as Venus clam or Common Orient Clam, is found on
nearly all Japan's shores.&nbsp; These clams are at their best from winter to
spring, and are eaten as sushi, or grilled.&nbsp; They look like regular
clams.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/kenagi.jpg" align="left" width="72" height="67">Kenagi
Crab</font></b> - Another breed of crab from Japan.&nbsp; I think &quot;Kenagi&quot;
means hairy.&nbsp; The pictured crab looks like it is meaty.&nbsp; Perhaps when
I go to Japan I can get a taste of all the different crabs they have to
offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/spiny1.jpg" align="left" width="100" height="123">Lobster </font></b>- </font><font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3">any
of numerous marine crustaceans (order Decapoda) constituting the families
Homaridae (or Nephropsidae), true lobsters; Palinuridae, spiny lobsters, or sea
crayfish; Scyllaridae, slipper, Spanish, or shovel lobsters; and Polychelidae,
deep-sea lobsters. All are marine and benthic (bottom-dwelling), and most are
nocturnal. </font> <font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Females
are ready to lay eggs when about five years old. Sperm are transferred from
males to females in summer, but fertilization does not occur until spring. A
female lays 3,000 or more eggs, which remain attached to her swimmerets until
they hatch several months later. Unlike adults, the young, about 1 cm (0.4 in.)
long, swim freely for about 12 days and then descend to the bottom, where they
remain. Some lobsters may live for 50 years. Young lobsters are preyed upon
especially by dogfish, skates, and cod. The principal enemy of the adult lobster
is man.</font>&nbsp; <font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3">Unlike
true lobsters,&nbsp; spiny lobsters(Palinuridae, pictured), so called because of their
very spiny bodies, do not have large claws. Usually only the abdomen is eaten
and is marketed as lobster tail. The antennae are strongly developed. Most
species live in tropical waters.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/matsuba.gif" align="left" width="100" height="77">Matsuba
Crab</font></b> - <font color="#000066">The Matsuba crabs are in fact a
species of spider crab. Caught in the Japan Sea using dragnets, these crabs can
be boiled, grilled or eaten raw, but they are best boiled plain to make the most
of their natural flavor.&nbsp;
A Winter delicacy in Japan.&nbsp; The long-legged crabs, are considered the king
of winter dishes. A gourmet is content by eating just this crab with a glass of
sake.<br>
<br>
</font><b><font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/syako.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="59">Mantis
Shrimp </font></b>- Stomatopods are predatory crustaceans that live in the
shallow waters of tropical and subtropical seas. They are not closely related to
shrimps or the other decapod crustaceans, although they are commonly known as
&quot;mantis shrimps&quot; due to the raptorial appendages that they use to
efficiently capture and subdue prey. These animals range in size from 1-2 cm to
more than 30 cm in some <em>Lysiosquilla</em> sp., and are one of the most
aggressive and pugnacious of all creatures. Some mantis shrimps are feared and
loathed as notorious pests by reef aquarists, and some species may be so
abundant in commercial shrimp beds that they become major predators of the
shrimps.</font>&nbsp; <font face="Century Gothic" size="3">Divers call mantis
shrimp &quot;thumb splitters.&quot; The impact from a blow from the claws and
head is only slightly less than the impact of a .22 caliber bullet.&nbsp; Mantis
shrimp can grow up to about ten inches in length and are fast moving. They eat
crabs, anemones, and fish, among other things, and if kept in an aquarium with
other fish, they will eventually eat them all. They dig burrows and live in
crevices in reefs and rocks.</font></p>

<b><font color="#0000FF">Octopuss </font></b>- Eight-armed cephalopod (octopod)
mollusk of the order Octopoda.&nbsp; One of my favorite sushi, which is one of
the sushi that's usually cooked when served.&nbsp; The typical octopus has a
saccular body: the head is only slightly demarcated from the body and has large,
complex eyes and eight contractile arms. Each arm bears two rows of fleshy
suckers that are capable of great holding power. The arms are joined at <!--index center-->
their bases by a web of tissue known as the skirt, at the centre of which lies
the mouth. The latter organ has a pair of sharp, horny beaks and a filelike
organ, the radula, for drilling shells and rasping away flesh.&nbsp; They also
have ink sac that can be used for cooking.</font><font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3"><br>

<b>
<font color="#0000FF"><img border="0" src="images/tairagai.jpg" align="left" width="120" height="63">Pen Shell Clam
</font></b>- Also known as razor shell clam, it supposedly has the texture of
scallops and the taste of abalone.&nbsp; The size of pen shell is about as large
as an open palm.&nbsp; It is usually prepared raw as sashimi or grilled
plain.&nbsp; They cost about 500 Yen a piece last time I checked.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Rock Crab</b></font> <font color="#000066">- The
Featured Theme for the Special New York Battle between Morimoto and Bobby Flay
of Food Network.&nbsp; I think Rock Crab is also another product from Maine.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF">
<b>Scallop</b></font> <font color="#000066">- Also known as fan shell, it is a
marine bivalve mollusk.&nbsp; The large white muscular part of the shell is
actually the part being eaten, as the rest of the body spoils really easily when
harvest.&nbsp; I think the name is also referring to that part of the fan
shell.&nbsp; Dried scallops are a gourmet item used in Asian cooking and can
fetch high price.&nbsp; I saw them for sale in Washington D.C. for about $100 a
pound.</font><br>
<br>
<b>
<font color="#0000FF">Sea </font></b><font color="#0000FF"><b>Cucumber</b></font><font color="#000066">
- one of the marine invertebrates, with soft cylindrical body </font>and often
warty, thus resembling a cucumber.&nbsp; A number of sea cucumbers exude a toxin
that is lethal to small animals but not to humans; South Sea islanders place sea
cucumber juices in water to kill or stupefy fish.&nbsp; Dishes that I've seen,
usually have it stewed in a hot pot with other seafood.<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Sea Urchin</b></font> <font color="#000066">- The spiny
critter doesn't really look edible.&nbsp; But at any rate, it is the inside
that's being used.&nbsp; Also known as Uni in Japanese,&nbsp; it has the
consistency of yellow mud, and probably taste like it too.&nbsp; Usually comes
in a small wooden box and is very expensive depending on the grade.</font><br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b><img border="0" src="images/takaashi.jpg" align="left" width="139" height="76">Takaashi
Crab</b></font> - The largest crab in the world, which, when its legs are
extended, measures more than three meters long!&nbsp; I've never saw the episode
that used this crab, but I heard that they had to roll the crabs out in a cart
due to its massive size.&nbsp; I've seen a smaller size crab that runs about
10,000 Yen (about $100) each.&nbsp; A Japanese restaurant in Hokkaido that
serves Takaashi crab charges 15,000 Yen per person (three people minimum).<br>
<br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b>Taraba
Crab</b></font> - Also known as king crab.&nbsp; Probably similar to Alaskan
King Crab.&nbsp; <br>
<font color="#0000FF"><b><br>
<img border="0" src="images/watari.jpg" align="left" width="101" height="67">Watari
Crab</b></font> - Similar to blue crabs from the east coast here.&nbsp; Except
it is not blue.&nbsp; Also knows as &quot;swimming crab&quot;.<br>
