        July 10th<br>
        Last week was fun, Ron's visit was pivital in
        spreading ironchef fans all over.&nbsp; The octopus battle proves to be
        somewhat graphic as I had hoped.&nbsp; The shark fin battle coming up
        maybe using dry ones as I have never seen fresh ones before.&nbsp; Also
        read that Harrison Ford's character in the Bladerunner was a replicant!
        Wow! Anyway, my goal for today is all the different mushrooms in the <a href="fruit.htm">veggie section</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        June 26th<br>
        wow! what a show last night.&nbsp; Generally
        I love almost every bit of it.&nbsp; I'm sick of same commercials thou (Tweety
        Bird, Rolling Rock, and Ener-X).&nbsp; I think they play the same three
        commercials during every break.&nbsp; Supposedly Bobby Flay was shocked
        several times but they edited down to one.&nbsp; Pretty funny. eh?&nbsp;
        The kid segment was down right creepy. the funniest part was kid's
        sister. &quot;She ate everything Tommy made&quot;, yeah, no kidding from
        the look of it.&nbsp; The deck was stacked against Bobby Flay from the
        start thou.&nbsp; It'd seem like the Zagats are bias already, and with a
        fan picked from the audience, an Ironchef fan nevertheless.&nbsp; But
        hey, it's just a conspiracy theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><br>

        Looks like Food TV had the wrong schedule, but I corrected
        them.&nbsp; Don't forget the Ironchef special is today!&nbsp; I'm
        actually working right now, that's why I have time to update this
        page.&nbsp; I should be able to finish vegetables tomorrow, or er, some
        times next week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><font color="#FF00FF"><br>

        </font>Sorry for the downtime, the server lost its static ip address or
        something.&nbsp; But we're up and running now.&nbsp; The goal for today
        is to finish fruits &amp; veggies icon.&nbsp; I also added a news <a href="archive.htm">archive</a>
        section to chop down the main page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><font color="#FF00FF">

        partial fruits and vegetables, but no icon yet.&nbsp; Perhaps
        soon?&nbsp; Anyone wants to help me with other sections?&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><font color="#FF00FF"><br>

        </font>Meat section is complete, but someone please check my spelling
        and grammar.&nbsp; I'm going back to work on the shellfish section,
        hopefully I can finish it today.&nbsp; I won't be able to update the
        page tomorrow as we are having a &quot;team building&quot; with my boss
        tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><font color="#FF00FF"><br>

        </font>My goal is to do some pork today. And fix spelling and missing

        </font>Actually, I added all the shellfish in
        the shellfish section.&nbsp; Now, I'm not biology major, so I was
        wondering if I put some of the stuff in the right area or not?&nbsp; For
        example, are sea urchin, sea cucumber, and squid considered to be shellfish?&nbsp;
        Please correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp; Check out some of the meat that
        I've added too.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 I thought Iron Chef was going to lose the asparagus battle.&nbsp; The salted green tea asparagus does
        look rather er, untasty.&nbsp; On a side note, all animated iron chef
        icons are made by me, so it will take a while to add new buttons.&nbsp;
        My goal is one a day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" width="36" height="10"><br>

        </font><font face="Tahoma">My goal today is to add more information on
        my <a href="ironchef.htm">iron chef</a> link.&nbsp; I was thinking about
        how I can make it original; thus, I came up with the &quot;ingredients&quot;
        of iron chef.&nbsp; I'd list exotic ingredients with descriptions and
        pictures.&nbsp; How about that?&nbsp; So, look for it at the end of the
        day.&nbsp; By the way, there's no game tonight or tomorrow due to

        June 6th 2000&nbsp;<br>
        </font>I made some subtle changes.&nbsp; Also, for some reason Fuji TV
        is shutting down all the Iron Chef websites.&nbsp; Good thing I grabbed a
        copy of <a href="http://www.ironchef.com">www.ironchef.com</a> content.<br>
        <br>
        I will not use slimfast again. You know how when you eat
        asparagus and you go to the bathroom?&nbsp; Picture this same thing,
        but smells like making
        coffee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color="#FF00FF"><img border="0" src="images/p1.gif" alt="pepsei" width="36" height="10"><br>

        </font>The
        counter has been added again.&nbsp; Some new titles have been assigned to
        our members.&nbsp; My future goal is to develop a way for you to
        edit your own title.&nbsp; The goal for today is to make the Iron Chef
        link into an animated gif.&nbsp; Also, let me know if there's a better
        color scheme for this title page or suggestions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

        Just click on the image and you'll go there.&nbsp; The page is not done
        yet, but eventually, it will.&nbsp; I'm trying to figure out how margins
