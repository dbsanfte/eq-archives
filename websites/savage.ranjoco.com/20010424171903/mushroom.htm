- They are elegant, earthy, enigmatic.&nbsp; And according to the mushroom
        council, they're idea for today's contemporary cooking styles and so at
        home in classical cuisine.&nbsp; Great cooks are well aware of
        mushrooms' versatility and creative potential.&nbsp; Gourmet and wild
        mushrooms are very popular recently, and they all possess different
        texture and taste that can easily be used to compliment any ingredients
        in cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><font color="#FF0000"><b>White
        mushrooms</b></font> vary in color from creamy white to light brown and
        in sizes from small (button) to jumbo. They are pleasingly mild and
        woodsy; their flavor intensifies when cooked. Freshly picked White
        mushrooms have closed veils (caps that fit closely to the stem) and
        delicate flavor; mature Whites, with open veils and darkened caps,
        develop a richer, deeper taste.<br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Shiitakes</b></font> range in color from tan to
        dark brown with broad, umbrella-shaped caps, wide open veils and tan
        gills. Shiitake caps have a soft, spongy texture. When cooked, Shiitake
        mushrooms are rich and woodsy with a meaty texture.&nbsp; Personally, I
        prefer the dried instead of fresh kind.&nbsp; It seems to have more
        aroma and taste.</font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><br>
        <font color="#FF0000"><b>Matsutake</b></font><font color="#000000"> is also
        known as &quot;pine mushroom&quot;.&nbsp; as the wild variety is known
        to grow under a pine tree.&nbsp; The matsutake has a fragrant spicy
        sweet pine scent with a somewhat earthy taste.&nbsp; It is usually used
        in soups or stews and with rice and other vegetable dishes.&nbsp; There
        is a store that sells that for about $25 for 4 oz., but it had the
        scientific name of Armillaria Ponderosa with a picture of whitish
        mushroom.&nbsp; Looking at a Japanese site, I came up with Tricholoma
        matsutake (or Tricholoma nauseosum) with a picture of brownish mushroom
        which I think is more accurate.<br>

        are described by a cluster of dark fronds with firm and supple texture
        at base, becoming slightly brittle and crumbly at the edges. Maitake
        mushrooms have a distinctive aroma with a rich, woodsy taste.Maitake is
        indigenous to the north-eastern part of Japan. For hundreds of years,
        this rare and tasty mushroom has been prized in traditional Japanese
        herbology. This mushroom has a rippling form with no caps and grows in
        clusters at the foot of Japanese oak trees, giving it an image of
        butterflies dancing to the Japanese eyes, thus named &quot;Maitake&quot;
        literally &quot;dancing mushroom&quot;. Others say that Maitake is so
        named because people who found it in the deep mountains knew its
        delicious taste and health benefits and thus began dancing with joy. In
        fact, in the feudal era of Japan it was exchanged with the same weight
        of silver by local lords who in turn offered it to their big boss; the
        SHOGUN. The botanical name of Maitake is &quot;<i>Grifola frondosa</i>&quot;
        referring to a mythical beast which is half-lion and half-eagle. Maitake
        is the only edible mushroom among all Monkey's Bench family. Sometimes
        it grows over 50 pounds. That is why this giant mushroom is called the
        &quot;King of Mushrooms&quot;<br>

        must be the prize for all mushroom hunters. The most sought-after of the
        truffles, it is found in very limited areas, mostly in northern Italy,
        where the finest certainly grow. Trained dogs or pigs are necessary to
        locate it. Its season is from late autumn to winter. Very little needs
        doing to the truffle beyond a careful brushing. If they are to be used
        fresh, very finely sliced slivers, quickly cooked, are best for the
        intensity of the flavor.&nbsp;<br>

        mushroom is regarded by mushroom hunters as a great prize; it has a
        wonderful nutty flavor and is extremely versatile. It can also grow very
        big and weight as much as 2 lb 2oz.&nbsp; The season is Spring to
        Autumn.&nbsp; This is one of the most versatile mushrooms and it can be
        used in many cooked dishes: fish, meat, fried vegetables</font>
