        <p align="left"><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Fruits</b></font>
- Fruits are good for you and taste good too.&nbsp; Many of my favorite fruits
        are not available here.&nbsp; But recently, New York has proven to be a good
        source of exotic tropical fruits.&nbsp; Fruits are used in some Iron
        chef battles.&nbsp; Common fruits used include <font color="#FF0000"><b>apple,
        banana, melon, peach, pear, pineapple, orange, strawberry, and
        watermelon</b></font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Mango</font></b>, member of the cashew family (Anacardiaceae),
        one of the most important and widely cultivated fruits of the tropical
        world, considered indigenous to eastern Asia.&nbsp; This is one of the
        favorite fruits from my childhood.&nbsp; There are a couple of different
        types with various sizes available.&nbsp; The Mexican mango is the type
        that is available here in the states.&nbsp; It was hard to find mango ten years ago, so
        we are very lucky.&nbsp; The fruit is very sweet and juicy with a large
        hairy seed.&nbsp; If you never had mango before, go out to your local
        grocery store and buy a case.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Papaya</font></b><font color="#000000"> is also
        a tropical fruit.&nbsp; The tree looks like a palm tree, but due to its shorter
        stature, the papaya is harvested more easily. Papaya is harder to find in
        the supermarkets here.&nbsp; The ones I've seen in the states are really small
        compared to ones that I've seen in Taiwan.&nbsp; The seeds
        look like Salmon Roe, but are dark brown in color.&nbsp; The fruit has a
        scent that I do not like much, but I really&nbsp; enjoy the special Papaya
        drink.&nbsp; Just blend papaya, milk and sugar together and
        it is delicious.</font><br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Pickled Plum </font></b><font color="#000000">(umeboshi
        in Japanese) is a traditional Japanese item.&nbsp; Plum is eaten every
        day in Japan and it is used to make sweet plum wine and liquor.&nbsp; An umeboshi
        is a sour, pickled plum, soaked in vinegar. Many Japanese believe the
        umeboshi is a healthy and sustaining food. During Japan's feudal
        period, samurai warriors would eat an umeboshi each day to maintain
        their energy during a battle.<br>
        <br>
        </font></font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Vegetable</b></font>
- vegetables are a good source of vitamins if cooked properly.&nbsp; There are
        quite a few colorful vegetables available in Southeast Asia.&nbsp; Many
        has appeared in Ironchef.&nbsp; There are also more common type of
        vegetables used which includes <font color="#FF0000"><b>asparagus, bean
        sprouts, bell
        pepper, broccoli, cabbage, carrot, chestnut, corn, cucumber, eggplant, green
        onion, leeks, lettuce, mushroom, potato, pumpkin, rice, soy beans,
        spinach, sweet potato, tomato, turnip, and yam.<br>
        Avocado </b></font>is also known as alligator pear, </font><font class="f2unbold" face="Century Gothic" size="3">a
        tree native to the Western Hemisphere from Mexico south to the Andean
        regions.&nbsp; The fruit is exceedingly variable in shape, size, and
        color, with certain Mexican races no larger than hen's eggs and those of
        other races sometimes 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 pounds) in weight. The form
        varies from round <!--index color-->
        to pear-shaped with a long, slender neck, and the color ranges from
        green to dark purple. The single large seed, with two cotyledons, is
        round to conical. The fruit's outer skin is sometimes no thicker than
        that of an apple and sometimes is coarse and woody in texture. It
        protects the greenish <!--index flavor-->
        or yellowish flesh, buttery in consistency and with a rich, nutty
        flavor. In some varieties the flesh contains as much as 25 percent of
        unsaturated oil. It is often eaten in salads, whence the name salad
        fruit. Mashed avocado is the principal ingredient of guacamole, a
        characteristic sauce in Mexican cuisine. Avocados provide thiamine,
        riboflavin, and vitamin A.<br>
        </font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><b><font color="#FF0000">Bamboo
        shoots </font></b>came from the young sprout of bamboo trees.&nbsp; The
        inner soft tissue is a delicacy and often used in soups or stew.&nbsp;
        Bamboo can be eaten fresh or processed by canning and freezing. Fresh
        bamboo has a crisp, sweet flavor. It is used in Oriental cooking as an
        extender because it will take on the flavor of whatever it is cooked
        with. A bamboo shoot has about the same nutritional value as an onion
        and is a good source of fiber.&nbsp; Most of the bamboo in the U.S. is
        canned although some fresh bamboo is beginning to reach the public.
        Gourmets report that once a person has tasted fresh bamboo it is
        difficult to switch back to canned even though fresh is much more
        expensive. Generally the U.S. public has indicated a preference for
        fresh foods--asparagus--for example, and is willing to pay a good deal
        more to get fresh vegetables. The price for fresh bamboo on the West
        Coast is about $3 per pound. It is considerably more expensive on the
        East Coast.&nbsp; I remembered when I was younger in Taiwan, we would
        drive for hours to pick fresh &quot;winter bamboo shoots&quot; .&nbsp;
        The taste is of course unmatched by canned variety.&nbsp; I haven't had
        fresh bamboo shoots since then.&nbsp; I hope I can get some next time I
        go to New York.&nbsp;<br>
        <b><font color="#FF0000">Daikon</font><font color="#000000"> </font></b><font color="#000000">in
        Japanese means &quot;big root&quot;, also known as a type of Japanese
        white radish.&nbsp; In Taiwan, we call it &quot;white
        carrot&quot;.&nbsp; I believe there are several different types of
        daikon in Japan that comes in various color and sizes.&nbsp; The taste
        is a combination of sweetness and bitterness.&nbsp; It is very
        refreshing in soups.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </font><b><font color="#FF0000">Lotus root</font><font color="#000000"> </font></b><font color="#000000">is
        strangely shaped as you can see from the picture.&nbsp; It is less
        consumed than lotus seeds (hmmm, I think I should go buy a can
        now).&nbsp; The inside of the root has many holes that may resemble
        Swiss cheese.&nbsp; The root is also quite fibrous, as if it is made of
        thousands of strands.&nbsp; You can make a&nbsp; delicious drink with
        this.&nbsp; Boil sliced lotus root in water and then add brown sugar to
        taste.&nbsp; It has some medicinal properties and is used as a Chinese
        herb like the lotus seeds.<br>
        </font><b><font color="#FF0000">Mushroom</font></b><font color="#000000">
        is in a different <a href="mushroom.htm"> section</a> due to the number of different mushrooms used.&nbsp;<br>
        </font><b><font color="#FF0000">Taro</font><font color="#000000"> </font></b><font color="#000000">is
        a yummy root vegetable.&nbsp; I believe it causes itchiness if you
        handle the root without wearing gloves.&nbsp; The outside of the root is
        brown while inside is usually purple or white with purple dots.&nbsp;
        The texture is like potato while it has some sweet taste to it.&nbsp; It
        is a very versatile item, and can be used in soup, stew, or ice
        cream.&nbsp; Taro ice cream is actually very good and you might be able
        to get them from Asian grocers.&nbsp; I thing a type of Hawaiian dish
        called Poi uses taro as the main ingredients.&nbsp; One of the famous
        Chinese dish I remember eating was made to look like Ice cream except it
        is actually very hot, with steams that gives the appearance of
        coldness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        </font><b><font color="#FF0000">Wakame seaweed</font></b><font color="#000000">,
        not to be mistaken with nori seaweeds used in sushi, usually comes dried
        in a plastic bag.&nbsp; They are usually hard and thick as opposed to
        soft nori.&nbsp; I usually combine this and bonito flakes to make a
        light stock for Miso soup.&nbsp; I believe it is also used to make light
        appetizers and soupy dishes.&nbsp; Sauteed wakame seaweed can also be
        served as one of the dishes in Asian cuisine.<br>
        </font></font><font face="Century Gothic" size="3"><b><font color="#FF0000">Winter
        melon</font></b><font color="#000000"> is the actual translation from
        Chinese and Japanese characters.&nbsp; I don't know if the harvest is
        indeed in the Winter, but they do grow to be large like pumpkins.&nbsp;
        It is usually used in soup or as the soup container itself (frequently
        in Cantonese cooking)!&nbsp; In Taiwan, they combine blocks winter melon
        and brown sugar as a way of brewing sweet &quot;Winter melon
        tea&quot;.&nbsp; Also one of my favorite drink.&nbsp;</font></font>
