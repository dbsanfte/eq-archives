<TR><TD><B>More Tips</B><BR>
1. Before you leave Beregost to go to Nashkell, try going west first.  There is a very nice NPC there and some decent fights.<BR>
2. Once you have picked up the NPC, go South to the next area.  There are some nice quests here with major Experience (for a first level party anyway).

I have received my copy of Baldur's Gate and I am currently playing it (I am playing multiplayer with pre-rolled Ranger, Cleric, and Mage).
This game is much better than the preview copy I played last year.  It is unbelievable!  If you were a fan of the old gold box games, you
should be in heaven with this game.   It is definately a must buy.<BR><BR>
<B>Game Tips</B><BR>
1. Don't ever leave a map section without fighting everything and talking to everybody possible.  The experience you can gain early on will be extremely important later on.<BR>
2. Always analyze the usefulness of items you pick up.  A +1 magical item may not be worth keeping if you can sell it for enough gold to buy something worthwhile.<BR>
3. Watch that your reputation stays good.  It will become difficult to get good prices buying or selling later on if you let your reputation fall to far.<BR>
4. If you have a lot of a certain item to sell (say 5 short swords), put them on one character and sell them all at once.  I know in the preview version (I haven't checked with this version), if you sold an item and then tried to sell the same item again, you would get a lower price for it.<BR>
5. Before you leave Candle Keep make sure you get extra arrows for Iomen who you will pick up in the wilderness.<BR>
6. You can sometimes retrace the same path you have been before (especially in the wilderness) and get into more fights (always a good thing to get more experience).<BR>
7. At the beginning of a fight, always pause to determine exactly what you are fighting against and what you need to do.  It is fine to continue the fight in realtime after that, but the initial pause can usually save you from having to restore a game.<BR>
8. And most importantly, save, save, save!<BR><BR>
<B>Game Cheats (not really)</B><BR>
1. If you don't have the identify spell, you can always save the game before putting on an unidentified item (remember there are cursed items in the game).<BR>
2. Save the game before leveling up.  By doing this, you can maximize your rolled hit points.  If you are not happy with what hit points are rolled, simply restore the game and try again.

<TR><TD><B>Multi-player Player List</B><BR>
I got the following e-mail from Jacob M. Dodd(Areti)<BR><BR>
<PRE>
Hello,
  I am putting together a list. This list will be for people who would
like to play Baldur's Gate multi-player. The list will not be given out
to any companies or anyone that uses them to spam crap. About a week
before Baldur's Gate comes out I will send a copy of the list to each
person that is on the list. This should give people time to get in
touch, and to get an idea if they want to play. 

To be added to the list, you must send me an e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:Areti@tidalwave.net">Areti@tidalwave.net</A>. The e-mail must have the following information:

1. The type(s) of party you would like to be in. For simplicity I am
breaking them down into 4 categories. (Good,Evil,Neutral,Any) If you
would like to adventure in different types of parties please state the
ones you are interested in.

2. The type of character(s) you would like to or be willing to play.
Race/Class of each character. That way people can find someone who wants
to play a class or race that they need. Also, indicated which one you
prefer to play, and which you may be willing to play for the good of a
party.

3. Your e-mail address. If you do not want to give me your actual
address, then get a free one from yahoo or wherever. The e-mail will be
used for interested people to get in touch with you. Also, for me to
send you the list.

The list will be broken down into the party
types(good,evil,neutral,any). Under each type pf party, will be a list
of what people would like to play, and their e-mail address. I have
gotten a few responses already. The more people respond the better it
will be for the people involved.

If you have any questions about this list, please e-mail me. Thank you.
</PRE>

<B>General Info Scavenged from the Baldur's Gate Message Board</B><BR>
<IMG SRC="bluebull.gif"><I><B>Dr. Ray Muzyka on colors</B></I>
<PRE>Well...we provide a large selection of colors - no 
slider bar, but pretty close.

You can choose hair color and skin color when you
create a character at the start of the game - after
that, you get to modify the 2 user colors that each 
of the characters in your party are wearing.

Hair length/facial hair - are prerendered on the
characters and we have almost a hundred different
looks for characters depending on level, class,
race, sex, etc. (e.g. as your mage increases in level
he or she gets sassier robes each time - but we 
still show a little leg on the girls of course :)

Armor changes character appearance dynamically of
course more than Diablo, close to the amount of 
variation you seen in UO (which I love by the way -
can't wait to play the real thing!)

So, we provide a lot of variation on character 
appearance - but not currently hair style
/facial hair.</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="bluebull.gif"><I><B>Dr. Ray Muzyka on multiplayer and other issues</B></I>
<PRE>We're still designing the interfaces and gameplay
for multiplayer - so some of these answers are
not too specific yet. Our main focus is still
the single player game, but we'll start in earnest
on multiplayer in September/October.

Early thoughts: I loved the Battle.net system. But
it is not quite as essential since you will be playing
one story from start to finish with the BG multiplayer - and this
is fundamentally different from the Diablo style of multiplayer - 
where you went out daily and met new people to adventure with in 
random (and often non-coop) dungeons.

BG multiplayer is strictly cooperative (although if
you want to have a duel, no one will prevent this :)
Actually, you can just duel if you want.

But the essence of this game is that you are playing
through a coherent, preplanned, prerendered story and
world regardless of whether you play single or
multiplayer. Our goal here is not to achieve the
sort of replay value of Diablo - which was great too, I
think - but rather to get the feel of an old-style
AD&D adventure pack - journeying through the Valley of 
the Giants with 5 friends, entering the Tomb of Horrors with
close compatriots. All specialists in their own areas - 
helping to solve quests and defeat horrible enemies, together.

This is the essence of AD&D in my mind - team play.

So anyways to answer the first question - since you won't be out
searching for new people to adventure with every few days,
it may or may not be essential to have a seamless log in system 
like Battle.net. We may opt for a simpler solution: a message board
where you can post your IP address and ask for people to join the party,
or to join to play a mission pack, etc.

BG Online - we're currently in discussion with 
Engage and Interplay about this and there isn't much
to report yet - other than that all three parties are
interested in it!

Dividing items - would be cooperative. The leader may
divide them, or people may just grab and argue afterwards.

If we go on Engage, the lag may not be as much of an
issue. Lag is actually not as critical as in UO
because we are dealing with 6 characters only in this 
game - plus we have a few programming tricks to 
make lag less of an issue.

Hope these answers are not too vague, but as I
said, the multiplayer has only recently been 
advanced to be included in the main release. Our
focus until early fall is on finishing the art and
programming for the single player game (with plug in 
slots for multiplayer code being planned for, of course).</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="bluebull.gif"><I><B>Ben Smedstad on experience and items</B></I>
<PRE>Experience is divided as it would be in a Pen & Paper
AD&D adventure, by who does what. There is a wide range 
of NPCs in the game, each can use only those Items that can normaly
be used by that class etc. You, the player, are going
to have to decide which fighter get the "cool" sword,
which mage gets what wand etc.</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="bluebull.gif"><I><B>Dr. Muzyka on named items</B></I>
<PRE>Good idea. I like the idea of named weapons too...
so I talked to my head programmer, Scott, about this - 
after he laughed for a but, he had the very pragmatic
solution of auctioning off names to you all - the highest bidder
gets a weapon or armor named after him... (just kidding!)

But seriously - maybe we should have a contest for you folks - 
as a reward for reading and posting all of the excellent questions and 
suggestions, maybe we could have a random draw to name some things after people.

Anyone interested in this? Don't email me...yet...let me set this up on the web page
somehow,</PRE><BR>
