<I>
I have just lately taken a look at Interplay's Fallout demo.  It brought
up , as I see it,
an important issue.  In Diablo, your character remained in the center of
the display at
all times.  This means that the terrain was always scrolling.  With
Fallout, you can
walk anywhere on the current display and then scroll the terrain
manually.  This
interface did not seem as nice or logical as Diablo's.  Which will you
use?  If you use
the Fallout method, will you add a "mode" that allows the interface to
act like
Diablo's?  Also, do NPCs always remain next to you are do they get
strung out
sometimes?</I><BR>
You can control any of the six characters - your first, plus 5 PC's.  This
is inherently different from the control in Diablo and Fallout, which were
both single character games - that is, you controlled one PC in your party. 

You can center on one of your characters with a double left click; otherwise
the field of view scrolls as you wish.  It would be very frustrating if it
didn't, due to the large size of the party (up to 6).  When you walk, the
terrain does scroll, to answer the first part of your question.  It follows
your selected character unless you choose (via double left click) a
different one, where it will follow the other.  A single left click causes
the display to stop following the selected character but does not center the
view on another.

network/internet play, please drop me a line.</I><BR>
We're doing the net play - probably in the main game.  We're working on it
now, and we'll see when it gets done.

1.) In multiplayer game, if you and 1 friend link up making a party of 2,
can you still have npc's join the party to get the group up to 6. and if so who controls the npc's actions(scripts).<BR>
2.) Say you have the game and 2 expansion packs, can you start a new player at lvl1 and still have the expansions in the game or do you have to get to lvl6 before
using first expansion pack. I hope we can start a lvl 1 guy and have the computer determine what lvl my party is and have the correct monsters roaming the land. I
hate to be a level 1 and come up on a herd of dragons dam!</I><BR>
As to question 1, Playtesting will change probably eveything I'm going to say,
So I won't go into detail. Yes your party still has a max of six, 
players and NPCs. 2 Pcs and four NPCs, or 3 and 3, or whatever. When
an NPC joins he/she is "Divied" to a Pc for control. The NPC can be
switched to another PC if the controler wishes it.<BR>

As to the second question, The game is non-linear in the respect you can
go almost anywhere, at anytime. Where you go is up to you and don't
worry, you'll get lots of suggestions from NPCs in the game world.
When your on (or near) the right track, it's a balanced affair (our designers
are working hard on this)and if your off the beaten path...beware.
The area you are in is probably not balanced for your level. You
can still go there, but you probably won't want to. It's all going to
be tweaked beyond belief during playtesting.

<I>
In previous AD&D computer games, the player could modify his character's
attributes to the max (ie STR 18(00), INT 18, WIS 18, DEX 18, CON 18,
CHA 18).  Will you allow this or will you make the player take a rolled
value?</I><BR>

You will get a roll and be able to modify the rolled numbers to the racial
max/min for each attribute.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
In creating a Priest (Cleric) class character, will there be a choice
of  god to follow or will you simply choose an alignment?  If you choose
a god, will this effect the game in any way?</I><BR>

We might - still debating this though.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will the thief only be able to open locked doors and bypass traps or
will he be able to actually pickpockets?</I><BR>

Pickpocket of course too!  Why else would you want to be a thief?

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will there be a way to speedily rest and memorize spells (bypass
realtime for the sake of having to wait through this boring action)?</I><BR>

Yes - you hit a "Rest" button and the resting occurs instantly - unless you
are attacked overnight, where you go to the main game view.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will you go as far as having items make saving throws?</I><BR>

Hmm.  Maybe.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
You have prerendered screens.  Does this mean that you do not have
special effects such as moving flames in a fireplace?</I><BR>

No, we have fire in the fireplaces and a lot of other ambient animations.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will you release a DVD-ROM version of this game?</I><BR>

Probably.


</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Is LAN and modem support a given?</I><BR>


Probably - we're negotiating this now.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
In your multiplayer model, will you have server based characters or
local characters?  The local characters in Diablo allowed for much
cheating.</I><BR>


Probably local, but this could change.  Having a server base would imply
that we're going to have a server...and this is probably not gonna happen
for a LAN- or TCP-LAN based game...

<TABLE BORDER=3>
<TR><TD>
<I>
How quick will the first mission pack be out?</I><BR>
Roughly two - three months after the main game Baldurs Gate is  released
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will it fit in seamlessly with the game or will it change the game drastically?</I><BR>
The mission pack will fit seamlessly.  New quests and sub-quests are    of higher level and difficulty.  They will add to the depth of the world        that is the Forgotten Realms
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will the mission pack upgrade the game (ie add new spells, levels, monsters, classes, races, items, NPCs)?  Which of these does it do?</I><BR>
Yes, all of these.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will the mission pack just add new encounters to previously visited areas or will the mission pack add all new areas to the game?</I><BR>
Some of the adventures will take place in the original settings, but as well whole new areas not in the main game.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Do you just install the mission pack or does it change the number of cd's from 5 to 6?</I><BR>
Because it can be played congruently with the main game, it effectively adds 1 Cd (5Cds to 6 CDs)
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
The original game boasts over 10,000 640X480 screens.  If the mission packs add new areas, how many of 640X480 screens can we expect to be added by the mission pack?</I><BR>
That's a tough one to answer.  We haven't completed the design on the mission packs, let alone the art. But i can give a ROUGH number.  Hmmm. about 12 or so 8*8 screens of new art so, 750 + screens.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>
Will the mission packs add NPCs from the Forgotten Realms novels?</I><BR>
The main game has many faces you'll recognize.  The expansion will probably add a few familiar faces as well.

<TABLE BORDER=3>
<TR><TD>
<I> noticed when looking at and comparing the thumbnail versions of
several of BG's screenshots
(http://www.alcyonis.fr/~garulfo/baldur/) that the degree of angular
rotation of a few of the rooms and buildings seems to vary.
Some seem to be about 90 degrees different, while others only vary by
maybe 5 or 10 degrees. Will there be a random layout
to the buildings in the cities and towns in this sense, giving a more
"sprawled" look? Or could this have just been the difference
between two separate areas of the game or even a change in the game's
engine?</I><BR>
Actually the game engine allows for buildings of any shape to be placed
at any angle, even large round ones. Just wait until you get a look at
the city
Baldur's Gate itself. It has buildings cramed together, on irregular
streets, just like a medeval town.
</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>What happens when your character walks behind a building?
Do they disappear and will there be separate, back entrances, for
example?</I><BR>
The character is obscured by the building, but character becomes
transparent so you can still see who it is.
We are trying to avoid placing back entrances, so you won't have to
constantly wave the cursor over buildings
looking for doors.

</TD></TR><TR><TD>
<I>I was also wondering about the small character portraits on the right
edge of the screen (you know, with Mona and all that).
Will they be changable / customizable?</I><BR>
The gui's that have been featured to date on the web and in magazines
have been early designs that don't really refect the
final ones. As I stated in an earlier post, we consider the user
interface, the most critical aspect of the game and we
are constantly refining and tweaking it. For example, we have greatly
reduced the amount of buttons, and have increased
the size of the portraits dramatically. As for the portraits themselves,
we are providing a pool of premade portraits to
choose from, and will have the capability to load in bmps also. So if
you want to scan in a picture of yourself, or just
paint on a pair of elf ears, you will be able to do this.

Interface
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Is the user interface customizable?  A screen shot on the French site showed icons down 
the left side of the screen while another at Thanos web site showed the same icons in the 
upper right hand corner.</I><BR>
No - these are different stages in the concept of the GUI.  Of note, we
originally planned on a customizable interface but decided that this was a waste of resources
- we instead decided to optimize the interface and increased the number of customizable buttons
(e.g. hot keys for quick spells, quick items, quick weapons, quick party formations).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>How exactly does the interface work?  Do you use the mouse to click
in the screen for movement/attacks/NPC interaction?</I><BR>
Yes, but there are many hotkeys as well.  
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Diablo for instance, only had a few weapon animations (sword, mace,
bow, staff, axe).  Will BG show more?  Will BG show a different
animation for each weapon?</I><BR>
Yes.  There are a fair number of weaponsin the game (dagger, longsword,
broadsword, two-handed swords, staffs, clubs, flails, maces, morning stars,
bows, crossbows, spears (non-throwing only), ?maybe a few more I can't
remember).   Yes, they all look different, most with different movements and
all with different weapons in hand.  And magic weapons and special weapons
LOOK different (glow in dark, different colors, etc.)
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>I have seen screen shots where armor has a greenish tint and shots
where armor has a bluish tint.  Is this configurable by the player or
does this denote different types of armor?</I><BR>

It denotes different armors.  But you can change your skin color, hair
color, and two user clothing colors on the fly.   We reserve certain color
ranges for indicating armor types and leather/trim colors.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>One of my main gripes with Diablo was the inventory.  Will we have
to divide our gold up into sections within our inventory as with
Diablo?  Will inventory be limited by weight as per the rules or by size
as with Diablo?</I><BR>

No gold dividing up (yuck).  Weight is a factor (you can't load a weak
character with too much stuff, and every item does have a weight), but you
can store items in the "group pool" temporarily (you can't use them there
but can pull them out later for use by individual characters).  The group
pool is limited by numbers of items, and each player can carry only a
certain number of items as well (limited by a certain number of slots per
character). 

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Can you save a game wherever you are?  When you save, how complete
is the state information?  Will bodies left in a certain area still be
there when you come back to it much later?  Can you save during the
middle of an encounter?</I><BR>

Yes, save anywhere.  We keep track of a certain number of bodies (like
bullet holes in Duke Nukem).  Yes, I suppose you could save in the middle of
an encounter (but you'd have to exit to the options page to do it).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>The area in BG seems to be quite large.  Will there be quick ways of
traveling across country?</I><BR>

Yes, a world map will let you traverse the country to areas which you had
already visited.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will there be a mapping function for dungeons (if there are any) or
will you be forced to do your own mapping?</I><BR>

The maps for dungeons will be the same mapping system as everywhere else in
the game - the map will be progressively revealed as you move around.  This
is intentional - we want the amount of notes you have to keep kept to a
minimum.  Mapmaking in the game would be quite painful due to the size
otherwise...

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>The French site mentions something about no tiling.  Do you really
not use tiles?</I><BR>

No.  It's all prerendered, no tiles anywhere.

Gameplay
</TH></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>At the Tavern, I saw you post that the game could be paused to go
into turn-based mode.  Can this be done in the middle of a fight?  If
so, once paused, can you simply change the script for one of your NPCs
and then go back to realtime mode?</I><BR>

Yes, that's the point - to be able to turn the game from a real-time game to
a turn-based game on the fly.   Realtime scripting - I hope to have this but
I don't know if we can do it for sure.  But we're going to try.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Which of the following will you have:<BR>
Random encounters.</I><BR>

Rarely only.<BR>

<I>Set encounters.</I><BR>

Mostly these.<BR>

<I>Random treasure.  (if random, do you use all items from the DND tables
or a smaller subset?)</I><BR>

Rarely only.<BR>

<I>Set treasure.  (Any artifacts?  Any newly create magical items?)</I><BR>

Mostly this.  A lot of new items - and magical items which are "standard"
(most are this type, since this game is for 1st-6th level characters) all
are going to be named (if we have time) and will have some background
history as well which will be accessible in the inventory page.<BR>

<I>A store in which magical items can be bought.</I><BR>

Of course!  But only a few can be bought...most must be earned...

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>In some of the later AD&D computer games, there were puzzles that
really didn't make sense and therefore were rather hard.  Will BG
contain puzzles?  What kind?</I><BR>

We don't like puzzles that don't make sense.  But ones that do sound ok to
me...riddles, and logical puzzles.  Plus ones where you have to do a little
research in the towns and dungeons of the region.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>So far, most of the screenshots I have seen have been outside or in
a building.  Are there any underground areas?  If so, can you send us a
couple of screenshots of this?</I><BR>

Yes, there are dungeons.  Lots of them.  Will try and do so.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>In Diablo, the only ranged weapons were bows.  Will you include the
ability to throw daggers, darts, axes, etc.?</I><BR>

Yes, but probably not axes - we're not sure how you keep getting more axes
to throw.   Daggers and darts, if you have a lot you can throw.  Spears. no,
since again you'd have to have a lot to make it worthwhile.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>In some of the gold box games, they implemented a "vault".  This
allowed the party to store gold and extra items.  Are you going to have
an equivalent function?</I><BR>

? I'm not sure what you mean.  There will be areas that are safer than other
to dump stuff, certainly.  But if you just dump a bunch of stuff in the
middle of nowwhere, it might disappear.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>The vault was simply a place in
a town or, as in Pools of Darkness, Elminster's pocket dimension where
you could leave items and
gold and come back to get them later.  A totally safe place.</I><BR>

Maybe.  I don't know yet.


</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Can the player totally wipeout all encounters in the game?  Or will
there always be some random encounters?</I><BR>

Yes, there will always be some.  But not too many.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>How will you handle resting?  Can the party always try to rest? Or
will there be areas where they cannot even try to rest?</I><BR>

Yes, you can rest anywhere (no Dark Sun rest camp sites!).  But some areas
will be better to rest  in than others, else you might get rudely interrupted.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>If you "finish" the game with a character, can you reload him and
start over?</I><BR>

No.  Start over?  With a 6th level character?  But you can transfer that
character to the next game and to the mission packs.  Plus probably as many
of your party as you'd like to transfer.  Actually the mission packs are a
little different - you can load the mission pack either while you are still
playing the main game, or afterwards - it plugs into the main game. 

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will the player be given specific quests by a NPC and then rewarded
on a successful completion?</I><BR>

Yes.  The game is party based (6 characters in your party).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>One of the cool AI things from Pool of Radiance was the ability for
random encounter size to be determined by the number of characters in
the party and their levels.  Will you implement something like this?</I><BR>

Yes.  But set encounters may or may not have variable numbers of foes.  Some
(even though not really random per se) may vary the number of enemies, while
others are set encounters.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Can you remove an NPC from your party after you have allowed
him/her to join?  If you can remove this character, will he remain in
the current spot always?  Will he disappear?  Will he return to his
original location?</I><BR>

He/she proceeds to his post-game location.  Where he or she may or may not
want to join you again.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Do NPCs move around on their own?  If you played the game twice,
would it be possible to find the same NPC in 2 different locations?</I><BR>

They move in limited ways.  Only if we tell them to.  Usually we don't (it's
harder to find them then!)

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Can you fight NPCs that are in the pool of characters that can join
your party?  Can you attack someone who is in your party?  In combat,
can you "accidently" hit one of you NPCs with a spell or weapon?  If so,
does he turn against you?</I><BR>

Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  yes, but only if he's pissed off enough (he'll warn you
that he's getting upset).

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>What about fighting in town?  Is there a penalty for this?  Can you
attempt to break into stores or other buildings at night?</I><BR>

Of course!  But guards might start noticing you and townsfolk might not want
to talk to you afterwards.  Evil doesn't ALWAYS pay, but it might in the
short term!

<TR><TH ALIGN=LEFT>
Rules</TH>
</TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>How detailed is the rule base you are using?  Do you get down to the
weapon speed level?  Do you count certain item's AC bonus to apply only
to its area(for instance: Would a helm give you an AC bonus of 1 or
would it only protect your head?)?</I><BR>

Weapon speeds: yes.  Spell speeds: yes.   Helm: AC +1.
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Can you give us a list of character classes/races that the game will support?</I><BR>
Classes: Fighter, Ranger, Paladin, Bard, Thief, Mage, Druid, Cleric;
plus multi-classed non-humans (for a total of about 18).
</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will you include special character classes like the ranger, bard,
and druid?  If so, will these classes include their special abilities
like use of 2 weapons without a penalty, playing music as a spell like
effect?</I><BR>

Yes.  2 weapons: no (I wish we could!).  Bard song: yes.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will special spells like enlarge, fly, and animate dead be
implemented?  Will these spells actually change the character's look(ie
grow larger, appear above the ground)?</I><BR>

Some.  Some aren't possible due to engine limitations.  But most are.  Yes,
they will alter appearance if it's appropriate - but only again if allowed
by the engine.  I'm not yet sure about resizing characters - we're trying
this now but the bitmaps don't look too good all the time.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will you include special character items (ie an item that can be
used only by a Lawful Good character)?</I><BR>

Yes, but remember this is a fairly low-level game, hence we don't have a lot
of high-level items.  No artifacts, for example.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will all character classes be able to use 2 weapons in combat with
the appropriate penalty on the 2nd hand?  Will the  warrior class
increase attacks per level at higher experience levels (ie 7-12 lvl - 3
attacks /2 rounds)?  If so, how will this appear different in realtime?
Will his weapon just swing faster?</I><BR>

2 weapons: no.   Increased attacks: yes.   It will be seen as more actual
effective attacks each simulated round of (approximately ) 3 seconds.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will you require spell components for the magic user?</I><BR>

No.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Will the characters automatically go up levels or will they have to
train?</I><BR>

Automatic.  But this is a good idea - we may implement the training if we
can think of a reasonable way to do it.

</TD></TR>

<TR><TD>
<I>Gamespot's current estimate for this game is December.  Is this
about the right time frame?</I><BR>

Yes, more or less.  QA is our main worry, along with the multi-player game -
we're not sure when the multiplayer game will be done.  If it is in the main
release (my preference) it may take a month or two more.  If in a mission
pack, this will not impact the main game.  We're working on it now and
discussing plans for implementation dates with Interplay now.

</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>
<I>Quoted from Thanos site:
 "What are the minimum system requirements for the game. It will run on
a P75 with 16 meg and a 2 meg video card - but we're
planning to implement better features for players with better systems (a
faster computer - say a P166 - and more memory -
say 32 meg - will allow for more animation and reduced latency). MMX is
also being implemented so as to allow for larger areas of animation on
MMX-based systems."
What exactly do you mean by "better features" and "larger areas of
animation"? Can you give us an example of what you mean?</I><BR>

Well - we're working on this now.  More variety in the people populating a
region, better frame rates, larger areas of animation for effects, faster
effects, etc.  The exact increases in performance are what we are working on
now - we really need to try it to know what we will get on a faster machine
with more memory and MMX.  This influences the design implementation as well
- we will design features for better systems to show off the better effects!
