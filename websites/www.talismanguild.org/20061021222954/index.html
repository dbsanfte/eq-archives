			  <p><img src="images/101606/MM_Corpse1.jpg" width="300" height="138" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>Day-after-day of practice paid off on October 10, when in a strong late-night showing, we defeated Mayong Mistmoore.</p>
			  <p>We had been refining the strategy for days, getting farther and farther along to learn what new tricks he would throw at us.  We suffered through the release of a new expansion (and the required xp grind and exploration that followed), as well as many low turnouts along the way.  But in the end, we all came together and stuck it out.</p>
			  <p>The night before, we got him to the low 40's with only a single enchanter online.  All was going smoothly until one tiny mistake from which we couldn't recover.  But we knew the win was &quot;there;&quot;  We just needed the people.  And the next night we had them.</p>
			  <p>In only a couple of attempts of refinements we had him down under 25 and were uncovering his final surprises.  We reached the end of our raid window, but almost no one could tear themself away.  We were so close.  We could feel that the win was at hand.   So we hit him again.</p>
			  <p align="center" style="clear:both"><img src="images/101606/MM_HP.jpg" width="700" height="34" /></p>
			  <p>The fight went very smoothly.  50% ... 40% ... 30 ... cruising along easily ... 20 ... 19 ... When I saw him go under 20 and we were still firmly in control of the fight, I actually got a chill, &quot;We've got this!&quot;  15 ... 10 ... 5 ... 2 ... 2 ... 2 ... (Arrgh!) ... 0 ... WIN!!!!</p>
			  <p>A good hour after we normally are wrapping things up, Mayong Mistmoore was dead.  And I swear for about another 10 minutes he wouldn't shut up!  He spoke more after death than while he was alive.		      </p>
			  <p>Loot consisted of <a href="images/101606/Erilynne.jpg">Erilynne, the Master's Mistress</a> for Rafather; <a href="images/101606/Glimmerice.jpg">Glimmerice, Tserrina's Forgotten Ardor</a> for Druisilla; <a href="images/101606/Dometrius.jpg">Dometrius, the Master's Burden</a> for Mallatik; and Agarwoen picked up the Persuasive Glimmering Serpent &quot;bonus&quot; loot.</p>
			  <p>Congratulations to EVERYONE for all the work put in to learn the encounter.  And special conga rats to the raid leaders who kept us moving and making adaptations along the way.</p>

			  <p>TSS hit the shelves and fattened all our EQ directories.  Once out, we put things on hold for about a week and a half in order to grind xp and explore.  I have to say, there are now certain areas of the game that I hope to never see again /cough 69.1 instance!!</p>
			  <p>The new expansion looks nice.  The new spells and ranks are interesting and add a new dynamic.  We are currently poking around the new events and progressions.  TSS was really 2nd on our priority list after Mistmoore ... but I think we're going to be spending more time there now that we've updated our 'Kill Bill' list.</p>
			  <p>We've knocked off some minor things, mostly progression and little quests, but nothing too exciting yet as to warrant a big write-up.</p>

			  <p>There are some GREAT flavor events in this expansion though.  I can't write about TSS without mentioning what a riot it is to &quot;Save Timmi from the Well.&quot;  When that event was first discovered, a lot of us - myself included - made a point of doing that one.  The reward is ok - just a toy.  But just the pure joy of the &quot;joke&quot; of the event is worth doing it!

			  <p>I write this huddled behind the bank desk in the Guild Hall.  Angry guildmates are all around.  They eye me warily, some pass with a slight smile that is not reflected in their eyes. Others are more open in their disdain.  &quot;When are we getting an update?&quot; they snipe at me.</p>
			  <p>&quot;I'm working on it,&quot; I lie.  Truth is I've just been out of it lately, barely managing the energy to log on at all.  And in fact I gave in last weekend and *didn't* log on.  So I've had nothing left to spend on what passes for creativity to work on an update.  But they can't hear that.  &quot;It's coming, I swear.&quot;</p>
			  <p>We beat The Performer event last week for the first time.  Let me restate that in case your eyes are glazing over reading this editorial:</p>
			  <p><font size="+1">We beat The Performer!</font></p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/090406/PerformerWin_Banner.jpg" alt="Performer Win Banner" width="700" height="264" /></p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><img src="images/090406/Performer6Alive.jpg" alt="6 Alive" width="388" height="664" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>Our first win on this event came on August 21, after a LOT of practice.  We had upwards of 35-40 people still alive at the end of the time.  It was a truly stunning win all the way around.  All the practice paid off, and we tore it up like we'd been farming it for weeks.</p>
			  <p>As fun as the first win was though ... I actually think the win a couple nights ago on the 29th was even MORE fun.  Why?  Because it was a nail-biter.  Full raid, and we won with only 6 people alive at the end!!!  Thank god we had a necro afk... err FD in there to rez a cleric lol.  Truth be told, the raid was going down-hill - the mobs were just picking us off at the end.  It was over.  But the tables got turned and it was the MOBS who ran out of time.  They didn't get us all killed  in time lol.  We Win!  (again).  :D</p>
			  <p>And from now on, I don't care how good we are doing on an event, I'll never &quot;predict&quot; again like I did in the last update.  I predicted we were only a few days, a week tops from beating him. And that was JUNE!  For unknown reasons we hit a HUGE slump with people not logging on.  We actually had a few raid nights that turned into &quot;Go farm some xp and AAs for the new expansion&quot; since we didn't have enough people to do anything.  So no more.  I don't care if I do an update where we missed a new kill because someone tripped on a spent mod rod and cost us the win.  I won't predict!!!</p>
			  <p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Snowtail:</font></p>
			  <p>Another of our First-Kills since last update was that big American Eskimo, Snowtail! Unfortunately, I wasn't there for it but they tell me it was exciting. /Gump So that's all I've got to say about that. </p>

			  <p><img src="images/090406/Mistmoore_1.jpg" alt="Mayong Mistmoore" width="350" height="531" style="margin: 10px" align="right"/>We've now got our sights set on the elusive Mayong Mistmoore.  He spends his days practicing sword twirling and shouting ominous warnings at us through-out the zone.  So we go to his room and beat on his minions, and taunt him by yelling &quot;Hey, play Misty for me, muhahahaha.&quot;  He just stands there, throwing his sword in the air, looking all spiffy in his cool armour, and pays us no heed.  Until we piss him off enough.  Then you get to hear some KICK-ASS music even if you have your music turned off.  I have to hand it to SOE for this one, hearing that music when Mistmoore goes active is truly a &quot;Holy Crap!&quot; moment.</p>
			  <p>We're still refining the event, but we've turned him on a few times .... umm I mean, we've &quot;gotten him active,&quot; and last night's attempts went VERY well.  BUT I MAKE NO PREDICTIONS!!!</p>

			  <p align="center"><font size="+1">Another update so soon!!?!? OMG!</font></p>
			  <p>I had to wait until the month changed for this little addendum, otherwise the site might have crashed. It just isn't used to me posting more than about once a quarter! Anyway, this is more of an Update-update, so will be short and sweet.<br>
			  </p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Roley DeFarge:</font></p>
			  <p><img src="images/061106/RoleyDeFarge_5.jpg" width="700" height="210"></p>
			  <p>With surprisingly little time spent practicing this event, we were able to beat Roley. Then again, it may have something to do with his name. I mean seriously, a vampire named Roley? I'm sure all the other vampires made fun of him, stole the dirt from his coffin while he was out, or hung bat sticky-strips near his windows. This fight is long enough that it has that air of unpredictable chaos (can chaos be predictable?) that makes it feel that it may be lost in a most gloriously horrific manner at any point ... but is otherwise pretty straightforward. :)</p>
			  <p><img src="images/061106/RoleyDeFargeSpirit_1.jpg" width="350" height="235" style="margin: 10px" align="left">Seeing Roley and Adrianna dancing at the end was sweet though. And I think we can all agree that we'd do this fight without loot just to bring those two undead kids together. Aaaawwwww.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both">&nbsp;</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Tris Wallows III:</font></p>
			  <p><img src="images/061106/TrisWallowSpirit_1.jpg" width="236" height="315" style="margin: 10px" align="right">Well, no mention of Tris would be complete without questioning her name. Is this one that a Dev slipped by the Suits? Almost all of us did a double-take when her name came up on target. &quot;Tri Swallows?&quot; Errr &quot;Tri Swallows ...3 !?!?!?!&quot; Of course being the naive embodiment of purity and sweetness, I had to have someone explain the joke to me, but I digress.</p>
			  <p>The Wallows Encounter is pretty fun I think. Has those elements of timing, direction-following (a Talisman anti-trademark), and that moment where it better all come together or the event explodes. Fun!</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Devlin Rochester:</font></p>
			  <p><img src="images/061106/DevlinRochesterSpirit_3.jpg" width="250" height="301" style="margin: 10px" align="left">Very shortly after my previous update, we beat Devlin. But beating him wasn't enough for me to de-lazify and do an update so had to wait until more. :)</p>
			  <p>Much like a lot of PoR, the Devlin fight requires that all of us pay attention to detail. No more Melee afk-fighting. No more Clerics watching TV pressing their heal buttons. No more Wizards standing in one place pressing their Big-Badda-Boom button then going afk for Rez. In short - this fight was a lot of trouble for us to learn. :D</p>
			  <p>But, like Bart reaching for the electrified cupcake, we are nothing if not persistant; in the end we prevailed. He's not so hard, but it does really test how you as a guild raid. It is far more about refining how the people BEHIND the keyboards raid, then it is about &quot;clerics do this, melee do that,&quot; etc.<br>

			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">The Performer:</font></p>
			  <p><img src="images/061106/Performer_1.jpg" width="300" height="375" style="margin: 10px" align="right">Our current target is The Performer. We are progressing very smoothly, and it wouldn't surprise me to have him beaten within a couple days of getting this update posted.</p>
			  <p>Yet another encounter where every single person has to pay super close attention. This expansion has tested our limits! :p</p>
