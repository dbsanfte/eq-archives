			<p>It has come to my attention from various sources that Talisman is now &quot;just 
  a fallen once uber guild that is now 3rd class&quot; to quote just one person. 
  Well shit i guess there is only one thing we can do about the situation...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="+5">FARM NToV!</font></p>
<p align="left">So on monday night we all headed over to the home of the uber 
  guilds, the Temple of Veeshan and found it almost empty....where could they 
  be? surely not farming newer more difficult content for better quality drops...</p>
<p align="left">On one of our finest nights ever we managed to not just kill 3 
  or 4 dragons but THE WHOLE OF NToV!</p>

<p align="left">Sadly it seems our audience was'nt impressed, it seems our &quot;collection 
  of random spam invites&quot; for members will have to do more to regain our 
  reputation on the server, as we don't have the time or ability to regain our 
  status on the battlefield, alternative measures were taken to alleviate the 
  problem</p>
<p align="left">So it was put into place, a zero tolerance system, say anything 
  or do anything to get an officers attention and you are outta here! so far only 
  a few members have been foolish enough to mess with them....</p>

  we were seriously lacking in damage dealing classes, 48 total people but somehow 
  we managed to kill him...just. When you are sat in bazaar naked waiting to hear 
  the outcome this is the sort of message you don't want to see, i wish he was

<p>It's been aaaaaages since i did one of these update things, lots of things 
  have happened and quite a few new members have joined us, if i tried to name 
  them induvidually i would just miss somebody and look an asshole so i won't, 
  i'll just say Welcome~</p>
<p>i started playing again this week and it's been ummm interesting. Ssra crashed 
  a few nights ago giving us a rare chance at killing Vyzh'thingy the Cursed (make 
  everything spawn randomly on zone reset or nothing you verant retards)</p>
<p align="left">We downed the Glyphed and Exiled quickly, made about 30,000 arrows 
  and set about killing the Cursed, I won award for dying the most times that 
  fight, drops were awesome for what i believe is our first kill.<img src="images/072602/cursed1.jpg" width="574" height="252" align="top"><img src="images/072602/cursed6.jpg" width="258" height="132" align="left"></p>
<p>Breastplate of the Void - Salcedo</p>
<p>Vengeful Mail of the Void - Azarius</p>
<p>Bloodfrenzy - Ragnrok</p>
<p>Next We heard the Statue had spawned in Kael, downed Vindi, owned Statue, AoW 
  fight went pretty bad, we lost i think 2 clerics on the pull and also our first 
  tank but everybdoy did great work pulling together and recovering, recovering 
  from a bad start makes the victory more satisfying as well as being one hell 
  of a rush.</p>
<p> Nedden got a Mask of making yourself as ugly as Phallax, Ragnrok and Rafather 
  got a helm each and Kukan got the legs</p>
<p>Also special thanks to the group of Krieger that showed up to help, it was 
  a late raid and we could'nt have done it without you , so thanks to Radek, Majerle, 
  Bastion, Lyden, Racur, those are the people i can remember, really sorry if 
  i missed you~</p>
<p>On a slightly funnier note, earlier in the week, Rhag 1 spawned early in the 
  night while a few members were camping him, yes you have to sit in rooms and 
  camp spawns now on this piece of shit server, Grats to Pia Fidelis who ran over 
  the guild and killed Rhag 1 then continued to race to rhag 2, you guys are class!</p>
<p>Just a little pissed and with maybe a debatable justification we decided to 
  head over to the Arch Lich room, after all it was really him that people like 
  rafather who spent half the day in the Rhag 1 room were camping, Rhag 1 just 
  happens to start the trigger, Anyway to cut the story short, here is what happens 
  when a guild like Pia try to race ahead of us up to the crypt guardians!</p>
<p><img src="images/072602/piaded.jpg" width="652" height="241"></p>
<p>Learn how to pull your way to the Arch Lich before you kill him guys...I admire 
  your perseverance though, grats on following us in, looking back i'm glad we 
  decided to leave the zone and let you have the spawn because i can write updates 
  like this and post a great screenshot of you wiping out to a few crypt guardians!</p>
<p>Lastnight was a great night too, races suck at the best of times, races where 
  the loser won't give up, ports up to the emperor room already filled with over 
  60 of us and in doing so curses your entire raid then proceeds to pull seconds 
  before you do really suck, i love this server and all the people on it!</p>
<p>The only people lower are the actual employees of Verant calling themselves 
  GM's, maybe i'm wrong though, maybe i should be more specific and place blame 
  on the retarded fuck GM's who come up with the policy rules, the guys who actually 
  encourage acts like running over other guilds, the guys who say that regardless 
  of anything, whoever is first to engage a mob is justified to kill it and it 
  doesnt matter who you fuck over or what you to do to make sure you engage first 
  as long as you do</p>
<p>after sleeping and calming down it's not so much the being run over by other 
  guilds, it's a competetive game and if some people are prepared to sacrifice 
  pride and integrity to stay at the top then so be it, what pisses me off though 
  is when GM's end up getting involved...because they are fucking useless, this 
  guild prides itself on behaving with maturity and in trying to take the moral 
  high ground by not doing the shit mentioned, the things that most high level 
  guilds on this server are prepared to do, it does however get increasingly harder 
  to do or to justify doing when GM's actively discourage it. </p>
<p>What made me laugh lastnight was that during all this happening, some retard 
  of a GM was broadcasting messages like this</p>
<p><img src="images/072602/gm.jpg" width="373" height="53" align="right">Great guys, you can't 
  handle the regular amount of players, you can't handle the bandwidth demand 
  on patch days but you want us to give a shit about your records and the bonus 
  you probably get by achieving it? hah</p>
<p><img src="images/072602/gm1.jpg" width="479" height="27"></p>
<p>Anyway, i petitioned asking it it was some sort of sick joke, here was the 
  reply.</p>
<p><img src="images/072602/gm2.jpg" width="351" height="79"><img src="images/072602/gm3.jpg" width="343" height="81"></p>
<p><img src="images/072602/gm4.jpg" width="347" height="78"> </p>
<p>It's easy to treat your customers like shit when there is no competition to run to, maybe when it's too late and half your customers have jumped ship ypu will realize what you did wrong.
<p>OK it's done, update finished and while it may be a pile of crap, at least 
  it's a new pile of crap~</p>

<p>Good thing about doing updates is you can post things purely with the intention 
  that they are taken out of context<br>

			<p>Patch day occasionally motivates me to do an update before i get ppl bitching at me for not doing one in over a week, lastnight we actually had a pretty decent post patch killing spree</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/heman.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right"></p>
<p>First off was the Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune, I hate this fight, i did'nt get any screenshots i was so god damn bored, even if i did he would loook just like the 200 other snakes i've posted here, So here's a picture of He-Man instead.</p>
<p>He put up a good fight but died eventually. Here's the loot that did'nt rot!<br>
<img src="images/061302/alloot1.jpg" width="401" height="151"><br>
<img src="images/061302/alloot2.jpg" width="401" height="151"></p>
<p>Platinum Mesh Guard: Kaustran<br>Shield of Holy Vigor: Lambert</p>
<p>Next was a mob we had yet to kill, the High Priest of Ssraeshza i really don't know why either, apart from a couple of suicide test runs around 5 months ago we had'nt tried him until recently, we had a play around in his room last week and worked on a strategy, tonight we executed it flawlessly....well except for a few problems like Nedden's little friend (will get to that soon) and some fucked up tanking....</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/rtank.jpg" width="508" height="18"><br>
<img src="images/061302/rtank1.jpg" width="553" height="35"></p>
<p>Anybody would think he had something to prove about a rangers tanking ability</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/hpdead.jpg" width="885" height="276"><br>
<img src="images/061302/hploot.jpg" width="119" height="134"></p>
<p>Bone of Bertoxxulous: Phallax<br>Ivory Crystal Greaves: Blitzberg<br>Shield of Ssraeshza: Chatraz</p>
<p>Now a little side story to this kill, I play a rogue so i'm taking the opportunity to tell everybody about my view of the High Priest fight, the corridor to the guy has 3 traps in it, one of which is total ass and curses your whole raid, so us lucky rogues get to spend most of the night clicking the same damn button over and over, you get a lovely chat window view<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap.jpg" width="210" height="84"></p>
<p>Bored and a little angry, Nedden starts to tell us how he feels<br>
<img src="images/061302/traps.jpg" width="532" height="29"><br>
Eventually he comes up with a little game, something to relieve the boredom and a worthy sequel to the hugely popular "Steal a mod rod and use a charge then drop on the floor and see who notices" game, ask a random person to come buff you, drop sneak so the golems behind a nearby door agro just as the buff lands and there you have it! one dead caster<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap1.jpg" width="399" height="195"></p>
<p><img src="images/061302/trap3.jpg" width="521" height="32"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap0.jpg" width="458" height="18"></p>
<p>With the next target aquired the game seemed to be going well, an Enchanted imperial Golem nearby was watching however and saw Nedden's little game and decided to play a game of his own, every time Nedden came over near his assigned trap, Enhanced Imperial Golem would bring his 2 buddies and charge nedden regardless of hide sneak!</p>
<p>Off the unsuspecting hobbit goes back to his trap...<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>A little confused but not yet suspicious Nedden gets a res and gets back to his duty<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>Now a little suspicious he edges his way back, careful to not get in agro range<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>By now the High Priest had been engaged by the guild, nobody was more relieved than Nedden, trap time over!<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap5.jpg" width="101" height="38"><img src="images/061302/trap4.jpg" width="528" height="18"></p>
<p>During the fight the group gets to hear Ned bitch a little and let some steam off, by this point i was in tears of laughter and barely able to fight<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap6.jpg" width="514" height="18"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap7.jpg" width="406" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap8.jpg" width="406" height="17"></p>
<p>High Priest dies (see above) and time comes again to move out of the room, to do so requires the traps to be disarmed again....guess who was waiting for him?<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap12.jpg" width="528" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap9.jpg" width="532" height="32"><br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>

<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>At this point i was just about pissing myself with laughter, what makes it funnier was the fact the golems all ran right over me and Joia totally ignoring us, killed Nedden and walked away, I just wish the rest of the guild could have seen it from my eyes.</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/trap14.jpg" width="447" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap15.jpg" width="347" height="17"></p>
<p>Moral of the story? Don't fuck with the buffers, a new protector is on the streets, he's ruthless and he won't take no shit!<br>
<img src="images/061302/golem.jpg" width="161" height="203"></p>
<p>Next on the to kill list was the Xerkizh the Creator, afterall he's just next door, snake picture inc~</p>
<img src="images/061302/creator.jpg" width="734" height="374"></p>
<p>to sum up the fight quickly, we engaged, some tard agrod the whole room on us AGAIN, we killed them all, we killed the big snake.</p>
<p>Shiny Trinket of Speed: Ackbah<br>Willful Dirk of Domination: Rot?<br>Shield of the Creator: Zazel (i think)</p>
<p><a href="images/061302/wuoshi.jpg"><img src="images/061302/wuoshi.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"></a> <a href="images/061302/wuoshidead.jpg"><img src="images/061302/wuoshidead.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Finally we took down one last mob, 3 Ssra mobs in one night was a great confidence boost and we were feeling on top of our game, we decided to try the impossible...Wuoshi!</p>
<p>Wuoshi was taken down in record time with 0 deaths, it just goes to show what we can achieve when we work together, sadly the same can't be said about our mob positioning as he died near the top of a tree =(</p>
