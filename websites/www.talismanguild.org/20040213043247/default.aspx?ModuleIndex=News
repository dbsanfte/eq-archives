<p>With nothing all that new to report, I thought we'd go with a 2003 Year in Review style of update this time.  2003 marked a very busy year for Talisman.  Lots of new content conquered and lots of changes in the interguild relationships on Tunare.  Our goal going into 2003 was of course to reach the Plane of Time.  To get there we'd first have to get thru the Elemental planes.  We started the year out right with our first Rallos Zek kill in mid-January gaining us access to the Elemental Planes.  We spent a few weeks farming elemental armor to begin gearing up for what lay ahead.  In early February we took down our first Elemental god, Fennin Ro.  He proved to be rather subdued compared to his cohorts in the other planes.  We then spent 2 months farming the planes and refining the various encounters until we finally beat Xegony in late March.  Again, 2 months passed before we took down Coirnav in late May.  That left only one god standing between us and Plane of Time.  A month later after many long nights, we took down Rathe to begin our summer with entry to the Plane of Time.  After a relatively slow start due to the early summer attendance bug that seemed to hit the entire EQ community, we came back together in late July to begin our methodical destruction of one god after another in Time leading up to our first slaying of Quarm on September 4th.</p>
<p>LDoN of course came out in September as well, adding a new dimension to Norrath in the form of adventures which marked a new way to grind exp with the additional reward of Adventure Points.  The raid content of LDoN proved to be demoralizing for the most part.  Long raids with the high probability of zero reward at the end.  We continue to work on mastering the various raids which prove quite challenging.</p>
<p>That covers most of our 2003 milestones.  It's also important to note some interguild relationship changes that took place earlier in the year.  Tunare has historically been a server infested with guilds racing for mobs, running over each other for content, emotional flare ups, flame threads on the boards, you name it.  Early 2003 was no different.  Our last race with DC ended on 2/22/03 when the race ended in a tie in Sol Ro's chamber in our final cockblock attempt into Plane of Fire, our precious farmland.  The race grew heated.  Wicked words were exchanged.  Rogues from both guilds quickly snatched up the arrows the opposing guild's mages were dropping, it was flat out ugly.  Both guilds quickly realized this had to stop.  This marked the beginning of a time of tolerance between both guilds.  Agreements were made to eliminate all racing by rotating weeks in the various planes. This agreement continued throughout the year up to and including our current Time rotation.  Re-flagging agreements also began taking place among many of the guilds on the server to help the newer members of all guilds catch up to the rest on flags.  This all resulted in what most consider a more enjoyable atmosphere to play in.</p>
<p>As we enter 2004, we eagerly anticipate the release of Gates of Discord and all the new AA's, some of which we hope will be useful.</p>
<p>As far as other stuff to report, we had an interesting Emp of Ssra encounter right before Christmas.  Upon zoning into Ssra to do a late night Cursed kill, we quickly found the Emperor waiting for us at zone in.  Somehow he had warped on Gale of Destruction when they wiped, so we chalked up our first emp kill at zone in as the rescue unfolded.  We still have no clue how he got there, despite various allegations.</p>

<p>In an attempt to do something a little different during our non-Time raiding nights, we decided to bring back some of the old school nostalgia and do some retro raiding.  Tired of elemental farming and lacking the motivation to trudge thru a 4 hour LDoN raid, we decided to pay a visit to our old friend Vulak.  The usual suspects encountered along the way proved nothing more than minor speed bumps.  After waiting 30 minutes for the Vulak ring to respawn after our over zealous ranger Grunties activated it out of lack of control of his excitement, the event began.  We quickly determined that the way to avoid a 4 hour LDoN raid is NOT to do the Vulak ring!!  That being said, in the end, I'm pleased to announce that yes, Vulak down to Talisman!!!
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_corpse.jpg"></p>
<p>The raid as you can imagine went fairly smooth.  Our biggest disappointment is that Divine Crusade, still, to this day, tries to sabotage and steal our leet tactics, often sending blatant spies. Plz, I mean wtf, can't they figure out how to kill Velious content on their own??</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_group.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course with any grand kill such as this, there comes phat lewts.  Let the farming begin...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_loot.jpg"></p>
<p>In a way the evening ended on a sad note.  On the eve of the announcement of our great warrior Ragnrok's retirement, having been tormented for years for never owning a Jaelen's Katana, our old friend Rags logged in to share his final words in Everquest...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/rags1.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/arative_pose.jpg"></p>
<p>In all seriousness though, we'll miss you Ragnrok.  Your contributions to the guild won't be forgotten.  I know I speak for everyone when I say it's been a true pleasure playin' with ya. For those who may not feel that way, well, here's a spoon.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/spoon.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Did one night of retro raiding satisfy our nostalgia?  Oh hell no!!  The next evening we had to decide between clearing Plane of Water or clearing Plane of Growth.  What would you pick?  Duh!!  No shit, We thought the same thing and chose Plane of Growth!  The following collage will let you experience what we experienced in Plane of Growth...some of it glorious, some of it...well...not so glorious.  After wiping out to a tree, we regained our composure and took down Tunare.  Listen up kids, PoG ain't a joke.  If Talisman can wipe out there, so can you!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/retro_pog.jpg"></p>
<p>Ahh yes, the holiday season is upon us, a time for family, fun, and of course, Christmas shopping.  Wanna avoid the crowds at the malls this year?  Stumped on what that elusive perfect gift for your loved one might be?  Well, fear not, here at Talisman we have the perfect gift for anyone, and you don't even need to get your ass outta your computer chair to get it!  That's right, it's the 2004 Women of Talisman Calender!  They're attractive, they're intelligent, oh FFS, they're down right SEXY!!  Calenders make good gifts.  Talisman Calenders make GREAT gifts!!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/calender.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a shot of the front cover...</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a random shot of one of our monks trying to catch a skunk...</p>

<p>Before we kick off the Official Quote section, sometimes we like to acknowledge our fans.  Talisman wouldn't be where it is today without our fans, so I'd like to take this moment to share with you an interview our very own Thanatopsis had with Talisman's Greatest Fan.  The fan chose to use an anonymous name, but we're guessing it's either Kolevii, Lace, or Emodius...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/fan.jpg"></p>
<p>Wanna see how we stay entertained during a Vulak raid?  Correct answer would have been NO, but...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/ogre_fun.jpg"></p>
<p>Well, that's about it for the meat of this update.  In other news we continue mowing thru Time during our rotation, but that's all boring news nowadays.  This is about the point I would have added in my Revenge on Hammie Section after the last update he did, but immediately following that update, he stopped all forms of communication in guildchat, tells, say, you name it.  Hell, he even got a job so he wouldn't have to be on as often for fear of exposing himself to my camera!!  Bastard!</p>

			<p>So what does a guild do when time is cleared and there is nothing left to 
    kill? we go to PoM, spend an hour running around, getting lost, killed, trained 
    and stuck at the wrong side of one way walls, we did eventually find the god 
    of sex appeal himself, but thats not all, just when you think nobody could 
    be better looking...</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="images/102303/bb1.jpg" width="248" height="27"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/bb2.jpg" width="830" height="314"></p>
  <p>For one night, the guild knew the true power of the hobbit, it did however 
    take 3 attempts to bring that power under control and use it against him but 
    eventually we killed him, sadly i was not in the zone to get a corpse shot 
    so Beldon kindly donated me one</p>

  <p align="left">Lastnight we gave a Mistmoor time level raid another shot, it 
    was a raid with a death limit so everybody had to be on top of their game, 
    a single death could bring failure to us all, we even had to put our regular 
    &quot;Kill Quen&quot; game on hold, well.....actually i'm lying but don't 
    tell the raid leaders</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="6">The Beldon('s) Special </font></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So it occured to me, with Beldon pretty much dominating the update page, 
    as well as being the biggest retard in talisman, lots of his little adventures 
    slip through the cracks, or get conveniently left out, well his reign of oppression 
    and censorship may be over, at least for the next 5 minutes</p>
  <p>Although the thing is, as much as we all laugh at him daily, there is something 
    endearing about the guy, i've not yet figured out what it is, i'll try to 
    explain....and maybe come to a conclusion</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One thing i noticed about him is the ladies all seem to love him, take for 
    instance this particular cutie<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldonpink1.jpg" width="112" height="217"><br>
    Just a young lady with a somewhat bright set of armor on, minding her own 
    business while she waits for her adventure to start....<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon19.jpg" width="379" height="179"><br>
    So, not being the shy type, he strolls over casually with his ever trusty 
    book on a stick - Love Tips for the Repressed<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldonpink.jpg" width="111" height="154"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon20.jpg" width="129" height="11"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon200.jpg" width="154" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon21.jpg" width="251" height="60"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon22.jpg" width="220" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon24.jpg" width="266" height="122"><br>
    Getting desperate now.....<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon23.jpg" width="259" height="24"> 
    <br>
    At least the group were sympathetic and managed to pick up his spirits<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon25.jpg" width="301" height="73"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So he's a hit with the ladies, but a modern man has to be able to cook for 
    his woman too, this is an area where Beldon really shines with his culinary 
    skills<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon42.jpg" width="382" height="24"> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon43.jpg" width="336" height="11"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon44.jpg" width="343" height="11"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon49.jpg" width="287" height="59"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I feel it's my duty though to report on the bad as well as the good, and 
    lets get that out of the way sooner rather than later, like many celebrities, 
    he has a dark side, a twisted, exploitative side, the lady in question (who 
    will remain anonymous) was offered 27 raid points if she met his sick demands<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon78.jpg" width="238" height="17"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon79.jpg" width="269" height="21"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon80.jpg" width="232" height="19"><br>
    Things are under investigation however and we hope to be able to clear Beldon 
    of these &quot;Points for Pootang&quot; allegations soon</p>
  <p>But back to Everquest, he's also a highly respected <em><strong><font size="4">member</font></strong></em> 
    of the tunare community, and as raid officer for Talisman he has to keep a 
    good relationship with other guilds, here he shows us just a few of his diplomatic 
    skills<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon15.jpg" width="354" height="38"> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon16ish.jpg" width="287" height="14"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon34.jpg" width="115" height="11"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But he has his helpful days, even though we have just wiped to a raid and 
    he's sat in PoT totally naked, he still offers to help Lace with a FREE translocate 
    to Ro<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon73.jpg" width="315" height="119"><img src="images/102303/beldon74.jpg" width="115" height="157"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon77.jpg" width="372" height="24"><br>
    Done...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To run a raid, you have to be able to get to a raid, and there is nobody 
    with a better sense of direction than Beldon<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon12.jpg" width="179" height="13"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon13.jpg" width="230" height="35"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon14.jpg" width="220" height="14"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But he always looks after his close friends, often leading raids just to 
    better their equipment while they pretend they can stay away from the game<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon39.jpg" width="294" height="14"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon41.jpg" width="280" height="83"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But the guy doesnt stop at raids, he's the definition of hardcore, doing 
    LDoN adventure after adventure with his trusty sidekick Lapismoon, he recruits 
    only the best and expects only the best, then he repeatedly fucks them over<br>
  <img src="images/102303/beldon63.jpg" width="388" height="48"><br>

  <p>Attempt number 2<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon72.jpg" width="361" height="49"></p>
  <p>Speaking of Lapismoon and recruiting, he also makes damn sure even the guys 
    are satisfied <br>

  <p>But to be honest, i'm still not satisfied that i know exactly why it is we
