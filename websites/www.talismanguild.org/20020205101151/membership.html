<p class=ContentHeader>Admission Policy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Talisman is primarily a high level guild with a tendency
to large, epic raids against the so called uber mobs of Norrath on the Tunare server. 
Talisman does not have requirements per se since everything is based around a voting system. 
In practice though this means that people not 51+ will be unable to group with and meet 
the people necessary to reach the required number of votes. To start the process 
any full member of Talisman can sponsor you for voting. At this point you have two weeks 
(with extensions available at the officer's discretion) to obtain the necessary votes. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently you must reach <b>45</b> yes votes with zero no votes, with the voting cap periodically adjusted
by the officers to help keep the guild at a reasonable membership volume. We
have also instigated a preliminary guilding policy once a prospective member
reaches 20 vote, with the deadline to get 45 votes extended to two weeks again
from the point of reaching 20 votes. . A major tenant of Talisman 
is that we never turn away people in the guild from a raid unless they are too late and we are already charging. 
To continue this policy we must carefully monitor the size of the guild.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Votes are strictly confidential and while we try and work out no votes, sometimes an arrangement can not be made and the 
applicant is <b> denied membership with no real means to address the situation</b>.
Also note that if you receive a no vote after being preliminary guilded you will
be removed. We try and avoid this situation, but it can happen and you should be
prepared for it. Once <b>45</b> votes is reached the member is
permanently guilded
and given access to the guild board, vault, and voting forums.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The voting system insures that the majority of the members know each other and feel very comfortable with each other. 
We do not guild people just because they are level 60 and a needed class, you must also be an outstanding member of the Tunare community
to get the required votes. The converse applies too, we frequently guild classes and level's that offer no real value 
to our raiding expeditions because we already have almost a dozen of higher level. With that said popular classes and higher levels will
likely get you more votes than not, but a fun spirit and a good attitude will earn
you the most.. <br><br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any questions about the process can be directed in game to the
<a href="contact.html"> guild leader and officers</a> or via email.</p>
