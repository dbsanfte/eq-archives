		Lets see, we are way overdue on an update. As usual we killed lots and lots o stuff including quite a few Sontalaks (thx thx daily spawns and such 
		a massive pain in the ass to kill that we don't have to worry about people rushing us to it). Note uber positioning in the shot of his corpse. That takes skillz
		only a newbie would have. Had a few CT kills as well, note what happens when the group tries to talk smack to the bard.

		But uber bard that's not news, you kill that crap all the time! Right you are young whippersnapper. Just we running out of new stuff to kill. Fear not
		though, we just discovered ToV's named and the fun within. That should keep us occupied for months of wipeouts. To start it off we axed Ikatiar and Eashen
		a couple of times each and got some fairly nice loot including some <a href="images/items/ancientwyvernhideleggings.gif">legs</a>,
        <a href="images/items/ancientwyvernhideboots.gif">boots</a>, <a href="images/items/maskofthesky.gif">mask</a>,

        <a href="images/items/clawoflightning.gif">claw</a>. Can check the points page history to see who
		got what, cause I am sure as hell to lazy to look it up. On our weekly sleepers tomb clearing we finally got a primal brawl stick... f33r
        Ushio. Also got a trio of 
		clawed guardian bracers too.

		After we cleared the first two warders again in record time we thought we would give the third warder a try for the first time, expecting
		of course to get our asses handed to us. Imagine our suprise when we kicked his ass with nary a hitch. Southern got a primal warhammer and
		Gardner a pretty nifty <a href="images/items/sceptredestruction.gif">Sceptre</a>. Feeling cocky we then moved onto the fourth and final warder in the hopes of waking the sleeper...

		In retrospect we feel pretty confident that our loss was do to missing the Can o' Whoop Ass cleverly hidden by the warder beforehand. Up to the fourth
		warder all you can think of is 'This is all that's preventing the Sleeper from waking up?!?' Then you feel much better after meeting Ms Ventani, 
		keeper of the holy Can o' Whoop Ass.

	What does a giant faction guild do after they killed everything? Why go do the 10th Dain ring and kill Dozekar of course. 
	Its decidedly more difficult to save the dorfs when they want 90% of your force dead on sight, and Dozekar is a little more interesting too.
	But in the end Gingdied ended up with the first Dain ring on Tunare, and Dozekar did a painful bellyflop into the fiery inferno of hell.

	CT, Statue, Vindicator, Tormax, Yel, Gore, blah blah blah. We killed lots of shit again since the last update. Yesterday was the first time in weeks 
	that the Warders where back up and we where chomping at the bit to give them a try. Two flawless victories (read: zero deaths) 
	over the first two warders netted us a bunch of crap we really didn't need or want. 
	Well of course minus the Mask of the Tinkering, which yours truly walked away with, creating the first Bard Gnome on Tunare. I already have my 
	hotkey ready /r "Gnome mask? I don't have a gnome mask, I was born like this."

  We finally got around to visiting Kael and giving tormax a try, first two attempts where pretty ugly examples of why bind rushing

	I believe Salsa and Kait walked off with his boots, Yikten his head, and Santhia his crown. Also rocked velketor for shits and grins afterwards, 
	was actually a fairly sloppy fight but after a Tormax win you really cant lose to Velk. Who is steve? Well if frozen jesus is foh, the ass triton, 
	and motoo LoS then Talisman gets Steve. Steve kicks ass and has a wicked temper. Don't fuck with steve.

  	I still wouldn't take him home and introduce him to the folks, but these days Tunare's most notorius Stinky SK is almost respectable.

	Back on the farm we cleared vp in a day for shits and grins and waxed Gozzrem in ToV for the first time on tunare too
	(hrm, no ss's, oh yah, wasn't there). Did sleepers again obtaining Blitz and Llaen a primal war sword each and was hoping to knock off
	a warder or two but of course they where permakilled thx thx verant. Oh well, we did the next best thing and fucked around with 
	the sleeping sleeper. He has a <a href="images/oneliners/sleeperquad.gif">mean quad</a> but we reigned victorious and pushed him into the water 
	where he promptly proceeded to drown. Speaking of drowning today was rather busy, starting off with a yelinak raid. Continuing
	with the water sports we pushed him off into the drink and after various shouts of camp! tards! and fuck we lost!! we realized that
	minus cASSai none of us melt when hit with water. Yelinak was quickly dispatched thereafter and despite gorum fouling the water
	was a fun fight.

    For some this was the most dangerous part of the evening, as talisman member
    after talisman member died while looting the corpse (<img border="0" src="images/oneliners/bob_drown.gif" width="244" height="14">).
    After the loot was recovered by our prize frogmen Daphni made off with the gauntlets and
    Yalara a sleepers key. Night still young we ran to fear to knock off CT for the scarecrow. Did i say scarecrow? 
    I meant Ushio. Also killed Sontalak the day or so before, Gardner getting a sleepers key, and the guild
    vault a whopping 6 spells! Verant has found the perfect balance of risk/reward with
    Sontalak.&nbsp;</font>

  So i was walking out from work tonight and saw a bumpersticker on a security guards yugo (well some pos car i didnt recognize). 
  It just said goatwhore.com. My first thought was to be afraid, and my second was that this was most
  definitely a sign from god. 
  Sure enough, I got home and our new url was finally up, talismanguild.org. No, we
  didn't lose norrath.org, but somebody forgot to
  pay internic and well, its just easier to register a new domain name. And as a bonus this url actually makes sense! My other excuse for
  not updating the www site was of course our guild Vegas trip. Is your guild cool enough to have a guild trip to
  Vegas? What? I 
  didn't think so. <br>
  So lets see... what's new. Continuing our fine tradition of being Tunare's first whores we wacked quite a few new mobs including 
  Sontalak, Yelinak, Telkorenar, and the Final Arbitor. Counting from the last update i did
  that's 2 Yelinaks, 2 Statues, 3 Vindicators, 2 Gorenaires,
  1 Sontalak, 2 CT, 1 Dain, 2 MoTG, 2 Progenitor, 1 Arbitor, and 1 Telkorenar. Ton of Zlandicar and Klandicar too I am sure, and other
  misc goobleygook.

  The frosty bitch Gorenaire actually dropped a paly book for Kable finally. Me and Aviar got gauntlets of dragon slaying from Yelinak, with 
  Aviar also taking home a primal warsword. The lovely Cyprusia looted a priceless war hammer for her bat wing farming escapades, 
  rest was the same ol same ol, can check out the points pages if you are so inclined.
  The best of the best SK tournement suprised nobody, with our very own Gorum handily taking the event.
