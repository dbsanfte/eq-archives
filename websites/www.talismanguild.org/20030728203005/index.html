			<p>This week we got off to a great start in Plane of Time.  Tonight we first took down Terris Thule after several unsuccessful attempts on Monday night.</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/072103/tt.jpg"></p>

<p>With Terris Thule dead, we moved on to Tallon Zek next.  With true inspiration from Blitzberg and his valiant battlecry "PUSH THE LIMIT", we took him down flawlessly on our second attempt keeping Blitzberg up the whole fight.  Had he died and we lost our battlecry, we surely would have lost! Like so many of our kills, we RARELY leave the corpse in a sexy position for a nice screenshot, so I leave you with this...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/072103/limit.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/072103/tz.jpg"></p>

<p>Next we are targeting Vallon Zek to complete our sweep of the Wave 4 Time Gods as we work our way towards Wave 5.  The week is still young!  That's all the big flashy important news for now.  Now on to the smaller, less flashy, but still very important news...</p>
<p>Since we never have cool screenshots of corpses, here's a new mob that looks pretty cool from the Plane of Time that's still alive.  It's much easier to photograph living mobs than dead mobs.</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/072103/hobgoblin.jpg"></p>

<p>I know last update I revealed some of Talisman's top secret leet strategies and said it was for one time only.  Well, luckily for everyone, I lied.  After many long nights of talks with the guild, I finally got permission to post a couple more leet strats.  We really take pride in helping other raiding guilds improve their tactics.  If you remember from last time, we recommended using rangers to tank mobs like Vindicator.  Well, we've now refined our tanking strategies to make use of other classes as tanks to free up our warriors and other melee to do other important tasks.  This first shot we will demonstrate how to properly use a cleric as your main tank.  Although often mistaken as a healing class, Clerics in reality make excellent tanks!  Here's what you do.  You put your warriors in a shielding order, very similar to the much more primitive "Complete Heal" order used in the old days.  The warriors will alternate shielding the Cleric while he tanks.  We find our clerics hold aggro just as well as our warriors, if not better.  Simply chain casting small stuns allows the cleric to maintain beautiful aggro for the duration of any fight.  This is a next generation tactic that you can employ today!</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/072103/ushio.jpg"></p>

<p>Once you master using Clerics as main tanks, which is easy if you follow the simple instructions above, you can begin to use other classes who often find themselves standing around dreaming of the day they too can tank a mob, classes like say....shamans.  Therefore, we put this idea to the test and decided to tank uber mobs with a shaman instead of a warrior, ranger, or cleric.  The verdict??  IT REALLY WORKS!!  This tanking tactic is implemented very similar to the cleric tank tactic.  Use your warriors in a shielding order, just like clerics...it IS why they got all those AA's right?  Simply have the Shaman stand in front of the mob and do everything they can to piss the mob off.  Soon, the mob will be dead.  Sure it takes practice, but we got it to work on our first attempt!</p>

<p>That's it for this update as far as news and useful information.  Now for the "Behind the Scenes" part of Talisman.  Remember, although a family guild, everything we do and say is NOT rated PG-13.  If you're under 13 years old, please do not read past this point and go back Ragnrok's website, www.carebears.com, if you're over 13, you might wanna go check out that website too, but read these quotes first.</p>

<p>We are constantly working to improve our strategies in all of our encounters.  We feel it's time to share a little of that with the public, so we'll first show how to kill Vindicator.  Have a Ranger be the main tank.  This serves several purposes.  First of all, it obviously gives you a tank, secondly, everyone likes to see rangers die, so you really can't lose with this method.  Here's a picture of Eonowyn doing the new and improved "Ranger AoW Pin".  Why he's trying to look up Vindicator's skirt, we still don't know...</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/063003/vindi.jpg"></p>

<p>Next... Talisman has always prides itself on our perfect placement of mobs.  This is key to any encounter.  Again, for one time only, we share our secret in how to achieve "Perfect Mob Placement".  This next series of photos reveal how to place a dragon.  You'll note that the dragon is dead, assuring you that the placement strategy does work.</p>

<p>Other than our placement strategy practice, this week we've spent most of our time reflagging and killing some elemental gods, Fennin Ro and Xegony among them.  Otherwise, nothing all that eventful to report right now.  After the 4th of July weekend we'll be back to trying to progress through the Plane of Time.</p>

			<p>The last couple nights have marked our first real progress in the Plane of Time.  Tonight we killed our first god in Plane of Time, Saryrn.  Was an interesting fight to say the least.  Using some inside information Qhue had learned about, we performed a secret pre-kill dance as you can see here (it's not secret anymore)... </p>

<p align ="left"><img src="images/062203/dance.jpg"></p>

<p>Here you can see tonight's target, standing proud and lookin' sexy in her room.  Even mobs deserve respect, so I won't bother showing the poor artistic painting of her hanging just outside her room.</p>

<p align ="left"><img src="images/062203/livesaryrn.jpg"></p>

<p>Our pre-kill dance completed, we charged into the room and with a medium amount of difficulty, dispatched her.  Here's a picture of the corpse.  I swear we killed her...really...we did... look REALLY close and you can see a part of her... </p>

<p align ="left"><img src="images/062203/saryrn.jpg"></p>

<p>Ok, still don't believe us?  Fine, here's the loot...  Grats Ragnrok on the Belt and Mallatik on the mask.  Plane of Time should be extremely smooth from this point forward considering the two biggest bitches in the guild got the first 2 god loots ;-P </p>

<p align ="left"><img src="images/062203/saryrnloots.jpg"></p>

<p>This weekend we went on a fishing trip with our good friends over at Divine Crusade to where else, but the Plane of Water.  Both guilds were in desperate need of several elusive flags, so in a late night expedition, a handful of members from each guild (I think around 10 or 15 from each) joined forces to reel in the giant squid known as Cornaiv.  With only 43 people (but who was really counting?) we killed him flawlessly.  Emodius died during the battle clinching flawless status.  Lots of flags were gained allowing us all to run off happily to the Plane of Time where our most difficult foe has been the evil "Lack of Attendance Monster"</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/062203/cornaiv.jpg"></p>

<p>Cornaiv dropped standard loot that everyone's seen before and it was split between the two guilds.  However, I'd like to take this time to congratulate Talisman on a server-wide first piece of loot that Blitzberg failed to mention on our last kill of The Rathe.  Talisman got the very first Fanny Pack to drop.  Quite simply put, this item owns.  You can store all kinds of loot in it...coins, small weapons, sunglasses, the list is endless.  Although jealousy quickly spread through the guild, almost tearing us apart, in the end it was Blitzberg who won this item.  Here he is standing proud with his new sword and new sexy fanny pack.  Gratz Blitz!  You deserve it!</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/062203/blitz.jpg"></p>

<p>Like many guilds these days in Everquest, a constant problem during these summer time months, is raid attendance.  Here at Talisman we're no different.  This apathy sometimes leads to extreme measures, including recruiting family members.  Since his weekend debut in the theatres is over, we were lucky to be able to add Tulk's long lost brother, Hulk, to our ranks.  Although a newbie, we feel his tanking ability is unmatched.  Plus, unlike most of our tanks, Hulk doesn't require weapons, so we don't feel he'll become a loot whore.  Quite honestly, he doesn't even need armor.  This guy is just a machine.  Give him a pair of ripped up shorts out of the guild vault, and he's good to go!  Welcome aboard Hulk!</p>

<p>Fortunately, due to a lot of our recent successes in the Elemental planes, and now in the Plane of Time, we're being flooded with applicants.  Needless to say, it's a recruiter's market right now.  Hulk is great and all...but....there is another....yessss.....Seeeester....That's right folks, SHEHULK.  She doesn't have the same tanking power as her brothers Tulk and Hulk, but what we like about her....seriously....is that she's freakin' HOT!  Hope you make it in the guild Shehulk!</p>

<p>One of the most challenging parts of doing an update like this, is to come up with themes that are of interest to the majority of our readers.  What topics do people want to read about?  What do people find funny?  Well, Bobear offered a suggestion, that at first I brushed off, but upon further analysis, concluded that it might just be able to be done.</p>

<p>Before I start this section, I need to give a disclaimer.  What you are about to see and read, is REAL.  Everything that you will read actually did occur.  None of this was staged, which is honestly the most frightening part of this entire section.  If you have a heart condition, weak stomach, or just ate lunch, I kindly request you to skip over this section as it will only cause health problems.  For those who don't know him, Heydin is one of our halfling ass stabbers.  Why are the halflings always the weirdos?  Soooo....Without further ado...I bring you...</p>

<p>Hi again.  For those of you who read the Heydin section, I applaud you, for those who skipped ahead, I understand.  Next, I'd like to do a sort of riddle from Blitzberg.  You job, as the reader, is to figure out what he's referring too.  In this case, and this case only, thinking perverted thoughts IS OK!!  Feel free to post your answers on our General Forum.</p>

<p align ="left"><img src="images/062203/riddle.jpg"></p>

<p>Well, that's about it for this update.  Not much new to report really.  The vast majority of us are now flagged for the Plane of Time, so we hope to start showing some progression there and will report back on the next update.  In addition to Hulk, we do have quite a few new members who recently joined us as full time members over the past couple months.  Welcome aboard Velo, Celestias, Maynar, Kelphas, and Maleki.

<p>Oh yes... the Quote section.  Most members probably feel they escaped this time courtesy of Heydin and Blitzberg.  *laugh*  I don't think so...  Another disclaimer, despite a lot of the perverted and sexual connotations you're about to read, Talisman is really a very clean cut, family values type of guild.</p>
