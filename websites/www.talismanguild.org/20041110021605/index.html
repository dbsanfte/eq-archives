			<p>Not a lot of Big News (tm), but in recent weeks Talisman
              has been working towards Anguish. No, no, not anguish over the
              upcoming releases of EverQuest 2, World of Warcraft, or even Halo
              2 and what those releases might do to our raiding numbers. No we
              have been actively working towards the zone of Anguish.</p>
			<p>	This has required a multi-pronged (not pr0ned) approach in that
              we have to keep 70-ish people motivated enough to break into groups
              to work on a signet quest, and then also raid together enough to
              beat several raid-level trials for access.</p>
			<p>Well, after repeatedly beating the trials for Adaption (not Adaptation
              curiously enough), Corruption, Endurance, Foresite, and Specialization,
              we did finally beat the trial for Hate. Hate took us longer than
              most because we were actively trying to find a way to beat it *without*
              gimping it. We tried it over and over and got down to the final
              mob &quot;the good way,&quot; only to find out from 'sources' that
              we are SUPPOSED to gimp the trial. Wow... what a design. Woo.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Anyway, we have decided for the moment to hold off on Anguish
              until more of our numbers are flagged/keyed/cool enough to go.
              So tune in soon for our adventures in Anguish!</p>
            <p>Mixed in among all those trials, we of course continue to beat
              down the Riftseeker's Rabble whenever we see them up. We also make
              a point of setting aside time each week to knock out the raid-ish
              level encounters for our folks' epics. We're so sweet. :)</p>
            <p>That's about all I have to say about that.</p>
            <p><img src="images/110504/KaitsHead.jpg" width="50" height="54"> So now, we turn to the <font size="+1">Talisman Opinion Page...</font></p>
            <p>Well the holiday season is fast approaching and with it comes
              the impending release of EverQuest 2. I won't comment on the state
              of the game but as a good-will gesture, let me offer SOE something
              to make their marketing and financial people very happy - perhaps
              distracting them from pushing EQ2 out the door until it's finished...
              /cough</p>
            <p>What is it that every little kid likes? What is it that computer
              geeks and geekettes secretly adore? And further, and perhaps most
              importantly to The Suits, what is it in the Anime/Manga world that
              is all the rage?</p>
            <p>Why, <strong>Plush Toys</strong> of course!</p>
            <p>SOE has wholly overlooked this segment of the market. They've
              tried action figures of about 6 types. They've tried cell-phone
              EQ (WTF???), and they've done the back-pack. They even custom-made
              an EQ fanny pack for Beldon, but we're not sure what he paid them
              with, nor do we really wish to know.</p>
            <p>But what they really need are EQ plush toys.</p>
            <p>Imagine the possibilities. You could have whole collections of
              them. EQ Plush Toys fall into several easily-markettable categories
              or sets. The first could be:</p>
		    <table>
			<tr><td colspan="2"><strong>&quot;EQ: Mobs of the Old World&quot;</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td class="TextNormal" width="130">
            <ul><li>Orc Pawn</li>
              <li>Bixie</li>
              <li>Caiman</li>
              <li>Fire Beetle</li>
              <li>Pixie</li>
              <li>Gargoyle</li>
			</ul></td>
			<td  class="TextNormal" width="349">
            Re-live your EQ Childhood with a wonderful representation of all
              the little mobs we started with. Come on ... how CUTE would your
              own little stuffed Orc Pawn be!?!? You could hug him and squeeze
              him and then ruin his lands!</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            <p>Once SOE has whetted our appetites, they could then release:</p>
		    <table>
			<tr><td colspan="2"><strong>&quot;EQ: The Dragon Collection&quot;</strong></td>
			</tr>
			<tr><td class="TextNormal" width="150">
              <ul><li>Lady Vox</li>
              <li>Lord Nagafen</li>

			</ul></td>
			<td class="TextNormal" width="329">
			Some were the Great End-All Beasts of the land when we were little.
              Then as the expansions arrived more dragons were added. A lot of
              us have fought them with our pixelated-selves, but for some, having
              their own Plush version is as close as they may come.</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
            <p>Then, SOE ups the ante with:</p>
			<table>
			<tr valign="top"><td class="TextNormal" width="50%">
              <strong>&quot;Collection 1 - Goddesses of EQ&quot;</strong>
              <ul><li>Tunare</li>
              <li>Xegony</li>
              <li>Terris Thule</li>
              <li>Saryn (Due to mature themes, ages 18+)</li>
			  </ul>
			</td>
			<td class="TextNormal" width="50%">
              <strong>&quot;Collection 2 - Gods of EQ&quot;</strong>
              <ul><li>Tallon Zek</li>
              <li>Vallon Zek</li>
              <li>Rallos Zek</li>
              <li>Bertoxxulos</li>
              <li>Cazic Thule</li>
              <li>Innothule</li>

            <tr><td class="TextNormal" colspan="2">Oooooo the gods and goddesses! Rule over your pretend lands with
              these dieties of the fantasy world. They're powerful. They're scary.
              And they are so squeezably loveable!</td>
			  </tr>
			</table>
            <p>And finally, to cap it off, SOE introduces the special offers.
              Some would be limited editions. Some would be promotional. And
              some would require outright bribes. SOE is well-known for the ultra-rare
              items, so they obviously can't have every one be able to just *buy*
              their whole Plush Line! Pfffft, silly people.</p>
		    <table width="100%">
			<tr><td><strong>Specials:</strong></td>
			</tr><td class="TextNormal">
              <ul><li>Talking Fippy Darkpaw</li>

              <li>EQ2 Baby Dragon</li>
			  </ul>
			  </td></tr></table>
            <p>To celebrate where it all began, a special edition plush toy would
              be the Talking Fippy Darkpaw! Squeeze his fuzzy belly and he utters
              his famous battle cry, <em>&quot;&lt;BBBBBAAAARRRKKKK!!!!!&gt; You
              humans will pay for ruining your homeland!! GRRRRRRRR!!!! Family
              Darkpaw of the Sabretooth Clan will slay you all!!&lt;BARK!&gt;&quot;</em></p>
            <p>Release the Sleeper on your unsuspecting Lego hoardes with the
              Plush Zerafym. If you never got to experience the thrill of releasing
              the virtual version, you now can with your very own hugable version
              of the most rare of the dragons.</p>
            <p>For those who never made it to the end of the Plane of Time, now
              you can have your own four-headed dragon. And for those that did
              - you know you want one too!</p>
            <p>To reclaim some fun and satisfaction from an otherwise lousy expansion,
              SOE can offer the GoD &quot;Goat&quot; plush toy. Now really, how
              cute would your own plush goat be!?!?! Pliable (and safe!) little
              spines to hold the colorful pennants. The happy little smile each
              of the Pixxts have as they crush your raid. Fun!</p>
            <p>(I would submit that they should give a free Plush Goat to every
              registered GoD buyer as compensation for the expansion, but I digress...)</p>
            <p>And finally, to celebrate the (pushed back) release of EQ2, get
              your own little EQ2 Baby Dragon! The adorability factor is almost
              unbearable!</p>
            <p>Buy them for your kids, buy them for your friends (you know you
              don't have many, so it will be cheap), and above all else - buy
              them for yourself!</p>
            <p>Once you have enough, you can conduct your own raids. Just listen
              to this testimonial:</p>

<p>Well, my lazy ass is finally getting around to doing a long overdue update.  Back on August 18th we finally got our first kill of Pixtt Xxeric Kex (or more commonly known as "Goat Bitch"), which yet again proved to be an incredibly difficult encounter to overcome.  After weeks of throwing ourselves at the slaughter, we finally pulled it off.  Since then we've killed her again as well as another couple slayings of Zun'Muram Tkarish Zyk.  Next on our hit list is Pixtt Riel Tavas.  We are making decent progress on her and hope to have her (or is it a him?) dead within another week.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/riel.jpg"></p>
<p>In other less exciting news, we've killed the Cragbeast Queen a couple more times and also took down Suled Dar's Shade a couple times to complete our *NEW* Veeshan's Peak keys.  Of course, we haven't stepped foot in the new Veeshan's Peak yet, but... hey... we got our keys!  Hooray for us!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/cb_corpse.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/veeshan_drag.jpg"></p>

<p>Other than that, not much worthy of reporting.  These days we usually find ourselves doing CR in Tacvi with periodic reflagging/farming in earlier zones.  We're pleased to have survived our 5th straight EQ summer slump grinding through what has been the most difficult expansion we've experienced.  We have our fingers crossed that the upcoming Omens of War expansion will prove to be a much smoother release throughout ALL of the content.</p>

No freakin clue how Galadir got in. I didn't even know he applied till he was in the guild. We make mistakes too. And you might die more than rangers because you have CDS, or better known as Chronic death syndrom. There is no cure for it, and of course, it's fatal.</font>

2) I've been told that elitist bastards like to "wave their dicks around". Umm, well, I'm a chick. Where can I get a dick to wave around? How much would it cost?<br>
3) Why hasn't Talisman washed Eonowyn yet? He's really beginning to smell rancid and those gnomish gas-masks that you all wear don't have enough AC for those bruising Gates of Discord encounters! Not to mention that we can smell Eonowyn all the way over here on Povar...</font>

<font color="#009933">Kophry:<br>
1) Well, you may not remember becoming one. With many religions they do this proceedure at birth, so it's less tramatic than other stages in life.<br>
2) They actually meant picks, wave your picks around. So go kill an orc, get his picks and wave them in the air like you just don't care.<br>
3) Eonowyn purposely greases himself so he's tougher to grab a hold of to try to wash. It's like a weekly event we like to call "Greased retard roundup", we haven't won yet </font>

As I ponder upon the meaning of life, I have stumbled across this revealation. Life, in it's infinite trickeries, is about coming to terms with oneself. So I want to ask you a few questions;<br>
1.) Are you my daddy?<br>
2.) Were you ever a GI Joe? Which one? If you were that would be cool as Pepsi One, with 2/3 less calories.<br>
3.) When is it okay to pass gas in front of your significant other? Do you go first or go last?<br>
4.) So you were a GI Joe commando...did you have to undergo surgery to get the Kung-Fu grip?<br>
5.) What was Cobra commander's real name? Why did he wear that mask? Was it to hide a horribly disfigured and/or scarred face?<br>
6.) Did Leatherneck know the Marines Hymn?<br>
7.) There was a Duke and Butch but was there a Hoss? A General Lee???<br>
8.) Why do you deny your GI Joe heritage????</font>

<font color="#009933">Sirulus Delon:<br>
1) No, you are your own father. Try to figure that one out!<br>
2) I was Destro<br>
3) As long as the first time you do it you make it a "Dutch Oven" you're ok.<br>
4) I was born with a Kung-Fu grip, even on my feet.<br>
5) Chuck was his real name, he wore the mask to keep mosquitos away.<br>
6) Leatherneck could belch the Mariens Hymm.<br>
7) They nicknamed Lady Jane "General Lee" because they all rode her.. ZING!!<br>

I could easily go on about "pinching a loaf", "dropping the kids off at the pool" and "making offerings at the porcelain altar", but I think the fact that you have named your own excrement "soldiers" may do the job better than I can.</font>

What is the most efficient method for CR after a raid wipes out?</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Kielle:<br>
First is to die. That's easy enough. Once you die take an afk, preferably at least 5 minutes. Then come back and complain that CR is taking too long. Then consent the rogues, but make sure to misspell all of their names. Once rez'd if you're a cleric, make sure you MGB Virtue to piss everyone off, if you're a ranger MGB SoT. After being rez'd, don't loot anything, find a mob, and train the CR spot. This is very important not to die before you get to the group, then blame someoene else. Once back to bind, go afk for another 5 minutes, come back and complain the CR is taking too long. Send as many tells to raid officers as you can with strat ideas, but make sure they make no sense and are in some over formal form of technical speak. Bitch a lot about how Sony sucks in guild chat. Then get a rez, and go afk until next wipe.</font>
