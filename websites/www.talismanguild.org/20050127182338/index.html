			<tr><td><p><img src="images/012405/NekkidPortis.jpg" width="150" height="304" align="left" style="margin: 15px"></p>
			  <p>Most people don't like to read so you are
			    always supposed to open with a picture. Well I like
			    to type, and there is nothing picture-worthy until later. So
			    until I get to it, here is a picture of nekkid Portis flaunting
			    her evil abs of steel. </p>
			  <p>We've been working on the Jelvan event in Anguish a lot lately,
			      but until we beat it (VERY close!) let me catch you up on what's
		      been happening. With all the time spent waiting on lock-out timers
			    to expire, we have to find something for the guild to do, or
			    bad things happen. The parents among you are well aware
			    of the destructive power of unsupervised children. It's a suprisingly
			    good analogy. </p>
			  <p>Talisman has a dark shadow across its past. It's something we don't
			      speak of much, but it haunts us. That dark page from our past
			      is Tacvi. It is the only zone since we formed that has truly
			      beaten us. True, true, it was also the zone that drove away
			      the top end of the guild hierarchy due to bugs and lack of
			      itemization. It was the zone that was tuned (poorly) for level
			      70 and the gear and AAs that go with it - but went live in
			      an expansion where the level stayed at 65. It was the zone
			      that generated the need for the Guild Summit that created the
			      relationship between SOE and some of the guilds to allow actual
			      guild testing for upcoming raid content. Yes, with all those
			      reasons for our failure to beat this zone, it still never sat
		      well that we never finished it.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both">So we changed that.</p>
			    <p>On one night, as time-filler, we went in and not only tore up the mobs
			      we had beaten when it was the high-end, but also were able
			      to finally beat the mob that had halted our progress. Then
			      we chose another night, and made Tacvi our raid target from
			      start to finish. We had near-unprecedented numbers, and it
			      was reflected in our progress. In one single night we were
			      able to empty the zone right up until the final boss. By then,
			      it was far too late, we were tired, and we had made our point. </p>
			    <p>Now a random collection of pictures from our night in Tacvi:</p>

				<p align="center"><img src="images/012405/Krakxt.jpg" width="364" height="268"></p>
		      <p>Pay special attention to the following. Two different mobs (check
		        the names) similar death poses ... and the same corpse in the
		        same position in both. :) </p>

            <p>In the days after Christmas, Talisman took

              In a second win, Lobsang picked up a helmet thingy, Daydreamer

            <p><font size="+1">Holiday Party</font></p>
            <p>A little after  the win in Anguish, we decided to retreat to a
              tropical island for a little holiday cheer. We had plans for singing,
              dancing, nude limbo, and general reverie. Massive amounts of alcohol
              were to be provided as a &quot;training aid&quot; in order to maximize
              alcohol tolerance for those few (lots) who never bothered to work
              on it.</p>
            <p>A tropical island has its advantages for a holiday bash. Mainly
              no neighbors to annoy or sicken (nude limbo you recall!) But little
              did we realize that this island was the home to Trakanon! Or his
              bastard of an older brother - Ragefire, who as it turns out
              is not very social and complained loudly at the party.</p>
            <p align="center"><img src="images/010705/Ragefire.jpg" width="528" height="420"></p>
            <p>So we soundly kicked his behind! Mind you that &quot;soundly&quot; involved
              25 minutes of running around and around the island kiting the big
              decaying lizard by yours truly. All this while mobs and AE debuffs
              assaulted the raid, keeping 3/4ths of the raid out of commission
              either medding, rezzing, or facedown in the sand.</p>
            <p><img src="images/010705/Paladins.gif" width="361" height="52"></p>
            <p>But after all was said and done, our own melee cleric Tallie
              gained the very first Cleric Epic 2.0 on our server! Congrats!</p>
            <p>Emboldened by all the alcohol, we  revisited our  running wildly
              plan to gain another  Epic 2.0 for Glori.</p>

            <p>Talisman is always on the look-out for dedicated and talented
              people to keep our ranks full. We are a raiding guild and as such
              an applicant must have a high playtime availability, be adaptable
              to changing circumstances, and most of all be good in their class.
              We are in most need of Beastlords, Bards, Clerics, Druids, and
              Rogues, but exceptional candidates of any class are always welcome.

			<p>Before and after other raids for the last few weeks, we have been making
			  our way into  Anguish with the full expectation of getting our
			  heads handed to us by Keldovan the Harrier in the hopes of gleaning
			  some information from the encounter. For a long time, very little
			  we did seemed to make a difference. In the last couple of days however,
			  tiny rays of hope began to shine through the gloomy clouds of despair. Wednesday
			  night, things finally came together in one climatic moment when we knocked
			  off Keldovan in Anguish!</p>
			<p>We can really be proud of ourselves.  Talisman has long been known as a
			  guild that could  accomplish tasks faster than a lot of guilds
			  who have far more members. Our numbers have been relatively low
			  of late due in a large part to the glut of really good games that
			  are out, and some of our raids have suffered for it. The win over
			  Keldovan really showed what skilled and dedicated players can accomplish
			  once we set our minds to it - and stop whining over low turn-out.
			  With the exception of the first day or two after gaining entry,
			  not a single instance in Anguish has been filled to capacity. And
			  yet still we were able to win this encounter (and others) and look
			  ahead for more.</p>

            <p>Yes I've been quite lax in posting quotes. Mostly because I hadn't
              been collecting any! Well to appease the frothing masses who skim

            <p>It's been said Talisman has a lot of active wizards. We need more
