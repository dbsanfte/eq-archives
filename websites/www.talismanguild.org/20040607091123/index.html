			<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/soe_logo.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/group.jpg"></p>
<p>This weekend marked the first Everquest Guild Summit in San Diego hosted by Sony Online Entertainment.  50 Guild Leaders were invited across the top guilds among all the servers.  The purpose of this meeting was to share dialog between the Everquest community and the SoE development team on current in-game issues as well as suggestions for future changes/additions to the game.  The event proved to be very informative on both sides.  I look for some positive changes to take place in the immediate future as well as down the road as we move forward in the current expansion and into future expansions.  The range of topics discussed varied a lot from high end raiding content down to single group content. We also discussed beta testing, raid and guild functionality, itemization, Epic 2.0, quests, customer support, and much much more.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/thomas.jpg"></p>
<p>Thomas Taylor of SoE did a spectacular job organizing this event from getting all of us from the airport to the hotel, to the game, and to all the events throughout the weekend.  On behalf of myself, and I'm sure I speak for the rest of the attendees, a big thanks for making this event so successful considering it was a very last minute idea.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/petco.jpg"></p>
<p>The weekend began on Friday evening where we were treated to a Padres game at the new Petco Park</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/beld_soe.jpg"></p>
<p>Saturday morning after breakfast at the hotel, we headed over to SoE headquarters where the meat of the discussions was to occur in various breakout sessions.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/smedley.jpg"></p>
<p>Upon arrival we greeted by SoE president, John Smedley.  Smedley welcomed us and went over what the expectations were for the weekend both from SoE and what we could expect.  By the time he was done the one thing we were definitely clear about is that there will be no pirates in any upcoming expansions.  On a serious note though, he did address all the various issues that surfaced with the release of GoD, most of which resulted from insufficient testing, particularly with the higher end raid content.  Many suggestions were brought up on how to address this moving forward.  I think most of us came away feeling confident that there won't be a repeat performance of what happened in GoD.  Several ideas are being tossed around to make things much smoother in the future come release time.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/art.jpg"></p>
<p>After the warm welcome, we began the day with a tour of the SoE facility.  Our group first went thru the Art department where most of the Everquest art design is created for all the various creature and weapon designs.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/epic2.jpg"></p>
<p>We also got a sneak peak of the upcoming Epic 2.0 weapons.  Subject to change of course, but it was great to get a feel for what we can expect to see in Omens.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/gm_PIT.jpg"></p>
<p>From there we ventured over to the server room where many of the servers reside.  No pictures allowed here, but basically it was a bunch of racks of computers.  Each server uses about 30 pc's, all P4's.  From there we headed over to the GM pit area where most of the lead GM's work from.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/hwuong.jpg"></p>
<p>It was here where I had the opportunity to meet Hwuong in person.  We've posted plenty of in-game pics, but now the true identity of EQ's most ruthless GM is revealed!!  (I bet you all thought he was Asian like I did!) ;-P</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/petitions.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's the wall of petitions for all the servers.  This is the place where petitions are resolved or escalated.  With the newly introduced petition system, most people should see dramatic improvement in how petitions are handled.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/brenlo.jpg"></p>
<p>Alan Crosby (aka "Brenlo") also spent a lot of time with us throughout the weekend during the tours, discussions, and events.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/EQ2.jpg"></p>
<p>From the GM pit, we headed over to the Everquest 2 development area where we met senior producer, John Blakely.  The graphics and sound looked outstanding.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/blakely.jpg"></p>
<p>After the tour we split up into 5 groups each with some of the development team.  Our group worked with Jonathan Caraker (aka "Prathun") and Jason Hash, one of the other designers.  Had some great discussion during this session discussing things such as augments, the ultra-high in demand endurance augments, Guild reflagging, Lots of raid functionality ideas, in-game support for critical issues, etc...  We look to see the results of much of this discussion in game moving forward, some sooner than later.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/prathun.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's our token uber guild picture.  In the picture is Thomas from SoE, Tikker from Legacy of Steel, Gaklek from Sovereign, Sikanak from Dark Horizon, Beldon from Talisman, Grabbit from Township Rebellion.  I'm horrible with names so sorry for those I forgot the names of.  Was great meeting all these people in person as well as all the other people I had the opportunity to meet during the weekend.  Certainly a LOT of EQ knowledge to be had at this event.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/ubers.jpg"></p>
<p>A few of us had the opportunity to sit with Rashere, the developer of Txevu, for dinner on Saturday evening.  In the pic below is myself (Beldon), Rashere, Grabbit (raid leader from Township Rebellion) and Michael of Ascending Dawn (don't know his game name).  It was fun sharing our experiences in the zone up to this point.  It was great having the chance to interact with the developers and share ideas throughout the whole weekend.  Overall from all the discussions we had, it's clear that the development team puts in a lot of work into this game that we've all been playing for years now.  Despite all the ridicule people throw towards them, the team really does seem genuinely interested in continuing to improve the game and address issues that need to be corrected.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/rashere.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's another shot of myself and Grabbit with more of the development team at dinner on Saturday night.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/devs.jpg"></p>
<p>Cynosure and Talisman friends at last?!?!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/060604/beld_krey.jpg"></p>
<p>Well, I put this together pretty fast, main reason being to cut down on the tell hell from everyone asking how the event went.  I think I speak for the majority of those who attended in saying that we were all quite impressed with how SoE treated us for the weekend.  It was top notch.  They wined and dined us, took us to a ball game, gave us a gift bag of cool stuff like EQ keyboards, t-shirts, caps, and more.  Most importantly though was the interaction we were able to have between the gaming community and the development team.  This is the first event of this kind that I've really been involved in. I think the advantages of holding an event like this are significant for both the players as well as the developers.  In a matter of a couple days we managed to provide an enormous amount of feedback.  All the discussions seemed very civil and professional.  A LOT of the ideas that were brought up were fantastic. I think both the players and the developers saw and heard things they wouldn't otherwise have thought of.  The obvious question from most people will be...That's nice and all, but will the changes discussed actually ever be implemented?  Well, that is yet to be seen, but SoE indicated that some of the ideas would begin being worked on as early as Monday morning.  Others will be addressed in the very near future.  I could go over the list, but that'd be an entire other update.  Instead, I'd just say keep your eyes open for some new and exciting features and most importantly, for buggy content to be addressed quickly and be much less prevalent in the future.  Much of the theme of the weekend was areas where GoD zones were either buggy or incomplete which caused many guilds a lot of heartache over the past few months.  Many suggestions were offered on ways to have content be as solid as possible when it goes live.  I'm sure lots of the other attendees will be posting up similar updates so will hopefully hit on areas I missed.  Check around your favorite EQ websites.  Lots of pictures were taken so I'm sure you'll see lots of fresh reading material!</p>

<p>On March 23, Talisman continued our trend of Sloppy....er....Serverwide Seconds with our defeat of Noqufiel granting us access to Txevu, the next zone in GoD progression.  Inktu'Ta was an interesting zone with creative encounters giving us a change of pace from previous pushes to end-game content.  Sloppy seconds aside, we did land a serverwide first Qvic Breastplate.  Gratz Tallie!!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/052404/qvicbp.jpg"></p>
<p>Tonight we ventured into Txevu for the first time with a rag-tag crew of 43 to do some exploring.  We were able to take down both Aneuk Nyrt Ymosa and Aneuk Rilst Uskst scoring Kaitlynn the first Qvic Paladin Breastplate serverwide and Chokidaii the first Beastlord Qvic Breastplate serverwide!  I forgot to take a screenshot of one of those guys, can you guess which one?!</p>

<p align ="center"><img src="images/052404/boss2.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/052404/pallybeastbp.jpg"></p>
<p>In other less exciting news, we finally decided to gank the Cragbeast Queen which proved to be faster, easier, and slightly more rewarding than killing a moss snake.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/052404/crag.jpg"></p>

<p>Once again, we are progressing through content faster than I can compile Quotes.  Absence will make the heart grow fonder though, I promise!  Look for Quotes to return soon!</p>
<p>So since we have no quote section, yet again... we offer you a new feature here at Talisman called...</p>
<p align="center"><font size="6">Ask Grunties!</font></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/052404/tard.jpg"></p>
<p>If you have any questions you'd like answers too, we have created a new thread on the Talisman Public Forum where you can ask your question to Grunties.  The answers will be posted on the next update.  These questions can be on any topic, EQ or not.  Why?  Because Grunties is a smart guy, and we feel this is a value-added service that we can provide our readers when they visit our boards.  Please take advantage of this service and provide us feedback or suggestions for other services.</p>
<p>Finally, because I don't know where else to put this or what to say about it, I leave you this...</p>

<p>Tonight, Talisman pulls off another serverwide 2nd with our defeat of Cynosure Kvanjji, which gives us access to a new hard-to-spell instanced zone - Inktu'Ta.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/051304/group1.jpg"></p>
<p>Received a recent request for a group shot, so here we are in Inktu'Ta.  Like any new zone, it didn't take us long to kill ourselves.  We'll be sure to report more on our progress here soon!  We are pleased to be the 2nd guild across all servers to gain access to this zone, so once again are treading in undiscovered territory.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/051304/boss.jpg"></p>
<p>This guy's friends are who had the honor of killing us.  His days of course are numbered.  We'll be back!</p>
