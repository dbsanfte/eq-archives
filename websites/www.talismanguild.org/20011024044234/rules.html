<BR>
&middot; All Talisman primaries 51+ are welcome on raids. Level 51+ secondaries may be brought to a raid with the
			approval of the raid leader.<BR>
			&middot; Anyone up for vote is invited to attend Talisman raids with the raid leader's approval.<BR>
			&middot; Guests may be invited to Talisman raids subject to the approval of the raid leader and any Talisman officer
			(or a raid officer if no officer present). Once they have approved the guest, the inviter must ask the guild if
			anyone objects to the individual joining the raid.<BR>
			&middot; Votees and guests may join /gui for a raid only if approved by the raid leader and if no one in the guild
			objects. Votees and guests must deguild following the raid.<BR>
			<BR>
			Awarding Points on Raids<BR>
<BR>
&middot; Points will be awarded to attendees at a kill if the mob is of sufficient difficulty (as to require 15+
			Talisman members in attendance) and at least one item worth points drops.<BR>
			&middot; At the raid leader's discretion, points may be awarded for attempts at mobs that have not yet been killed
			on the server.<BR>
			&middot; Points are awarded to the person, not the character. Each person is identified by one UserID.<BR>
			&middot; Raid leaders will be awarded a portion (*.2) of the raid point value and have available .2 points to award
			as a bonus for extraordinary effort. The bonus would be largely available to pullers or people involved in extensive
			corpse recovery efforts.<BR>
			<BR>
			Using Points to Buy Raid Items<BR>
<BR>
&middot; Whenever mobs of this caliber are killed, their loot will be up for distribution to attendees at the kill.<BR>
			&middot; All items are made available to primaries first. Each individual indicates who their primary is in the
			roster. Changes should be posted to the message board.<BR>
			&middot; Tradeable items that are not taken by a primary get turned into the Guild Vault. This allows all Talisman
			primaries a chance to get an item.<BR>
			&middot; No drop items are made available first to primaries who are present, then to primaries not on the raid,
			and then to secondaries if no primary wants the item.<BR>
			&middot; No drop items that are not purchased will be destroyed.<BR>
			&middot; Items are awarded based on a Top minus 5 system. This means that you take the person with the most points
			of those going in on an item, subtract 5, and anyone within that spread is in the lotto. For example, if 4 people<BR>
			with 35, 32, 29, and 21 points go in on an item, you take 35 (top) minus 5 = 30. Anyone between 35 and 30 can go
			in on the item.<BR>
			&middot; All points gained or lost up to the current raid will be considered.  It is each person's responsibility
			to know how many points they have when going in for an item.<BR>
			&middot; If a player wins an item, they lose points equal to the value of the item.<BR>
			&middot; At the time of loot awarding, attendees may trade in a point value item that is for the same slot as the
			item up for lotto. The points will be instantly credited to that player for the lotto. If the points added are<BR>
			not sufficient to put the attendee into a higher tier, then the item may not be traded in for instant credit.<BR>
			&middot; Items that are traded in at a raid are made available to those on the raid first and goes to the GV if
			nobody wants the item.<BR>
			&middot; Points can only be used by the person who earned those points.<BR>
			&middot; If an individual doesn't have enough points to buy an item outright, then they can go negative.<BR>
			&middot; Only those players that can actually use the item can enter the lotto.<BR>
			&middot; Any items won through this system cannot be traded, sold, or given to a secondary.<BR>
			<BR>
			Non Points Items<BR>
<BR>
Non point value items are randomed amongst primaries who want first, and secondaries if no primary wants the item.<BR>
			<BR>
			Guild Vault<BR>
<BR>
&middot; Items that are not claimed on a raid should be turned in to the Guild Vault. If the GV representative
			(Dwyer or Alendora) is not available, the item must be given to the raid leader or a guild officer.<BR>
			&middot; Items posted in the Guild Vault are available to level 51+ primaries for the first four days after posting.
			If more than one person is interested in the item, then it is awarded according to the Top minus 5 system.<BR>
			If no primaries want the item, it is then available to secondaries. Level 51+ secondaries receive priority. If
			after 7 days nobody enters in for an item, it can eventually be sold for guild money to be used for raid related
			expenses such as peridots, shaman potion ingredients, and coffins.<BR>
			&middot; Items can be turned into the GV at any time, but you must make arrangements to get the item to a GV representative.<BR>
			&middot; Items are considered &quot;in-system&quot; and &quot;out of system.&quot; &quot;In-system&quot; means
			that you paid points for the item. &quot;Out of system&quot; means you didn't pay points for the item.<BR>
			&middot; In-system items that are turned into the GV are credited at 75% of the item's current value.<BR>
			&middot; Out of system items that are turned into the GV receive a credit of 50% of the item's current value, but
			only if someone in the guild buys the item or if the GV representative is able to sell the item. Unsold items<BR>
			are returned to the owner.<BR>
			&middot; Any items bought through this system for a primary can not be traded, sold, or given to a secondary (with
			the following exception: if you have an item purchased for your primary that you wish to give to your secondary,<BR>
			you must post the item on the GV. If no primaries wish to purchase the item then you may give the item to your
			secondary. This cannot be done within 30 days of the original item purchase).<BR>
			&middot; You cannot go in on GV items if the value of the item would take you over -10 points.<BR>
			<BR>
			Spells and Spell Vault<BR>
			&middot; Spells that drop on raids will be awarded to primaries who can scribe the spell first. If no one on the
			raid can instantly scribe the spell, it is recommended that it be turned in to the Spell Vault to be distributed
			to those who who can scribe it.<BR>
			&middot; Spells that are not claimed on a raid should be turned in to the Spell Vault representative. If the representative
			is not available, keep the spells until the representative is available.<BR>
			&middot; Anyone who can instantly scribe a spell can request that spell from the SV. If more than one person wants
			the spell, it is lotto'd.<BR>
			&middot; If a rare spell goes unclaimed for 30 days, that spell is made available to secondaries. Common spells
			are made available to secondaries immediately.<BR>
			<BR>
			Gems and Gem Bank<BR>
			&middot; All gems that guildmembers loot or receive should be turned in to the Gem Bank representative (Lambert).
			You are encouraged to give gems to the Gem Bank whether it was acquired on a raid, in a group, or solo.  Banks
			work on withdrawals *and* deposits.<BR>
			The Gem Bank is open to all level 51+ primaries and secondaries, though primaries receive priority. Sub-level 51
			secondaries can withdraw gems with permission from the GB representative as well as an officer or raid officer.<BR>
