			  <p align="center"><img src="images/022006/HatchetTeam3.jpg" width="700" height="560"></p>
			  <p>On 2/02/06 we beat the big huggable lug that we all call Hatchey. It
			    took us a little bit to learn the encounter, but once figured
			    out, he's cake. The best part about learning a new encounter
			    all	the	effort the officers, raid officers, and smart-people
			    put into generating a well thought-out detailed Plan ... vs the
			    tarderrific comedy that is The Execution. On one such planning
			    night, our cameras were rolling .... </p>
			  <p>Redrover and Funeral demonstrate The Plan, including movements and mob
			    positioning:</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/022006/Hatchet_ThePlan_2.jpg" width="700" height="596"> </p>
			  <p>Execution however, differed on a few minor points:</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/022006/Hatchet_TheExecution.jpg" width="500" height="590"> </p>
			  <p>However, after much practice we finally applied our A Game and now consistantly
		      beat this encounter. </p>

			  <p><font size="+1">The Wailing Bradys:</font></p>
			  <p>We worked on the Wailing Sisters event for quite a while before we beat
			    it? Why ... well see above for Execution vs Planning. Anyway,
			    on 1/17/06 we beat the Brady Strumpets for the first time. Now
			    we just treat Sisters like Sorority girls at a kegger and have
			    our way with them whenever we please. * </p>

			  <p>On 1/04/06 we killed Zi-Thuuli for the first time. He is such a fun event

			    new members (and their touching first TalisDeaths),
			    and new loot. Some of the lows were the loss of some of our active

			  <p><font size="+1">2005 in Review:</font></p>
			  <p>January saw both our very first Warden Hanvar kill in Anguish, and our
			    very first (near) full-clearing of Tacvi. On the evening of January 17,
			    we knocked off Pixtt Xxeric Kex, Zun Muram Kvxe Pirik, Zun`Muram Yihst
			    Vor, Pixtt Kretv Krakxt, Zun'Muram Shaldn Boc, and Zun`Muram Mordl Delt
			    all back-to-back. (Ed note: Thank god for copy-n-paste - that's a LOT
			    of unpronounceable names!) I would like to add, once again, that SOE is
			    still missing out on a great opportunity for more money, since demand
			    remains high for the Plushy Tacvi Collection - most notably the Plushy
			    Goat (Xxeric Kex).</p>
<p>January also saw our first defeat of the Jelvan event in Anguish, followed
			    immediately by the 1st kill of the Arch Magus Vangl.</p>
			  <p><img src="images/122905/DeadVishTeam.jpg" width="350" height="130" style="margin: 10px" align="left"></p>
			  <p>In March, we killed Vishimtar for the first time. Of course by then we'd
			    already knocked off the rest of the Dragons of Norrath mobbies: Yar'Lir,
			    Kessdona, Ju'rek, Rikkukin, Volkara, Shogurei, T'Shara, and a special
			    appearance by Tirranun (though he left before we could kill him). We also
			    tore a hole in the wall in Lavastorm exposing the Broodlands, and then
			    promptly trampled the island into the sea, exposing T'Shara's lair.</p>

			  <p>In April we finally got the satisfaction we desired by getting our first
			    kill of Tunat Muram Cuu Vauax in Tacvi. With the Anniversary celebration
			    under way, we also took time to knock off the best loot-giving Fabled
			    mobs until the celebration was over. I use my Inviso-BP every day, so
			    am quite thankful. :)</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><img src="images/122905/Vishimtar_2.jpg" width="350" height="261" style="margin: 10px" align="left"></p>
			  <p>In June, the Summer Slump officially took hold and we saw our numbers
			    drop. Still, we were able to get our first kill of the revamped Vishimtar
			    2.0. We also goofed around with the Depth of Darkhollow pre-release fun
			    by killing Ithiasor, though by then they had depopped the quest-giving
			    npc so we never did find out what the quest gave hehe.</p>
			  <p>The Summer Slump drug on, Depths of Darkhollow was released, followed
			    by the frenzied exploration that entailed. We also saw member losses due
			    to EverQuest II and that other game (WoW, can't seem to think of the name
			    at the moment) so things were pretty slow for several months.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><img src="images/122905/TalisVule.jpg" width="350" height="184" style="margin: 10px" align="left"></p>
			  <p>By the end of October and heading into November the quest and flag progression
			    reached critical mass and we saw our first (major) kills of the new expansion:
			    Master Vule the Silent Tear and Sendaii, the Hive Queen. By then of course
			    we had knocked off the rest of the progression mobs: Emperor Draygun,
			    Matriarch Shyra, Bloodeye, and the Council of the Nine.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both">The late summer / early fall months were a tragic time for the US, and
			    with members of our family spread all over the world, invariably
			    some were in harm's way. Thankfully, even though we had a few members
			    in the hurricane-devastated areas of Mississippi, Louisiana,
			    and Texas, they and their families made it out safely. Hurricanes
			    and natural disasters aren't the only bad things in the world
			    however. Lozack lost his battle with cancer and passed away late
			    in November (This deserves more than a simple note for the year,
			    so more on this below).</p>
			  <p>At this point in the year, the Summer Slump gave way to the Thanksgiving
			    holiday and then on to the Christmas/Hanukkah holidays and even onward
			    to the new year. We've been in the Demi Plane for a long time now and
			    still have not progressed past Zi-Thuuli. Our numbers are still very low
			    for reasons that we can't pinpoint so as you can imagine, we will be pushing
			    hard for recruiting as the new year approaches. Even so, with just a few
			    days to go in the calendar year, we still generated over 70 pages of points
			    records. So we've been busy - and we plan on staying that way!<br>

			  <p><font size="+1">Lozack:</font></p>
			  <p>As I briefly noted already, on November 21, 2005 one of our members passed
			    away from Leukemia. Lozack was one of our Cleric Crew and showed a dedication
			    that frankly, many of us lack. He'd be making no sense in chat and when
			    asked, Oh he was hopped up on drugs after receiving some medical procedure.
			    Or on occasion he would go on-and-off afk and when asked, well he is in
			    the hospital and using a laptop so sometimes he had to put it down with
			    little notice. The guy would play in almost any spare moment he had, when,
			    I would venture to say, not many (if any) of us would.</p>
			  <p>Those are just a couple of observations I personally made. I won't lie
			    and claim to have known him as well as I should, but his dedication was
			    without question. To quote something his brother posted on our board, &quot;He
			    really loved 4 things in his life, his family, his cats, his ballteam
		      and his EQ.&quot; Lozack is greatly missed.</p>

			  <p>Missing: raid numbers. If anyone has any information regarding the whereabouts
			    of our raiding numbers please contact a raid leader so a team can be assembled
			    to recapture them. Please do not attempt to apprehend them yourself as
			    prolonged exposure to direct sunlight may have damaged their pasty complexions
			    and given them sun poisoning. They may be highly agitated and are prone
			    to fits of caffeine-induced frenzies.

			  <p><em>/ticker Talisman wowed the EQ markets this week with an impressive start
			    to the 4th quarter. Attendence, morale, and DPS were up, which
			    corresponded to many mobs being down. /ticker</em></p>
			  <p>It's been several (x a lot) weeks without an update, mainly due to us
			    *almost* doing something, or *just about* to make that Next Big
			    Kill. When I do my update, I like it to be seen, so I loathe
			    the thought of creating one only to have to replace it the next
			    week because we killed something new. So a couple weeks turned
			    into many weeks, which turned into well ... months. Depths of
			    Darkhollow came out also, so our focus became exploration
			    and progression. Welp, we knocked off a couple nice mobs that
			    I think are worth noting ... so here I am!</p>
			  <p><img src="images/110605/RogueVule.jpg" width="250" height="343" align="left" style="margin: 10px"></p>
			  <p>Our first major kill took place on November 1, when we killed Master
			    Vule the Silent Tear in Dreadspire. His loot was pathetic, but we spent
			    a lot of time learning the fight so that we could finally beat him. Was
			    the first kill since Vish maybe that really felt like we earned it. It's
			    ok to go into a zone and walk all over everything, but it is more fulfilling
			    when you get beat up a few times before you win. That's when you feel
			    good!</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/110605/Sendaii.jpg" width="300" height="201"></p>
			  <p style="clear:both">Fresh off our Vule kill on Nov 1, we returned the very next night and
			    finally beat Sendaii, the Hive Queen! Now THAT is a fun fight!
			    Long, can be monotonous, can be lost even AFTER the Queen is
			    dead (grrrr), but winning that fight feels great! Another win
			    that you have to earn. :)</p>
			  <p>The Queen win capped off the Curse progression raids and is by far the
			    hardest of the fights. The other 4 vary from 'cake' to 'mildy-difficult'
			    but are mostly fun hehe. The other fights in the progression are Shyra,
			    Bloodeye, Emperor Draygun, and the Council of Nine.</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/110605/Bloodeye.jpg" width="250" height="428" style="margin: 10px">
			  <img src="images/110605/EmperorDraygun.jpg" width="250" height="347" style="margin: 10px"></p>
			  <p>Oh yeah, I mentioned Dreadspire? It looks like a  roomier Castle Mistmoore
			    inside. REALLY neat zone!</p>

			  <p>Speaking of the new expansion, I have to admit that I am not at all surprised
			    at its core. Story goes something like Lanys and Firona have
			    a big spat in Nektulos Forest. After an epic catfight, a rift
			    is opened up exposing a new zone. Upon exploring the dank dark
			    spaces under Nektulos, what does one find? GNOMES! I knew it!
			    Nek is evil because they have Gnomes in the basement! The taint
			    that darkened the souls of the Elves and mutated them into Dark
			    Elves is the presence of Gnomes. For the good of all the races
			    (save 1), the next expansion should be Everquest: The End of
			    Ak'Anon. Raids take place to rid Norrath of the Gnomish Plague.
			    Would be a best seller!</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/110605/NekHole.jpg" width="300" height="240"><img src="images/110605/GNOMES.jpg" width="400" height="173"></p>
			  <p><img src="images/110605/Shrooms.jpg" width="300" height="347" align="left" style="margin: 10px"></p>
			  <p>Some cool new things in the expansion though. The shard gargoyle for
			    the pre-order folks was kind of fun ... except I for one didn't
			    know how to drop shard form. I was horrified that I was going
			    to be stuck like that! The other thing that struck me about the
			    expansion is evidence of rampant drug use in the Sony art department.
			    Come on ... psychedelic killer shrooms? Otherwise some
			    neat-looking mobs though. As a Paladin, I do have to thank SOE
			    for adding a lot of undead to the zones. Opened up a whole new
			    feeling for us Pallies - feeling useful on raids! One gripe though...
			    whoever designed the new Nek forest should be severely reprimanded.
			    It's now more like the East Commonlands Ghetto instead of the
			    dark scary place that it used to be.
