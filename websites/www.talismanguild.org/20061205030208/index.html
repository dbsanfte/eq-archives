			  <p align="center"><img src="images/112606/AyonaeRoBanner.jpg" width="750" height="476" align="middle"/></p><p>Talisman capped an awesome run of event wins over the last few weeks by killing Ayonae Ro on November 21.  Of course our Paladin web-updater, whose name starts with 'K', but who isn't Klomp (and is taller and prettier than him anyway) dropped the ball this time.  And fell over it.  I ... I mean 'she,' didn't realize the significance of our Sullon kill and that it opened up Deathknell.  So ... guess I have a lot of news to catch you up on!</p>
			  <p><img src="images/112606/AyonaeRoWipe2.jpg" width="350" height="226" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>First is the Ayonae win, aka The Mad Choir.  We beat the precursor event the night before, and faced her for the first time.  Over half our raid window was already gone, but we poked and prodded her to see what she responded to.  Our &quot;test wipes&quot; are a testament to the fact that she objects to being poked and prodded.  After a couple more tests, we called it a night and returned the next day.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><img src="images/112606/AyonaeRoChest.jpg" width="200" height="156" style="margin: 10px" align="right"/>With a night to mull things over, we came back and were able to defeat her handily - so quickly in fact we had time to finish the night killing some other things.  In some respects, the win was almost a let-down.  No big fan-faire, nothing exciting.  The event just ends and we got an emote.  Woo.  But we did get a chance to get our hands on Ayonae's chest and her goodies!  Glori got a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39370">Bell Chime of Dissonance</a>, Mallatik a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39368">Diva's Mask of Eternal Beauty</a>, and Hump got a <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=39374">Symbol of Mezzoforte</a>.  Congrats to all!</p>
			  <p style="clear:both">As an aside to the kill, I want to hand it to Sony for a really beautiful area for the Mad Choir event and also for Ayonae Ro herself.  The church area is just visually stunning.  Stained glass all around, a massive organ (/pauses for effect), huge vaulted ceilings.  And the way the light comes through the stained glass to make patterns on the floor, wow!  Just superb!  And as for Ayonae?  One word - amazing.  If you are slacking during the fight under the guise of &quot;prepping for the update&quot; to take screenshots, you can really see the detail the artists put into her.  The feathered wings are like nothing I'd seen before in the game.  Click the thumbnails for bigger pictures to see what I mean.</p>

			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Deathknell:</font></p>
			  <p>To everyone out there who knows the progression cycle, obviously by beating Ayonae Ro, we've already beaten the previous events in Deathknell.  To people like me though, who just show up and do what we're told without regard to zone or event, I'll update you on our other Deathknell wins.</p>
			  <p>The first was the Tolling of Dissonance Bells, which we beat for the first time on November 6.  Mini-Ayonae has us play a strange game of Keep-Away which is not only easy, but boring.  After lulling us to sleep with monotony, she unleashes a bunch of big gargoyle types to beat the crap out of us hehe.  And that is where it gets interesting.  Upon beating it, the big bell falls to the bottom of the pit.  Talisman breaks another zone!</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/112606/BigBell2.jpg" width="300" height="240" style="margin: 5px"/><img src="images/112606/BrokenBell.jpg" width="300" height="240" style="margin: 5px"/></p>
			  <p>On November 14 we beat the next event, Vertigo for the first time.  It involves protecting the stately High-Elf NPC Jimmy_Stewart as he races to the top of the bell tower to save beautiful Wood-Elf NPC Kim_Novak.  Well actually it doesn't, but that would be pretty cool too.  In fact this event is one of the most logistically demanding of all the Deathknell events as our raid-planners discovered.  Multiple mini-events going on all at the same time, with different and specific requirements for each one.  Discovering the nuances of this one is why it took a bit between winning Dissonance and this one for the first time.</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/112606/BatKeeper2.jpg" width="250" height="207" style="margin: 5px"/><img src="images/112606/Skelly.jpg" width="250" height="224" style="margin: 5px"/></p>
			  <p>The third event was Unwelcome Guests, which we defeated for the first time on November 20.  This event is annoying to say the least.  You have to fight these three guys all decked out in their best armour while at the same time dealing with all kinds of crap that arrives to kill you.  Definitely a survival event and not one you can really control or get ahead of.</p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/112606/MelkisConfidant.jpg" width="250" height="244" style="margin: 5px"/><img src="images/112606/TPallConfidant.jpg" width="250" height="227" style="margin: 5px"/></p>
			  <p>The last event is The Mad Choir, which is where you face Ayonae Ro herself.  As described above, we beat the event for the first time on November 21.</p>
			  <p>Overall, the Deathknell events aren't the most difficult in and of themselves, but they require a lot of thought, planning, and hard work.  Everyone has to perform together and do precisely the right things.  For those working towards Deathknell for the first time, you can expect to be browbeaten by your raid leaders, goaded into performing better, and called incompetent to the point of putting members of your own guild on /ignore.  Good luck!</p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Sullon and Suchon:</font></p>
			  <p><img src="images/112606/DeadSullon.jpg" width="350" height="259" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>For whatever reason, we never seemed to take Sullon seriously (as a guild).  We put in a few attempts long before TSS came out and were soundly smacked.  People just wouldn't pay attention - or they just plain wouldn't show up.  Anytime it was even hinted that we'd go try Sullon again, we'd end up with light numbers, forcing us to do something else.  After TSS, armed with our higher levels and a new-found optimism, we once again worked toward Sullon.  I think it had to do in large part to the fact that it opened up Deathknell, but as I alluded to, I wasn't paying attention to that.  :)  After several tries over a few nights we finally prevailed by killing her for the first time on October 26.  Miraculously, subsequent kills had higher and higher turnouts hehe.</p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><a href="images/112606/Suchon.jpg"><img src="images/112606/tmb_Suchon.jpg" width="233" height="215" border="0" align="left" style="margin: 10px"/></a>Suchon took almost no time to beat as we spanked his demonic butt for the first time on October 29.  He seemed to like it though. (Click for bigger picture) </p>

			  <p><img src="images/101606/MM_Corpse1.jpg" width="300" height="138" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>Day-after-day of practice paid off on October 10, when in a strong late-night showing, we defeated Mayong Mistmoore.</p>
			  <p>We had been refining the strategy for days, getting farther and farther along to learn what new tricks he would throw at us.  We suffered through the release of a new expansion (and the required xp grind and exploration that followed), as well as many low turnouts along the way.  But in the end, we all came together and stuck it out.</p>
			  <p>The night before, we got him to the low 40's with only a single enchanter online.  All was going smoothly until one tiny mistake from which we couldn't recover.  But we knew the win was &quot;there;&quot;  We just needed the people.  And the next night we had them.</p>
			  <p>In only a couple of attempts of refinements we had him down under 25 and were uncovering his final surprises.  We reached the end of our raid window, but almost no one could tear themself away.  We were so close.  We could feel that the win was at hand.   So we hit him again.</p>
			  <p align="center" style="clear:both"><img src="images/101606/MM_HP.jpg" width="700" height="34" /></p>
			  <p>The fight went very smoothly.  50% ... 40% ... 30 ... cruising along easily ... 20 ... 19 ... When I saw him go under 20 and we were still firmly in control of the fight, I actually got a chill, &quot;We've got this!&quot;  15 ... 10 ... 5 ... 2 ... 2 ... 2 ... (Arrgh!) ... 0 ... WIN!!!!</p>
			  <p>A good hour after we normally are wrapping things up, Mayong Mistmoore was dead.  And I swear for about another 10 minutes he wouldn't shut up!  He spoke more after death than while he was alive.		      </p>
			  <p>Loot consisted of <a href="images/101606/Erilynne.jpg">Erilynne, the Master's Mistress</a> for Rafather; <a href="images/101606/Glimmerice.jpg">Glimmerice, Tserrina's Forgotten Ardor</a> for Druisilla; <a href="images/101606/Dometrius.jpg">Dometrius, the Master's Burden</a> for Mallatik; and Agarwoen picked up the Persuasive Glimmering Serpent &quot;bonus&quot; loot.</p>

			  <p>TSS hit the shelves and fattened all our EQ directories.  Once out, we put things on hold for about a week and a half in order to grind xp and explore.  I have to say, there are now certain areas of the game that I hope to never see again /cough 69.1 instance!!</p>
			  <p>The new expansion looks nice.  The new spells and ranks are interesting and add a new dynamic.  We are currently poking around the new events and progressions.  TSS was really 2nd on our priority list after Mistmoore ... but I think we're going to be spending more time there now that we've updated our 'Kill Bill' list.</p>
			  <p>We've knocked off some minor things, mostly progression and little quests, but nothing too exciting yet as to warrant a big write-up.</p>

			  <p>There are some GREAT flavor events in this expansion though.  I can't write about TSS without mentioning what a riot it is to &quot;Save Timmi from the Well.&quot;  When that event was first discovered, a lot of us - myself included - made a point of doing that one.  The reward is ok - just a toy.  But just the pure joy of the &quot;joke&quot; of the event is worth doing it!  But watch out for the soft fluffy bunnies! <img src="images/101606/em_SharpPointy.jpg" width="306" height="20" /></p>

			  <p>I write this huddled behind the bank desk in the Guild Hall.  Angry guildmates are all around.  They eye me warily, some pass with a slight smile that is not reflected in their eyes. Others are more open in their disdain.  &quot;When are we getting an update?&quot; they snipe at me.</p>
			  <p>&quot;I'm working on it,&quot; I lie.  Truth is I've just been out of it lately, barely managing the energy to log on at all.  And in fact I gave in last weekend and *didn't* log on.  So I've had nothing left to spend on what passes for creativity to work on an update.  But they can't hear that.  &quot;It's coming, I swear.&quot;</p>
			  <p>We beat The Performer event last week for the first time.  Let me restate that in case your eyes are glazing over reading this editorial:</p>
			  <p><font size="+1">We beat The Performer!</font></p>
			  <p align="center"><img src="images/090406/PerformerWin_Banner.jpg" alt="Performer Win Banner" width="700" height="264" /></p>
			  <p style="clear:both"><img src="images/090406/Performer6Alive.jpg" alt="6 Alive" width="388" height="664" style="margin: 10px" align="left"/>Our first win on this event came on August 21, after a LOT of practice.  We had upwards of 35-40 people still alive at the end of the time.  It was a truly stunning win all the way around.  All the practice paid off, and we tore it up like we'd been farming it for weeks.</p>
			  <p>As fun as the first win was though ... I actually think the win a couple nights ago on the 29th was even MORE fun.  Why?  Because it was a nail-biter.  Full raid, and we won with only 6 people alive at the end!!!  Thank god we had a necro afk... err FD in there to rez a cleric lol.  Truth be told, the raid was going down-hill - the mobs were just picking us off at the end.  It was over.  But the tables got turned and it was the MOBS who ran out of time.  They didn't get us all killed  in time lol.  We Win!  (again).  :D</p>
			  <p>And from now on, I don't care how good we are doing on an event, I'll never &quot;predict&quot; again like I did in the last update.  I predicted we were only a few days, a week tops from beating him. And that was JUNE!  For unknown reasons we hit a HUGE slump with people not logging on.  We actually had a few raid nights that turned into &quot;Go farm some xp and AAs for the new expansion&quot; since we didn't have enough people to do anything.  So no more.  I don't care if I do an update where we missed a new kill because someone tripped on a spent mod rod and cost us the win.  I won't predict!!!</p>

			  <p style="clear:both"><font size="+1">Snowtail:</font></p>
			  <p>Another of our First-Kills since last update was that big American Eskimo, Snowtail! Unfortunately, I wasn't there for it but they tell me it was exciting. /Gump So that's all I've got to say about that. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  <p><font size="+1">Mayong Mistmoore:</font></p>

			  <p><img src="images/090406/Mistmoore_1.jpg" alt="Mayong Mistmoore" width="350" height="531" style="margin: 10px" align="right"/>We've now got our sights set on the elusive Mayong Mistmoore.  He spends his days practicing sword twirling and shouting ominous warnings at us through-out the zone.  So we go to his room and beat on his minions, and taunt him by yelling &quot;Hey, play Misty for me, muhahahaha.&quot;  He just stands there, throwing his sword in the air, looking all spiffy in his cool armour, and pays us no heed.  Until we piss him off enough.  Then you get to hear some KICK-ASS music even if you have your music turned off.  I have to hand it to SOE for this one, hearing that music when Mistmoore goes active is truly a &quot;Holy Crap!&quot; moment.</p>
			  <p>We're still refining the event, but we've turned him on a few times .... umm I mean, we've &quot;gotten him active,&quot; and last night's attempts went VERY well.  BUT I MAKE NO PREDICTIONS!!!</p>
