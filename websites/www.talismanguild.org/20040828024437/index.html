<p>Well, my lazy ass is finally getting around to doing a long overdue update.  Back on August 18th we finally got our first kill of Pixtt Xxeric Kex (or more commonly known as "Goat Bitch"), which yet again proved to be an incredibly difficult encounter to overcome.  After weeks of throwing ourselves at the slaughter, we finally pulled it off.  Since then we've killed her again as well as another couple slayings of Zun'Muram Tkarish Zyk.  Next on our hit list is Pixtt Riel Tavas.  We are making decent progress on her and hope to have her (or is it a him?) dead within another week.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/riel.jpg"></p>
<p>In other less exciting news, we've killed the Cragbeast Queen a couple more times and also took down Suled Dar's Shade a couple times to complete our *NEW* Veeshan's Peak keys.  Of course, we haven't stepped foot in the new Veeshan's Peak yet, but... hey... we got our keys!  Hooray for us!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/cb_corpse.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/082604/veeshan_drag.jpg"></p>

<p>Other than that, not much worthy of reporting.  These days we usually find ourselves doing CR in Tacvi with periodic reflagging/farming in earlier zones.  We're pleased to have survived our 5th straight EQ summer slump grinding through what has been the most difficult expansion we've experienced.  We have our fingers crossed that the upcoming Omens of War expansion will prove to be a much smoother release throughout ALL of the content.</p>

<font color="#009933">Detheb:<br>
No freakin clue how Galadir got in. I didn't even know he applied till he was in the guild. We make mistakes too. And you might die more than rangers because you have CDS, or better known as Chronic death syndrom. There is no cure for it, and of course, it's fatal.</font>

Do you think Qhue has more gayness and homosexual loving in his pinky then you do in your whole body?
What do dingleberries taste like?
If a dick could not get hard anymore off of cocaineeee...what would u ax it?
and finally
If i stick a rod up my own ass and enjoy it, and then try to squeeze a bottle into it, and enjoy that too, should I let Qhue be my butt pirate anal assassin commander?</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Ragnrok:<br>
Qhue's gayness is like a foundation for homosexuality. Kind of like a 2x4 is in construction.
Dingleberries taste kinda like candy cereal stuff, they're good in milk and are a part of a healthy balanced breakfast.. or was that crunchberries...
Umm.. how's the weather?
Ragnrok, I really think you just need to come out of the closet and save yourself and everyone else some time.</font>

How are we supposed to focus on reading your main page with all the sexA pics of Beldon posted on there?</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Juleea:
The best way is NOT to focus. Like one of those picture thingies where you let your eyes focus on something else and the image comes out. It never works for me either, so I just downloaded the Beldonblocker 2.0, works wonders.</font>

I agree. I can't get enough of that sparkling fresh Grunties knowledge! And as far as Beldon is concerned, along with the BeldonBlocker, there are many other programs. Beldonwatch 1.2, Norton's Anti-Beldon, and my personal favorite, BeldonCastrator 2.1.</font>

2) If nothing is impossible, is it possible that some things are impossible? <br>
3) If anything is possible, is it impossible that some things are possible?<br>
4) Is it possible that anything (and nothing) is BOTH inherently possible and impossible?</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Donkey:<br>
1) The hole actually turns into another donut! Then you can eat that one too!!<br>

O Mighty and Powerful Grunties, I beseech you! Please, please, PLEASE answer these three questions for me!<br>
1) What is an "elitist bastard"? I've been told that I am an elitist bastard, but I have no idea what one is or how I became one! Is it something I would have signed up for, like the Grub of the Month Club or Archers Anonymous?<br>
2) I've been told that elitist bastards like to "wave their dicks around". Umm, well, I'm a chick. Where can I get a dick to wave around? How much would it cost?<br>
3) Why hasn't Talisman washed Eonowyn yet? He's really beginning to smell rancid and those gnomish gas-masks that you all wear don't have enough AC for those bruising Gates of Discord encounters! Not to mention that we can smell Eonowyn all the way over here on Povar...</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Kophry:<br>
1) Well, you may not remember becoming one. With many religions they do this proceedure at birth, so it's less tramatic than other stages in life.<br>
2) They actually meant picks, wave your picks around. So go kill an orc, get his picks and wave them in the air like you just don't care.<br>
3) Eonowyn purposely greases himself so he's tougher to grab a hold of to try to wash. It's like a weekly event we like to call "Greased retard roundup", we haven't won yet </font>

Dear Grunties,<br>
As I ponder upon the meaning of life, I have stumbled across this revealation. Life, in it's infinite trickeries, is about coming to terms with oneself. So I want to ask you a few questions;<br>
1.) Are you my daddy?<br>
2.) Were you ever a GI Joe? Which one? If you were that would be cool as Pepsi One, with 2/3 less calories.<br>
3.) When is it okay to pass gas in front of your significant other? Do you go first or go last?<br>
4.) So you were a GI Joe commando...did you have to undergo surgery to get the Kung-Fu grip?<br>
5.) What was Cobra commander's real name? Why did he wear that mask? Was it to hide a horribly disfigured and/or scarred face?<br>
6.) Did Leatherneck know the Marines Hymn?<br>
7.) There was a Duke and Butch but was there a Hoss? A General Lee???<br>
8.) Why do you deny your GI Joe heritage????</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Sirulus Delon:<br>
1) No, you are your own father. Try to figure that one out!<br>
2) I was Destro<br>
3) As long as the first time you do it you make it a "Dutch Oven" you're ok.<br>
4) I was born with a Kung-Fu grip, even on my feet.<br>
5) Chuck was his real name, he wore the mask to keep mosquitos away.<br>
6) Leatherneck could belch the Mariens Hymm.<br>
7) They nicknamed Lady Jane "General Lee" because they all rode her.. ZING!!<br>
8) I used to deny it only because I never got to ride the General Lee </font>

It tastes better if you change the 2 parts Fresca into two parts Gin.

We have to grow to understand people that are different from us Beldon, we must embrace each other in our differences. Southern is not a bad person because of his hyperactive Drama Queen gland, but actually, you are.</font>

Dear Gruntasaurus,<br>
Do your balls hang low? Do they wobble to and fro? Can you tie them i a knot or can u tie them in a bow?
On these hot summer days is it possible to recycle my pee into water just as Kevin Costner did in Water World? because so far it just tastes salty.

No, but I can throw them over my shoulder like a continental soldier.
To recycle your pee you need a filter. Try using your T-shirt, then drink your own pee. That should help</font>

I could easily go on about "pinching a loaf", "dropping the kids off at the pool" and "making offerings at the porcelain altar", but I think the fact that you have named your own excrement "soldiers" may do the job better than I can.</font>

Crunties,<br>
What is the most efficient method for CR after a raid wipes out?</font>
<br>
<font color="#009933">Kielle:<br>
First is to die. That's easy enough. Once you die take an afk, preferably at least 5 minutes. Then come back and complain that CR is taking too long. Then consent the rogues, but make sure to misspell all of their names. Once rez'd if you're a cleric, make sure you MGB Virtue to piss everyone off, if you're a ranger MGB SoT. After being rez'd, don't loot anything, find a mob, and train the CR spot. This is very important not to die before you get to the group, then blame someoene else. Once back to bind, go afk for another 5 minutes, come back and complain the CR is taking too long. Send as many tells to raid officers as you can with strat ideas, but make sure they make no sense and are in some over formal form of technical speak. Bitch a lot about how Sony sucks in guild chat. Then get a rez, and go afk until next wipe.</font>

<p>On July 12th, Talisman defeated Zun'Muram, the final encounter in Txevu standing in our way to Tacvi,the end zone of Gates of Discord.  After a few weeks of trying just about every possible angle to make even a hint of progress on the encounter, it all came together tonight.  Zun'Muram was certainly among the most challenging encounters we've ever faced.  The biggest challenge was just maintaining our sanity as we threw ourselves at this slaughter night after night, but as always, we never gave up and came thru in the end.</p>

<p>On June 29th, we finally took a step closer to Tacvi with our victory over High Priest Nkosi Bakari in Txevu.  This marks one of our most difficult obstacles to date on our GoD progression path as we have been grinding away at this event for the past couple weeks.  After quite a variety of strategies, everything came together tonight with an incredible amount of teamwork.  The real reason we were finally able to win is all because of Southern.  He botted a cleric and a wizard and...well....yeah...that won it, or at least that's what he told me to say, and he's always right....right?  Seriously though, it was a very satisfying victory for us and we look forward to moving closer to the end zone of GoD, Tacvi in the days ahead.  Of course with GoD comes the never ending task of reflagging.  We had to take a break from progression last week in order to get several members and applicants caught up on their flags so we pulled off victories in Uqua and Inktu'Ta.  The Inktu'Ta win probably marks one of our longest single encounters in recent history.  I believe the fight with Noqufiel at the end was clocked at about one and a half hours.  Once completed, we had another handful or two of warm bodies to throw at Txevu.</p>

<p>In this day and age in Everquest, it's often difficult to dig up quality applicants to maintain a steady flow of fresh blood into the guild.  Talisman, being innovative as always, has come up with alternative approaches to recruitment by advertising at gas stations in the backwoods of places such as Louisiana.  Yes, this picture is real, and yes, we really are recruiting clerics.  Next time you pull over to fill up with gas or pick up a Slim Jim and a Slurpy, ask yourself....Do I have what it takes to be in Talisman?  There's only one way to find out!  Apply!  Talisman is currently recruiting quality players with great attitudes serverwide of all classes.  If you're interested in raiding bleeding edge content, have high play time, and can follow directions, be sure to check out our Membership Information section in our Public Forums and see if you meet our requirements and learn a little about our application process.</p>

  And don't forget the dancing fruit... Then there's the times when Talisman has 
  raced Vae and DC, doing our best to train each other and KS... And there's Bobertson 
  using gravity flux on GMs and getting banned... Then us waking the sleeper to 
  prevent other guilds from getting loot... And I doubt we can even count how
