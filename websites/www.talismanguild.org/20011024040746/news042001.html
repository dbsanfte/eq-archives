	   We started off with a quick raid on the Dain... was just the 350 one. You know, the feel good dain. Cant believe this caksucker was

	   That's not what makes us uber. No, what makes us uber was the rotting primal.  We made a great attempt on the Progenitor tonight
	   and handily owned the bastard. I was going to post some amusing stories of how we accomplished this but we are just too uber for that. 
	   We are so uber we didnt even bother trying to loot the primal warsword we knew he had (thx thx 1h slash and mad avatar procing). We where
	   also to uber to plead to the GM to come help us loot it, and definatly to uber to feel snubbed by him telling us he would never help.
	   Never mind that our uber asses laid him down flat on even ground where he fucking spawns.

	    So you finally get to sleepers with enough people and you start picking up the primal weapons from the Master of the Guard. Who do you equip first? 
	    The rangers of course! Its HOURS of entertainment, reminds me of the experiments with rats and the "pleasure" button vs the "food" button. 
	    Ended up wih a lot of starved rats. Same princaple here, Wine and Kaus are with cheerful alacrity getting themselves owned with their 
	    primal war swords. Even more humerous is when they realize they are about to die and start trying to jolt, 
	    like the damage they just did with their 1500+ attk is gonna get fixed up with 2 jolts. Priceless was good to, hell they even let me have a warsword. 
		Also did Cazic yet again today, Gratz Dok and Terryn on Halos, Popeil a robe, and Kaustran on a choker. Klandicar popped so we had to go off him with

	Cause every fucking dragon there is dead. For the first time on Tunare Nexona, Druushk, and Phara Dar where all given one way tickets to the Necropolis. 
	Which coincidently is missing Zlandicar too since we finished up with vp early. Lots of items, most
    begrudgingly looted. Well, the two <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/bostaffofstrorsmang.html"> monk
    staffs</a> (Sarabi, Ashana) 
	and <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeofadversity.html"> necro	robe</a> (Blaisse) off Nexona where eagerly
    received. Also Bobertson's new <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/robeoftheazuresky.html"> Azure robe</a> off
    Phara, Gneagle's <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crownofrile.html"> Crown of
    Rile</a>, and Kaitlynn's new Katana found nice homes. Hoshkar, Silverwing,
    and Xygoz also bit it, but dropped nothing worth remembering. Also knocked
    out Talendor... more crap. 8 dragons all in all, was a busy weekend.&nbsp;

	We had one shaman capable of casting focus the entire weekend too, Barber. That's a lot of buffing, had to promise to buy him a
    hooker in vegas to keep him going. 
 	Zlanidcar dropped more worthless paly swords, a cracked claw, a Frakadar Talisman for Caon, Zlandicar Talisman for Wine, and guild vaulted a heart. 
 	Did I mention we cleared vp too?
