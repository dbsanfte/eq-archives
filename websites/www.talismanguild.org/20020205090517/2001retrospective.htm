						55+ players joined forces to kill the Kunark dragons. The larger guilds on the server had worked together to create
						the first cleric epic, rogue epic, and simultaneous first paladin and enchanter epics serverwide. January, however,
						heralded a new era for Tunare: guild autonomy.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Talisman underwent some changes. We decided to become a raiding guild and recruited
						some new folks like Southern, Malloci, and Falkahlan. We went through some lengthy debates about how loot was going
						to be done, and decided on a points system.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The other heavy topic was faction. The guild tried to weigh all of the advantages
						and disadvantages of Coldain, giant, and Claws of Veeshan factions, and in the end chose giant faction. Things
						can't be simple for Talisman, we had to pick the faction that had three sub factions (Kromzek, Kromrif, and Tormax)
						to worry about.</FONT></P>

						out of the woodwork to help each other. The guild was energized.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In October, the world changed. Dark Age of Camelot beta had been slowly stealing

						<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oneliners/s_aon.jpg" WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="194" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">October also brought the Melee Patch to Everquest. Verant had analyzed the inequities
						in melee classes and delivered the long awaited class balancing. Rangers, monks, SKs, and paladins rejoiced. Warriors
						and rogues grumbled. 2h weapons stopped getting destroyed. Approval of Verant was at an all time high.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">We had always heard stories from friends on servers like Ayonae Ro about the horrible
						competition between large guilds and how it would get so nasty that guilds would leap frog past each other to get
						to ToV north dragons first. With only two guilds vying for Tunare's uber mobs, we felt lucky.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Well, with an ever-growing server population, that can only last so long. The uber
						mobs are now shared between 5 or 6 guilds, three of which would be hunting in ToV north. It was inevitable that
						the 55+ population would swell, and the likeliest answer for the worsening ratio of uber mobs to guilds capable
						of killing uber mobs seemed to be the upcoming Luclin expansion. The only problem with that was the early rumors
						which indicated there was little to no high end uber mobs in the expansion.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">It seemed that Velious had been the playground for uber guilds, and Verant wasn't
						going to be catering to them with this expansion.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">November was another month full of farming the same old same old. A lot of people
						were feeling the strain of the constant farming of mobs and the lack of new challenges in the game. Talisman killed
						Ventani and released Kerafyrm, but afterwards the dreariness of more mob farming seemed even more oppressive. It
						seemed like Luclin would never arrive.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The serverwide Test of Tactics came the weekend before Luclin. This time Talisman
						only made it to the top 8, but then again, the best thing about ToT is not the competition.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Then, it came. The Luclin expansion. For many, it was about 4 months too late. Everquest
						didn't receive just a few more new zones. The changes were massive, not only in the game but also in the bare minimum
						pc requirements. Unless you already had top notch hardware, you had to shell out some money for RAM and a new video
						card. You had to have the right operating system. And even if you had all those things, you still experienced tremendous
						lag.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">The new models were interesting, and hard to get used to. Suddenly, everyone looked
						different. After looking exactly the same for a few years, it was fun to be able to change your look at will. That
						is, if your pc would let you even turn on the new models. And, like DAoC, the women now sit in this sort of awkward-that-they-think-looks-graceful
						sideways leaning position. It looks STUPID. It makes me want to turn off the new models, except that would mean
						I can't see my horse, and that is an unacceptable solution. I'm sure all the guys out there have similar beefs
						with Verant, because after all, things like how you sit are among the most important things about this new expansion.</FONT></P>
						<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oneliners/s_dora.jpg" WIDTH="169" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">This expansion didn't bring another 10 levels like Kunark did. Instead, it brought
						alternative exp points, with new abilities that made everyone drool. The complaints about the stunning lack of
						high end uber mobs in Luclin were forgotten in the feverish pursuit of AA exp. Many found the joy of AE grouping
						in the Grey, just to have it nerfed a week later by Verant, along with a nerf that made it harder to get AA exp.
						In the end, though, I'm not sure it is the new abilities that drive people to do 12 hour exp grinds, or if it's
						all about the new titles. Vanity is a funny thing.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Verant patched and patched, and it was obvious that they had not understood just
						how quickly and efficiently high end groups could kill. But in their efforts to make it more difficult for the
						5% of the server population to rip through their AA exp, they've forgotten the 20% of the server that has sufficient
						levels but sub optimal gear. I think they are stepping over that fine line where AA exp becomes so much of a torture
						that people would rather quit than face it.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">In traditional MMORPG fashion, Luclin was released with lots of bugs and before
						some zones had been itemized. After the multitude of patches (&quot;we'll keep patching every night until we fix
						the problems!&quot;), Luclin seems to have stabilized. Verant turned it's eye on the Temple of Veeshan.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Inexplicably, the PoM entrance castle shrank to a barely visible rooftop in the
						revamped Temple of Veeshan. I don't know what this had to do with the proposed 'safe spot' clearing, but then I
						think logically and you can't apply logic to Everquest.</FONT></P>
						<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="images/oneliners/s_castle.jpg" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="75" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">I'm actually rather glad to see the ToV north safe spot go away. Every guild approaches
						ToV clearing a different way, whether they start in the safe spot and Vulak pull all the dragons there, do a dungeon
						crawl, or some combination thereof. I'm sure that someone has already found a way to avoid the dungeon crawl, coth
						the entire raid in, and stare at the same walls for a few hours of dragon slaying. Enjoying a leisurely dungeon
						crawl is a luxury these days, one that guilds can hardly afford with the competition for spawns. I say this because
						I have never seen competition as a lessening of what uber phat lewt we get. To me, competition just means that
						everything fun to do is already done.</FONT></P>
						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Luclin also brought the welcomest present of all for the die hard Talisman EQ'ers
						- the return of many of those who had departed for Camelot. The small group of Talisman who still play Camelot
						somehow managed to hold the second place in amassed Realm Points slot by having a ton of realm points (gained each
						time you kill a member of the enemy realm). I watch as a group of 8 Talisman take on a raiding party of 20 and
						kill them all with no casualties, and it's easy to see why they haven't come back.</FONT></P>

						<P><FONT SIZE="2" FACE="Arial">Even the most hardened cynic can see that Verant has indeed tried to correct the
						problems in the game. It is in sharp contrast to Mythic's stunning lack of interest in fixing the problems that
						plague Camelot, especially in class and realm balancing. Verant still needs to address caster issues, but the pursuit
						of new AA abilities has casters preoccupied for the time being. However, there is one big problem looming on the
						horizon still. The burgeoning level 60 populations on all servers and the lack of high end raiding in Luclin is
						going to create a lot of animosity in Everquest. And a lot of boredom. The AA exp diversion can only last so long.</FONT>
