			<p>Before and after other raids for the last few weeks, we have been making
			  our way into  Anguish with the full expectation of getting our
			  heads handed to us by Keldovan the Harrier in the hopes of gleaning
			  some information from the encounter. For a long time, very little
			  we did seemed to make a difference. In the last couple of days however,
			  tiny rays of hope began to shine through the gloomy clouds of despair. Wednesday
			  night, things finally came together in one climatic moment when we knocked
			  off Keldovan in Anguish!</p>
			<p>We can really be proud of ourselves.  Talisman has long been known as a
			  guild that could  accomplish tasks faster than a lot of guilds
			  who have far more members. Our numbers have been relatively low
			  of late due in a large part to the glut of really good games that
			  are out, and some of our raids have suffered for it. The win over
			  Keldovan really showed what skilled and dedicated players can accomplish
			  once we set our minds to it - and stop whining over low turn-out.
			  With the exception of the first day or two after gaining entry,
			  not a single instance in Anguish has been filled to capacity. And
			  yet still we were able to win this encounter (and others) and look
			  ahead for more.</p>

			<p>Not a lot of Big News (tm), but in recent weeks Talisman
              has been working towards Anguish. No, no, not anguish over the
              upcoming releases of EverQuest 2, World of Warcraft, or even Halo
              2 and what those releases might do to our raiding numbers. No we
              have been actively working towards the zone of Anguish.</p>
			<p>	This has required a multi-pronged (not pr0ned) approach in that
              we have to keep 70-ish people motivated enough to break into groups
              to work on a signet quest, and then also raid together enough to
              beat several raid-level trials for access.</p>
			<p>Well, after repeatedly beating the trials for Adaption (not Adaptation
              curiously enough), Corruption, Endurance, Foresite, and Specialization,
              we did finally beat the trial for Hate. Hate took us longer than
              most because we were actively trying to find a way to beat it *without*
              gimping it. We tried it over and over and got down to the final
              mob &quot;the good way,&quot; only to find out from 'sources' that
              we are SUPPOSED to gimp the trial. Wow... what a design. Woo.</p>

            <p>Anyway, we have decided for the moment to hold off on Anguish

              So tune in soon for our adventures in Anguish!</p>
            <p>Mixed in among all those trials, we of course continue to beat
              down the Riftseeker's Rabble whenever we see them up. We also make
              a point of setting aside time each week to knock out the raid-ish

            <p>Well the holiday season is fast approaching and with it comes
              the impending release of EverQuest 2. I won't comment on the state
              of the game but as a good-will gesture, let me offer SOE something
              to make their marketing and financial people very happy - perhaps
              distracting them from pushing EQ2 out the door until it's finished...
              /cough</p>
            <p>What is it that every little kid likes? What is it that computer
              geeks and geekettes secretly adore? And further, and perhaps most
              importantly to The Suits, what is it in the Anime/Manga world that
              is all the rage?</p>
            <p>Why, <strong>Plush Toys</strong> of course!</p>
            <p>SOE has wholly overlooked this segment of the market. They've
              tried action figures of about 6 types. They've tried cell-phone
              EQ (WTF???), and they've done the back-pack. They even custom-made
              an EQ fanny pack for Beldon, but we're not sure what he paid them
              with, nor do we really wish to know.</p>
            <p>But what they really need are EQ plush toys.</p>
            <p>Imagine the possibilities. You could have whole collections of
              them. EQ Plush Toys fall into several easily-markettable categories
              or sets. The first could be:</p>

            <p>And finally, to cap it off, SOE introduces the special offers.
              Some would be limited editions. Some would be promotional. And
              some would require outright bribes. SOE is well-known for the ultra-rare
              items, so they obviously can't have every one be able to just *buy*
              their whole Plush Line! Pfffft, silly people.</p>

			  </td></tr></table>
            <p>To celebrate where it all began, a special edition plush toy would
              be the Talking Fippy Darkpaw! Squeeze his fuzzy belly and he utters
              his famous battle cry, <em>&quot;&lt;BBBBBAAAARRRKKKK!!!!!&gt; You
              humans will pay for ruining your homeland!! GRRRRRRRR!!!! Family
              Darkpaw of the Sabretooth Clan will slay you all!!&lt;BARK!&gt;&quot;</em></p>
            <p>Release the Sleeper on your unsuspecting Lego hoardes with the
              Plush Zerafym. If you never got to experience the thrill of releasing
              the virtual version, you now can with your very own hugable version
              of the most rare of the dragons.</p>
            <p>For those who never made it to the end of the Plane of Time, now
              you can have your own four-headed dragon. And for those that did
              - you know you want one too!</p>
            <p>To reclaim some fun and satisfaction from an otherwise lousy expansion,
              SOE can offer the GoD &quot;Goat&quot; plush toy. Now really, how
              cute would your own plush goat be!?!?! Pliable (and safe!) little
              spines to hold the colorful pennants. The happy little smile each
              of the Pixxts have as they crush your raid. Fun!</p>
            <p>(I would submit that they should give a free Plush Goat to every
              registered GoD buyer as compensation for the expansion, but I digress...)</p>
            <p>And finally, to celebrate the (pushed back) release of EQ2, get
              your own little EQ2 Baby Dragon! The adorability factor is almost
              unbearable!</p>
            <p>Buy them for your kids, buy them for your friends (you know you
              don't have many, so it will be cheap), and above all else - buy
              them for yourself!</p>
            <p>Once you have enough, you can conduct your own raids. Just listen
              to this testimonial:</p>
