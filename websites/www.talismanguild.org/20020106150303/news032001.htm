	We axed CT once again on Tuesday, and this time actually got some caster loot. Bobertson made off with some
    <a href="images/items/cazicbrains.jpg"> brains</a> (nobody was going to deny him this based on need), 
	Ainthe a nice robe,	Quen a <a href="images/items/halooftheenlightened.jpg">halo </a>and Docvahn the
    <a href="images/items/pauldronsofferocity.jpg">pauldrons</a>. I completely forgot what the draco dropped and I think we offed trakanon once or
    twice too.  Tonight though we
	did the 425 Dain and actually lost the first time. Boggled by the loss we rebuffed and pulled him again and
    completely owned
	the bastard with a grand total of 4 deaths. Well i don't know for sure if the muzzle of mardu
    hastens npc's like it does pets, but some asshole put it on him.

    <font size=-1 face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> Not much to say really. We spent a lot of time and effort dying to figure it out,
    and in the end it came together beautifully. Three deaths out of 38 people equals pure ownage of one of, if not the hardest, dragon in VP.

    <font size=-1 face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> Wielding the very nerf stick Verant used to beat the cleric's upside the head, Talisman took down
    the sorcerer Velketor again. Was by far and away our best fight, probably because the nerf stick reduced velk down to a lvl 1 gnome wiz. The 
    poor giant was chased around the castle for a good hour by Surox and Gorum, both of whom where seriously encumbered trying to lug around
    an unwieldy gas grill.

	Unfortunatly for us it seems the nerf stick effects the loot table too, because we got a bunch of crap. 
	Gratz Jienna, BerryOhSoFyne, and Ggak on yer velk trophies!
