<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak1.jpg"></p>
<p>In an attempt to do something a little different during our non-Time raiding nights, we decided to bring back some of the old school nostalgia and do some retro raiding.  Tired of elemental farming and lacking the motivation to trudge thru a 4 hour LDoN raid, we decided to pay a visit to our old friend Vulak.  The usual suspects encountered along the way proved nothing more than minor speed bumps.  After waiting 30 minutes for the Vulak ring to respawn after our over zealous ranger Grunties activated it out of lack of control of his excitement, the event began.  We quickly determined that the way to avoid a 4 hour LDoN raid is NOT to do the Vulak ring!!  That being said, in the end, I'm pleased to announce that yes, Vulak down to Talisman!!!
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_corpse.jpg"></p>
<p>The raid as you can imagine went fairly smooth.  Our biggest disappointment is that Divine Crusade, still, to this day, tries to sabotage and steal our leet tactics, often sending blatant spies. Plz, I mean wtf, can't they figure out how to kill Velious content on their own??</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_group.jpg"></p>
<p>Of course with any grand kill such as this, there comes phat lewts.  Let the farming begin...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/vulak_loot.jpg"></p>
<p>In a way the evening ended on a sad note.  On the eve of the announcement of our great warrior Ragnrok's retirement, having been tormented for years for never owning a Jaelen's Katana, our old friend Rags logged in to share his final words in Everquest...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/rags1.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/arative_pose.jpg"></p>
<p>In all seriousness though, we'll miss you Ragnrok.  Your contributions to the guild won't be forgotten.  I know I speak for everyone when I say it's been a true pleasure playin' with ya. For those who may not feel that way, well, here's a spoon.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/spoon.jpg"></p>
<br>
<p>Did one night of retro raiding satisfy our nostalgia?  Oh hell no!!  The next evening we had to decide between clearing Plane of Water or clearing Plane of Growth.  What would you pick?  Duh!!  No shit, We thought the same thing and chose Plane of Growth!  The following collage will let you experience what we experienced in Plane of Growth...some of it glorious, some of it...well...not so glorious.  After wiping out to a tree, we regained our composure and took down Tunare.  Listen up kids, PoG ain't a joke.  If Talisman can wipe out there, so can you!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/retro_pog.jpg"></p>
<p>Ahh yes, the holiday season is upon us, a time for family, fun, and of course, Christmas shopping.  Wanna avoid the crowds at the malls this year?  Stumped on what that elusive perfect gift for your loved one might be?  Well, fear not, here at Talisman we have the perfect gift for anyone, and you don't even need to get your ass outta your computer chair to get it!  That's right, it's the 2004 Women of Talisman Calender!  They're attractive, they're intelligent, oh FFS, they're down right SEXY!!  Calenders make good gifts.  Talisman Calenders make GREAT gifts!!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/calender.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a shot of the front cover...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/calender_group.jpg"></p>
<p>Anyway, here's a random shot of one of our monks trying to catch a skunk...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/skunk.jpg"></p>
<p>Before we kick off the Official Quote section, sometimes we like to acknowledge our fans.  Talisman wouldn't be where it is today without our fans, so I'd like to take this moment to share with you an interview our very own Thanatopsis had with Talisman's Greatest Fan.  The fan chose to use an anonymous name, but we're guessing it's either Kolevii, Lace, or Emodius...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/fan.jpg"></p>
<p>Wanna see how we stay entertained during a Vulak raid?  Correct answer would have been NO, but...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/111403/ogre_fun.jpg"></p>
<p>Well, that's about it for the meat of this update.  In other news we continue mowing thru Time during our rotation, but that's all boring news nowadays.  This is about the point I would have added in my Revenge on Hammie Section after the last update he did, but immediately following that update, he stopped all forms of communication in guildchat, tells, say, you name it.  Hell, he even got a job so he wouldn't have to be on as often for fear of exposing himself to my camera!!  Bastard!</p>

  <p align="center"><font size="6">The Beldon('s) Special </font></p>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So it occured to me, with Beldon pretty much dominating the update page, 
    as well as being the biggest retard in talisman, lots of his little adventures 
    slip through the cracks, or get conveniently left out, well his reign of oppression 
    and censorship may be over, at least for the next 5 minutes</p>
  <p>Although the thing is, as much as we all laugh at him daily, there is something 
    endearing about the guy, i've not yet figured out what it is, i'll try to 
    explain....and maybe come to a conclusion</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One thing i noticed about him is the ladies all seem to love him, take for 
    instance this particular cutie<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldonpink1.jpg" width="112" height="217"><br>
    Just a young lady with a somewhat bright set of armor on, minding her own 
    business while she waits for her adventure to start....<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon19.jpg" width="379" height="179"><br>
    So, not being the shy type, he strolls over casually with his ever trusty 
    book on a stick - Love Tips for the Repressed<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldonpink.jpg" width="111" height="154"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon20.jpg" width="129" height="11"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon200.jpg" width="154" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon21.jpg" width="251" height="60"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon22.jpg" width="220" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon24.jpg" width="266" height="122"><br>
    Getting desperate now.....<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon23.jpg" width="259" height="24"> 
    <br>
    At least the group were sympathetic and managed to pick up his spirits<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon25.jpg" width="301" height="73"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So he's a hit with the ladies, but a modern man has to be able to cook for 
    his woman too, this is an area where Beldon really shines with his culinary 
    skills<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon42.jpg" width="382" height="24"> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon43.jpg" width="336" height="11"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon44.jpg" width="343" height="11"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon45.jpg" width="365" height="35"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon46.jpg" width="286" height="24"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon47.jpg" width="206" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon48.jpg" width="360" height="13"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon49.jpg" width="287" height="59"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I feel it's my duty though to report on the bad as well as the good, and 
    lets get that out of the way sooner rather than later, like many celebrities, 
    he has a dark side, a twisted, exploitative side, the lady in question (who 
    will remain anonymous) was offered 27 raid points if she met his sick demands<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon78.jpg" width="238" height="17"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon79.jpg" width="269" height="21"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon80.jpg" width="232" height="19"><br>
    Things are under investigation however and we hope to be able to clear Beldon 
    of these &quot;Points for Pootang&quot; allegations soon</p>
  <p>But back to Everquest, he's also a highly respected <em><strong><font size="4">member</font></strong></em> 
    of the tunare community, and as raid officer for Talisman he has to keep a 
    good relationship with other guilds, here he shows us just a few of his diplomatic 
    skills<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon15.jpg" width="354" height="38"> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon16ish.jpg" width="287" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon16.jpg" width="206" height="53"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon18.jpg" width="168" height="13"><br>
    And even our friends over at Divine Crusade..<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon31.jpg" width="217" height="14"> 
    <br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon32.jpg" width="119" height="14"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon34.jpg" width="115" height="11"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But he has his helpful days, even though we have just wiped to a raid and 
    he's sat in PoT totally naked, he still offers to help Lace with a FREE translocate 
    to Ro<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon73.jpg" width="315" height="119"><img src="images/102303/beldon74.jpg" width="115" height="157"><br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon77.jpg" width="372" height="24"><br>
    Done...</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To run a raid, you have to be able to get to a raid, and there is nobody 
    with a better sense of direction than Beldon<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon12.jpg" width="179" height="13"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon13.jpg" width="230" height="35"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon14.jpg" width="220" height="14"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But he always looks after his close friends, often leading raids just to 
    better their equipment while they pretend they can stay away from the game<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon39.jpg" width="294" height="14"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon40.jpg" width="283" height="150"><br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon41.jpg" width="280" height="83"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But the guy doesnt stop at raids, he's the definition of hardcore, doing 
    LDoN adventure after adventure with his trusty sidekick Lapismoon, he recruits 
    only the best and expects only the best, then he repeatedly fucks them over<br>
  <img src="images/102303/beldon63.jpg" width="388" height="48"><br>

  <p>Attempt number 2<br>
    <img src="images/102303/beldon72.jpg" width="361" height="49"></p>
  <p>Speaking of Lapismoon and recruiting, he also makes damn sure even the guys 
    are satisfied <br>

  <p>He also has a solid understanding of his fellow guildmates and the role of 
    their class<br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon30.jpg" width="370" height="14"></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But to be honest, i'm still not satisfied that i know exactly why it is we 
    love Beldon, he has so many redeeming qualities, or was it retarded, so i 
    decided to get an outside opinion and interview Gaddilae of Divine Crusade<br>

    <img src="images/102303/beldon61.jpg" width="326" height="35"></p>
  <p>At this point there was no reply, something to hide? i dont know, maybe we 
    will never know, but Beldon, we love you anyway!</p>

<p>FINALLY!! After weeks of trying to come up with newsworthy material to post on our front page, Saturday night we decided to clear all 5 Tiers of Plane of Time AND Quarm in ONE NIGHT.  We did exactly that, marking the first time it's been done on Tunare.  Depending on time zone, not everyone agreed it was really done in one day, but Quarm died before sun up.  Still having yet to get a decent corpse shot, here's a shot of our kill from last week...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/quarm_corpse.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a rare good corpse shot of Innoruk on our way to Quarm last night...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/innycorpse.jpg"></p>
<p>Rather than post a bunch of boring corpse shots though, I think more people would be interested in *other* shots....you know....like this one...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/ragsqhue.jpg"></p>
<p>As you can see, this picture explains a lot on why Qhue must've pushed so hard to have Illusion Guktan added to the Enchanter spell books...I mean....look at the size of the tongue on that thing!!  The other important thing to point in this picture is the true love and affection that is shared intimately between Ragnrok and Qhue.  Don't believe me?  Early quote section inc then...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/rags1.jpg"></p>
<p>Nowadays when not in Plane of Time, we've of course been spending a LOT of time in LDoN both in single group adventures competing to see who wins the *I have no life* competition on the Leaderboards as well as some LDoN raids.  We've successfully won several raids (only guild on Tunare to do so to date from what I've been told), but have found most to be extremely challenging, if not completely ridiculous.  And the rewards are...well...not worth mentioning...  In case you haven't ventured into LDoN yet, here's a shot of some of what awaits you, including Quen's long lost twin.</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/ldonpics.jpg"></p>
<p>Actually, I guess I was wrong earlier when I said we rarely get good corpse shots.  I forgot I'm guilded with a bunch of perverted individuals, so was lucky enough to have one of them send me these gems illustrating that not all corpse shots suck.  I'm sure the women of Talisman will now be searching for equally perverted male-mob shots now...Look for crotch shots of Banford Paffa on the next update!</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/crotch_shot.jpg"></p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/delor_boobs.jpg"></p>
<p>Hey....ever seen a flying ogre?  I'm sure if you haven't been around Ragnrok and Qhue you may not have, but when Qhue is near and Rag's is feelin' frisky, well, you have yourself a naked flying ogre in heat! </p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/flyingogre.jpg"></p>
<p>Here's a cute shot of Southern and Heydin.  Coulda sworn this had been posted before, but it still holds some value...</p>
<p align ="center"><img src="images/101003/heydin_south.jpg"></p>
<p>I'm wrong again....here's another perfect corpse shot.  Nothing better at the end of a long fight than a dead NPC laying next to a dead Promethis.  This is always met by a large amount of applause.</p>
