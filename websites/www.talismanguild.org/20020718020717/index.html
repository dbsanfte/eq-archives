			<p>Patch day occasionally motivates me to do an update before i get ppl bitching at me for not doing one in over a week, lastnight we actually had a pretty decent post patch killing spree</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/heman.jpg" width="200" height="150" align="right"></p>
<p>First off was the Arch Lich Rhag'Zadune, I hate this fight, i did'nt get any screenshots i was so god damn bored, even if i did he would loook just like the 200 other snakes i've posted here, So here's a picture of He-Man instead.</p>
<p>He put up a good fight but died eventually. Here's the loot that did'nt rot!<br>
<img src="images/061302/alloot1.jpg" width="401" height="151"><br>
<img src="images/061302/alloot2.jpg" width="401" height="151"></p>
<p>Platinum Mesh Guard: Kaustran<br>Shield of Holy Vigor: Lambert</p>
<p>Next was a mob we had yet to kill, the High Priest of Ssraeshza i really don't know why either, apart from a couple of suicide test runs around 5 months ago we had'nt tried him until recently, we had a play around in his room last week and worked on a strategy, tonight we executed it flawlessly....well except for a few problems like Nedden's little friend (will get to that soon) and some fucked up tanking....</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/rtank.jpg" width="508" height="18"><br>
<img src="images/061302/rtank1.jpg" width="553" height="35"></p>
<p>Anybody would think he had something to prove about a rangers tanking ability</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/hpdead.jpg" width="885" height="276"><br>
<img src="images/061302/hploot.jpg" width="119" height="134"></p>
<p>Bone of Bertoxxulous: Phallax<br>Ivory Crystal Greaves: Blitzberg<br>Shield of Ssraeshza: Chatraz</p>
<p>Now a little side story to this kill, I play a rogue so i'm taking the opportunity to tell everybody about my view of the High Priest fight, the corridor to the guy has 3 traps in it, one of which is total ass and curses your whole raid, so us lucky rogues get to spend most of the night clicking the same damn button over and over, you get a lovely chat window view<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap.jpg" width="210" height="84"></p>
<p>Bored and a little angry, Nedden starts to tell us how he feels<br>
<img src="images/061302/traps.jpg" width="532" height="29"><br>
Eventually he comes up with a little game, something to relieve the boredom and a worthy sequel to the hugely popular "Steal a mod rod and use a charge then drop on the floor and see who notices" game, ask a random person to come buff you, drop sneak so the golems behind a nearby door agro just as the buff lands and there you have it! one dead caster<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap1.jpg" width="399" height="195"></p>
<p><img src="images/061302/trap3.jpg" width="521" height="32"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap0.jpg" width="458" height="18"></p>
<p>With the next target aquired the game seemed to be going well, an Enchanted imperial Golem nearby was watching however and saw Nedden's little game and decided to play a game of his own, every time Nedden came over near his assigned trap, Enhanced Imperial Golem would bring his 2 buddies and charge nedden regardless of hide sneak!</p>
<p>Off the unsuspecting hobbit goes back to his trap...<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>A little confused but not yet suspicious Nedden gets a res and gets back to his duty<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>Now a little suspicious he edges his way back, careful to not get in agro range<br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>By now the High Priest had been engaged by the guild, nobody was more relieved than Nedden, trap time over!<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap5.jpg" width="101" height="38"><img src="images/061302/trap4.jpg" width="528" height="18"></p>
<p>During the fight the group gets to hear Ned bitch a little and let some steam off, by this point i was in tears of laughter and barely able to fight<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap6.jpg" width="514" height="18"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap7.jpg" width="406" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap8.jpg" width="406" height="17"></p>
<p>High Priest dies (see above) and time comes again to move out of the room, to do so requires the traps to be disarmed again....guess who was waiting for him?<br>
<img src="images/061302/trap12.jpg" width="528" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap9.jpg" width="532" height="32"><br>
<img src="images/061302/golemagro.jpg" width="538" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap13.jpg" width="451" height="49"><br>
<img src="images/061302/neded.jpg" width="392" height="17"></p>
<p>At this point i was just about pissing myself with laughter, what makes it funnier was the fact the golems all ran right over me and Joia totally ignoring us, killed Nedden and walked away, I just wish the rest of the guild could have seen it from my eyes.</p>
<p><img src="images/061302/trap14.jpg" width="447" height="17"><br>
<img src="images/061302/trap15.jpg" width="347" height="17"></p>
<p>Moral of the story? Don't fuck with the buffers, a new protector is on the streets, he's ruthless and he won't take no shit!<br>
<img src="images/061302/golem.jpg" width="161" height="203"></p>
<p>Next on the to kill list was the Xerkizh the Creator, afterall he's just next door, snake picture inc~</p>
<img src="images/061302/creator.jpg" width="734" height="374"></p>
<p>to sum up the fight quickly, we engaged, some tard agrod the whole room on us AGAIN, we killed them all, we killed the big snake.</p>
<p>Shiny Trinket of Speed: Ackbah<br>Willful Dirk of Domination: Rot?<br>Shield of the Creator: Zazel (i think)</p>
<p><a href="images/061302/wuoshi.jpg"><img src="images/061302/wuoshi.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"></a> <a href="images/061302/wuoshidead.jpg"><img src="images/061302/wuoshidead.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Finally we took down one last mob, 3 Ssra mobs in one night was a great confidence boost and we were feeling on top of our game, we decided to try the impossible...Wuoshi!</p>
<p>Wuoshi was taken down in record time with 0 deaths, it just goes to show what we can achieve when we work together, sadly the same can't be said about our mob positioning as he died near the top of a tree =(</p>

			<p>The current hot topic on the Tunare server at the moment is how horribly overcrowded the server is, how there is fuck all to kill for 5 nights a week and how much it sucks to be here, a recent safehouse thread got hijacked into a "Tunare sucks" thread in fact.</p>
<p>What will Verant do? safe bet is nothing, if they can't charge $49.99 for it they don't give a shit anymore, they are even whoring out some of their long standing principals and letting you change your name for $$, something that takes a GM ten seconds to do by typing a single command, can you say moneygrabbing? sadly if they did shock us all and do a server split to a fresh server, i'm pretty sure they would find a way to make some money out of it.</p>
<p><a href="images/061102/szaroka.jpg"><img src="images/061102/szaroka.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0" align="right"></a></p>
<p>I say the above as a kind of introduction to the following mob, even on an overcrowded server, nobody is stupid enough to spend hours clearing PoG racing another guild to kill tunare right? wrong!<br>
I suppose if you look for the good in it, the plane was cleared in record time!</p>
<p>with 3 or 4 mobs left....poof goes Tunare to be replaced by Szaroka, our server GM.</p>
<p>Szaroka used her limitless GM powers and unsurpassed negotiation skills and sat on her ass listening to our representitives debate the issue for 20 minutes before coming to the decision that a random (which incidentally is the only solution the retarded Verant CS are able to actually offer and also was offered from the beginning by Parthiv) was he best way to solve the problem, WTG Szaroka! must have been a hard decision to come to!</p>
</p> Anyway, Pia Fidelis won the random and got first shot at Tunare, we all moved way back and waited patiently...and waited...and waited. the long wait gave us time to come up with sabotage plans!<br>
<img src="images/061102/sabotage.jpg" width="553" height="48"><br>
<img src="images/061102/sabotage1.jpg" width="472" height="15"></p>
<p>With every bind sight class of ours watching tunare with anticipation, the fight started, acompanied by 60 of us repeatedly bashing the "/who pia" hotkey, the count started at 67.</p>
<p><img src="images/061102/44.jpg" width="182" height="18"><br>

<img src="images/061102/20.jpg" width="220" height="18"><br></p>
<p>Buffed and ready, we helped CR Pia and moved in to smack the bitch around, she dropped fast and with few deaths.<br>
Supasonic got a Sap Encrusted Branch, Ihsan an Essence Of Nature, the Girdle Of Living Thorns went to me and Eriana got a Petrified Heartwood Flameberge, grats to all, ummm especially me!</p>
<p>Tunare died to us on the next spawn too but dear god i'm not writing any more about that stupid slut</p>
<p>Late last week sometime we found Xerkizh the Creator up in Ssra, we had camped for a key earlier in the night and managed to get a key, so armed with the SECOND CREATOR KEY ON TUNARE! we headed up, no more $9.99 a shot guide summons past the door for us baby!</p>

<p>Fuck i forgot how boring this fight is, i think the rest of the guild felt the same way...<br>
In an effort to make things interesting, Blitz decided to go Darkelf and tank in his caster look gear, Ushio decided to borrow a SoD and melee instead of heal and some tard decided to jump off the back of the altar and train the whole room on us<br>

<p>Thankfully we managed to stay awake until he died and oh my god what gimp loot we got, it was all looted however, grats to Nakoro and Xerryn on the 2 Hammers Of The Iornfist and Baeltor on the Cudgel Of Cowardly Death</p>
<p>Last thing for the update and very vaguely covered because i'm so god damn bored of sitting at this pc is this guy</p>
<p align="left"><a href="images/061102/blood.jpg"><img src="images/061102/blood.jpg" width="300" height="225" border="0" ></a></p>
<p>Between the servers ass like stability and Ssra resets we managed to get this guy twice recently, was a great feeling to finally get enough keys together to take him down and it's a fun fight!</p>
<p>The 2 bracers went to Chatraz and Qhue, Phallax got a new belt though i doubt even this belt will keep his pants up while he's around various treelife, finally Wikala got the mace.</p>

<p>First off, sorry to the 10 people who actually read this page for the lack of updates lately, i've been taking a bit of a break from EQ and I saw my friends and actually went to a place of social activity it scared me, think i'm back down to reality now...back to EQ.</p>
<p>I pretty much don't have a clue what the guild has done over the last 6 days or so but i do know we killed Tunare sometime last week</p>
<p><img src="images/053002/tunare.jpg" width="468" height="440"></p>
<p>8 hours or so clearing the stupid zone and what amazing loots did we get? 3 god damn flamberges...<br>
I really don't understand verant, they had a great system with Vulak where he had 3 loot tables and you got one item from each table, why for gods sake can't you implement that system with more mobs, just to prevent fuckups like getting 3 stupid swords that only 2 classes in the whole game can use of which there are few because you fuck them over all the time. you then feel the need to put a god damn Paladin/Shadowknight 2h sword on every mob in existence as some sort of compensation. get a clue and put some variety into the game.</p>
<p><img src="images/053002/tunareloot.jpg" width="112" height="228"></p>
<p>Usually, on most mobs you can handle a few bad loots, but on a mob that takes around 8 hours just to get to it's a real kick in the balls, the worst part is that all 3 swords got looted so i can't even rant on for 3 paragraphs about it being unwanted loot (oops i kind of did already) and how i'd like to send Ragnrok over to verants offices to assfuck the whole design team</p>
<p>Anyway, grats to Azarzal, Baeltor and Kielle on a Petrified Heartwood Flameberge each<br>
And grats to <A HREF="images/053002/ushdead.jpg">Ushio</A> on a Golden leaf Earing, the saviour item for the night</p>
<p>This tuesday saw us head once again to the Deep to kill the wormwholookslikeaskeleton, i think this is about the only encounter in Luclin that i actually enjoy, it's well made and has well tuned RvR</p>
<p><a href="images/053002/worm.jpg"><img src="images/053002/worm.jpg" width="400" height="300" border="0" align="right"></a></p>
<p>After Tunare i was half expecting to get 4 daggers or something equally suck from the wormwholookslikeaskeleton but we got lucky and the highlight was a Tunic (about the only reason to even bother doing the worm along with the robe)</p>
<p>Grats to Elis on the Ancient Burrower Hide Tunic<br>
Kinadar on the ring Of Ore<br>
Arhim got the shard From Unfathomable Depths<br>
And Joia got the Burrower Spine</p>

<p>As for other things we have done, online...not much, around 20 people from the guild did have a weekend gathering in vegas though you'll have to ask them what happened there, be sure to /tell Sephrana and ask her how it went, she is alway happy to chat.</p>
