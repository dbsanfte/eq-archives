<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Qeynos near the Temple of Life (also known as the flying<br>
saucer), Astaed Wemore will ask you if you would Travel Afar, <br>
tell him you would.&nbsp; (Note : if Astaed will not give the quest he<br>
will also not reward you, and possibly kill you to boot.)&nbsp; He will<br>
send you to Rivervale to talk to Kizzie Mintop. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon entering Rivervale find the Fool's Gold (Octagon shaped<br>
building 3 or 4 stories), walk around it and one way will have two<br>
houses, the back one is Kizzies'.&nbsp; Get 3 Honeycombs (bixies drop<br>
it, buy it for 5gp or so from PCs) and 30gp and give these to Kizzie<br>
all at once.&nbsp; She will give you Honey Jum in return.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run back to Astaed Wemore give him the Honey Jum.&nbsp; This is an<br>
odd part, there are currently two theories on this :<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) If you take to long Lepeck sucums to the disease and kills you
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Lycanthrops is a night-time disease and if you
give it to him at
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; night he kills you (or tries)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done it twice and was never attack so I don't
know...&nbsp; Anyway
<br>To find Lempeck enter WKaranas from QHills and head on an angle to
<br>the right (more right than straight), once you hit the river follow
it and
<br>before long you should find fields there.&nbsp; In approximately the
middle of
<br>these fields you will find Lempeck's House, normally he is inside,
yet
<br>he has been known to run on the roof-top (possibly people kill him
for
<br>exp).&nbsp; He will then give you a No Drop Lore version of a Rusty
Scythe.
<br>Return this back to Astaed Wemore for your reward, the <a href="/cgi-bin/framed/1883/weapons/ssl.html">Shining Star of Light</a>
