<b><font size=+1>Deepwater Harpoon</font></b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Serna Tasknon in the Temple of Marr in North
Freeport
<br>will give you a potion of Marr, take this to 7 the Sentries in Alphabetical
<br>Order (Andlin, Boris, Gallius, Janeal, Meighan, Theo, Warren).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next go to the Ocean of Tears, and get off and Sisterhood
of
<br>Erollisi Island.&nbsp; There ask the leader, "Where is Sentry Xyrinn?".
<br>Sentry Xyrinn will then spawn on an Undead Isle (straight off the docks,
<br>to Oracle Island, go 1/4 the way around the island to the right, now
swim
<br>straight to the Undead Isle).&nbsp; At the top of the island there
are 4 spectres,
<br>Kill the spectres and keep them down, then give Sentry Xyrinn the Last
<br>Potion of Marr. She will run up the hill to where the spectres would
be,
<br>they will agro on her if they spawn so you get them first.&nbsp; After
approximately
<br>10 minutes, Sentry Xyrinn will thank you and drop the Deepwater Harpoon
<br>on the ground (literally).&nbsp; Be VERY careful of poachers I have
heard many stories where
<br>someone steals it.
