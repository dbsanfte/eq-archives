Quest for the Holy Partisan of Underfoot
<br>The Chalice of Conquest Quest Spoiler
<br>I was helping my good friend Riae Soulmender in Dagnor's Cauldron trying
to find
<br>that elusive Bilge aqua goblin when suddenly Riae mentions that he
found some
<br>exiled Paladin by the docks of faydwer. Naturally I felt obligated
to go
<br>investigate. Off to butcherblock I went in search of something interesting.
<br>I get to the docks and to my surprise I find a friendly young Dwarf
fisherman by
<br>the sea.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>"Hail Dru Razbine", I said. He responds back about his fishing spot
and tells me
<br>how he needs to fish for food now that he is banished from Kaladim.
I listen in
<br>on his story of woe and how he was stripped of his Cape of Underfoot
by Datur
<br>Nightseer, the leader of the Paladin Guild in Kaladim. Turns out he
was chosen
<br>for a very important task by Datur, failed, and was banished. If only
he had a
<br>brave Paladin to help him. "I think you've found your best hope Dru,
let me help
<br>you," I said to him, hoping for the chance to redeem my newfound fallen
dwarf
<br>paladin. He jumps at the chance maybe seeing something in me that reminded
him
<br>of himself back in his younger years. He goes on to explain the unfortunate
<br>circumstances surrounding what has happened. He was sent by Datur Nightseer
to
<br>carry the Chalice of Conquest to a noble band of Paladins in the Mountains
of
<br>Rathe. Dru then informs me that the Chalice of Conquest is very special
indeed.
<br>Rumor has it that Brell himself delivered the Chalice to the Church
of Underfoot
<br>himself. Drinking from the Chalice of Conquest assures you of victory,
howerver
<br>only good natured people can drink from the cup. If someone of an evil
past
<br>drinks from the cup, they suffer the wrath of Brell. He goes on to
say he was
<br>able to make it to the group of High Paladins in Rathe Mountains but
while he
<br>was there a band of orcs attacked the camp. During the melee an opportunistic
<br>Blue Orc was able to sneak into the camp and steal the Chalice! Dru
was busy
<br>fighting off the attacking orcs to notice the artifact being stolen.
After the
<br>fight was over Dru chased the orc off into the sunset to no avail.
When Lord
<br>Datur Nightseer heard of the events that took place from Dru, he chose
to blame
<br>his once noble paladin and banish him from Kaladim.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>After his tale ended he handed me a container with two slots. He told
me that
<br>once I found the Chalice of Conquest and the Candle of Bravery, combine
them,
<br>and return the case to Lord Nightseer. "Candle of Bravery?" I asked,
having
<br>never heard of such an item. He explained that is a Ceremonial candle
lit when
<br>the Chalice of Conquest is to be drunk from. He told me to get the
Candle of
<br>Bravery I would have to get both the candlestick and the candle, the
latter of
<br>which burnt out long ago and he did not know where Priestess Ghalea
aquires them
<br>from.
<br>From this point I'm off on my quest for the Chalice of Conquest, Candle
of
<br>Bravery, and most importantly- To restore Dru Razbine to his former
glory of
<br>being a Paladin of Underfoot. First, thanks to Riae Soulmender who
reminded me
<br>who she was, I went to Kaladim to speak with Priestess Ghalea of the
Church of
<br>Underfoot. I made my way to the cleric guild inside Kaladim and asked
the
<br>Priestess about the Candle of Bravery. She explains that the candle
itself is
<br>very difficult to make and only one person is able to do this task:
Dok of
<br>Halas. She told him that if I needed one made I would surely need some
Soil of
<br>Underfoot to give to Dok. For the Soil of Underfoot I had venture to
Lesser
<br>Faydark and lay waste to some Fairies, and pick up four portions of
Fairy dusts.
<br>After this tedious task I returned the dust to Ghalea and she gave
me some
<br>blessed Soil of Underfoot. I then knew my journey required me to take
the boat
<br>to Antonica.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>After a long boat ride, followed by a long run, I made found myself
at the
<br>Paladin camp in Rathe Mountains, the same Paladins who give out the
Armor of Ro
<br>molds. I find Nicholas, the dwarven Paladin, and ask him about the
Chalice of
<br>Conquest. He fills me in, with more detail, of the orc attack that
fateful day
<br>and the events that followed. Turns out that after the attack, a passing
ranger
<br>helped Nicholas track down the blue orc to an orc camp in the near
by Lake
<br>Rathe. At this lake the found the blue orc's dead body, appearently
the orc had
<br>taken a fatal blow during the fight but had enough stamina to make
it back to
<br>the camp, and a group of orcs too powerful for just the two of them
to take on.
<br>Nicholas decided that it would be best to go back and get help from
the other
<br>Paladins. The next morning when the Paladins returned to the orc camp
they found
<br>it deserted with some orc remnants scattered about. They found a bracelet
with
<br>the name "Klunga" on it, a shovel, a bag of cauldron prawns, and two
sets of
<br>tracks leading away from the camp. Nicholas went on to say that the
orc camp has
<br>now been taken over by green orcs and advised me to stay away. I thanked
<br>Nicholas for the information and then asked him what he knew about
the Candle of
<br>Bravery. He gave me a piece of the broken candlestick and went on to
say that
<br>the Rathe Mountains are not only overrun by monsters, but by evil druids
as
<br>well! Appearently an odd druid somehow managed to brake the candlestick
and
<br>steal a portion of it during a fight between the druids and the paladins.
<br>Nicholas even remembered the druids battle cry, "Long live the green!!!"
<br>Nicholas told me that if I was able to find the other piece of the
candlestick,
<br>the make of the candlestick would surely be able to put it back together.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Against Nicholas' advice, I went to Lake Rathetear in search of clues.
I found
<br>the orc camp that he mentioned, dispatched the surrounding orcs and
found an
<br>abandoned orc shovel on the ground, which I promptly picked up. I found
no other
<br>clues or tracks however, so I went back to Rathe Mountains in to find
the odd
<br>druid who holds the remaining portion of the Candlestick. At this point
I
<br>searched and searched and searched but could not find any druids that
seemed...
<br>well unordinary to me. Luckily for me an old friend of mine, Bohr Blackblade
of
<br>Fires of Heaven, a fellow Dwarven Paladin, passed through the mountains
and
<br>stumbled upon me. I informed him of what I was searching for. He sat
down for a
<br>moment to think, like many wise dwarfs do at times. He stood up and
told me that
<br>the only "odd druids" he knows of in the Mountains of Rathe would be
the Unkempt
<br>Preservers. He then told me he was in a bit of a rush and he hoped
he helped
<br>out. I waved goodbye and then started looking for Unkempt Preservers.
I indeed
<br>found them and after killing the evil druids for almost a full day
I felt
<br>discouraged. I took a bit of a rest and decided to give it another
shot. Then
<br>out of nowhere I heard, "Long live the green!!!", as a dagger pierced
my
<br>shoulder from behind. I quickly showed her what a Dwarven Paladin is
made of and
<br>I'm sure she will regret what she started for all eternity, the druid
fell dead
<br>at my feet. I did indeed find the Base of the Candlestick on the body
and felt
<br>with these components I should make my way to Halas to find Dok.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>I was unfamiliar with Everfrost and Halas, and everything inbetween.
After a
<br>days journey wandering the Snowy Peaks I found a cave with surrounding
Barbarian
<br>Warriors. I found myself at Halas at last. I was able to find Dok in
the
<br>building aptly named "Dok's Cigars". When I hailed him Dok told me
how I would
<br>find no cigars for they had run out and I should leave. I informed
him that I
<br>was not there for the cigars, but for the Candle of Bravery. "Candle
of Bravery?
<br>I'll need the candlestick, or pieces of it, a pouch of Soil of Underfoot,
and a
<br>honeycomb to make that magical item," he told me. Of course I had every
<br>component accept the honeycomb and none of the local shops had any
instock. I
<br>reluctantly left Halas and started the journey for Misty Thicket, where
I had
<br>heard Bixies dropped the Honeycomb I was after. Lucky for me a friendly
druid
<br>named Tryst Trustolid was kind enough to take me to Misty Thicket in
a flash. I
<br>found a Honeycomb in one of the local shops and my friend Tryst was
able to get
<br>me back to the Karanas. From there I was able to run back to Halas
and turn in
<br>the items to Dok. He must have been a shaman because I was sure I felt
some
<br>magic pulsating from the Candle of Bravery when he handed me the item.
I placed
<br>the Candle into my container given by Dru Razbine and was already halfway
to my
<br>goal!
<br>&nbsp;
<br>At this point I was all out of clues. I had a bracelet with the name
Klunga on
<br>it, and an abondoned orc shovel. "Where could the Chalice be?" I asked
myself
<br>over and over. The blue orc, Klunga?, had it last and now he is dead.
I finally
<br>went back to Nicholas to ask about the orc remnants to see if I missed
<br>something. He reminded me that he found the shovel, the bracelet, and
a bag of
<br>cauldron prawns when he looted the camp. Cauldron prawns! How could
I have been
<br>such a gnoll and missed that clue, surely it meant that the Orcs were
from
<br>Dagnor's Cauldron.
<br>So I rode the boat back to Faydwer and headed to the Cauldron. When
I arrived I
<br>found that my old friend Dalas Soww was there looking for the elusive
Blige. I
<br>asked him if he had seen any orcs in the area and he quickly led me
to the only
<br>orcs he knew of, the orc scout camp high atop of a rocky hill. I thanked
him and
<br>he went along his way. So I was onto them now. I found the orcs and
they were
<br>going to give me the information I needed to find the Chalice! Even
though I was
<br>very good at the Orc Language they would not respond to my questions.
I showed
<br>them that Dwarves do not appreciate such lack of cooperation. I had
to resort to
<br>violance. I slaughtered the Orcs and every time they came back to the
camp I
<br>slaughtered them again. Still no information. However I did notice
an odd
<br>pattern. Roughly every 6 hours there would be four orc at the camp
instead of
<br>three. However this fourth orc that was appearing was still just a
plain Orc
<br>Scout. But I was determined, and continued the Orc slaughter, I needed
to redeem
<br>Dru! Finally, days later, a new orc appeared at the camp. It was an
exiled orc
<br>legionaire. "Could this be what I have been looking for?!" I questioned
myself.
<br>Sure enough he followed suit as with his orc brethen not responding
to my
<br>questions so I dispatched him. However this orc, instead of dropping
Rawhide
<br>armor, dropped a note. A bloodstained note.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The note had some very interesting information, the spelling was sloppy
as is
<br>all Orc Literature. The note read a little something like this: "Dis
is a notis
<br>of the death of Klunga~ He tryd to reedeam himsef by stealig a Dwarv
cup~ When
<br>he drunk from cup at lake he died~ We drug his body back to Calldrin~
We burnd
<br>bodi in fire pit here~ We bury cup here~ We killd gnome castor here~
We tink he
<br>knows sumtink~ Den all is gud~"
<br>I deciphered the note I found on the Orc with my brother Xiae Soulmender,
a very
<br>intelligent High Elf wizard. We decided the message stated that Klunga
was the
<br>blue orc that stole the cup, he was not injured during the battle in
Rathe
<br>Mountains but died from drinking the cup. His fellow orcs brought Klunga's
body
<br>and the cup back to the Cauldron. The Orcs then cremated Klunga's body
in the
<br>fire pit at the Orc Camp, and buried the cup elsewhere. The only thing
we
<br>weren't quite sure about was the Gnome caster. Who was it? And where
was he?
<br>While scouring the Cauldron for answers I noticed my brother Diae Soulmender,
a
<br>Ranger, walking to the Estate of Unrest. I asked him if he could try
to track
<br>down this Gnome Caster. He was able to make short work of that task,
finding
<br>Ghilanbiddle Nylwadil very quickly. Ghilanbiddle was at a camp with
some
<br>companions of his. I asked Ghilanbiddle if he knew anything about the
Chalice of
<br>Conquest. He told me that he knew the Chalice was buried within the
Cauldron but
<br>he did not know precisely where, however he did know someone who does.
He
<br>explained using his arcane magic he would be able to resurrect Captain
Klunga
<br>and have him lead me to the cup. He required a few items to do this
task, a item
<br>that was once owned by Klunga, a portion of his blood, and most importantly,
100
<br>gold coins. I had the bracelet klunga had owned, and also 100 gold
coins. But
<br>what could be the portion of blood? "Is it possible the bloodstained
note itself
<br>is what he requires?" I asked myself. I decided it was worth a try.
I traded him
<br>the note, the bracelet, and 100 gold coins.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Sure enough he responded back saying the he had successfully resurrected
<br>Klunga's soul to the place he was laid to rest. Ghilanbiddle also told
me that
<br>Klunga's soul would need something to dig up the Chalice with. I sure
was glad
<br>that I picked up that abandoned orc shovel at the Orc Camp back in
Lake
<br>Rathetear. I ran to the Orc Camp where I found the exiled orc, and
found a
<br>skeleton named Captain Klunga. I gave the scattered fallen bones the
shovel. I
<br>have to admit I jumped back a bit with the bones came together to form
a
<br>skeleton twice the size as I. Klunga, wordless, started walking in
a straight
<br>line towards a distant point in the Cauldron. I followed him into the
water and
<br>swan close behind to follow, my only fear now was that a passing adventurer
<br>would kill Captain Klunga before he was able to dig up the chalice.
We made it
<br>across the Cauldron to a remote spot. Klunga paused a moment, a brown
bag
<br>appeared at his feet and then he turned on me! I unsheathed my Ghoulbane,&nbsp;
and
<br>dismissed him back to the realm of the undead. When I picked up the
brown bag
<br>where Klunga paused I found none other then the Chalice of Conquest!
Overjoyed I
<br>made my way back to Kaladim. Ran through the halls, past the Bank of
Kaladim,
<br>through the halls of the Church of Underfoot and kneeled before my
liege, Lord
<br>Datur Nightseer, the noble Paladin leader. I placed the Chalice into
the
<br>container and combined the two items. I handed the container then to
Lord Datur
<br>Nightseer who, in return, gave me a Cape of Underfoot for my troubles.
The Cape
<br>itself was not very useful, a simple 4 armor class and maybe 5 extra
stamina. I
<br>believe the cape to be more of a status symbol in Kaladim and almost
forgot
<br>about Dru Razbine himself. I ran to him, cloak in hand, seeing in his
eyes that
<br>he knew my quest was over and he would be able to back to Kaladim.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Dru Razbine exclaimed, "Jiae, you're definitely a finer Paladin then
I. Take
<br>this holy weapon, but be careful what you do with the magical charges
it
<br>possesses, for I know of only one cleric that can recharge the magical
effect.
<br>The cleric I speak of went to the lava filled plains of Antonica and
has not
<br>been heard from since. Thank you Jiae, I will now be able to walk the
halls of
<br>Kaladim again..."
<br>&nbsp;
<br>When I examined the blade closely I found no magical effect or charges,
does
<br>this mean I must search out the cleric in the lava filled plains of
Antonica?
<br>What does she hold in store for me? A refined weapon? Possibly our
grandest holy
<br>sword of all? We shall she in the future fellow Paladins, I call on
you to help
<br>find the missing pieces regarding this Cleric!
