<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this quest you need to have decent faction with
the High Elven paladin's guild.
<br>The quest truely begins with seaching out Jojojojunga in Innothule
swap and returning
<br>his hide to the guildmaster, however you can skip this part. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to Freeport area and obtain Orc Pawn Picks, take
these (4 at a time) to
<br>Tohsan Hallard it the run-down section of Freeport.&nbsp; Do this repeatedly
until
<br>you are given Ticket #16568, take this to Treasurer Lynn in High Hold
Keep.
<br>She will in return give you a High Hold Keep Suite Key.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the third floor of High Hold Keep open the locked door with your<br>
newly accquired key.&nbsp; Talk to Tearon Bleanix, he will give you a bracer and<br>
tell you to go talk to Mistress Anna who is on the 4th floor.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Mistress Anna tells you to kill Tylani. Tylani is behind a secret door through a&nbsp;<br>
picture frame where the Princess Lenya used to be.&nbsp; She drops a fish food <br>
container, fill this with 3 fairy dusts and 1 sand of ro to make fish food.&nbsp; Go to <br>
Qeynos and out from of the inn with the lion on it there is a merchant that sells silk <br>
 evenings gowns it looks exactly like a cloth shirt.&nbsp; Head back to High Hold Pass, <br>
goto the Rooster Inn (sorta like a casino), on the second floor spawns Marlin, I <br>
 believe only at night.&nbsp; Give Marlin the Evening Gown and in return you get a key.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Go to lake Rathe and the Royal Fish.&nbsp; Give the Fish the Fish Food and apparently<br>
Princess Lenya spawns in a tower, give her the key from marlin and the bracer from <br>
Tearon Bleanix.&nbsp; She will give you a <a href="/cgi-bin/framed/1883/quests/royal_amulet_of_thex.jpg">Royal Amulet of Thex</a>*.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp; Now go back to High Hold Keep again,&nbsp; back to the room where Tearon Bleanix is.<br>
Now you have to be careful here, I got trapped for a while =)&nbsp; Open the door find out how<br>
close to it you can be and still be able to give Bleanix items.&nbsp; Now re-open the door quickly<br>
give Tearon Bleanix both the Suite Key and the Amulet.&nbsp; In return he gives you a Silent Watch<br>
Shield.&nbsp; Boot it out the door double time or you will get stuck there behind the unpickable lock =)<br>
