<b>Ronium</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do fool yourself, the making of Ronium is every bit
as hard
<br>as obtaining the molds, in some cases much harder.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to Lord Searfire the Dwarven smith in the Temple
of
<br>Ro and ask him about Ronium, you need high faction which
<br>can be obtained these three ways :
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Kill Shadowed Men
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - In South Ro give the erudite Rathamana 3pp in coins,
use
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; this only if you have money to burn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; - In South Ro give 4 Dervish Cutthroat Insignia Rings
to
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ortallius, a named friendly orc.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have the faction required (amiable), you'll
need:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Sands of Ro, from Sand Giants in Ro
&amp; Oasis (34-8)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Mistmoore Granite, from Flouting,
Jeering, and Leering
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gargoyles from Mistmoore.&nbsp; (30-38)&nbsp;
<b>No Drop</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; </b>Melatite, from Clockwork
Gnomes CWG and MC, in
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solusek A (lowers Ak'Anon factions).&nbsp;
(30+)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; Soil of the Underfoot <b>No
Drop</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; 2 bars of Enchanted Platinum
from Enchanters
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should no longer be required to be a Master Smith
to
<br>combine.
<p><b>Mob Level Range</b> : 30 - 39
<br><b>Reward </b>: Ronium
<br><b>Other loot </b>: Misc.
