<b>Zimel's Blades (Soulfire)</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the Temple of Truth (Freeport), go right,
<br>then first right, up the stairs, left then left.&nbsp; There
<br>should be one Kalatrina Plossen. Talk to her,
<br>she will tell you of one of our spies in the militia
<br>house, and give you a letter to give to him.&nbsp; He
<br>will then give you a piece of paper&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait around
<br>for a few moments and he will be attacked by
<br>Krazen (from the Bank in NFP).&nbsp; I don't know
<br>what happens if you save him, probably end up
<br>with the militia house on your head.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalatrina Plossen had instructed you to take
<br>what this spy gives you back to her.&nbsp; At this point
<br>if you do the quest seems to be broken, DO NOT
<br>give it to her, take it to Groflah in Groflah's forge.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He will instruct you to meet him in Sea Farer's
<br>Roost in EFP (on the docks).&nbsp; He will show up
<br>around 1-3am (/time), give him the note back
<br>and ask him now who Zimel was.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Groflah leaves a beggar named Tykar
<br>Renlin is nearby, give him 4 Drom's Champagne
<br>(these are Lore), if your faction is not high enough
<br>you must get another to buy them for you.&nbsp; In
<br>exchange Tykar will give you a blanket.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try Brownloe Bakery (near monks) and see if
<br>they have any Edible goo, if not you need to make it.
<br>Find an Oven and place in it a Rat Ear and a Fire
<br>Beetle Eye.&nbsp; Now unless you know a Brewer you must
<br>also make some Bog Juice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take these to Zimel underneath the Arena, give him
<br>the Blanket, Bog Juice and Edible Goo.&nbsp; He will give
<br>you H.K. 102.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now run to High Keep and give the Key to the Bank
<br>Cleric.&nbsp; She will give you a note in exchange.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make towards Splitpaw in SKaranas, within it you
will
<br>find Brother Hayle, give him the note (you may have to be
<br>kindly at this point).&nbsp; He will tell you what you need then
<br>give you the note back.&nbsp; (You need a way out of his cell,
<br>as it closes. A friend outside or a nifty Gate potion 1300pp!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complete the <a href="/cgi-bin/framed/1883/quests/Test_of_Truth.html">Test
of Truth</a> in Freeport, next head to
<br>Mistmoore (just off of Lfaydark), find the evil shadow
<br>knight Xicotl (level 35ish).&nbsp; Now we're in the home stretch
<br>Race back to Freeport and complete the <a href="/cgi-bin/framed/1883/quests/bsof.html">Brilliant Sword
<br>of Faith</a> quest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure your faction with Brother Hayle is up
to kindly,
<br>(Qeynos factions), then give him the items.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may now proudly wield the holy sword Soulfire.
