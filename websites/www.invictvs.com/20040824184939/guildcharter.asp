						<div align="left" id="subheading">Guild Focus</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>~FUN~
							<br>This is our primary focus.  Everquest is afterall, a game.  A game is played for enjoyment and relaxation.  When the game stops being fun, when people are bogged down on a daily basis with politics and/or arguments that cause stress, it is no longer worth the while to log in. Please remember that it is not fun when you subject your guildmates to your personal complaints about the guild, regardless of how sympathetic they may seem.  There will not be any drama.
							
							<p>~Union~
							<br>We've always considered ourselves a family guild.  We were very successful at it for many years.  Perhaps we are no longer the small family guild, but we do strive for a close, tight knit union.  We work as a team and compromise one another's weaknesses with our strengths. Our members will indeed learn to get along and enjoy playing with one another.
							
							<p>~Achievements~ 
							<br>We're here to get things done.  Raiding is not required, but we recommend that members participate in order to make the guild stronger.  Our ideal is to build a guild where each and every member knows and likes the next person and is having FUN and still able to get the job done. Let's face it, we all have our ambitions and we want to get somewhere in the world of Norrath. This guild will concentrate on progression. We're not going to stop short and continue a stale routine.  <strong>Our current focus is Vex Thal, as well as other Ssraeshza mobs.  Planes of Power will be part of our agenda as time permits, however we are not on the fast track to Elementals.</strong>
							
							<p>~Loot~
							<br>We have a very fair method of awarding loot.  We use a DKP (dragon kill point - just an old term) system.  If you work for the guild, you will have the DKP to spend.  It's pretty simple.  You may not always get what you want and when you want it, but remember that the item is going to your guildmate.  This will make the guild stronger and in turn help you with your loot goals.  In the meantime, no one enjoys hearing constant chatter about who wants what loot.  It just gives the wrong impression.
						</blockquote>							
							
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Your Responsibility</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>This is YOUR guild! If we are not doing something befitting of your standards and desires, then be proactive. You have a voice in this guild, but for that right you will also be expected to take responsibility.  We welcome your ideas and opinions.  Remember to always consider what is best for the guild as a whole. If you don't feel comfortable speaking in front of a crowd, then just get in touch with your most trusted Officer on a one-on-one basis. We may not always agree with you, but we are here to help you. Information is the key to success.  The lines of communication must always be kept open. If we don't know what your issues and concerns are, we can not help you. 
						</blockquote>							
							
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Disciplinary Action</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>There will be unfortunate times that the Officers are forced to discipline members.  Any infraction of our Charter, Code of Conduct, Raid & Loot Rules may be grounds for disciplinary action.  It is your responsibility to be familiar with our Charter.  Some infractions will result in immediate guild removal, but generally a formal warning between 30-90 days will be issued.  During that time, loot will not be received and any infraction will result in removal from the guild.  There may be other penalties as deemed by the Officers, which may include a percentage of your DKP deducted.  
						</blockquote>

						<a name="codeofconduct"><div align="left" id="mainheader">Code of Conduct</div></a>
						<blockquote>
							<p>~NO DRAMA!  Swift measures will always be taken to avoid drama, conflict, and gossip.
							 
							<p>~Behave appropriately. Excessive profanity or inappropriate language and behavior will not be tolerated in-game or on ANY of the message boards.   Do not engage in offensive exchanges in any channels in-game.
							 
							<p>~Bragging is not something that honorable and respectful guildmates engage in.  We are but one guild in the world and need to coexist with other guilds and players to make Norrath a better place to play. 
							 
							<p>~Treat your guildmates with respect. We must show the others the same respect that we as players expect to be shown to us, whether they be in the guild or not. In addition, sexual harassment and racial slurs will not be tolerated. You can not take back things said in jest regardless of your intentions. 
							 
							<p>~Complaints about member behavior are to be limited to respectful private /tells. Should you have any reason to question a member's behavior, the best thing to do is to report the situation to an Officer.  Do not participate in gossip.
							 
							<p>~You have chosen to be in this guild and should be proud to say so. If you choose to be anonymous then so be it, but you are required to place yourself under role-play so your guild tag may be seen. 
							 
							<p>~We do not put up with Kill Stealers or Ninja Looters. Period. 
							
							<p>~Other than what is stated, just use common sense and remember that your actions represent Invictvs as a whole.  We have always had a very good reputation and you will be expected to live up to it.
						</blockquote>
						
						<div align="left" id="mainheader">Officers & Responsibilities</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>As Officers, we will do what is in the best interest of the guild.  The Charter, Code of Conduct, and Raid & Loot Rules will be our guide.  There may be times when our decisions are outside the scope of the Charter.  Please be respectful when this occurs.  It is not always possible to make everyone happy, but we always weigh the pros and cons of a decision and never take it lightly.  We will try to be patient and understanding, however there will be times when we are called to make swift and final decisions.  Those are the times that you need to put your trust in us and our abilities.  Myriad/Invictvs has a very successful legacy extending over 3 years and it is our goal to continue on that path.
