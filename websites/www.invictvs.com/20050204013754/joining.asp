						<div align="left" id="subheading">Applicant Instructions</div>
						<blockquote>
							<ol>
								<li>Contact our Recruiting Officer via e-mail, in game or on the <a href="http://p213.ezboard.com/binvictvs">bulletin board</a>. Please leave your e-mail address if you post on the bulletin board. Our Recruiting Officer is Aradiani: <a href="mailto:AradianiSaskiir@yahoo.com">AradianiSaskiir@yahoo.com</a>.</li>
								<li>A complete understanding and agreement with our <a href="http://www.invictvs.com/guildcharter.asp">Charter</a>, <a href="http://www.invictvs.com/guildcharter.asp#codeofconduct">Code of Conduct</a> and <a href="http://www.invictvs.com/raidloot.asp">Raid & Loot Rules</a> which can be found at our website: <a href="http://www.invictvs.com/">www.invictvs.com</a>. Please note, that we are a quiet and respectful guild. We do not tolerate drama.  I cannot stress this aspect enough.</li>
								<li>Complete an application, which is e-mailed to you by the Recruiting Officer.</li>
								<li>After you have completed an application contact an Officer to tag you as an initiate.</li>
								<li>During your initiation period, you will accrue DKP, but you will not be allowed to bid on items until you have been approved for full membership.</li>
								<li>You must attend a minimum of 5 raids during your initiation period. Please allow up to a week after your 5th raid for the finalization of your application.  If you do not attend raids for a month, your application will be closed.  If you do not complete your raids within 2 months, your application will be closed.</li>
								<li>It is your responsibility to request access to the bulletin board and to be aware of our raids, policies, discussions, etc.  During your initiation period, you must record your raid hours in the "Raid Hours" section of the bulletin board.  This is the only method that we use to track your raids and DKP.  If you fail to do this, we will assume you have not been raiding and your application may be closed.</li>
								<li>You must receive unanimous favor by our current members. Efforts will be made by the Recruiting Officer to settle any concerns brought up by our members. The Recruiting Officer will also decide which concerns are substantial and valid. Disputes will be presented to the Officers. However, if even one member remains resolute with substantial concerns behind their decision, an initiate will be asked to look elsewhere.</li>
								<li>Members may veto your application before you have completed the 5 raids.  If this occurs, you will be removed from the guild and will receive an e-mail from the Recruiting Officer.  We reserve the right not to share the details of our decision.</li>
							</ol>
						
							<em><p>Much luck to you and I hope to hear from you soon! Please feel free to contact me or post if you have additional questions.</p>
							<p>-Aradiani Saskiir</p></em>
						</blockquote>
						
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Reasons your application was closed</div>
						<blockquote>
							<ol>
								<li>You never contacted an Officer for an initiate tag.</li>
								<li>You have not raided in 1 month.</li>
								<li>You have not completed your 5 raids within 2 months.</li>
								<li>You failed to record your raid hours.</li>
								<li>Your behavior made it obvious that you did not read and agree to our Charter, Code of Conduct, and Raid & Loot Rules.</li>
								<li>You did not receive a unanimous vote from the members.  This can occur at any time during your initiation period.  In this case, you will receive an e-mail.</li>
							</ol>
						
							<p>In situations surrounding 1-4 (sometimes 5), you are welcome to e-mail Aradiani about your situation and you may be granted an exception.  If you find that suddenly you do not have time to dedicate to Invictvs, you are welcome to reapply at a later date.
