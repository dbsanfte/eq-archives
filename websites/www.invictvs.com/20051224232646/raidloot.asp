						<blockquote>
							<p>~What is an official raid? - All official raids at which members earn DKP are posted in the "Upcoming Raids" section of the bulletin board.  If a member plans an event, they are responsible for making sure the loot rules are understood by all in attendance - and that DKP will NOT be earned. 

							<p>~Level Requirement - Your character must be level 70 in order to attend raids (mains of current members before this change must be 65+). If you play your alt instead of your main at an official raid you must be level 70 and receive permission from an officer.

							<p>~Raid Limit - At this time, we have a raid limit of 72.  If we are near or over that on a raid, members that 2-box will be asked to play only one character.

							<p>~/rsay - The raid channel (/rsay) is reserved for Raid Leader use.  This channel also may be used for calling assists and announcing some debuffs. Otherwise, this channel is off limits.

							<p>~/ooc & /shout - If a situation arises with another guild, please let the Officers & Raid Leaders speak on behalf of Invictvs.  This also applies to private tells to others.

							<p>~Invictvs Raid Channel - Only the Raid Leaders & Officers (pullers & assists at times) will give instructions and information regarding the raid.  Please refrain from making comments that could be misconstrued as instructions.  Your information may be incorrect and could cause confusion as well as offend your guildmates.  Also, please limit chatter to raid related topics.  Other talk and funnies should go in guildchat.
							
							<p>~Buffs - If you need buffs after the raid has been buffed, please send a tell.  Do not ask in the raid channel.

							<p>~Pay Attention - The single most important thing you can do on a raid is to listen to and follow the instructions of the Raid Leader.
							
							<p>~AFK - If you have to go afk, tell the raid and your group, put up afk, and auto follow a group member.  Do NOT ninja afk.  By doing this, you are holding up the raid and compromising our success.  If caught ninja afk'ing, you may be asked to leave the raid.

							<p>~Patience - Please have patience with your Raid Leaders.  Their goal is to provide the guild opportunities for challenge and advancement.   They have many duties and responsibilities and will take care of them as timely as possible.

							<p>~Call and Wait for Assist - Assists will be assigned.  Calling assist is an important responsibility as is waiting until assist is called before attacking.  Do not auto attack!
							
							<p>~Understand your Role - If you do not understand what you should be doing or are uncertain of what is happening, ask questions.  If possible ask your group or the general channels first, but if uncertainty remains bring it to the Raid Leader's attention.

							<p>~Shrink - Many raids take place in tight quarters.  Thus, all members of the guild should have some method to shrink themselves.  We have tinkers that can make <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16420" target="_blank">shrink machines</a> cheaply and they are easily <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=16414" target="_blank">recharged</a>.

							<p>~Pets - Pet owners must have the Pet Hold ability to use a pet on a raid. Even so, pets will not be allowed during certain encounters.  You must be aware of your pet at all times during a raid.  Multiple instances of uncontrolled pets and the owner will be asked to go without one.

							<p>~Push - Mob positioning is a very important aspect of a raid.  Please be aware of things causing an inordinate amount of push.  Weapons and spells with stun effects and pets with stun procs tend to be the biggest culprits of push.
						</blockquote>
						
						<div align="left" id="mainheader">Loot Information</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p> Loot is awarded by a DKP (dragon kill points) bidding system, where you earn 3 DKP per 1 raid hour.
								
							<p><font color="yellow">Your DKP is found on the guild website. You must log in to view the database.</font>
								
							<p>Unlike other DKP guilds, <strong>full members</strong> have additional methods of earning DKP:
							
							<p>1 AA point = 1 DKP (max of 20 DKP per bonus period)*
							
							<p>*Note: For alts, DKP is only given if they meet the level and AA requirements of new members.
							
							<p>Raid Hours - <em>You must post your raid attendence on the bulletin board to receive DKP. Only post in threads started by an officer or raid leader. Whenever possible raid hours & loot will be updated before every raid.  Regardless, the only DKP you can bid with is the amount displayed on the web site.</em>
							
							<p><em>AA Bonuses - Keep your levels & AAs updated via the website.  Bonuses are updated on the 15th and end/beginning of the month respectively.  New members may not receive a bonus depending on when they were added to the database and when they become full members. <strong>Alts of members must meet membership requirements to be eligible for bonuses.</strong></em>
							
							<p>Recruiting a new member = 30 DKP
							<br><em>Your name must be listed on their application. If more than one person is named, then the 30 DKP is divided. You will receive the bonus at the end of the month following one full month of full membership.</em>
							
							<p>Donations = bonus to be determined by the Officers
							<br><em>We are very selective as to what items we accept for DKP bonuses. Please post in the Treasury section what you are interested in donating.</em>
						</blockquote>							
							
						<div align="left" id="subheading">How loot is awarded at a raid</div>
						<blockquote>
							<ol>
								<li>Item drops. Only officers or raid leaders will check the corpse.
								<li>If you are interested in an item, send a tell to the designated Officer immediately with the maximum amount of DKP you are willing to bid. Do NOT bid more DKP than what you have (doing so may result in a future penalty). Feel free to link us the item you would be replacing - replacements may be considered if bids are close or tied.  If you are bidding on a mana regeneration item, please include your mana regeneration total in the tell. 
								<li>There is always a minimum bid of 10 DKP... even for rot or alt items.
								<li>Officers will consider the top 3 bids. Most often, the top bid will be awarded the item, however, there may be occasions when the Officers feel the need to award an item to another member.  Those reasons may include last loot received, upgrade, effect on item, close or tied bids, etc.  This is our discretion.
								<li>Winners and DKP paid are announced.
							</ol>
						</blockquote>
																
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Bidding Rules</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>*Main characters always have priority.
							
							<p>*Since this is a silent bid system discussion and agreements on bids are not tolerated.  Anyone found trying to circumvent the system can be placed on probabtion, loot diet and/or deguilded. 
							
							<p>*You may only request items for the character that is present at the raid and the character must be your own.
							
							<p>*If no members bid on an item (for mains or alts), it may be offered to initiates for no DKP charge for their first item, and after that a flat charge of 10 dkp per item.
							
							<p>*You may not bid on items for resale purposes (doing so may result in immediate guild removal).
							
							<p>*If there are no bids, the Officers may take bids for guild level and guilded alts (much of this is dependent on time and the item). Otherwise, loot will be dumped on the guild mule and in the next few weeks posted on the bulletin board. Items in the guild bank will be available for approximately 2 weeks for members to request. If no one shows interest in the items, they will be placed on the guild vendor. 
							
							<p>*<strong>You are responsible for checking your DKP.  The amount available to you is listed on the website and you must use the amount listed even if you dispute it's accuracy.  If you overbid, there will be a penalty.</strong>  If we catch the overbid, it will only result in a warning. The second overbid, if caught in time, will result in the 2-week loot diet. Third and higher overbids will result in a 1-month loot diet, regardless of whether you win the item. In all cases, your bid will be thrown out.  On the other hand, if we don't catch the overbid and you win something by bidding more than you have you will pay the full amount (likely causing a negative dkp balance) and receive a 1-month loot diet.
						</blockquote>
							
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Key Pieces/Spells/Quest Pieces</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>Key Pieces - Officers and Raid Leaders have priority when receiving key pieces.  Key pieces will primarily be awarded based on raid attendance over the last 2 months.  Please refer to our website for the spreadsheet.  If a member needs 1 piece to complete a key, the Officers reserve the right to award that piece to the member.  Seniority in the guild may be considered after we have determined the highest 3 raid percentages. There are no DKP deductions for key pieces.
							
							<p>Spells - The maximum bid for spells is 50 dkp. In case of a tie bid, the spell will be awarded to the member with the highest 2-month raid percentage. In case of another tie, guild seniority (longevity) in the guild will be the deciding factor.  Most spells in the guild bank will cost 10 DKP.
							
							<p>Quest Pieces - Typically are awarded to the person that is furthest along.  If more than one person is at that step, seniority in the guild will determine who is awarded the drop.  This policy will typically apply to arduous quests and will cost 10 DKP per piece.  There are some very simple quests that only require turning in a piece or two.  These quests may be handled differently, such as bidding on the item.  The Officers will handle the situation as fair as possible.
							
							<p>*Note about Epic Quests*
							<br>At this time, the guild is focused on the Epic 1.5 quests, with an Epic/Quest raid every other week.  Please be respectful of your guildmates and their response when requesting assistance outside of scheduled raids.
						</blockquote>
							
						<div align="left" id="subheading">Other important information about DKP and the bidding system</div>
						<blockquote>
							<p>If you were awarded loot as the high bidder, the amount of DKP deducted is determined based on the second highest bidder. If there is only 1 bidder, then 10 (minimum bid) will be considered the second bid. Half of the difference between the 1st & 2nd bid added to the 2nd bid is the amount the item will cost. For example: 
							
							<p>Top 3 bids: 20, 40 & 60
							<br>60 bid wins the item
							<br>60-40=20... 20/2=10... 40+10=50
							<br>50 DKP is paid
							
							<p>Epic help/item = 10 DKP deduction.
							
							<p>Quest help/item (if specifically for you or item is contested) = 10 DKP deduction.
							
							<p>Spells = 10 DKP deduction.
							
							<p>Key Pieces = 0 DKP deduction.
							
							<p>If you are inactive after 2 months, you will be subjected to a 10% DKP penalty.  Members that are inactive longer without keeping the Officers updated about their departure, may be removed from the guild.
							
							<p>If you deguild, you will be subjected to a 20% DKP penalty or more depending on the length of your departure.
							
							<p><strong>It is YOUR responsibility to record your raid hours and gained levels & AA points in a timely manner. You will not earn DKP if you fail to do this!</strong>
							
							<p>There may also be times that the members present do not have adequate DKP for the value of the item. Awarding the loot will be at the Officer's discretion. Options such as the member going into negative DKP will be considered or the loot may be reserved and posted on the bulletin board.
							
							<p>Please note that there may be unforeseen issues regarding the bidding system. At that time, the Officers will do their best to determine what is fair and in the best interest of the guild as a whole.
