							<br>All official raids at which members earn DKP are posted in the "Upcoming Raids" section of the bulletin board.</P>
							
							<P><strong>What is a non official raid?</strong>
							<br>Often our members will plan events on off nights. If a member plans an event, they are responsible for making sure the loot rules are understood by all in attendance - and that DKP will NOT be earned. Please note that loot rules for non official raids are as stated by the member running the event. Guild leadership will not dictate how loot is awarded. To avoid unnecessary drama, please ensure you announce your loot rules prior to the mob's death.</P>

									<TD width="80%"><P>If you have to go afk, tell the raid and your group, put up afk, and auto follow a group member. Do NOT ninja afk. By doing this, you are holding up the raid and compromising our success. If caught ninja afk'ing, you may be asked to leave the raid.</TD>

								<TR>
									<TD width="20%"><P>Shrink</TD>
									<TD width="80%"><P>Many raids take place in tight quarters. Thus, all members of the guild should have some method to shrink themselves. We have tinkers that can make shrink machines cheaply and they are easily recharged.</TD>

									<TD width="20%"><P>Invis/Lev</TD>
									<TD width="80%"><P>Come prepared with invisibility &amp; levitation potions. Usually you will be able to obtain from someone in your group, but you should have the ability to do this yourself if required.</TD>
								</TR>
								<TR>
									<TD width="20%"><P>Pets</TD>
									<TD width="80%"><P>Pet owners must have the Pet Hold ability to use a pet on a raid. Even so, pets will not be allowed during certain encounters. You must be aware of your pet at all times during a raid. Multiple instances of uncontrolled pets and the owner will be asked to go without one.</TD>

New members will receive the bonus only if they are a full member during the bonus period. Alts/bots and initiates are not eligible for AA bonuses. Please note that we expect you to update the site as you earn your AAs. "Banking" of AAs into the next period in order to maximize AA bonus in a period where you may not XP is prohibited. You must attend one raid during the bonus period to be eligible for the bonus.</TD>

									<TD width="18%"><P>Recruitment</TD>
									<TD width="35%"><P>30 DKP per recruit</TD>

							<br>Members and initiates with forum access can find instructions on how to view their DKP by going <A href="http://p092.ezboard.com/finvictvsfrm24.showMessage?topicID=5.topic">here</A>.</P>
							
							<P><strong>What happens to my DKP if I am inactive for a period of time?</strong>
							<br>A 10% inactivity deduction will be done on the 1st of every month for anyone who did not attend a raid during the prior two months.* An example of how this works: on February 1st anyone who did not attend a raid between Dec. 1 through Jan. 31 will receive a deduction. If they do not attend any raids in February, they will receive an additional 10% deduction on March 1st, and so on.</P><I>
							<P>* Someone may communicate special circumstances to the officers for a waiver to the deductions. A good example of this would be if you are in the military and get shipped off to Iraq. Or for a shorter period of time, if your work schedule changes and you now have to work the night shift, etc.</P></I>

								<LI>If you are interested in an item send a tell to the person taking bids with your bid. The minimum amount you may bid is 10.</LI>

In most cases the item will be awarded to the top bid, however the officers reserve the right to award to another member based on last loot received, upgrade, effect on item, close or tied bids. Exceptions to the top bidder getting the item are very rare. If two people tie for the top bid, they will be given the option to raise their bids. If both people decline to raise their bid, officers will determine the winner based on raid attendance, seniority or recent loot awards.</LI>

This policy will typically apply to arduous quests and will cost 10 DKP per piece. There are some very simple quests that only require turning in a piece or two. These quests may be handled differently, such as bidding on the item. The officers will handle the situation as fairly as possible.</TD>

							<P><strong>How does bidding priority work?</strong>
								<OL>
									<LI>Full members</LI>
									<LI>Member Alts (must be present)</LI>
									<LI>Initiates</LI>
									<LI>Member Alts (not present)*</LI>
									<LI>Initiate Alts (not present)*</LI>
								</OL>
							<P>Officers will call for bids in two stages. Bids will be asked first from full members and if no members are interested, then from characters falling into categories 2 though 5. Once loot has been opened to alts/initiates full members will no longer have priority.</P><I>
							<P>*Please note that depending on the location/type of raid we’re on, officers may opt not to allow characters not already present to loot as it may slow down or endanger the raid.</P></I>
							
							<P><strong>How much can I bid?</strong>
							<br>You can bid anywhere from 10DKP up to your total DKP as listed on the site. Whenever possible, raid hours &amp; loot will be updated before every raid. Regardless, the only DKP you can bid with is the amount displayed on the web site. In the event that loot is going to rot, officers may exercise the option to allow someone to go negative DKP to bid the minimum of 10 DKP.</P>
							
							<P><strong>How does loot work for initiates?</strong>
							<br>If loot gets offered to alts/initiates, initiates simply need to send a tell expressing their interest to the person taking tells for that item. If it is their first item, there will be no charge. After an initiate receives their first item from the guild there is a flat charge of 10DKP per item charged for each subsequent item. If multiple initiates are interested in an item, officers will award by looking at raid attendance, amount of loots received, as well as considering the feedback on the initiate’s application.</P>
							
							<P><strong>What happens if I overbid?</strong>
							<br>The amount available to you is listed on the website and you must use the amount listed even if you dispute its accuracy. If you overbid, there will be a penalty. If we catch the overbid, it will only result in a warning. The second overbid, if caught in time, will result in the 2-week loot diet. Third and higher overbids will result in a 1-month loot diet, regardless of whether you win the item. In all cases, your bid will be thrown out. On the other hand, if we don't catch the overbid and you win something by bidding more than you have you will pay the full amount (likely causing a negative DKP balance) and receive a 1-month loot diet.</P>
							
							<P><strong>What if I want to bid on more than one item from a single mob or encounter?</strong>
							<br>You may bid on multiple items from one mob or encounter, but you may only win one of them. You must tell the person taking the bids that a) you’re bidding on multiple items and b) which item is your preference in the case that you’re the top bidder on both items.</P>
							
							<P><strong>Am I allowed to talk about what I am bidding on an item?</strong>
							<br>Since this is a silent bid system, discussion and agreements on bids are not tolerated. Anyone found trying to circumvent the system can be placed on probation, loot diet and/or deguilded.</P>
							
							<P><strong>Can I bid on droppable loot for the purpose of reselling the item?</strong>
							<br>You may not bid on items for resale purposes (doing so may result in immediate guild removal).</P>
							
							<P><strong>How are key/progression pieces awarded?</strong>
							<br>Officers and Raid Leaders have priority when receiving key pieces. Key pieces will primarily be awarded based on raid attendance over the last 2 months. Please refer to our website for the spreadsheet. If a member needs 1 piece to complete a key, the officers reserve the right to award that piece to the member. Seniority in the guild may be considered after we have determined the highest 3 raid percentages. Key pieces are awarded at no charge.</P>
							
							<P><font color="yellow"><strong>General note: The above information are the current rules that have been developed over the last several years. Officers follow these rules as closely as possible; however there may be unforeseen issues or scenarios that may require us to deviate from them. Exceptions to these rules are incredibly infrequent, but we reserve the right to make exceptions in the interest of fairness and the overall best interest of the guild.</strong></font></P>
