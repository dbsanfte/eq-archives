Fist let me tell you that DG started as a evil guild on EQ on the TZ server pvp. Ranzire our guild leader started DG and its numbers grew to the point that we were one of the biggest dark guilds on TZ. Over the years on TZ pvp has taken a back seat and it has turned into a game of endless hours of exping and pve for gear. At long last a game has arrived that is pvp based to quench our thirst for blood and war.<br><br>We are planning on a Military or Mercenary guild, at this point we are more towards that Mill guild. This will leave the largest race/class combinations available. Note all race/class may join but there is a proffered race/class for each guild granting a exp bonus and most people will choose there guild depending on this bonus. <br><br>Our goals are to be the leader, we are going to be organized and ready with our plans before SB goes life. From day one we will set our plan into action, first the forming of the guild, second the planting of our tree of life and the building of our city. Every member of DG will work as a team so that we may grow stronger together. We have a inner circle were our officers talk daily about plans tactics and goals for the guild.<br>I can not go into great detail on all of our plans but like a said before we plan on being the leader. Other guilds will come to us as we grow in size asking for alliance, we will be a dark overwhelming shadow that slowly spreads over the realm destroying all who stand in our way.<br><br>You wish to no how to climb the ladder of ranks? Well let me say right now that we expect a lot of our guild members. When we ask for help in the guild channel there should be no hesitation. This is going to be a whole new game and there will be much more to loose and gain. Our city will need to be defended at all costs, we cannot let all our hard work go to waste because someone had better things to do then defend the city that will be there livelihood. Putting the guild goals first and your personal goals second is something we will need and expect from everyone no matter what rank you may hold.<br>We look for dedication, loyalty,pvp skills and obedience. I have seen so many guild raids and plans go bad because guild members would hesitate when asked to do something. When our leader Ranzire or one of the inner council give an order it is for the good of the guild and the faster the guild as a whole can carry out that order without hesitation the stronger we become. Moving up in the ranks will take time just remember to put the guilds needs over your own and DG will treat you with respect and friendship.<br><br>It must be late I am going on and on, I bet it I take a look back I probley repeated myself a few times. If you have any more questions please post them or email me at Vern6767@msn.com <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#000000><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub9.ezboard.com/uzelovos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zelovos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(6/11/02 5:06:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Interested in Dark Genesis</span><hr size=1> Hmm, interesting<br>What type of government do you guys plan to be? I hear of the &quot;inner council&quot; so im guessing Oligarchy, but some of the more successful guilds in game have been a republic, its a bit better on the PR. <br>Also, i understand that you guys are a &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;shadowy&quot; guild, all and well. But these type of guilds seem to have all the jerks that ruin the game for everyone, i'll try not be rude but in AC and what ive experienced in EQ the &quot;dark&quot; guilds have a bunch of high school whiner kids who play to vent their angers. True jerks, Now explain your aspect on being a &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; guild.<br>What are you views on random PKing?<br>When is it justifyable to PK?<br><br>What kind of benefits do you give to the common member? It seems as if you have a few in power, why would one want to join an evil guild that kills a lot of people? Any incentives?<br><br>Very interesting guild to say the least, I am interested as I've said but I like to know a little bit more about something before i commit to it.<br><br>I'd like to hear from some of your leaders on this and the other questions too.<br><br>Thanks <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#242422><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub9.ezboard.com/uthonatos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Thonatos</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>The Inner Circle </span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#E6E8fA>(6/11/02 8:35:52 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://www.ezboard.com/images/posticons/pi_mad.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: Interested in Dark Genesis</span><hr size=1> Hail,<br>I am Thonatos of the Inner Circle, Well met and perhaps I can offer you some more information, answer some questions perhaps.<br><br>We want numbers, but we are willing to sacrafice quantity for quality for our members. We are on a more mature level then the High School Whiners you speak of, and dont be fooled they are on all teams not just one.<br><br>A little bit of info on Shadowbane here though.. just to maybe open a new wave or chain of thinking.  There are no lands to defend, Except those lands you control, to control lands you must take them over and lay claim to them by building a city.<br>You do not create a charector to defend the rights of elves or the great elven city. Quite simply there is none of either, Unless you create it.<br><br>Evil.. manny guilds will and can be seen as Evil in SB due to thier simple ways of waging war for land. It would be safe to presume that every guild created will have the hopes and dreams of controling an empire, cities and armies to protect them. That is of course the  name of this game.. in a very general overview.<br><br>What do we want in a member ?<br>I think that was stated well in the 1st reply above.<br><br>What does our guild want ?<br>Land. To control and hold the ability to defend those lands. We also wish the strenth to expand our lands. And we shall wage war in doing this.<br><br>Alliances ?<br>Alliances are something it seems the creaters of SB wish us to have. DG will most likely partake in some alliances. What we seek in an alliance thus far is activity and loyalty. We will offer our forces as they will thiers for defence of lands and offensive action against mutual enemies. I do not think DG will have dozens of alliance, It would more then likely be a small number..   our basic outlook is smaller the number the lesser the complications.. the better the friendship an trust.<br><br>PVP.<br>Feel free. Kill.<br>Limitations to this will be imposed over alliances or any treaties we perhaps have setup.<br><br>Harrasment -- is something we are against however. This is a mature atmosphere with some roleplaying and fun for all.<br><br>Lamers -- ..  No need apply..<br><br><br>Those are some general answers to your questions I hope it may help you out some. <br>We are still working hard to ensure the guild is setup and working properly and efficently by the time sb opens public.<br><br>Officers ?  we will have more officers yes, lower level/ranking officers.<br><br>__________________________________<br>What kind of benefits do you give to the common member ?<br>___________________________________<br>The Common Member you  say. It came accross the wrong way to me my friend I am sorry =). <br>Common Members, where would any guild be without them ? they are not just junk to be ordered around. It is the common member that makes the guild..  forms it..  Officers guide itsmovement.. and shape its moldings.  Though Moldings to not tell how strong what it is that is inside them..   The Common Member my friend is our most important part.<br><br>Now, What will we offer  the common member...   <br>#1 - Experienced Leadership. All of your Inner Circle members have either lead guilds or been in leading positions for a long period of time. Experience in politics of gaming, pvp, guild setup, guild structures and of course basic gaming knowledge.<br><br>#2 - Organization.  A guild is something that needs to be structured, in my eyes at least. Organization plays key roles in manny aspects of gaming. How do some guilds function much better in massive combat ?  usually.. better organization.<br>How do some guilds battle great beasts and succeed ?  Not with a chaotic attack plan I will tell you that now.<br><br>#3 - It is on my agenda to bring to the Inner Council a topic that i have yet to bring up. A " Guild Vault ".  ALL members of DG would be able to withdraw and deposite items to this vault for use. A sort of community bank/storage area. Some members would donate items they have no use for or outgrown or bought, others in need could withdraw one or two if need be for use.<br><br>#4 - Common members will have the Honor to bear a crest "Dark Genesis" that will mean something. We will ensure this guild has a reputation that is deserving. Of course our common members will have to work toward this goal as well. <br><br>/shrug<br><br> That is it for now my friend. Please post more questions if you have them.<br>  There is still alot DG is working on behind the scenes. Let it be known we chat/email/post in the inner circle area  DAILY..  Ideas, Issues, Concerns are addressed constantly by all 4 of us.<br><br> We have a couple months to get this all prepared. Plenty of time. <p><p> <font color=red face="comic sans"size=4><i><align="center"><img src=http://members.cox.net/thonatos/Thon.gif><BR>Member of the <B>Inner Circle</B><BR>Dark Genesis -- Shadowbane<BR><BR></font><Font Color = white size=1>Formerly <BR>GM of The Plague of Serpents -- Tallon Zek EQ, GM of The Hunt -- Morgan Le Fay DAoC, Bromen Swordfire GM Smithy -- Great Lakes Server -- UO <BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.showPrevMessage?topicID=241.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.showNextMessage?topicID=241.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=241.topic&index=3><img src=http://www.visceralstudios.com/darkgenesis/images/messageboard/addreply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.emailToFriend?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.threadControl?topicID=241.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=241.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub9.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="darkgenesis75448general">Public General<option value="darkgenesis75448frm7">Dark Genesis Charter and Information Forum<option value="darkgenesis75448frm6">The Inner Circle<option value="darkgenesis75448frm2">Ancient Texts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#E6E8fA>- </font><a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/bdarkgenesis75448>Dark Genesis</a><font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><a href=http://pub9.ezboard.com/fdarkgenesis75448general>Public General</a> <font color=#E6E8fA> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.9.3<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
