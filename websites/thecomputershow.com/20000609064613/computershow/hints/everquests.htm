<LI>

</OL><OL><P><a name="eurdin">Eurdin: The Land of Magic and Mystery</a>
 <LI> In The Paladins Guild:Followers of Light.  Ask Vynon Estaliun ask him about "I desire to face fear" Then say  "I will help catch the Poachers" He will tell you he wants there heads and to look for who is causing the killing.
<LI>Larena Shelyrak Tell her "What Disruptions of the kobold Shaman"she will tell you to bring her 2 paws from the shaman for your reward!Or say "I will slay the Kobold Shaman" This quest takes place in Erudin and the Tox Forest. The first cleric guildmaster on the right wants you to kill a kobold shaman (lvl 5ish mob) and give her its paw.  The reward is a couple of sp/faction/small xp.
<LI>Lumi Stergnon Talk to her about "I am the new acolyte of peace" "I wish to battle the Undead"
<LI>Rarnan Lapice Tell him "I am a new disciple"
<LI>In the Deepwater Paladin's Guild: Dleria Mausrel tell her "I am a new priest"  Then say "I wish to protect the Depths"
<LI>Quweligon Steelherder Tell him "What deepwater tasks"  Then say "What is the peacekeeper battlestaff" he will talk about getting pearls to make a battle staff and you must swim with the sharks. He gives you a pouch to get the pearl and put them in there, I found that the sand sharks have the bags right next to them with pearls and they wont attack unless provoked. Then say "I will collect the pearls".
<LI>Then say to him "What is ocean protection" He speaks of a diseased shark and you must kill it, he gives you a bag after you tell him "I will hunt the diseased shark" He gives you a bag to fill with 3 of her young and her to combine them.
<LI>Laoni Reista speak to her and say  "I am a new Knight"  She says you must clean the ocean of the rouges in Eurdins crossing. Then say "I am ready to assist with the cleansing of the ocean"
<LI>This quest takes place in the Tox Forest. Talk to the female guildmaster (forget her name) in the necro hut.  She wants you to kill Darla Starfire, a level 5ish npc who is supplying the hated Kerrans.  Your reward for turning in her head is a torch.  Another lucrative quest.For Erudites (clerics, paladins, and those who follow prexus or quellious) :
<LI>The peacekeeper staff is a staff useable only by erudite clerics and paladins. The staff does 5 damage and has a delay of 28. The only real advantage of this staff is that it grants +10 charisma when held.  This quest begins at the clerics guild in erudin. If you accept the quest you will be sent to the Tox Forest to search for an NPC. The NPC is in the first hut to the right after you leave the city gates. He will give you a staff and directions on how to continue the quest. Basically you will be required to kill a treant and bring back the treant shards to the NPC. When you do so he will grind them into treant resin and hand them back to you. You know must get the other required item to combine in with the treant resin to create the staff. Go to the vault in erudin(the bank) and talk to the banker on the far left. Tell him you are in need of some vasty deep water. He will tell you that you need a guild coin in order for him to give it to you. Now return to the clerics guild and tell them that this NPC sent you to get a guild coin. You will be given the coin. When you give it to the banker you will receive the vasty deep water in return. Combine the water and the resin in the staff and the end result will be a peacekeeper staff.
<LI>This quest takes place in the Tox Forest at the necromancers hut. Talk to Marzius Denison (I think that's his name) on the right side of the hut.  He will tell you to go kill Rungupp, a fippy-type NPC who runs around yelling that he will kill all erudites.  He's a level 6ish troll shaman.  Your reward for turning his head into the guildmaster is a rusty dagger.
<LI>This quest takes place in Erudin and the Tox Forest. The paladin who stands outside the cleric's guild wants you to kill Poachers (lvl 4 NPCs who have names like Poacher Dell or Poacher Smith) and return their heads to him for 2sp/faction/xp.

</OL><OL><P><a name="felwithe">Felwithe</a>

<LI>Downstairs at the paladin's guild in Felwithe you will find a guildmaster by the name of Lord Jyleel. He has two different quests that he will reward you for. One of the items he wishes to acquire is found on Orc Runners in Butcherblock. The other item will be found on Orc Oracles. The reward will vary in this quest from a minor item all the way up to a high level scroll.

<LI>Lord Jyleel  Say to him "Hail"  And he will talk about the orcs of crushbone he wants the scrolls that the Orc Orcles carry, You can only carry 1 at a time so this may take you awhile. You get money Exp and items,
<LI>Say "Whats the problem with Orc runners" He says to hunt them in Butcherblock between Greater feydark and kaladim. I have seen them but could never catch one they carry a pouch that he wants!
 <LI>In Crushbone is a Dark Elf Ambassador he is a Match for me to kill at 24 alone Beware he hits for 40!  When you kill him get his blackened Heart and return it to him for as I have heard really nice items. The ornate Dagger is a Quest Item as well for rivervale I was told.

<LI>Celsar Vestagnon "What is the marr Minnow"and "I shall eradicate the Pirhrana"The are low level quests I was to high when I found them!
<LI>Hall Of Truth
<LI>This quest originates at the Paladins guild in Freeport. The freeport guards are quite clearly corrupt and the Paladins would like to purge the corrupt element from the city. For every freeport militiamen that you kill you will get a damaged helmet. If you return this helmet to one of the Paladin's in the guild you will receive 1 pp in compensation and a nice faction adjustment.
<LI>Recommended level to complete : 3 and up To start this quest, speak with Theron Rolius, who stands next the paladin guildmaster in the back raised section of the Hall of Truth.  He will tell you to find the Queynos courier and retrieve a message from him.  Make sure to buy two or three bottles of milk before you leave.  You must then travel to the West Commonlands, and find Mojax Hikspin, who will be sitting near a fisherman on the south side of the lake in the zone.   If he is not there, wait for a few minutes and he will arrive.  Say to him that you are from the Hall of Truth, and he will ask for a bottle of milk (yes, there was a reason you got them).  When you give him the milk, another NPC, Duggin Scumber, a level 2-4 monk, will charge up, steal the note from Mojax, and start attacking him.   Kill Duggin Scumber.  It is important that you be the one to kill him, and not Mojax, because Duggin's body has the note, and will disappear if he is killed by Mojax.   When you kill Duggin, take the note from his body, and return to the Temple of Marr in Freeport.  Deliver the note to Eestyana Neastra, on the top floor of the temple, and she will reward you with a little EXP, a good faction adjustment, and a wrist pouch.
<LI>This quest originates in the Freeport Militia House. Upstairs on the balcony you will find Captain Hazran. He will inform you that it is your duty as a citizen to seek out and destroy clan deathfist(an orc clan). Return their deathfist slashed belts to Hazran and you will be rewarded with a money compensation as well as a faction adjustment.
<LI>Monks who begin in freeport are able to complete quests for several different sashes. You must do these in order and each is better than the last. The training(white) sash requires to turn in a snake fang, a bone chip and 2 orc scalps. The white headband grants +1 stamina and +1 charisma. The next headband is a yellow headband and will require you to return the white headband, a giant snake rattle, a deathfist slashed belt and a chitin from a desert taurantula.
<LI>Speak with Celsar Vestagon on the third floor of the Temple of Marr in Freeport.  Ask him about the Marr Minnow, and then about exterminating the pirahna.  He will give you a sack, and ask you to put 4 fresh pirahna in it (not stacked, but 4 individual pirahna). You may get  0-2 fresh pirahna in loot when you kill a pirahna. The pirahna may be found in the lake by the Hall of Truth, just left of the bridge before you cross.  There will be one or two just in the water.  You will have to wait for them to respawn to get 4 pirahna, but it is worth it.  When you have 4 individual pirahna in the sack, hit combine and it will give you the Full sack item. Give the Full sack back to Celsar, and he will give you a potion of Disease
Warding.   This may not seem like much at first, but it sells for about 8 gold, which is a load of change for a level 2 character.  
<LI>This quest takes place in Freeport. You start out going to the rogue guild under the hidden shop (near docks) located  in East Freeport and talk to Nestral TGaza (she is the Dark Elf Rogue next to the entrance to the hidden rogues guild). she asks u to bring a note to Rebby (a halfing rogue) next to the Theater of the Tranquil and Ashen Order in WEst Freeport.

<P>Rivervale is the home of the halflings. This zone exits to Kithicor Forest and Misty Thicket. 
<P>Rivervale is important for two reasons. First and foremost it is the only city on the main continent where you can buy small armor. This is important for visiting gnomes or dwarves who probably don't want to sail all the way home to buy armor. The second reason is that rivervale is more or less in the center of the continent. If you have to be bound to one place(and are not an evil character) this is probably the place to be bound to. Rivervale features many interesting quests.
