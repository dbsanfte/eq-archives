<p>We finally reach that time of year when the plants and trees start dying all on their
own. If only treants would follow suit.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from September 2001</h2>
<h3>September 28, 2001</h3>
<p>Obviously, I haven't been around for a while. Other concerns have taken up my time, and
I have a number of projects that will continue to demand my attention. As a result, I'll need
to change a few of my immediate plans for the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<p>I'll think about the changes over the weekend, and then start putting things into proper
places next week. What I'm currently considering is this:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Removing the Cruel World. It's a nice idea, but I can see it becoming quite
		time-consuming. I'll keep it in mind after everything else is complete.</li>
	<li>Revising Tactics of Terror. I had originally planned on an area detailing how to
		work with each class. I may instead focus on the various tactics available to the
		necromancer, with a few side comments regarding class interaction as applicable.</li>
	<li>Finishing the Trail of Blood. I like where it's going, even if it does take a while
		to put those pages together.</li>
</ul>
<p>So... we'll see. If anyone has other suggestions, feel free to drop on by
<a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">the message board</a> and share.</p>
<p>Now go out and kill a goblin for your Uncle Morty.</p>
<hr>
<h3>September 11, 2001</h3>
<p>There won't be any updates today. My condolences and best wishes go out to those who
have been affected by today's tragedies.</p>
<h3>September 10, 2001</h3>
<p>One of the best places to find all kinds of necromantic information,
<a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/" target="_new">necro.eqclasses.com</a>, seems to
be missing. If you have any information regarding its disappearance, please let us know
in the <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>.</p>
<p>(Nevermind... it's back now.)</p>
<p>I've started the next section in the Trail of Blood, and added a tactic to a previous
step. There were two or three other tiny changes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>September 7, 2001</h3>
<p>No updates today &#150; the freelance necromancer needed to interview. Such is life.</p>
<p>I also spent my evening on my first Fear raid, and it was quite the fun time. I'd like
to thank the fine people in Crimson Legacy for a truly enjoyable experience.</p>
<h3>September 6, 2001</h3>
<p>A lot of the missing pictures have been filled in, now that I've had a chance to visit
Ak'Anon again.</p>
<h3>September 5, 2001</h3>
<p>Very few updates today, mostly in the form of archiving and a picture or two.</p>
<p>Now would be a fine time for you to visit the <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon"
title="Message Board">Words of Darkness</a> and introduce yourself.</p>
