<p>Faithful undead who have proven their worth in the service of necromancy are
posthumously awarded the Tarnished Bone Medal.  In this way, we commemorate our
bony servants and remind ourselves that some people are more useful when they're
dead.</p>

			I certainly wasn't going to do it alone. Zabeker proved himself a most capable
			bodyguard in the face of unexpected dangers.</td>

		<td class=story width="250">It was a long night in the Mines of Nurga, and
			Gebartik couldn't be stopped. He consistently interrupted the goblin
			spellcasters, valiantly chased running burynai, taunted like a fiend, and
			brought goblin pain the likes of which they're still talking about. Some minions
			I hate to leave behind. Gebartik was one of the best.</td>

			valiantly holding off a goblin whipcracker and a goblin slinker
			who foolishly came to assist the bonecharmer I was instructing.
			His efforts and ultimate sacrifice were enough to guarantee a messy
			end to all three goblins.  I look forward to calling him up again.</td>

<h2>A Word of Warning</h2>
<p>It is an omen when you summon Goner.</p>
<p>Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
