<p>What we can do gives us potential, but power is in application. Improperly used, the
sinister forces of the necromancer accomplish nothing.</p>
<p><b>Please note that many of these pages are missing at the moment &#150; I'm looking for
them even now.<b></p>
<h2>How I Did It</h2>
<p>While I certainly can't claim to be the best or the most successful necromancer, I
do believe that I've been around long enough to justify spouting off questionable bits
of wisdom in the hopes that others may be strengthened in their dark deeds.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="tactlist.html">Deadly Methods</a>: There are many approaches to combat
		available to the necromancer. Although some of those approaches are more popular
		than others, all of them are worthy of contemplation.</li>
	<li><a href="classtips.html">A Class Apart</a>: Over the course of time, you will
		undoubtedly find yourself in the company of those who follow different professions.
		If you familiarize yourself with their capabilities, you'll know what to expect
		when you fight together (if things go well) or when they turn on you (if things go
		poorly).</li>
	<li><a href="safetytips.html">Important Safety Tips</a>: When you're fighting, travelling,
		or just visiting a pesky merchant, it's good to keep a few things in mind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Dead Next Door</h2>
<p>Raising the dead is more than just a fun hobby &#150; that smiling, friendly skeleton is
just waiting for the opportunity to lash out in fearful necromantic vengeance. The wise
practitioner of the dark arts will be sure to study the finer points of those undead minions
we call up.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="petstats.html">Autopsy Reports</a>: Detailed examinations of many
		undead remains have revealed the limits and abilities of our minions.</li>
	<li><a href="pettricks.html">Dead Pet Tricks</a>: The necromancer's bony &quot;pet&quot; is
		both loyal and fierce, but it is only as powerful as the mind controlling it. It's
		important to know which commands the walking dead will heed.</li>
	<li><a href="petstats.html">Dominating the Dead</a>: Taking control of naturally
		occurring undead is both rewarding and dangerous, and worthy of special
		consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are undoubtedly many tactics of which I know very little. If you'd care to
share those things with your fellow necromancers, make your mark in the
<a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>.
