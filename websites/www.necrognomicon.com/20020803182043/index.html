<p>The NecroGnomicon is a work in progress. Then again, so is my plan for world
domination, and you can imagine which of the two I consider more important. Updates will
be sporadic until my inevitable rise to supreme power, at which point I'll likely take a
break to fill in the missing pieces.</p>
<h2>Gnomish Grumblings</h2>
<h3>June 21, 2002</h3>
<p>I've updated by <a href="cityfaction.html">faction listing</a> to include the major cities of
Luclin. There have also been a few minor updates of little consequence.</p>
<h3>June 12, 2002</h3>
<p>After all this time, I finally find myself at the 50th rank of power. It's been an
interesting trip, and an enjoyable one.</p>
<p>I'm still working on my Graveyard Tour, and I'm collecting information on Luclin starting
factions before I do too much killing.</p>
<p>Previous grumblings can be <a href="appendix.html">revisited</a> if you've been too busy
killing things to drop by.</p>

<p>Tuesdays past are <a href="appendix.html">available for reminiscence</a>.</p>
<h2>The Gnomish Guide to What's Inside</h2>
<p>Here's what you'll find in the various chapters of the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Index</a>: You're looking at it now. I really
		hope you already knew that. If you didn't, you may mock yourself and
		proceed.</li>
	<li><a href="notes.html">Morty's Notes</a>: This is where I put all of the
		odds and ends which amuse me but don't really fit anywhere else, such as
		basic introductions, the latest gnomish fashions, and personal stories</li>
	<li><a href="necros.html">About Necromancers</a>: Here you'll find the gory
		details concerning the skills that a Necromancer acquires, racial
		distinctions among Necromancers, and the gods that make it all happen.
		You'll also find a lot of numbers to satisfy that gnomish mathematical itch,
		but don't worry &#150; I've tucked them away so that the lesser races can avoid the
		trouble of trying to comprehend such matters and having their heads explode.</li>
	<li><a href="tactics.html">Tactics of Terror</a>: An overview of hunting techniques and
		safety tips is provided for your pleasure, along with some of the finer points of
		controlling your undead minions.
		<b>Scheduled for Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="trail.html">A Trail of Blood</a>: Follow the progress of the Necromancer
		as the level of their power increases, with comments about spells and pets. A few
		additional words about hunting styles and my own killing grounds are included.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="world.html">The Cruel World</a>: There are places in the world worthy of
		particular attention. I'll note those, and make occasional comments. If you're wondering
		where I am at the moment, that's here too.</li>
	<li><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>: Join the
		conversation on the message board with general necromantic chit-chat, tales of woe and
		envy, and feedback regarding the NecroGnomicon. Whining is poorly tolerated &#150; there's
		enough of that elsewhere.</li>
	<li><a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>: Archives and links to other sites of interest are
		all stuffed here. It's fit to burst.</li>
</ul>
