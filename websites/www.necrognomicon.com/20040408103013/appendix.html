<p>Past information and references to other places are here for your perusal. Since the past
is gone and other places have fewer gnomes, it's really not very interesting. Shouldn't you
be doing something else? The current information is on the <a href="index.html">front page</a>.
Move along, nothing to see here.</p>

<h2>Previous Grumblings</h2>
<p>If you weren't paying attention to me, this is what you missed. Where were you? Huh? When
I was your age, we respected our elders and listened to every word. Every word! And then we'd
write them down. In stone. With chisels. We hadn't earned our hammers yet, so we had to pound
with our bare hands. Yes, we had to earn our hammers in those days, you couldn't just buy one
from some drunken dwarf merchant.</p>

<h2>Past Tuesdays</h2>
<p>Even if we could find a drunken dwarf merchant! We had to go all over the place back then
just for basic needs, not because we didn't have everything we needed there in Ak'Anon, oh no,
we had it all. We had to show that we deserved it, that's what I'm saying. Sitting around at
home you get nothing, that's how it was, you have to head out and prove you're more valuable
than a cabbage if you want the good stuff. And we got the best of the good stuff, let me tell
you. Yep.</p>

<h2>Closing the Book</h2>
<p>Hey, where are you going? You there! You head off now, you're likely to miss something.
Probably going to one of those other sites they tell me about. Well, bah! Maybe you'd better
put that sinister grimoire down before somebody gets hurt.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://necro.eqclasses.com/" target="_new">Necro.EQClasses.com</a>: Probably
		the most popular necromantic hideout around, with a great deal of information and
		an active message board community. Formerly EQNecro. Gnomes will have to contend
		with the lesser races there, but it's a small price to pay.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eqportal.com/tinkering/" target="_new">The Tinkering Compendium</a>:
		Everything a tinker would need to know is right here, and it's under new
		management as well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/" target="_new">Casters Realm</a>: The prime
		information site for spellcasters and, well, everybody else. You'll find up-to-date
		news, active forums, and a place to keep track of what you've got.</li>
	<li><a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/" target="_new">AllaKhazam's Magical Realm</a>:
		A central clearing house for every kind of information, including an extensive
		bestiary and very current equipment lists.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ancientguardians.com/" target="_new">Ancient Guardians</a>: The
		guild of which I'm a member.</li>
</ul>

<p>You listening to me? Huh? That's what I'm saying. That's right. That's right.</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Mr. Undercrypt's disjointed ramblings made it necessary
to construct a list of <a href="sitemap.html">the Pages of the NecroGnomicon</a> to
facilitate the translation process. &#150; B]</p>
