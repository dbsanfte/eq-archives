<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: This book came into my possession following the
extended disappearance and presumed demise of one Morty Undercrypt, a necromancer
of some standing amongst the Dark Reflection. While I have translated its
forbidding contents for
<a href="http://www.necrognomicon.com/darkage/">the people of my own realm</a>,
I have also put some effort into straightening out the original text.</p>

<p class=trans>Mr. Undercrypt lives on in Spirit (and I mean that in the
most literal sense possible). Should he once again return to the Sunlit Lands,
further updates may occur. &#150; Bifrons Shroudweaver]</p>

<h2>Bifrons' Notations</h2>

<h3>March 31, 2004</h3>

<p class=trans>In Mr. Undercrypt's physical absence, I have compiled a listing of
<a href="sitemap.html">the Pages of the NecroGnomicon</a> to assist in
my ongoing translation efforts.</p>

<p class=trans>I have also assembled what Facts are available <a href="demise.html">Regarding
the unfortunate Demise of the late Mr. Undercrypt</a>.</p>

<p class=trans>The complete travelogue of Mr. Undercrypt's wanderings may now be
viewed for those who might wish to
<a href="bloodytrail.html">Follow the Bloody Trail</a>.</p>

<p class=trans>In areas where it seemed warranted, I have inserted Marginal
comments in the hopes of illuminating particularly Outdated material where
it might be a concern.</p>

<h2>The Gnomish Guide to What's Inside</h2>
<p>Here's what you'll find in the various chapters of the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Index</a>: You're looking at it now. I really
		hope you already knew that. If you didn't, you may mock yourself and
		proceed.</li>
	<li><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>: Join
		the conversation on the message board with general necromantic chit-chat,
		tales of woe and envy, and feedback regarding the NecroGnomicon.</li>
	<li><a href="notes.html">Morty's Notes</a>: This is where I put all of the
		odds and ends which amuse me but don't really fit anywhere else, such as
		basic introductions, the latest gnomish fashions, and personal stories.</li>
	<li><a href="necros.html">About Necromancers</a>: Here you'll find the gory
		details concerning the skills that a Necromancer acquires, racial
		distinctions among Necromancers, and the gods that make it all happen.
		You'll also find a lot of numbers to satisfy that gnomish mathematical itch,
		but don't worry &#150; I've tucked them away so that the lesser races can avoid the
		trouble of trying to comprehend such matters and having their heads explode.</li>
	<li><a href="tactics.html">Tactics of Terror</a>: An overview of hunting techniques and
		safety tips is provided for your pleasure, along with some of the finer points
		regarding your undead minions.</li>
	<li><a href="trail.html">A Trail of Blood</a>: Follow the progress of the Necromancer
		as the level of their power increases, with comments about spells and pets. A few
		additional words about hunting styles and my own killing grounds are included.</li>
	<li><a href="world.html">The Cruel World</a>: There are places in the world worthy of
		particular attention. I'll note those, and make occasional comments. If you're
		wondering where I am at the moment, that's here too.</li>
	<li><a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>: Archives and links to other sites of
		interest are all stuffed here. It's fit to burst.</li>
</ul>

may also want to <a href="disclaimer.html">read the disclaimer</a> at some point.</p>
<p>Give me necromancy or give me death!</p>
