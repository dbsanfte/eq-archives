<p>Necromancers are capable of far, far more than raising the dead. Likewise, it takes
more than a Book of Dark Bindings and a black robe to master the forbidden circle of magic.
Who are the necromancers, then, and what do they do? I'm glad you asked.</p>

<h2>Who are the Necromancers?</h2>
<p>Tales of necromancers tend to follow a common theme: Master of the Undead performs
some wicked deeds, Heroic Person sets out to thwart these deeds, Master of the Undead
is either (variation 1) defeated by the Heroic Person or (variation 2) consumed by
the very same dark powers that were invoked in the first place.</p>
<p>While this sort of thing does tend to happen fairly often, stories like this provide
very little insight for those who may be considering a satisfying career path in the black
arts. For the apprentice necromancers and those who wish to understand them, I have compiled
some information which may be useful.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="sacrifice.html">Incredible Necromantic Power</a>: For anyone considering
		a journey on the road of darkness, it is worth noting that there are both great
		advantages and great disadvantages to be found along the way.</li>
	<li><a href="qualities.html">Qualifications</a>: Despite the near-universal appeal
		of raising an army of the undead to march across the face of Norrath and beat the
		cities of the weak into submission, only a few individuals have the characteristics
		necessary to reap the grim harvest.</li>
	<li><a href="races.html">Racial Features</a>: With necromancy being the supreme form
		of magic that it is, it should come as no surprise that only the most gifted races
		are capable of grasping its power.</li>
	<li><a href="thegods.html">The Gods</a>: Necromantic rituals must call upon powers of
		darkness if they are to success.</li>
</ul>

<h2>And What Do They Do?</h2>
<p>The skills of the necromancer can be organized into five significant areas of involvement:
physical combat, magical ability, adventuring, trades, and languages. Obviously, some
of these skills are more important than others. An efficient necromancer can concentrate
almost entirely on mystical skills, but a well-rounded skill set has a certain style.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="skills1.html">Spilling Blood</a>: The combat skills of the necromancer are
		not particularly impressive, but never underestimate the potential of a well-placed
		dagger.</li>
	<li><a href="skills2.html">Calling the Powers</a>: Necromancy relies on the near-constant
		use of magical skills. Study is essential for mastery.</li>
	<li><a href="skills3.html">Surviving in the Wild</a>: Combat and dark rituals are all
		well and good, but there are a number of other miscellaneous abilities that the
		adventurous gnome will appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href="skills4.html">Crafting a Trade</a>: The necromancer need not spend every moment
		in life-or-death situations. There are many other worthwhile pursuits &#150; hobbies,
		if you wish &#150; which some find appealing.</li>
	<li><a href="skills5.html">Speaking in Tongues</a>: Although the Common Tongue is well
		known across the entirety of Norrath, cultures both living and dead have used their own
		specialized languages.</li>
</ul>
