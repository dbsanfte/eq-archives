<p>When tales are told of the necromancer, the brooding figure in the legend is
almost always an ancient evil well-versed in the dark arts. The untold tale is
the long and sometimes painful path which leads to such unspeakable horrific power.</p>

<h2>The Long and Winding Road</h2>
<p>The necromancer's growth, like that of most spellcasters, is highlighted by the
acquistion of better and more efficient magics. Every time a level of power is attained
which is marked by new spells, another chapter in the necromancer's life begins &#150; more
tactics are available, different styles become apparent, and a greater portion of the world
can be put under the dark influence of undeath.</p>
<p>Reflecting this fact, each of these periods in the necromancer's life is outlined here.
The recently acquired spells are summarized, new tactics are presented, and a few choice
hunting spots are mentioned. I also present my own journals from that period of my life.</p>
<p>As I am not yet a Warlock, many of the later chapters are a bit sketchy.</p>

<p>The remaining steps in the path are currently being scribed.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Whether or not the remaining steps were ever scribed,
regarding which there is some Doubt, these summaries end here. Either Mr. Undercrypt
never completed his notes, or they have been somehow removed; the violently incomplete
state of the last page may suggest the latter. It may be of interest to some that his
<a href="bloodytrail.html">private Travelogue</a> continues far beyond that which is
contained above. &#150; B]</p>

<p>I do attempt to keep the information presented here fairly up-to-date. If you happen
across something which is missing, no longer complete, or just plain wrong, please feel
free to provide correct information so I can change things accordingly.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Unfortunately, Mr. Undercrypt does not currently have
the physical presence necessary to make changes, and so is not accepting updated information
at this time. &#150; B]</p>
