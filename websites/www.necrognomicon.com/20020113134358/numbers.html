<p>In the long-standing gnomish tradition of measuring things, I took it upon myself to
analyze a representative population of necromancers.  By using a numeric &quot;point&quot;
system for several individual characteristics, comparisons between various races were
possible.</p>

<h2>Cut-Offs and Other Lost Appendages</h2>
<p>After sending out a lot of party invitations and subsequently performing a great many
autopsies, I was able to establish a &quot;points&quot; value in each individual's
characteristics.  A pattern emerged where significant differences were noticeable at
certain values.  Careful observation of still-living test subjects confirmed this pattern.</p>
<p>The first &quot;magic&quot; value in this scale was 75.  If any given characteristic was
determined to be less than 75, the individual was working under a relative disadvantage.
This was particularly noticeable in Agility, where less than 75 &quot;points&quot; indicated a
significant decrease in the effectiveness of armor.  This effect could be seen in other
characteristics as well, although the effects were more subtle.</p>
<p>Additionally, a rating of 100 or more marked an exceptional ability.  With at least 100
points of Stamina, complete fatigue did not lead to slower attacks as it did in those with
less Stamina.  Sorely injured individuals with 100 or more Agility were able to run
at a regular pace while the less agile were moving slower. (For a while, anyway &#150; these
benefits diminished greatly as the subject got closer and closer to death.  At the point
of death, all movement ceased.)</p>
<p>Beyond the 100 point mark, significant improvements may have been noticeable at 25 point
increments, leading to marked benefits at 125, 150, and so on.  Unfortunately, I didn't have
enough test subjects within those ranges to come to any meaningful conclusions &#150; I'll
need to send more invitations next time.</p>
<p>Those who arrived for my party with magical enhancements had some characteristics
at truly remarkable levels.  I found out, though, that achieving a rating greater than 255
exceeded the abilities of the mortal frame and conferred no additional benefit, setting 255
as a functional maximum on the scale.  In the case of Intelligence and Wisdom, ratings
greater than 200 seemed to have little real advantage, particularly regarding the amount
of mana that could be contained.</p>
<p>Some necromancers, in their use of powerful magical tools, had decreased their Charisma
to seemingly negative numbers on this scale.  This showed no demonstrable effect outside
of scaring merchants, but I intend to do a more detailed study on this particular situation
in the future.</p>

<h2>Playing by the Numbers</h2>
<p>More detailed examinations made it quite clear that necromancers of the various races
have certain minimum characteristics.</p>

<p>These minimum characteristics, however, rarely showed themselves in this way.
In nearly all of the specimens studied, intelligence was rated significantly higher
(25 points higher in most of them).  Other characteristics tended to be elevated in
areas with a particular racial weakness.</p>

<p>With a little prodding and some less-invasive testing, I was able to determine
my own ratings on this scale.  Not surprisingly, I was noticeably off the norm.<p>

		<td width=40>67</td>
		<td width=40>133</td>
		<td width=40>60</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>It should be noted that while this experiment showed my Intelligence as less than
typical, <i>I</i> was the one holding the surgical saw while my &quot;brighter&quot;
peers were scattered throughout the room in well-marked containers.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>A higher point value in any characteristic confers some advantage, which is particularly
noticeable at cut-off points.  For many characteristics, however, the advantage gained
is relatively small.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, increases to Intelligence make the greatest impact on the performance
of the necromancer until the 200 point mark is reached.  At that point, more benefit is
achieved by increasing other characteristics to cut-off points, especially those below
the 75 point mark.  Other increases are fairly superficial on an individual basis, with
the single exception of increasing Strength for the purpose of carrying greater weights
without penalty.</p>
