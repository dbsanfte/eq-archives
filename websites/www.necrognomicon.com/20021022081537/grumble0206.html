<p>Getting back into step with the living inhabitants of Norrath is a challenge at times,
but well worth the effort.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from June 2002</h2>
<h3>June 21, 2002</h3>
<p>I've updated by <a href="cityfaction.html">faction listing</a> to include the major cities of
Luclin. There have also been a few minor updates of little consequence.</p>
<h3>June 12, 2002</h3>
<p>After all this time, I finally find myself at the 50th rank of power. It's been an
interesting trip, and an enjoyable one.</p>
<p>I'm still working on my Graveyard Tour, and I'm collecting information on Luclin starting
factions before I do too much killing.</p>
<hr>
<h3>June 7, 2002</h3>
<p>Just a few minor things today, mostly updating information that had changed over
the past few months.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">message board</a> is now an EZBoard
Gold Community with faster loading and no ads. I'm pretty pleased with it.</p>
<p>I also put together a
<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=247832" target="_new">Magelo</a> profile,
if anyone cares about what I'm wearing.</a>
<h3>June 5, 2002</h3>
<p>Like most other necromancers, I'm trying to figure out how to work the newly-revealed
caster focus items to my advantage. A few of them look particularly nice. When I have
enough information, I'll set up a separate section for them in my notes.</p>
<p>I'm also collecting information for my upcoming Graveyard Tour &#150; if you know of a
good graveyard or tomb (as opposed to a place simply frequented by the undead), pay a visit to
the <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a> and let me know.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Words, I put a wrench in my coinpurse and made it a Gold Community. No more
pop-up ads as soon as they determine my money is good.</p>
<p>People have been responding favorably to my <a href="firepots.html">Firepots Guide</a>,
which makes it all worthwhile. Glad to be of service to my necromantic associates.</p>
<p>NecroGnomicon t-shirts and miscellaneous other small items are currently being designed,
including at least one general &quot;necromancer&quot; design. When they're completed, I'll
be certain to make a large announcement.</p>
<p>My faithful pet Lebarn is the most recent recipient of the <a href="bonemedal.html">Tarnished
Bone Medal</a>. Among other things, he helped me acquire another level of power. Ahhh...</p>
