<p>A tip of the Silk Lined Steel Helm goes to Gnomad, who originally collected much
of the information here and kept interest going through some painful stages of
tinkering. Those who remember the multiple failures trying to recreate the Collapsible
Fishing Pole will know what I mean. He will be remembered fondly.</p>
<p>Further honors go to Fulcrum, who compiled the original <a href="http://www.tinkering.org/"
target="_new">Tinkering Compendium</a>. The Compendium rivals the very Journals themselves
when it comes to useful knowledge, and I have unashamedly stolen some of this information
directly from there.</p>

<h2>Tinkered Goods</h2>
<p>These items represent the standard selection of tinkered goods, and can be assembled
in any toolbox. The necessary components are easily available in the vicinity of
Ak'Anon, with the exception of those items available from your local smith or potter. If a
component is listed more than once, more than one is required. The costs mentioned are based
on a gnome with typical charisma and an indifferent relationship to the vendors, added up for
all of the components and rounded up to the nearest coin; your prices may vary.</p>
<p>Tinker wisely, for attempting something far beyond your current level of skill will result
in losing great gobs of platinum. This listing is roughly in the order of difficulty, as best
we know.</p>

<h2>Velious Tinkering</h2>
<p>The Pirates of Iceclad have providing us with a few more odds and ends.  Their
most significant contribution, however, is revealing the ancient secrets of
<a href="watchman.html">Watchman armor</a>.</p>
<p>These items can only be assembled in the Deluxe Toolbox, and the necessary components are
mostly available from the pirates themselves. Costs are approximate.</p>

<p>The astute gnome will notice that very few of these items offer much to the necromancer.
This may change in the future as tinkering advances; do not be discouraged. Tinkering is
a worthy pursuit for any gnome.</p>

<p>If you can help narrow down some of the less-than-exact trivial points, feel free to
<a href="mailto:morty@necrognomicon.com">let me know</a> and I'll make the appropriate
changes.</p>
