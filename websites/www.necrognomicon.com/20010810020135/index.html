<p>If you're looking at this now, you've stumbled upon a work in progress.
Good for you!  You've got a healthy dose of gnomish curiosity.  Unfortunately,
I have to kill you because of what you've seen.  I'm sure you understand.</p>
<p>You probably should have headed to the <a href="http://www.mentalviruses.com/morty"
title="The Real NecroGnomicon">old version</a> until this one was finished.  Oh
well, too late now. Call yourself Kabober.</p>
<h2>Daily Grumblings</h2>
<h3>August 9, 2001</h3>
<p>The Languages page is done (finally!), and more pages were converted from the old
version.</p>
<p>Next on my list is the Baking recipes, then on to Tactics.</p>
<h3>August 8, 2001</h3>
<p>I got a large chunk of the Languages page done &#150; you don't realize how many of them
there are until you go looking for reasons to learn them. I also provided more information
in the Research area regarding the four necromantic research books.</p>
<h3>August 7, 2001</h3>
<p>Today brought a new Tuesday, a couple of changes that aren't terribly visible, and some
research on the EZ Board and how to pay for it.</p>
<p>I've also made a submission to the Developer's Corner detailing the continuing problems
with keeping our pets alive in combat. Based on the recent comments there regarding the
new resistance the Kael giants have to being charmed, it seems that our problems are being
addressed in approximately a week.</p>
<h3>August 6, 2001</h3>
<p>In a burst of rearrangement, I added the Appendix. Many things are clearer now. I also
updated a few pages here and there, reorganized my Notes page, and added in some of the
stories from the old site. If I feel creative later, I'll finish the Languages page, but
more likely that'll be tomorrow.</p>
<p>Previous grumblings can be <a href="appendix.html">revisited</a> if you've been too busy
killing things to drop by.</p>

<p>Tuesdays past are <a href="appendix.html">available for reminiscence</a>.</p>
<h2>The Gnomish Guide to What's Inside</h2>
<p>Here's what you'll find in the various chapters of the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Index</a>: You're looking at it now. I really
		hope you already knew that. If you didn't, you may mock yourself and
		proceed.</li>
	<li><a href="notes.html">Morty's Notes</a>: This is where I put all of the
		odds and ends which amuse me but don't really fit anywhere else, such as
		basic introductions, the latest gnomish fashions, and personal stories</li>
	<li><a href="necros.html">About Necromancers</a>: Here you'll find the gory
		details concerning the skills that a Necromancer acquires, racial
		distinctions among Necromancers, and the gods that make it all happen.
		You'll also find a lot of numbers to satisfy that gnomish mathematical itch,
		but don't worry &#150; I've tucked them away so that the lesser races can avoid the
		trouble of trying to comprehend such matters and having their heads explode.</li>
	<li><a href="tactics.html">Tactics of Terror</a>: An overview of hunting techniques and
		safety tips is provided for your pleasure, along with some of the finer points of
		controlling your undead minions. I've also added some comments about what to do
		when you find yourself in a group of people who follow other, less interesting
		professions.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="trail.html">A Trail of Blood</a>: Follow the progress of the Necromancer
		as the level of their power increases, with comments about spells and pets. A few
		additional words about hunting styles and my own killing grounds are included.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="world.html">The Cruel World</a>: Like many gnomes, I travel quite a bit.
		Here are the notes on what I've found, conveniently sorted by continent and location.
		If you're wondering where I am at the moment, that's here too.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>: Join the
		conversation on the message board with general necromantic chit-chat, tales of woe and
		envy, and feedback regarding the NecroGnomicon. Whining is poorly tolerated &#150; there's
		enough of that elsewhere.</li>
	<li><a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>: Archives and links to other sites of interest are
		all stuffed here. It's fit to burst.</li>
</ul>
