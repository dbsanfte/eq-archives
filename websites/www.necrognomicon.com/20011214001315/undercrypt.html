<h2>The Rise and Fall of Ak'Anon</h2>

		<td class=story width="250">Quite a long time ago, even as gnomes measure years,
			the city we know as Ak'Anon was a very different place. (It had a different
			name as well, but what that name was has been ruthlessly wiped from the
			histories.) You see, the King of the Gnomes was a necromancer.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">How and why that king fell is a tale that I'll leave
			to a bard; I could do no justice to it. Suffice it to say that the Eldritch
			Collective placed Horatio Ak'Anon on the throne, and then began their
			&quot;cleansing&quot; of the remaining followers of Bertoxxulous.</td>

			alt="The beginning of the Dark Reflection."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">The weak died, as is their wont. The strong found that
			the long-abandoned Mines of Malfunction proved to be deep enough for safety
			and easily defended. With an invocation of the fallen king's soul and a sacrifice
			to the Plaguebringer, a new coalition was formed &#150; a Dark Reflection of the
			power that once ruled the city.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">Take a walk through Ak'Anon. Look carefully and you'll see
			traces, here and there, of the way things were. The circle of necromancy and
			summoning room in the basement of the palace. The torture chamber. The former guild
			hall of the necromancers, intact despite the attempts of the Eldritch Collective to
			destroy it and now hidden by illusion. This is the true history that goes unspoken.</td>

	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">When the time is right, the Dark Reflection will display
			the power that they have gathered over the years. Those who fell in the name of
			Bertoxxulous shall rise again, stronger in death than in life. Those who died by
			the Dark Reflection's blades shall rise again to join us, wiser in death than in
			life.</td>
