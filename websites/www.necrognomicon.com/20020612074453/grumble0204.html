<p>After spending the last few months delving into the more arcane aspects of necromancy (and
subsequently locked up in a series of tombs and laboratories), I returned to continue my
sporadic commentary.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from April 2002</h2>
<h3>April 25, 2002</h3>
<p>I've spent some time talking shop with a few other necromancers, and apparently some
folks on the moon have taken necromantic research into new directions. No doubt I'll have
to find them and beat them senseless. Or at least talk to them and see what they know,
depending on how friendly they are.</p>
<p>Necromancers on the moon. Who would've thought?</p>
<p>I did a small update to the <a href="cityfaction.html">faction listings</a> thanks to
some feedback, and I'm currently sorting through my information on the Combine firepots
to get something presentable together. Look for it soon.</p>
<h3>April 22, 2002</h3>
<p>Failure is annoying. All this time, all of the rituals, and I'm <b>still</b> bound to my
body, and I <b>still</b> don't control the world. Bah. Guess I'll have to get back to the
killing and slaughter while I figure out what went wrong.</p>
<p>Probably the fault of some elf. I'm sure of it. Stupid elves.</p>
