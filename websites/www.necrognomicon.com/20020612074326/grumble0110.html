<p>It's a busy time of the year for necromancers.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from October 2001</h2>
<h3>October 31, 2001</h3>
<p>I've got a little poem that I put together for this lovely holiday, and I'd like to share it
with you. Unfortunately, I can't find it now, so I can't &#150; I may have left my only copy in
my previous crypt. If by some weird chance you've got a copy of my &quot;Eve of All Hallows&quot;
lying about, do me a great favor and <a href="mailto:morty@necrognomicon.com">send me a copy</a>,
would you? Thanks.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween all, and to all a good fright!</p>
<hr>
<h3>October 22, 2001</h3>
<p>Never again will I underestimate the importance of the Flameless Lantern. Who would
have thought that a case of gnomish spirits and a torch could do so much damage?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I've put all of the pieces back together, and managed to add an update.
My summary of the <a href="pettricks.html">Dead Pet Tricks</a> is now available. I've also
received a few helpful updates regarding some of <a href="petstats.html">pet statistics</a>,
which I've incorporated into the table &#150; thanks for the information!</p>
<hr>
<h3>October 11, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm still putting all of my pieces together, so don't expect much in the way of
updates today. I really ought to get better at this tinkering business...</p>
<h3>October 10, 2001</h3>
<p>A much better front page for the Cruel World is now in place. Like the Tactics of
Terror, much of it remains incomplete. I'll get to work filling that in when I've
finished the Trail of Blood.</p>
<p>In addition, I think that I've finally fixed all of the broken picture links. If you
run across a picture that's not there, drop by <a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">the
Words of Darkness</a> and let me know.</p>
<p>That's all for today &#150; I'll be tinkering with my new black box for the rest of the day.
Upgrades are a wonderful thing.</p>
<h3>October 9, 2001</h3>
<p>Even though I'm far from complete, I've compiled my personal experience with the
<a href="scythe.html">necromancer epic quest</a> in my Notes. There's also a new
Tuesday, and the front page for the Tactics of Terror has been put into place (although
there's still no real information there just yet).
<p>Not a bad day, all in all. I should go kill something to round out the evening.</p>
<h3>October 8, 2001</h3>
<p>I've had a few comments on the missing <a href="petstats.html">pet statistics</a> page,
so I've finally put that together. I'm currently working on a detailed account of the
necromancer &quot;epic&quot; <s>quack</s> quest, or at least as far as I've gotten through it
at any rate.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I'll spruce up the current placeholder pages for the Cruel World and the Tactics of
Terror a bit. That's what I'm telling myself, at least.</p>
<hr>
<h3>October 4, 2001</h3>
<p>I've thought about the changes that I'll need to make due to my changing schedule.
Here's what to expect...</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Cruel World will not, as I originally intended, cover the entire world. I'll
		keep notes on specific areas of interest, like graveyards and good fishing spots.
		From there, I'll add to it as amuses me.</li>
	<li>Tactics of Terror will focus on the necromancer's tactics alone, without much to say
		about class interaction. That may change someday if I get particularly inspired, or once
		everything else is complete.</li>
	<li>The Trail of Blood will continue as best as I can supply the time, and will eventually
		be completed in its current form.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the plan. If you don't like it, consider sending me a bribe.</p>
