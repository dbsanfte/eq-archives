<p>It's always a pleasure when others join me in my ongoing killing spree.  Over the
course of time, I've made many interesting friends.  Some of them I still see now and
again, while others have either sought adventure in more challenging lands or faded into
memory.  I'm sure we'll meet again &#150; but this is a common belief among necromancers.</p>

		<td class=story width="250">Roserot Swampflower, a powerful shaman among her people,
			brings her &quot;swamp mojo&quot; far and wide.  She's fun to be around,
			and she has her own theme song.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">Slithermoss, Roserot's younger sister, isn't really
			what I'd call a &quot;fun&quot; troll, but she's definitely powerful for
			her age and is already garnering some attention from the guild leaders at
			Night Keep.  I look forward to seeing her on a rampage as she continues her
			necromantic studies.</td>

		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/amelia.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Amelia"></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Amelia Brightblade, wizard extraordinaire and
			purveyor of fine baked goods.  Travel with Amelia is never dull; I'll
			attempt further explorations with her after I master a few more
			rituals of darkness.</td>

		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/bogroot.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Bogroot puts down Da Smack"></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Bogroot is my primary supplier of smithed goods.  Why?
			&quot;Trollstuff no break.&quot;  He's also a powerful shaman in his own
			right, spreading the Fear of Cazic-Thule throughout the world.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">Leanann Sidhe, an enchantress of high elven origin, can
			often pick up various supplies in places where I'm less than welcome.  Her
			&quot;Love is stronger than Death&quot; tirades are occasionally amusing.  She
			spends most of her time with Roserot.</td>

			alt="Athravan abd-Ahura"></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Athravan, despite his claims of agnosticism, is really
			a closet follower of Solusek Ro.  Even though he's just starting to come into his
			own as a magician, his summonings are occasionally quite useful.</td>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Legend reports that Roserot Swampflower remains
to this day in a shamanic trance, secluded within a Nameless swamp, while Bogroot
remains always near to protect her. It is unknown whether any Other of these souls
yet remain in the lands of the living. &#150; B]</p>
