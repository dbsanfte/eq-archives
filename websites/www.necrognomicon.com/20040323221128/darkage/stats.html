it may be the case that we Turn our faces in pitying veils of sadness upon
such unfortunates as choose other professions, we must admit to ourselves that very few
of those poor souls would wield the dark powers with success, seeing as they lack those
personal qualities necessary in such a Challenging task.</p>

<p>In considering this seemingly cruel fate, it is good to be mindful of the manner in
which necromancers are wont to operate, to wit:</p>

<h2>They are known for Intelligence and Dexterity but rely upon others for Strength.</h2>

<p>To emphasize this matter, let us consider personal traits Each in their turn, with
some regard to whether these may be Natural to the necromancer or gained through
external means. Let us also consider how these traits may, or may not, be reflected
in the Minions to be found at the necromancer's side.</p>

<h3>Concerning those Traits Inherent to the Necromancer</h3>

<p>Those elements least worthy of our time we examine first. Piety, Empathy, and
Charisma, while each fine Qualities in their turn, are of little concern to the
necromancer. Arawn's power is achieved through Study, not mere Faith, thus the
pious have no advantage; this power is of a Higher order than the natural realm and
so requires no empathic understanding of nature; the power is unleashed with
the proper discipline and concentration, regardless of the Personality of the wielder.
This being now made plain, no more word of these traits is required here or elsewhere.</p>

</table>

<p>What is it, then, which acts as the master Key, unlocking the secrets of study,
higher power, discipline, and concentration? It is none other than raw Intelligence
that determines the extent of the necromancer's Power, none other than this which
allows for a greater focusing of the spirit Energies to inflict a deeper wounding.</p>

<p>Yes, intelligence is the greatest need, but it is said (and truly) that intellect
without action is impotence; reflecting this, channeling the spirit to the material world
is aided by certain Arcane gestures. These gestures, while simple, require Dexterity
to perform with the speed required on the battlefield, and so those necromancers
expecting to find themselves in dangerous situations often spend at least some Effort
in maintaining and improving themselves in this area as well. While it is true that
such effort also improves the necromancer's prowess when wielding a staff in
m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, this is so rarely a wise or necessary option that it is only
a curiosity.</p>

<p>As for the remaining qualities of the physical form, they may be considered
insignificant but yet are worthy of some Small comment regarding their influence;
even though the necromancer's shade is insubstantial, it is not entirely incorporeal,
and so such qualities do from time to time sway events. Thus, just as with anyone,
the Strength of the necromancer determines how much weight can be carried before
encumbrance slows down movement; the Constitution determines health and the capacity
to endure harm, although this is rarely tested given the shade's inherent immunity
to most physical and magical attacks; Quickness reflects the speed with which an
embodied necromancer may strike an enemy with a staff, should that rare occurrence
come to pass. As it is common that These qualities are rarely developed in one
of Arawn's chosen, the wise necromancer is encouraged to find others to whom these
areas are those of excellence, and endeavor to obtain their services such as they are
needed and in so doing enact the will of Arawn through even these unlikely servants.</p>

<p>It has been duly noted <a href="races.html">elsewhere</a> how history and
racial memory have afforded peoples an ability to ward off or otherwise ignore
small injuries of certain types both physical and magical, and while any such
ability is a Welcome gift, it is of little importance to the dark conjuror since the
insubstantial shade is unaffected by these sorts of injuries.</p>

<p>Note well that in the Summoning of an undead minion, when the summoner's body is
held ransom to the unliving flesh, all of these base qualities of the necromancer's
form are inconsequential and in no way alter the summoned being. It is true that
the magic channeled through the deathly servant does reflect the master's
Intelligence, but this is solely due to the nature of the spells employed and it
should in no way be suspected that the servant has any Intelligence
of its own. (Experience in necromancy will serve to reinforce the truth of this.)</p>

<h3>Concerning the Benefits of Mystical Enhancement</h3>

<p>As the necromancer progresses in power and arcane learning, it will become
Apparent that the spiritual energies which are so efficacious in destruction
can also be manipulated to enhance and enstrengthen. For the Disciple of Arawn,
this takes the form of improving the physical abilities of the summoned minion
and lessening wounds inflicted upon allies; certain members of Albion's church
have likewise learned manners in which the body and mind may be honed, and even
elementalists have learned a trick or two with regard to Bolstering a defender's
effectiveness in battle.</p>

<p>So we find that these same Traits which we considered inherent to the
necromancer may be improved upon, allowing greater ability as one might expect
(such that a necromancer with magically boosted Strength is able to comfortably
carry a heavier burden, enhanced Constitution allows for survival of greater injury,
and so forth).</p>

<p>It is a curiosity of note &#150; and to the necromancer a matter of some keen
importance &#150; that when these beneficient magics are applied to the walking
dead, the effects are not always identical as when applied to the living. Boosted
Strength, for example, heightens the minion's abilities in combat (and that alone,
since we do not use one of Arawn's servants for the menial task of toting burdens
as if it were some horrific undead donkey from beyond the grave). Boosted
Constitution, rather than improving the servant's health, reduces the depth of
physical wounds.</p>

<p>Naturally, the summoned minion will only reap the benefit of those enchantments
which are bound Directly to it; any such magics as may be empowering the necromancer
are not extended to the servant (although, as always, the power of the master's
spells is fully channeled, even if that power is amplified).</p>

<p>The detail of such magics as are Known may be perused in this abbreviated
compendium:</p>

<p>Although obvious to those who have walked the Path for many years, and as
any amount of Thought will logically deduce, it is commented for completeness'
sake that enemy magics Detrimental have an effect opposite of those magics
Beneficial.</p>

<h3>Concerning the Wondrous powers of Magical Objects</h3>

<p>The great Bond which is formed between the Necromancer and the minion
is not only a channel of control, but is also a conduit of power.
This is clearly demonstrated as the shade directs spells through the
servant. There is, however, another aspect of this conduit which is of
vital Importance despite being subtle in nature and ofttimes difficult
to perceive; the mystical powers of the equipment upon the Person of
the necromancer are, in part, woven into the energies which vivify
the undead flesh.</p>

<p>As the Necromancer is a dealer in manifestations of the spirit with
little regard to matters corporeal, it is fitting that only the essential
energies of an item contribute to the summoning of a servile lich. Thus the
physical aspects of an object play no part: a magically empowered river stone
is more valuable than a raw diamond, linen robes infused with Arawn's might
are preferable over unenchanted fine silk, a battered cap of dubious quality
but granting power is chosen over the finest mundane crown wrought by goldsmiths
for an emperor. In all cases, it is the power within rather than the form
without which reflects true value and usefulness.</p>

<p>There is mystery here, though, for certain aspects of an item's
powers may affect the minion while others do not, and the decision
as to whether or not a particular influence is transferred is one of Arawn's
secrets that he is loathe to share. However, these decisions are always
consistent and may be relied upon once deduced, for although it is a
great Wonderment that an object which increases the Strength of the
necromancer effects no change upon the servant while an object which
increases Constitution grants its blessing freely, these same observations
hold true for all improvements of Strength or Constitution originating in
objects.</p>

<p>Yet beyond this mystery is another! For some influences only converge
upon the Summoning of the minion and are thereafter inert, while other
influences flow Continuously.</p>

<p>We see then that with some care, we may assemble the facts surrounding
this curious transfer of some powers and seek to avoid the confusion which
would so naturally spring from the interplay of such convoluted forces:</p>

<p>Lest the Necromancer think to be beyond mortal decay, ponder well:
even as the mystic current channels items' magical energies
from the shade to the servant, so too does that current reflect back a
mirror of the cruel forces which rip and tear the undead flesh. The
necromancer, strong in Arawn, notices not this backlash; material
objects wear and break under the strain. And in this is a Great Truth.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: These pages in particular held a great deal of
information Difficult to render sensible. Numbers, letters, and markings
of unknown meaning were strewn across the parchment with abandon, and
the task was not Simplified by the extensive blood stains which often
obscured areas of key importance. For the curious I offer up
<a href="statverification.html">a more literal translation</a>; make
of it what you will. &#150; B]</p>
