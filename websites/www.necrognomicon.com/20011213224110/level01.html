<p>The first steps on the dark path are often tenuous, and questions fill the mind of the
neophyte. What am I to do? What is my role? When does the killing begin? Thankfully, the
answers to these questions are simple. (Respectively: &quot;Kill things,&quot;
&quot;Facilitate the killing of things,&quot; and &quot;Now.&quot;)</p>
<p>Rejoice in the powers of necromancy, even if they seem weak at the start.</p>

<h2>Level 1 Spells</h2>
<p>Even the youngest initiate has the spells which are the hallmark of all necromancers:
a life-stealing attack, an attack which does damage over time, magical protection, and an
undead pet.</p>
<p>The School of the spell reflects which <a href="skills2.html">skill</a> is used to cast
it: Abjuration, Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, or Evocation. Mana is drained from your
mana pool immediately upon casting the spell, even if the spell was resisted. If a spell
fizzles &#150; and you can expect to see a lot of that until your casting skills
improve &#150; you still lose some mana, but it is only a fraction of the total mana cost of
the spell. Cast Time is in seconds; it may not seem important now, but it's a vital piece of
information later on. Any necessary Reagents must be in your inventory to complete the
spellcasting, and (except where noted) are consumed every time the spell is cast.</p>

<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>The neophyte necromancer, with little experience in the use of spells and a limited pool
of mana, has a fairly narrow range of tactics available.</p>

<h3>Melee Solo</h3>
<p>When your weapons and your raw strength (aided by your twisted magics) are enough to
finish off your victims, indulge in some personal bloodspilling. Even though our physical
attacks are quickly eclipsed by our magical arts, it is important to engage in melee once
in a while. This builds both offensive and defensive skills; offensive skills are convenient,
but defensive skills will keep you alive.</p>
<p>If you have the chance, familiarize yourself with a variety of weapon types. You never
know what sort of <a href="grimtools.html">grim tools</a> you'll run across in the future.</p>
<p>You won't be able to melee solo for very long. Enjoy it while you can.</p>

<h3>Melee with the Dead</h3>
<p>One of the joys of necromancy is our ability to summon up a bony warrior to fight by our
side. It makes the killing go faster, it makes you look necromantic, and it can provide
you with a window of safety should you need to retreat. There's really no better time to
start learning how to <a href="pettricks.html">command your undead pet</a>.</p>
<p>At this level, your companion is fairly brittle. Be sure that he's not taunting, and be
at the forefront of the fight.</p>

<h2>Hunting Grounds</h2>
<p>Familiarize yourself with your home town; begin by making your way to the necromancer's
guild and handing in your recruitment note to the guild master listed. Once that's done,
head out and begin your killing spree.</p>
<p>Gnomes will begin by finding the Mines of Malfunction, which are in the deepest parts of
Ak'Anon. First find the main merchant area, which holds the Forge of Defiance, the large pyramid
which contains the bank and many vendors, and the meddling bard. Cross the bridge which goes over
the river and make your way down the sloping path. Once there, follow the right-hand wall; you'll
pass the large underground falls, go through a corridor, pass some machinery, and stumble down an
incline. About halfway down that incline is the square metal door which marks the entrance to the
Mines. Go through the door and turn left. The Dark Reflection necromancer guild is before you.</p>
<p>Once you've acquired your <a href="dressed.html">Dark Gold Felt Robe</a>, leave Ak'Anon and make
your way into Steamfont. Follow the mountains to the left or the right for a good killing ground,
you won't need to go far at all.</p>

<h2>Morty's Bloody Trail</h2>
<p>Long ago &#150; and that's not an exaggeration, trust me &#150; I began to keep a journal of my
hunting grounds. It begins here. Not terribly interesting at the start, but there it is.</p>

<h3>Level 1</h3>
<p>My rampage of death began in Steamfont, like nearly all other gnome necromancers. Since killing
gnome skeletons results in a falling out of favor with the Dark Reflection, I left those alone.</p>
<p>(Note: I believe that this has changed, as the Dark Reflection no longer concerns itself with
the wandering dead of Steamfont. They were, shall we say, an interesting experiment.)</p>

<h3>Level 2</h3>
<p>I was still killing things in Steamfont, there being no particular reason to move on.</p>

<h3>Level 3</h3>
<p>I remained in Steamfont, taking down a slightly wider variety of things. I had a short period
of freelancing in the Mines of Malfunction, but I found that to be troublesome.</p>
