<p>While travel for the necromancer was made possible with Gather Shadows, the true potential
for travel is opened up with the ability to Bind Affinity nearly anywhere the world. Many
hunting areas which would otherwise seem quite distant are made convenient.</p>

<h2>Level 12 Spells</h2>
<p>The spells of this circle are a pleasant combination of utility and mayhem.</p>
<p>Two of our spell lines, Darkness and Lifetap, receive much-appreciated improvements. We also
see the introduction of several other spell lines: the fiery Blood line, the lifetap-over-time
Leach, and our Scent resistance debuffs. A stronger pet is also available for conjuring.</p>
<p>Bind Affinity is what makes all the difference, though.</p>
<p>The highly increased damage potential makes solo adventuring even easier. Don't forget to
group occasionally to stay in touch with your allies.</p>
<p>The School of the spell reflects which <a href="skills2.html">magical skill</a> is called
upon.  Mana is drained from your mana pool immediately upon casting the spell. Cast Time is in
seconds. Reagents must be in your inventory to complete the spellcasting.</p>

<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>No particularly new tactics present themselves at this point. Previous tactics tend to work even
better, though, with the increased damage of the new spells and the ever-greater pool of mana to
draw from.</p>
<p>Fear Kiting becomes even more effective at this point. Fear is an affordable spell, and Spook the
Dead can replace it in places. Heat Blood does a significant amount of damage, and can be used in
addition to Engulfing Darkness on enemies with high health.</p>
<p>Always keep your minion focused if you're in the battlefield.</p>

<h2>Hunting Grounds</h2>
<p>With Bind Affinity, the world opens up for hunting. Travel to a choice hunting spot, bind
yourself somewhere safe, and let the screaming begin.</p>
<p>Gnomes may be tempted to head back to Steamfont and visit areas that were previously deadly but
now offer a wide range of choice victims. On Antonica, there are too many good hunting spots to list;
if you want to avoid crowds, head for Lavastorm or the Rathe Mountains, but hunt carefully.</p>
<p>This is a good time to start venturing into some of the dungeons, too. The upper levels of
Befallen and the Warrens offer many opportunities.</p>

<h2>Morty's Bloody Trail</h2>
<p>I only visited a few of the places that I could have, and some of them were a lot less
crowded than they are now.</p>

<h3>Level 12</h3>
<p>The Commonlands were becoming routine, and it was time for a change. Now that I was able to
Bind Affinity, I headed back across the Ocean of Tears and returned to Steamfont. It was like old
times, only better. The heretic dead that used to terrorize me were now just walking piles of bone
chips, and the kobolds were beneath my contempt. I spent a great deal of time near the windmills
and in the minotaur cave.</p>

<h3>Level 13</h3>
<p>The pickings were too good to leave. I remained in Steamfont, slaughtering minotaurs, harpies,
elementals, and anything else that got in my way. The living was good, but the killing was better.</p>

<h3>Level 14</h3>
<p>Steamfont suddenly being much less challenging, I once again turned westward. Lesser Faydark had
camps of suitable enemies, but companions were few and far between and so I continued on. I visited
Dagnor's Cauldron, having never been there before, and did find opponents worth my time; however, they
were found only infrequently, and far tougher foes than I wished to confront were also plentiful. I did
not tarry. I returned to Antonica to hunt in the West Commonlands, taking care to avoid the druid ring.
I also spent some time exploring the first two floors of Befallen &#150; quite the endearing place, I
may choose to retire there in my advancing years &#150; but the depths were beyond my skills, and so I
must return at a later time.</p>

<h3>Level 15</h3>
<p>Although I could feel Befallen calling to me, I avoided it like the... well, I avoided it. I took
some time to tread the outskirts of Lavastorm, but I did not find the weather to my liking (although I
must make it a point to visit Najena later). Lured by the promise of good fishing spots, I spent a quite
a lot of time in the Oasis of Marr.</p>
