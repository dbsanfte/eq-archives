doubt, it is to be acknowledged that the beings here known as Inconnu
form the greatest part of the Ranks of the Disciples of Arawn, being as they are
bound to his service by their very nature. Yet one will sometime see Saracens
so called, as their homeland holds too an historied Store of arcana necromantia;
and indeed, even common Britons may chance upon greater teachings than those
which Occupy most of their kin.</p>

<p>Let us then consider for a moment these races so honored.</p>

<h2>Qualities of the three Bloodlines which serve Arawn in fair Albion.</h2>

<p>Know that beyond mere appearance, people of the same Race exhibit
similar tendencies in physique and intellect; and although these traits can
in time vary greatly between members of differing professions
(or be heightened through mystical concentrations and enchanted objects as
detailed <a href="stats.html">elsewhere</a>), those individals who pursue
a common Path up the Mountain of experience can expect to arrive at
the same Pinnacle of development with their peers. Thus, the difference
between a Briton necromancer and an Inconnu necromancer is less than, for
example, that between a Briton necromancer and a Briton paladin (which
should surprise no one).</p>

<h3>The Common Briton</h3>

<p>We first turn our attention to the Briton, as the common native of
Albion provides an excellent standard of comparison being neither
particular Gifted in any area nor suffering from any specific Detriment.
Possessed of an adequate mind and well-suited to any task, Britons find
themselves drawn to many professions; only rarely does one follow the True
path of necromancy. (Indeed, it is far more common for such a one to be
ensnared on the False path of the so-called &quot;Arawnites&quot; &#150; may
their accurs&eacute;d tongues be torn from their vacuous heads and Wrapped
around their eyes that their words may only Blind themselves!)</p>

<p>Common heritage provides the Briton with some small resistance to the crushes
and slashes such as might occur on any farm, as well as a natural resistance
to Matter-oriented attacks as may reflect nature's destructive ire.</p>

			width="200" height="300" alt=""><br>A Saracen necromancer

	</tr>

<h3>The Dexterous Saracen</h3>

<p>Upon first observation of a Saracen, one might suspect that the slightly
smaller frame in comparison to the Briton may indicate some general Lack
in prowess. This would be true in a sense, as the Saracen is neither quite
so Strong nor as Hardy as Briton stock (at least in these northern climes);
the falsehood would be clear, however, upon seeing the Saracen's uncanny
precision in form and activity. While this Admirable trait plays little
role in the the most common types of m&ecirc;l&eacute;e &#150; for indeed the
Briton-swung sword strikes more soundly and just as swift &#150; place within
the Saracen's hands a dagger and you will See (or Feel, depending upon your
standing with said Saracen) what delicate labyrinths of pain can be etched
into a bodily form. This same Dexterity serves the necromancer just as well
if not better, for it allows the physical Gestures which focus Arawn's power
to be completed more quickly.</p>

<p>Generations of warfare have inured Saracens to the slashes and thrusts
common to the weapons of their lands, just as the desert winds have
accustomed them to a greater heat.</p>

			light of dawn, an Inconnu pauses to consider what fate may come.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3>The Sinister Inconnu</h3>

<p>Having now reflected upon those humans favored with the Insight to walk the
gravestone path, we turn to the natural necromancer, Arawn's own, the Inconnu.
Physical aspects of the Inconnu clearly signify their Subterranean origins, the
pale skin unaccustomed to the Sun and the large light-absorbing eyes being the
most obvious. Aside from these somewhat superfluous externalities, however, the
corporeal form is not terribly remarkable in what it displays: more dexterity than
the Briton, yet not so much as the Saracen, while being slower than both in gross
activity; the solid Constitution of the Briton, but without the strength. What is
it then, which marks those of Arawn as chief in the Dark Arts? Quite simply it is
their native Intelligence, for this is the very foundation of magical power.</p>

<p>Survival in the Underground has brought out in the Inconnu an ability to withstand
such crushes and piercing thrusts as happen when rocky walls collapse, while also
bringing out an ability to shrug off bursts of heat as are not uncommon in certain
areas. Additionally, service to Arawn has acquainted the race with an especial
insight into the workings of Spirit, allowing attacks of that nature to be
somewhat blunted.</p>

<p>These, then, are the Chosen ones &#150 Briton, Saracen, Inconnu.
What of the other races? Are they lesser? No, they are yet worthy, and may in
the passing of time come to the Dark Wisdom, even if they are presently
unable either by aptitude (as the otherwise mighty Half Ogre) or attitude
(as the otherwise adept Avalonian or the most worthy Highlander).
For in time, all souls perceive Arawn's truth.</p>

<h3>Qualities Demonstrated during Activity</h3>
<p>A summarization of the similarities and differences between the bloodlines
may be presented as such, with note upon Which characteristics tend to be
enhanced in those brought to Arawn's discipleship:</p>

<p>Of course, variations do occur, and it is not an indication of the Times of
Tribulation should one cross the path of a necromancer uncommonly Strong, or
exhibiting some other oddity. In all cases, however, the traits shown At the End
are the lowest to be seen; service to Arawn demands no less.</p>

<h3>Qualities Demonstrated under Duress</h3>
<p>In a similar fashion, each race's ability to withstand maltreatment
resulting from varying physical effects (which tend to be concentrated on a
Specific point of contact) and magical effects (which tend to damage the
individual as a Whole) may be put thus:</p>

<p>For reasons expressed in <a href="stats.html">another place</a>, these racial
gifts of heritage and happenstance are of little concern to the Walker in the Spirit.</p>

<h3>A Spirited Race</h3>

<p>Given the racial predilections, it is not uncommon to hear the Uninitiated pose
questions comparing the bloodlines and their relative success in practicing the
Necromantic arts. Let us consider and in consideration answer two of these questions,
these two in particular being the most common:</p>

<p><i>&quot;Which race is best suited to necromancy?&quot;</i> This question is
easily answered, for the Inconnu are intimate with the Dark powers and are
uniquely gifted in those areas which a Necromancer values highly. As a result
of this uncommon bond between Race and Profession, most necromancers are Inconnu,
and most Inconnu are necromancers.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Which race makes for the best necromancer?&quot;</i> Although nearly
identical to the previous question, it is yet different and worthy of consideration,
for we must ask ourselves what the Best Necromancer may be.</p>

<p>In truth, the best necromancer is the One who, in the application of mundane skills
and magical spells to a Situation, transforms enemies into corpses and corpses into
obedient servants, spreading throughout the lands the Peace of Arawn. The best
necromancer is a Fearsome force either solitary or in the company of others,
and can be counted upon always when Death draws near.</p>

<p>The Best necromancer, it is certain, can be a member of Any race.</p>
