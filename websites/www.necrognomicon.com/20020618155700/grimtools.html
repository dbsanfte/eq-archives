<p>Going into battle empty-handed is a bad idea. Going into battle looking like you
just got back from a Felwithe flea market is even worse. Don't give in to those
charismatic elven wenches hawking their steins and stones at every lamppost &#150; get
yourself some gear that says, &quot;I've come about the reaping.&quot;

<h2>Implements of Destruction</h2>
<p>While there are many necromancers who would disagree with me, it remains my opinion
that keeping a good weapon handy is vital. There are several excellent choices for the
necromancer. Keep in mind that the right weapon not only serves you in battle, but gives
you that menacing aura which sets you apart from the weak and spineless.</p>

<h2>Instruments of Darkness</h2>
<p>While the incredible necromantic power which we wield is without compare, the wise
necromancer will enhance that power whenever possible.  To that end, an assortment
of tools and utensils present themselves for our dark purposes.</p>
