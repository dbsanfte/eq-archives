		<td class=story width="250">I once encountered a goblin who was different than his
			kin &#150; calm, insightful, and rational. After recovering from my initial
			shock, we had a long discussion concerning the histories of the goblin tribes and
			how an ancient curse brought them to their current state. We then shared a dinner
			of roast giant and gnomish spirits, swapping stories until late in the night.</td>

		<td class=story width="250">Enslaved and imprisoned for his political views on the
			growing power of Lanys T'Vyl, Boondin Babbinsbort maintains his composure in the
			face of T'Vyl opposition and clerical oppression. This loyal servant of the Dark
			Reflection must not be allowed to undergo such punishment. Free Boondin!</td>

	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">I don't know why it is &#150; maybe it's something
			to do with living in caves &#150; but gnomes are naturally adept mountain
			climbers. I recently scaled this peak in the Frontier Mountains and engaged
			in a bit of yodeling.</td>
