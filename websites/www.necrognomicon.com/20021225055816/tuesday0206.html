			alt="I didn't come here to sell anything, but have you given any thought to purchasing a front door? Gnomes make good doors."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">As I was wandering through the Tenebrous Mountains, I
			paid a visit to the Coterie of the Eternal Night. While they weren't very
			talkative, they were otherwise quite courteous in allowing me to tour their
			impressive keep.</td>

		<td class=story width="250">Once a year, I make a pilgrimage to a small village in the
			East Commonlands. According to legend, Bertoxxulous himself walked here in
			the flesh and gazed upon Antonica, leaving his gifts in the earth before
			returning to his plane. It's a good picnic spot.</td>

			alt="Brave or foolish... so hard to tell the difference."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Since I was in the neighborhood, I decided to stop in for
			a visit with one of the master necromancers on Luclin. After getting a few tips on
			minions from him, we spent the better part of the day swapping stories and
			discussing the finer points of secret lairs.</td>
