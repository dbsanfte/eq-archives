<h2>The March 2004 <strike>Team Lead</strike> Community Report</h2>

<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p>The necromancer is a class of contradictions. Part fighter, part mage.
Part player, mostly pet. Among the most popular classes, but strongly disliked by
many. Fun and challenging for some, but too buggy for others. Impressive in farming
parts of the PvE world, but a lightweight in RvR. Feared by melee classes, but a mere
trifle to enemy casters. A non-stop ranged killer of yellow con mobs (Deathsight), or a
spike-covered, PBAoE bear outlasting reds (Death Servant). Constantly hounded to PL,
but shunned from normal groups. Kept by some as farm-bots, but enjoyed by many as our
favorite class.</p>

<p>Recent changes, announced or otherwise, plus a list of long-lived bugs have lead
to significant player dissatisfaction. Chief among the issues are rapid armor decay,
RvR survivability, and surprise changes. We feel that this is a class with great
potential and look forward with optimism for helpful changes, and with some concern
about reduced utility from adjustment of some class strengths and our ability to play
effectively in a post-Frontiers game.</p>

<h3>2. Concerns</h3>

<h5>2.1 RvR survivability</h5>

<p>The necromancer is unbalanced in RvR. It may overpower a small melee group, or die
quickly when legendary weapons are used. Casters can quickly kill the pet or cause it to
suffer maximum duration CC effects. The necro has no way of reducing CC through purge,
determination, or sorceror mezz cure via the group panel. Unable to heal pet through the
group panel spells also healing classes must choose between using more expensive
groupheal/spreadheal spells or letting the necro fall in battle. The best necromancer’s
casting delay is at least twice that of a typical well-equipped cloth caster.</p>

<h5>2.2 RvR Utility</h5>

<p>Necromancers are perceived as adding little to an RvR group and have great
difficulty in finding groups. This leads to player frustration, or the use of
gimmicks to solo in RvR. Some of these gimmicks such as grouping with a cleric bot are
viewed as exploits by other classes, but necros who wish to RvR often feel forced
to use a bot, or leave the field.</p>

<h5>2.3 Pet Control</h5>

<p>Pet control is awkward at best. Pathing problems continue to result in deaths
in PvE and RvR. Response to the &quot;here&quot; command is too slow. Erratic pet
behavior after a &quot;stay&quot; mode kill can lead to aggro problems. The pet
cannot be stopped from attacking a player in range if we cast a spell. The pet can
be aggroed like a mob and will leave your selected target to engage its attacker/taunter.
Despite clear caster LOS it can be very difficult to position the pet so that it has
a valid LOS on target.</p>

<h5>2.4 Spell Queuing</h5>

<p>The spell queue system makes it very difficult for a necromancer to react to a
dynamic situation. If a particular spell is to be cast, it can take up to 11 seconds
just to start casting it. The necromancer is wholly dependent on the pet's spell queue
and attack cycle in order to attack. All spells and abilities in the spell queue can
be overwritten by other spells or abilities. This can trigger the FP, spell or RA timers without ever producing the spell or RA effect.</p>

<h5>2.5 PvE Utility and Group Interplay</h5>

<p>With the exception of powerlevelling, necros are not commonly sought by groups.
In PvE groups they are valued primarily for AF debuff, ABS buff, and power transfer
to healers. All of these abilities are in the Deathsight line; emphasizing the Servant
and Pain necros problem. Group members cannot perform some common tasks with necros in
shade form. The pet cannot be selected and healed from the group window. Shield tanks
cannot guard the pet. Fast casting requires a cleric to spend concentration to dex &
dex/qui buff both the necro and pet.</p>

<h5>2.6 Procs, charges and potions</h5>

<p>The necromancers have been denied access to procs and charges in shade form for a
long time. This was generally accepted by the players by reasoning that since the
necro’s gear did not decay, it was not getting hit, and procs should not fire. Now
that our gear is being damaged, the procs should fire as for other casters.
Similarly we should have access to charges and potions just like any other class.</p>

<h5>2.7 Pet Summoning and Porting</h5>

<p>The necromancer is without its pet, and helpless, for at least 20 seconds when he
first logs on or ports. After going LD or logging in RvR or wandering mob zones the
necro can face certain death upon relogging. So to when porting into certain dungeons.
The summoning delay is fair when pet is killed or released. If the highest level pet
were auto-summoned, or if the summons were changed to an instant with 20 second delay
following death or release, this problem would become small. The Frontiers porting
system is of obvious future concern.</p>

<h5>2.8 Unanticipated Changes to the Class</h5>

<p>No issue has caused more frustration among the necros in the past few months than
the introduction of changes without mention in patch notes, and at times, without
having been first implemented on Pendragon. To elaborate here would sour the tone
of this report.</p>

<h3>3. Spec Line Issues</h3>

<h5>3.1 General</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The spec lines are unbalanced with over 90% of necro specced 44+
		in deathsight. Sight necros solo very well with minimal downtime.
		This spec line is the most group-friendly.</li>
	<li>All spec lines would benefit from improved group support tools.</li>
	<li>The resist rate for lifetap and powertap spells appears to be higher
		than that of the DD spells of other classes. Taps are the primary
		attacks of the class.</li>
	<li>We feel that our spec buffs are too weak to enhance their respective
		spec lines.</li>
	<li>We feel too restricted by having to use only one specific pet at level
		50. We would like to take advantage of the different pet features
		such as attack speed, but due to the level cap restrictions only
		the abomination is survivable in RvR, or death servant play.</li>
</ol>

<h5>3.2 Deathsight</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The new sound effect for the spec lifetap is very loud and long. It makes
		it difficult for players to pick out the sound cues they have been
		used for timing FP. The spec lifetap is typically spammed while the
		necro waits for the FP timer to reset.</li>
</ol>

<h5>3.3 Death Servant</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The servant necro is the class most affected by gear decay. This character
		will typically have paladin-like prolonged melee with a high level mob,
		or pull groups of lower level mobs to its damage shield and PBAoE attack.
		Unlike the paladin the pet has very poor block/parry skills and does
		not have durable plate armor. When sorcerors and cabalists pull pygmies
		the damage taken by their pets is not transferred to the caster. The
		net result is extremely fast gear decay.</li>
	<li>Due to poor pet defense the death servant spec line is very difficult to
		play without a group or cleric-bot. No class’s viability should be based
		on the assumed presence of a bot.</li>
	<li>Our PBAoE spell does approximately 2/3 of normal PB damage with increased
		cast time and only marginally less power usage.</li>
	<li>The shade cast DD spells do only 20% more damage than the deathsight
		lifetap while requiring twice the amount of power.</li>
	<li>Our HoT spell doesnt last long enough or heal for enough to be considered
		a viable alternative to using lifetaps or even pure DDs.</li>
	<li>We feel our damage shield's duration is too short to be adequately used in
		group situations due largely to the trouble of passing it through the
		queue in the middle of battle.</li>
	<li>Power management can be difficult for servant necros. Unlike Deathsight necros
		they cannot count on powertaps to replenish power after a long fight,
		and like all necros they cannot use power potions.</li>
</ol>

<h5>3.4 Painworking</h5>

<ol>
	<li>Painworking is a nearly unplayable primary spec line, and is a weak
		secondary line. This line deals less damage and takes more time do so
		than the others while also having no means of self-defense, healing,
		or ranged attack. Painworking necros are so rare that it is difficult
		to comment in detail about their problems.</li>
	<li>The AoE snare's duration, especially after resists, is considered to be too
		short to be useful in most situations, especially since it breaks mez.</li>
</ol>

<h3>4. New Issues</h3>

<h5>4.1 Item decay</h5>

<p>Melee damage now degrades the necromancer’s gear. Unlike other cloth casters, however,
the necro class is a fighter-mage. It is designed to engage opponents toe-to-toe and has
no ability to CC and kite. Thus a necromancer’s gear is far more damaged by killing
100 mobs than that of other casters. This issue is critical to Death Servant necros since
this class kills primarily with PBAoE and melee attacks. This problem has caused some
interesting player responses. These include: never repairing gear except staff and
playing with 70% condition items; play mostly naked; acquiring but not leveling artifacts.</p>

<h5>4.2 Attack from legendary weapons</h5>

<p>Because of the 26% magic damage penalty of the pet vs a level 50 player, legendary
weapons have a much larger impact on necros than other players. It also appears that the
magic damage of these weapons bypasses some of the high damage absorption that is key
to necro survival in RvR.</p>

<h5>4.3 Use of legendary weapons</h5>

<p>Because of the restriction on the use of alchemical features, the necro cannot employ
legendary weapons.</p>

<h3>5. Item Issues</h3>

<h5>5.1 Quickness transfer</h5>

<p>Quickness on gear does not transfer to the pet and improve swing speed. This has
been reported since December 03, but has not been recognized in patch notes,
or grab bag notes.</p>

<h5>5.2 Useless stats on class-specific items</h5>

<p>The necro epic cap has +quickness. The epic robe and entire Caer Sidi gear suite
have procs that are useless to the class. We are therefore denied a benefit given
to other classes.</p>

<h5>5.3 Non-functioning ToA bonuses</h5>

<p>The ToA casting speed, casting range, and attack speed bonuses do not transfer
to the pet. ToA spell damage and duration effects do work as expected. Once again
we are denied benefits given to other classes.</p>

<h3>6. Other Issues</h3>

<h5>6.1 Impossible or needlessly difficult quests and tasks</h5>

<p>Many items cannot be used in shade mode. This was originally implemented for
balance/exploit issues, but</p>
<ol>
	<li>distance-to-pet checks have been implemented for other abilities,</li>
	<li>many items have little/no impact on class balance issues (used to
		trigger quest events, map items, readable scroll items), and</li>
	<li>requiring 20 seconds of defenselessness and dropping buffs in order
		to use a potion seems unfair.</li>
</ol>

<p>The necromancer is effectively denied, or limited in, participation in some
standard, ML and artifact quests. Examples are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fall of the Emperor Quest</li>
	<li>Jashan's Brother Artifact Quest</li>
	<li>Master Level 6 Trial 5</li>
	<li>The Lost Treasure Quest.</li>
</ul>

<h5>6.2 Personalizing appearance</h5>

<p>Necromancers are completely unable to change the way they look. They must all
use the same pet and must all be the same shade. Necromancers would love some way
to change the appearance of themselves, or the pet. This would also assist healers
in selecting the correct abomination when several are present.</p>

<p>Female character’s are represented by the same shade and pet forms as male
characters. At a minimum the top pet should have male and female forms. Players
have suggested several female mobs that might be used as the female counterpart
to the abomination.</p>

<h5>6.3 User Interface</h5>

<p>Third party UI mods have improved our understanding of pet status. This ToA
feature is much appreciated, but issues remain. The buffs and effects on the pet
cannot be delved. The number of pet buffs and effects that can be displayed is too
small to allow all positive and negative effects on the pet to be visible to the
necro. Necromancers believe that this unique class restriction is unnecessary and
would like to be able to have this information if at all possible.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Appendix 1. Bug list</h3>

<p>We realize that detailed bug lists are not part of the standard report outline,
but have no other means of submitting this list in the absence of an active TL.</p>

<h5>A1.1 General bugs</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The necromancer cannot tell if the pet has proper LOS to the target
		until he attempts to cast. If LOS check fails then the spell fails,
		and pet must be quickly switched to passive to avoid its running
		off to engage.</li>
	<li>Spells take power from the necro whether they are cast or not due to
		LOS check, and whether they are on valid targets or not.</li>
	<li>Casting speed. The necromancer is the slowest caster in the game.
		Naked and unbuffed the most commonly cast RvR spells delve 3s,
		but require at least 3.25 seconds to cast. With max gear and buffs
		the time improves to perhaps 2.3 seconds. It is possible for an
		opponent to cast three PBAoE spells between two casts by a fast necro.</li>
	<li>The pet must remain close to the necromancer to enable casting, but the
		pet cannot be controlled to stay within range.</li>
	<li>All spells must process through the spell queue. There are no necro
		instant-cast spells.</li>
	<li>ToA casting speed bonuses do not effect the most commonly cast spells.
		This is because these are pet-cast spells, and the speed bonus does
		not transfer to the pet.</li>
	<li>Necro buffs on the pet are overwritten by buffs from other players. This
		happens even when the new buff is of a lower level than the original
		necro buff. Because pet buffs cannot be delved, it is not possible to
		tell, for example, if the pet has +48 dex buff from the necro, or a
		+40 dex buff from a level 47 cleric.</li>
	<li>The death servant damage shield delivers almost no increase in damage
		from level 24 to 44 despite an almost 2:1 difference in delved DPS.</li>
	<li>As for other pet classes, certain group effects and spells work at long
		or unlimited range.</li>
	<li>Racial resists do not transfer to the pet, although the pet is the
		necromancer most of the time.</li>
	<li>The Cabalist spirit debuff doesn't work for necro spells.</li>
</ol>

<h5>A1.2 RA and MA bugs</h5>

<ol>
	<li>Purge processes through the pet’s queue. Since the queue is stopped when
		the pet is mezzed or stunned, purge only works when it is not needed.</li>
	<li>Several important RAs do not transfer to the pet, and are therefore
		useless to the necromancer. Among these are:
		<ul>
			<li>Mastery of Concentration,</li>
			<li>Augmented strength/constitution/quickness/dexterity,</li>
			<li>Avoidance of Magic,</li>
			<li>Empty Mind,</li>
			<li>Toughness, and</li>
			<li>Regeneration.</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>Some important RAs fail to function at all. Among these are:
		<ul>
			<li>Concentration, and</li>
			<li>Magestic Will</li>
		</ul></li>
	<li>The 100 unit pet range limit for casting MAs negatively affects game play.
		This range is less than the normal follow distance of the pet at a
		walk, and when presented with the slightest of obstacles the pet may
		not close to that range when the necro stands still to cast.</li>
	<li>When MAs fail to cast because the pet is out of range the MA timer is
		triggered as though it actually did cast. Similarly, if the necro
		attempts to cast an RA without first summoning a pet, the timer is
		triggered but the cast fails.</li>
	<li>The bodyguard MA cannot guard the pet, so is useless.</li>
	<li>Wild Arcana works, but the player receives no feedback when a critical
		debuff occurs.</li>
</ol>

<h5>A1.3 RvR bugs</h5>

<ol>
	<li>The pet suffers maximum duration crowd control regardless of resistances
		or fall off from AoE.</li>
	<li>Players can score 100% crits on our pets, and the pets take more spell
		damage than a player equal to the necro in level.</li>
	<li>The pet takes 26% more spell damage than a level 50 player, 13% more
		than a level 44 player(the same level as the pet.)</li>
	<li>The pet is affected by confuse. This is unacceptable since the pet is
		the necromancer, not merely a companion.</li>
	<li>The pet can not be stopped from swinging at an enemy after processing
		a spell, not even in passive mode. This means that melee and stealth
		classes can use reactive styles against the pet, even though we
		have commanded it not to melee with the target.</li>
	<li>The pet can be taunted or aggroed with damage like a mob and cannot be
		forced to stay on the selected opponent.</li>
	<li>Any debuff cast on our pet interrupts us. This does not apply to any
		other class in the game.</li>
	<li>When the pet has two spells in the queue and the first is interrupted,
		the pet will still attempt to cast the second spell but it will be
		automatically interrupted even if the source of the interruption
		is gone.</li>
</ol>
