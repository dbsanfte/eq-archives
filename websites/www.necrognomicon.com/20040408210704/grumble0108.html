<p>August is a fine time to be underground. Gnomes have known this for ages.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from August 2001</h2>
<h3>August 31, 2001</h3>
<p>One more step in the Trail of Blood has been taken, and a few more pictures have fallen
into place.</p>
<p>No more updates until Tuesday &#150; have an enjoyable Labor Day, unless you've made
other plans.</p>
<h3>August 30, 2001</h3>
<p>The next step in the Trail of Blood, covering levels 12 to 15, is now in place. A few
details were altered here and there, and I made some additional notes for the upcoming
Cruel World section.</p>
<h3>August 29, 2001</h3>
<p>Most of today's updates were done to my guild site, including our first peek at
the <a href="http://www.ancientguardians.com/stonebrunt.html" target="_new">Stonebrunt
Mountains</a>. Necromantic updates will now continue as scheduled.</p>
<p>Never forget a troll's birthday. Never.</p>
<h3>August 28, 2001</h3>
<p>I've officially &quot;closed&quot; the old version of the NecroGnomicon, and it won't
be getting any more updates. I'm leaving it up for now, since I'm still moving some of the
information over, but it will eventually be archived and brought down.</p>
<p>A new Tuesday is in place, and I'll be working on the next step in the Trail of Blood
later in the day.</p>
<hr>
<h3>August 23, 2001</h3>
<p align=center><b>In Memorium</b><br>Troy &quot;Feebbasa&quot; Dilley<br>1971 &#150; 2001</p>
<p align=center>&quot;A man of worldly wisdom,<br>and a cheerful smiling friend;<br>
We'll meet again in joyous times<br>for Death is not the End.&quot;</p>
<h3>August 22, 2001</h3>
<p>No updates today at all, I'm afraid, as I needed to round out my guild's new web
site and message board. Feel free to <a href="http://www.ancientguardians.com/">give
it a visit</a>. It's a bit perky, I know, but sometimes blue skies make for better
fishing.</p>
<p>Today's patch brought no announced changes that would seem to have any effect on
the necromancer's life... we'll see.</p>
<h3>August 21, 2001</h3>
<p>Not many changes today, I'm finishing up my guild's web site. There's a new Tuesday,
some of the missing images have been put into place, and some wording was changed here
and there.</p>
<h3>August 20, 2001</h3>
<p>The next step in the Trail of Blood, Shadow Walker, has been completed. I also added
a new fish recipe to the Seafood section, and fixed a few typos here and there.</p>
<hr>
<h3>August 17, 2001</h3>
<p>The Fearmonger summary has been completed in the Trail of Blood. The summaries take a bit
of time to put together, I doubt I'll get more than one done per day, which puts completion
of that section somwhere in about mid-September.</p>
<p>And now I shall buy boots. Have a good weekend!</p>
<h3>August 16, 2001</h3>
<p>Work has begun on A Trail of Blood. The main page is mostly set up, the template for each
of the summaries has been created, and the first summary has been completed. Whee.</p>
<h3>August 15, 2001</h3>
<p>I've completed the Seafood page, and rumor has it that our undead pets now have a better
chance of surviving basic group combat. That's a fine thing.</p>
<p>I also tracked down those misbehaving tables and fixed them up. Addition and
subtraction &#150; your key to a quality grimoire.</p>
<p>With those changes, Morty's Notes and About Necromancers are both complete for content,
with the exception of some pictures that I'll get around to filling in later. Tomorrow...
the begining of A Trail of Blood.</p>
<h3>August 14, 2001</h3>
<p>The recipe page is complete, but the seafood recipes will be found elsewhere &#150; I'll
work on that later this week. In the process, I stumbled onto some tables that were a bit too
large. I fixed a couple of them, and I'll tackle the rest tomorrow.</p>
<p>I don't want to think about pickles any more.</p>
<h3>August 13, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm still working on my guild's web page, so not many changes here today. I did get a
start on the Recipes page, finally, and it should be done soon. There sure are a lot of
pickles in the world.</p>
<hr>
<h3>August 10, 2001</h3>
<p>No updates today, I'm working on the new version of my guild's web site. Go out and kill
some things for your Uncle Morty.</p>
<p>See you Monday!</p>
<h3>August 9, 2001</h3>
<p>The Languages page is done (finally!), and more pages were converted from the old
version.</p>
<p>Next on my list is the Baking recipes, then on to Tactics.</p>
<h3>August 8, 2001</h3>
<p>I got a large chunk of the Languages page done &#150; you don't realize how many of them
there are until you go looking for reasons to learn them. I also provided more information
in the Research area regarding the four necromantic research books.</p>
<h3>August 7, 2001</h3>
<p>Today brought a new Tuesday, a couple of changes that aren't terribly visible, and some
research on the EZ Board and how to pay for it.</p>
<p>I've also made a submission to the Developer's Corner detailing the continuing problems
with keeping our pets alive in combat. Based on the recent comments there regarding the
new resistance the Kael giants have to being charmed, it seems that our problems are being
addressed in approximately a week.</p>
<h3>August 6, 2001</h3>
<p>In a burst of rearrangement, I added the Appendix. Many things are clearer now. I also
updated a few pages here and there, reorganized my Notes page, and added in some of the
stories from the old site. If I feel creative later, I'll finish the Languages page, but
more likely that'll be tomorrow.</p>
<hr>
<h3>August 3, 2001</h3>
<p>No updates today, as I was following up on a job lead. Even necromancers need to
freelance once in a while.</p>
<h3>August 2, 2001</h3>
<p>Just a few touch-ups today, working with the style sheet and the tables to make some
things fit. Nothing impressive, but it needed to be done.</p>
<h3>August 1, 2001</h3>
<p>All of the pages have now been converted to the new format. In the process, I cleaned
up a number of the tables, corrected some errors, and made a start on the Languages page.</p>
