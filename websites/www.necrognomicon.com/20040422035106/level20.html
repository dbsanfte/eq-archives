<p>The necromancer is now coming of age. A surname can be acquired, the skeletal minion is
strong, and spellcasting is much more reliable. The power of darkness is mighty.</p>
<p>While <a href="research.html">magical research</a> is still an undeveloped skill, the spells
that it makes available are useful indeed.</p>

<h2>Level 20 Spells</h2>
<p>A few new abilities turn up in these spells, along with the always-welcome improvements
to some older spells.</p>
<p>The most dramatic new spell is Dominate Undead, which allows the necromancer to temporarily
control an undead minion just as if it were personally summoned. This is a powerful
spell which can change the nature of an undead encounter. It can also get the necromancer killed
in a shockingly short amount of time &#150; that's the dark side for you.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is the <a href="research.html">research spell</a> Harmshield, which (like
Feign Death) can save your skin more times than you can count.</p>
<p>The School of the spell reflects which <a href="skills2.html">magical skill</a> is called
upon.  Mana is drained from your mana pool immediately upon casting the spell. Cast Time is in
seconds. Reagents must be in your inventory to complete the spellcasting.</p>

			the spell will not command undead above a certain level; the length of the domination
			is unpredictable; and finally, when the domination breaks, your former minion will
			attempt to eat your brain. Aside from all that, though, the practice can be quite
			rewarding, and in certain places where the undead are plentiful it is yet another
			powerful tool in the necromancer's arsenal.<hr></td>

			uses of its own</a>, there are a couple of things that it won't protect you from.
			If you're using a health-to-mana spell such as Dark Pact (or the much later Lich),
			the health drain continues during the 18 seconds; if you've waited until near death to
			cast Harmshield, your own evil spell can be your undoing. In addition, Harmshield
			won't protect you from a god's Death Touch. While you are invulnerable, you cannot
			launch any physical attacks or cast any spells &#150; a small price to pay for such
			a powerful defense.<hr></td>
