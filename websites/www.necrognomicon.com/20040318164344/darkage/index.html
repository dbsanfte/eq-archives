is with a Certain curiosity that I hold now this book Before me,
for the writing therein is wondrous strange and most unlike any with
which I am familiar. Yet by my Arts, I am able to decipher within it
some Pages which seem to concern topics Necromantic and grim; and that
being within my demesne I feel beholden to offer Comment thereon.</p>

<p>I can only wonder what dire fate Met the book's author, for it
seems incomplete.</p>

<h2>That Which May be Found Herein</h2>
<p>The great majority of the Book's writings are to me without meaning,
seeming concerned with strangeness Unknown to the lands I have visited.
These writings I ignore.</p>

<p>That which remains, while sparse, may hope to offer some insight to
Those practictioners of the dark arts to whom the tome seems directed.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="races.html">Qualities of the three Bloodlines which serve
		Arawn in fair Albion.</a> These pages offer some insight into the
		Natures of the Briton and the Saracen, as well as those called
		Inconnu. (Related pages in the Book &#150; indeed most of the book's
		pages &#150; seem to insist that a fourth race of &quot;Knowers&quot;
		excels in Arawn's art to a degree unimaginable; until proof of
		such a race presents Itself, I withhold both judgement and comment.)</li>
	<li><a href="stats.html">They are known for Intelligence and Dexterity
		but rely upon others for Strength.</a> The qualities of those who walk the
		dark path are discussed, with commentary upon how wondrous Items and
		Enchantment may improve both Necromancer and the Minion typically
		found in said one's company.</li>
	<li><a href="pets.html">When accompanied by Horrific Undead creatures it is
		best to Understand them.</a> Those of passing frailty may wish Not to look
		upon this, for within is discussed the walking dead in some detail.</li>
	<li><a href="spells.html">Beware their rituals of Unspeakable Darkness ere your
		spirit Be lost.</a> The spells which call a corpse from the Grave and bid it
		walk are only the beginning of the frightful arcane lore under the command
		of Arawn's sinister Minister; at your own risk do you peruse.</li>
	<li><a href="realmabilities.html">Death is augmented with Powers learned on the
		Battlefields of life.</a> The necromancers who wield Arawn's gifts in Albion's defense
		(few though they may be!) hone their death-dealing abilities in many ways, some of
		which methods here documented being more successful than others.</li>
	<li><a href="masterlevels.html">Their Successes are reflected in a Mastery of Ancient
		Lore once lost.</a> When certain Trials have been met with victory by the soultorn
		wanderer whose path crosses Atlantean shores, further powers both beneficient and
		malefic become commanded.</li>
	<li><a href="trifles.html">Even their least secrets are Not to be trifled with.</a> True,
		any power-filled grimoire should be approached with a certain caution; yet not
		every Organ in the necromancer's Body of knowledge is the Black Heart of
		wailing Despair. Some few leavings of the bloody feast of sacrifice
		are yet fit for consumption.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note well that within these pages are Occasionally to be found certain charts not
unlike tables of accounting, with numbers and abbreviated labels that defy my not
inconsiderable skills of translation. These I present as best I am able, in the hope
that some Glimmer of wisdom may illuminate the reader as to their hidden meaning.</p>

<h3>Further Commentary</h3>

<p>Beyond the scope of this translated book, other scholars have put forth essays of
great value and interest to the Practicing necromancer. I have collected these for
preservation and presentation in <a href="reanimator.html">The Well-Read Reanimator</a>,
the perusal of which I heartily recommend.</p>

<p>Discussion of subjects necromantic and grim may be heard in 
<a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon" title="Message Boards">Mysterious Whispers</a>.
Questions regarding this Book may find answers herein, and comments to the Translator may be
given voice. The Forbidden Ones also hold discussion in this place, but of this we do Not speak.</p>
