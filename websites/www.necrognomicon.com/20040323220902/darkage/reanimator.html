is both a Science and an Art, a path of study as well as a way of life (as it were).
Many scholars, of necromantic profession or otherwise, have offered comment upon
the Darkest of Magics that is insightful, timely, or otherwise worth mention.
Some of these works are reproduced here in the hope that such wise words will
Illuminate the meaning of this most obscure practice and serve Arawn's Chosen in
their continuing endeavours.</p>

<h2>The Well-Read Reanimator</h2>

<p>While the Authors of these works may speak in phrases foreign and strange,
with strings of plain verbiage interspersed with most obtuse jargon,
remember always that a Prince may wear the rags of a Beggar yet retain
the power to command obedience with a word.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="deathsightrvr.html">The Iron Mage Guide to Necromancer RvR</a> &#150; A
		valuable overview of what a Deathsight necromancer may rightly
		contribute to Albion's defense.</li>
	<li><a href="necrobuffing.html">Norien's Guide to Buffing the Necromancer</a> &#150; Clerics
		and Friars take heed! Here are the secrets to sharing your Enhancements
		with the unliving and the undead.</li>
	<li><a href="statverification.html">What Transfers to the Pet, and When</a> &#150; Although
		I have compiled this information for reference, much of the content originates with
		other <a href="mausoleum.html">Insightful souls</a> who have spent considerable effort
		in determining the veracity of its contents and to whom we owe a Debt of gratitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>If erudite works of great value to Necromancers come to light which by
merit of their Wisdom are deserving of reproduction,
<a href="mailto:bifrons@necrognomicon.com">the editor</a> would be most
interested in learning of them.</p>

<h3>Necromancer Team Lead Reports</h3>

<p>Several times throughout the year, the many Team Leads submit reports detailing
the issues and insights of their classes. The reports specifically regarding Necromancers
are here collected.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="0403tlreport.html">The March 2004 <strike>Team Lead</strike> Community
			Report</a> &#150; There being no Team Lead in residence at the time, Redh_armor
			collaborated with others of the community and fashioned this update.</li>
	<li><a href="0312tlreport.html">The December 2003 Team Lead Report</a> &#150; The
		last official report submitted by Avecrien, with responding comments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that the views expressed in the pages above are those of the Authors
and do not necessarily represent the opinions of myself, Arawn, the late Mr.
Undercrypt, or anyone else who may be living, dead, or something in between.</p>
