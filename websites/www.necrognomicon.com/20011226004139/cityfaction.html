<p>Before heading off to the local bait store, it's nice to know whether or not the locals
consider you to be good bait.</p>

<h2>Who Loves You, Baby?</h2>
<p>Briefly, the gnome necromancer should be fine in Ak'Anon, Freeport, Neriak, the
Qeynos Aquaducts, and Thurgadin.  Everywhere else will require some work.</p>
<p>Opinions in some cities may have changed since I began my world-wide killing spree,
but this is what I remember.</p>

<h3>Faydwer</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Ak'Anon</b>: You're barely tolerated in most of the city, and the folks in the
		Mines of Malfunction are amiable.  After I take over Ak'Anon and put the Eldritch
		Collective into my torture chambers, you'll be viewed warmly pretty much everywhere.</li>
	<li><b>Felwithe</b>: I had to go there for a wedding once, and I discovered that I was
		dubious. I don't recall doing anything that would raise the elves' opinion of me,
		so that's probably where it starts.  I didn't go wandering around into the
		paladin/cleric guilds, though.</li>
	<li><b>Kelethin</b>: From the first time I wandered into the Greater Faydark to the
		present, the wood elf guards have always wanted me dead.  You can fix that with
		enough killing in Crushbone, but then you'll have problems in Neriak.  Neriak is
		much, much nicer, believe me. Avoid the elves for a while, then kill them for food
		later.</li>
	<li><b>Kaladim</b>: There might be some dwarves that don't want us dead, but the guards
		are pretty hostile.  Don't bother.  There are some dwarf merchants south of the docks
		that will deal with you, if you're really desparate.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Antonica</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Freeport</b>: I've never had a problem anywhere in Freeport. North Freeport folks
		don't like me too much, but they've never tried to kill me. (Well, back when the
		merchants attacked people they didn't like, I had an incident with that halfling
		merchant right inside the marketplace entrance, but things are different now.) I have
		personally broken wind in the heart of the paladin guild. You can train in East Freeport
		at the underground necromancer guild, which is also the closest place to pick up the
		Book of Dark Bindings since Ak'Anon doesn't seem to carry it.</li>
	<li><b>Grobb</b>: The warriors (who are also the guards) want us dead, so I haven't
		bothered to check with the trolls in the village.  There are some very tedious ways
		to get in good with Da Bashers, but I've never bothered.</li>
	<li><b>Halas</b>: Pretty much every barbarian I've run into has wanted me dead, which makes
		hunting in Everfrost interesting sometimes.  Nothing like relaxing after a nice fight
		and then getting interrupted when Tundra Jack decides to wander by.  I'm going to eat
		his heart later. And his little dog, too.</li>
	<li><b>Highpass Hold/High Keep</b>: Yet another place we're not welcome, but it's easy (and
		worthwhile) to fix it.  Gnolls and orcs, orcs and gnolls, you'll be strolling through
		unmolested in no time.</li>
	<li><b>Neriak</b>: We're grudgingly welcome in Neriak except, ironically, in the
		necromancer's guild. After bartering with the smith in the Southern Desert of Ro and
		getting the right people drunk, though, I get better prices from the merchants here
		than anywhere else. Unfortunately, I'm still dubious to The Dead, so I can't train and
		can't buy spells (except the ones that are available at the cleric's guild here, and
		quite a few of them are).  If you offend the Indigo Brotherhood (by, for instance,
		hunting in Crushbone) navigating the city can have tense moments, but it's still
		possible.</li>
	<li><b>Oggok</b>: Like Grobb, the guards hate us.  The merchants are indifferent, so you
		can shop in the Feerrott (and probably inside if you avoid the bouncers).  There's
		probably a way to get the Bouncers friendlier, but I haven't bothered.  Maybe I will
		someday.</li>
	<li><b>Qeynos</b>: It's been so long since I first visited Qeynos that I don't really
		remember if the &quot;good&quot; guards wanted me dead originally, but the corrupt
		ones were friendly enough.  Killing in Blackburrow fixes things easily, but there
		are few druids planted in the city who will always want to kill you &#150; and as
		soon as they attack, the guards join in.  Avoid them and you'll be fine.  You'll
		probably also want to avoid the Temple of Life and the Karana guilds to the south.</li>
	<li><b>Qeynos Aquaducts</b>: The loyal followers of Bertoxxulous will welcome you here.
		Now that there's a bank down in the Shrine, you could ignore the main city if you
		wanted to. The guildmasters are competent and ready to train you, and spells are
		available from the necromancer, shadow knight, and cleric spell vendors.</li>
	<li><b>Rivervale</b>: They want you dead, but what do you expect from an entire city of
		hors d'oeuvres?  Going on a massive goblin killing spree in Misty Thicket and RunnyEye
		might get you accepted everywhere except the druid and cleric guilds, but it would
		probably be more fun to go on a killing spree in Misty Thicket and Rivervale to try
		and get accepted in RunnyEye.</li>
	<li><b>Surefall Glade</b>: Show up armed for bear.  There's good huntin' here.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Odus</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Erudin</b>: Pretty much everyone I ran across in Erudin was dubious, although I
		think there might have been one enchanter who wanted to kill me.  I didn't spend a
		lot of time in the area.</li>
	<li><b>Paineel</b>: I was dubious to the Heretics, too, but that was a while ago and I
		haven't checked out Paineel proper.  If I get uppity, I might go on an Erudite
		killing spree just to have another necromancer guild to visit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Kunark</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Cabilis</b>: Not very friendly at all, those lizards. A massive killing spree
		will get you in good with the Legion and the necromancers, but the rest of city
		won't be impressed without a display of serious dedication to the iksar cause.</li>
	<li><b>Firiona Vie</b>: They start out wanting us dead. One one hand, you can get into
		their good graces with enough goblin killing. On the other hand, the city is named
		after some wuss elf, so why would you want to?</li>
	<li><b>The Overthere</b>: You start out apprehensive, like most outsiders who follow the
		black arts. Proving your ability to protect the docks will improve general opinion
		here, but killing in a few places will lower that opinion even faster. Having friends
		here is useful, making the choice somewhat difficult.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Velious</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Kael Drakkal</b>: Just like everywhere else in the world, giants want us dead.
		I suppose by killing enough of their enemies they'd like us, but I just can't imagine
		that a city built by giants would be convenient for gnomes.</li>
	<li><b>Skyshrine</b>: I've heard that the dragons don't start out very friendly, but I
		haven't checked for myself.</li>
	<li><b>Thurgadin</b>: The &quot;bearded ice rats&quot; start out apprehensive, but after a
		short bit of giant killing they're all quite friendly. All in all it's a very nice town,
		with all of the merchants you'd need (except for a necromancer guild), and it's the right
		size. The residents even look kind of dead. I feel so comfortable here that I wonder
		what cruel god deprived the dwarves back in Faydwer of all sense and reason.</li>
	<li><b>Pirates of Iceclad</b>: Yes, locked away on a remote icy island are the ones who
		start out like you more than anyone else in the world. They consider you kindly.
		Makes you want to be a pirate, doesn't it? Yarrrr.</li>
</ul>
