<p>Only five of the races remaining in Norrath have mastered the black arts.  Even though
most of those races have yet to fully acknowledge their necromancers as the ruling elite,
that's only a matter of time.</p>

<h2>Cultural Necromancy</h2>
<p>Each race views its own necromancers in a different way.  These social differences, in
addition to any inherent racial abilities, makes each necromancer's path fairly unique.</p>

<h3>Dark Elf &#150; Innoruuk's Chosen</h3>
<p>Long ago, Innoruuk took his hand to some high elven royalty and made certain...
improvements. Changed and filled with hatred, they became the first of the Teir'Dal,
the dark elves of Neriak.</p>
<p>Necromancy naturally holds a place of esteem for the dark elves &#150; so much so
that all other schools of magic are spurned. Dark elves were the first necromancers,
as necromancy was given directly to them by the Prince of Hate himself. (Incidentally,
this is why the circle of necromancy features Innoruuk's sigil prominently in the center.)
All dark elf necromancers follow <a href="thegods.html">Innoruuk</a>.</p>
<!-- Link to Circle of Necromancy page and the sigils of the gods -->
<p>Despite their popularity in Neriak, dark elf necromancers are generally considered to
be the Embodiment of Evil in the rest of the civilized world. They may visit the
&quot;cities&quot; of Grobb and Oggok as they will, but other areas are best approached
cautiously.</p>
<p>The typical dark elf is well-suited for a life of necromancy, showing extreme intelligence
and natural agility (even if a bit short on stamina). The inherent ability of all dark elves to
hide certainly has uses, and their natural night vision is without equal.</p>
<p>Specially crafted adamantite chain armor, forged by a dark elven smith, can be worn by the
Teir'Dal necromancer, offering a degree of protection beyond that offered by a typical robe.</p>
<h3>Erudite &#150; Miragul's Legacy</h3>
<p>The followers of Erud, at first ignorant of necromancy, learned the dark rituals
from spies who had infiltrated Neriak. Those who studied these rites of death were quickly
branded Heretics and forced from the city. The history of the Heretics is filled with tales
of power and treachery, from the creation of Paineel to the fate of the arch-necromancer
Miragul.</p>
<p>All erudite necromancers, and all of the other Heretics in Paineel for that matter, follow
<a href="thegods.html">Cazic-Thule</a> for reasons that I can't fathom.</p>
<p>When it comes to travel, the erudite necromancer is much better off than a dark elf, but
still not extremely popular. Some care must be taken, particularly in nearby Qeynos.</p>
<p>Erudites are known for their great intelligence but tend to crumple quickly when
words come to blows, making them better suited for the more arcane aspects of necromancy.
Reflecting this bias, the typical erudite is a bit more resistent to magic, and a bit less
resistant to disease. Like other humans, erudites are night blind, leaving them stumbling
about in the dark until the Deadeye spell is acquired.</p>
<p>Erudite necromancers have a few pieces of armor available to them that won't fit the
nonhumans.  In addition, the residents of Paineel have several quests for necromancers of
their ilk.</p>
<h3>Gnome &#150; Tinkering with Death</h3>
<p>Embarassingly enough, there are no records which detail the pursuit of the dark arts
by the gnomes. Unwritten history tells of a necromantic king once, as discussed
<a href="undercrypt.html">elsewhere</a>. There are no facts, only theories, concerning the
beginning of <a href="clockorigin.html">necromancy in Ak'Anon</a>.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, necromancy is alive and well (as it were) in the Mines of Malfunction, where
the rust and decay reflect the power of the Plaguebringer even over inanimate objects.
Here, gnome necromancers, as well as all other members of the Dark Reflection, praise
<a href="thegods.html">Bertoxxulous</a> and gain their power through him.</p>
<p>Since many gnomes are travelers, and since Ak'Anon has traditionally maintained a
&quot;neutral&quot; stance regarding the greater questions of good and evil, most gnomes
have little trouble gaining some kind of acceptance in most cities. Unfortunately, this
does not hold true for the gnome necromancer, as the minions of the Plaguebringer are
quite unpopular. Details important to the <a href="cityfaction.html">gnome on the run</a>
can be found in the information regarding <a href="world.html">the cruel world</a>.</p>
<p>By their very nature, gnomes are intelligent, agile, and dexterous. As a result, all
gnomes would make skilled necromancers if they would simply embrace the path of
Bertoxxulous and practice the dark arts. Sadly, only a select few make that choice. The
rest are therefore doomed to be our eternal slaves in undeath &#150; which works out pretty
well for us necromancers, so I'm not complaining.</p>
<p>Accustomed as we are to living in the caverns, the heat-sensing infravision of gnomes
provides good sight in nearly all conditions. There are also some advantages in being
comparatively small &#150; a gnome can crawl through spaces where a human would have trouble
and a troll could never go. (There are also disadvantages, but I'll leave stories of missed
boats and shallow pool drownings for another time.)</p>
<p>The craft of tinkering is exclusive to gnomes and can provide a great deal of amusement.
Even though many of the known tinkered contraptions aren't terribly useful to the
necromancer, some of them are quite handy.</p>
<h3>Human &#150; Remnant of the Combine</h3>
<p>How the lackluster humans stumbled onto necromancy is anyone's guess. My guess is that
the secrets of the dead were known to the Combine Empire, and the knowledge was never
completely lost. The ill-fated necromancers of <a href="thegods.html">Solusek Ro</a> were
likely human as well, although I've never been able to confirm that.</p>
<p>The true center of human necromancy is found in the Qeynos Aquaducts, where the Bloodsabres
commune with <a href="thegods.html">Bertoxxulous</a> at his shrine.  The human necromancers
of Freeport, members of the Dismal Rage, follow <a href="thegods.html">Innoruuk</a> and are
little more than pawns of the Teir'Dal.</p>
<p>Humans are as common as weeds (although their necromancers are relatively rare).
Coincidentally, the human necromancer is as welcome in common society as the typical
weed &#150; you see them everywhere, but you don't really go out of your way to kill
one unless it happens to be right in front of you.</p>
<p>Even though the average human necromancer is no smarter than a lizard, they're a strong
and hardy bunch compared to other necromancers. Night-blind without magical aid, but strong
and hardy. Bad hair, smelly, ugly, and too big, but strong and hardy. No good recipes for
human meat, but strong and hardy.</p>
<p>Like their erudite cousins, humans can wear some armor that just won't fit on a nonhuman.
It doesn't make them look any better, but what would?</p>
<h3>Iksar &#150; Brood of Kotiz</h3>
<p>In the distant past, in a time known as the Age of the Snake, the iksar were the
slaves of the Shissar, rulers of Kunark. Seeing that the lizardmen were apt pupils,
the Shissar taught them the secrets of necromancy &#150; only to be wiped
out soon thereafter in a tragic god-smiting accident (although rumors hint that
some of the snakemen may have escaped). The iksar continued their studies, becoming
the most primal and violent necromancers in the world. Coincidentally, they also
conquered most of Kunark &#150; only to be nearly wiped out soon thereafter in a
tragic dragon-smiting accident.</p>
<p>During all of this time, the iksar have kept faith with their creator. All of the
classes, necromancers included, follow <a href="thegods.html">Cazic-Thule</a>.
<p>Within the ruined walls of Cabilis, all iksar are viewed with the respect due to
their brood. Beyond those walls, it's lizard season. Even the dark elves are more
popular.</p>
<p>Although the iksar necromancer isn't the brightest torch in the cave, taking longer to
advance in the levels of power than the other necromantically-inclined races, the abilities
inherent to all lizardmen more than compensate. Characteristically, the iksar is as agile
as a dark elf, as dexterous as a gnome, and nearly as strong as a human. The scales common
to all lizards provide extra armored protection, their swimming skills are legendary, and
they can forage food in the wild. Their cold-blooded nature gives them an edge when
resisting fire, although it makes them a bit more susceptable to cold. Those beady
reptilian eyes can sense heat, giving them quite good night vision. Most importantly,
the iksar have a natural health regeneration rate that rivals the trolls, a significant
advantage considering the life-draining nature of some necromantic spells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the necromancers of Cabilis are respected and feared within their own city,
as is proper. The Harbinger wields significant political power, and the scholars in the
Tower of Terror have a number of errands for the ambitious broodling.</p>
<p>There are also a few odd items in the world which can only be used by the iksar.</p>
<h3>Pluses and Minuses</h3>
<p>It should be clear, then, that each race embraces necromancy with different ability and
has to deal with different problems. I've put together <a href="racesum.html">a brief
summary</a> of these differences.</p>
<p>Gnomes are encouraged to peruse <a href="numbers.html">the gory details</a>.  Other races
should ask a gnome to explain things slowly and carefully.</p>

<h2>A Race to the Finish</h2>
<p>&quot;Well then,&quot; many people ask, &quot;which race makes for the best
necromancer?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer depends on what you consider important.</p>
<p>Some would say that the erudites are the best necromancers, since their great intelligence
allows them to focus on other areas when choosing equipment, they're not as widely hated as
other followers of darkness, and they have several excellect quests to pursue.</p>
<p>Others would say that the iksar are obviously the best, their innate regeneration and
other advantages more than compensating for their typically low intelligence, slow advancement,
and poor relations with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Many would say that dark elves are the best necromancers, given their history and
characteristics, with the best vision and the ability to hide.</p>
<p>Some would say that gnomes are clearly superior, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>I'm sure that someone could be found claiming that humans are the best necromancers,
if enough bribe money were offered. If nothing else, human necromancers are somewhat rare.</p>
<p>In truth, the best necromancer is the one who knows how to apply their skills and spells
in any situation, turning living enemies into dead enemies and dead enemies into willing slaves,
and leaving a trail of bloody carnage in their wake. The best necromancer knows how to reap a
harvest of souls alone or with others, and can be counted upon when death is on the line.</p>
<p>The best necromancer can be of any race.</p>
