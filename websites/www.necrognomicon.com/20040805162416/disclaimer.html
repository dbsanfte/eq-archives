<p>Just so there's no misunderstanding, it's important to keep a few things in mind.</p>

<h2>The All-Purpose OOC Disclaimer</h2>

<p>In case you're wondering, this is a fan site dedicated to the massively multiplayer online
role-playing game EverQuest&reg;, which is the source for much of the information and some of the
graphics presented herein. As mentioned below, EverQuest is a Registered Trademark of Sony Online
Entertainment.</p>

<p>No one official is involved with this. Employees of Sony Online/Verant Interactive do not
wander through or make occasional comments.</p>

<p>Any or all of this information may be wrong. Although I do my best to keep the site contents
updated, the world of Norrath is constantly changing. I have not personally verified all of the
information here, particularly with regard to spells that I can't cast yet. Also, despite what I
tell my friends, I do occasionally make mistakes.</p>

<p class=trans>[March 2004 Update: In fact, most of the site is trapped in 2002 and thus
more than a little out of date. That may or may not change in the future.]</p>

<p>Some pieces of information may be considered spoilers. By &quot;spoilers&quot; I mean any
information that you could find out in the course of play. This includes all of the information
regarding equipment, all of the research information, and a number of other things. If you don't
want to know, don't look. The process of exploration and discovery is a wonderful thing &#150; tamper
with it at your own discretion.</p>

<p>I do not condone nonconsensual necromancy. Respect the dead, and the dead will respect you.</p>

<p>If you value your social life, cherish your loved ones, and/or want to spend some time outdoors,
then for heaven's sake don't buy this game.</p>

<h2>And while we're OOC...</h2>

<p>Over the last year, there's been a lot of talk about the general degradation of the necromancer
as a viable class. Powerful for 50 levels despite all of the changes, and then a steep decline
in usefulness after 50; a decline so steep as to be crippling. Weak spell upgrades. Useless
spells. Fragile pets. A general inability to contribute to most fights. A tapering off of power
when other classes grow tremendously. A laughable epic quest. The conversion of a first-rate
damage-dealer to a third-rate support role.</p>

<p>I share your pain, truly. But, my friends...</p>

<p>Get over it. These attitudes are not welcome here.</p>

<p>While I acknowledge that there certainly are problems, I've heard from too many necromancers
who haven't been crippled by them.  There are ways, and there are ways.  If your ways aren't
working, find better ways.</p>

<p>It's also wise to keep in mind that many changes will undoubtedly occur over time.  While
changes tend to be both good and bad, I believe the trend will be in our favor.  To be
completely honest, I believe the trend will be greatly in our favor.</p>

<p>If you have a problem with that, well, write your own book.</p>

<h2>And another thing...</h2>

<p>This site looks best when using Internet Explorer 5 or better. According to the reports I
get, that's what most of you are using. If you're using a different browser and things are
illegible, <a href="mailto:morty@necrognomicon.com">please let me know</a>.</p>
