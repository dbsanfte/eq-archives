<p>I started writing the new version of the NecroGnomicon in April 2001. Things weren't very
regular, and a lot of plans changed in the process. Obviously, I didn't realize how long
things were really going to take.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from June 2001</h2>
<h3>June 12, 2001</h3>
<p>Feh. Nothing like an unplanned career change to throw off your plans.</p>
<p>I'm still working on things, but I needed to take care of a few other details first.  That
being mostly done, I should be able to progress nicely on finishing the site.</p>
<h3>June 5, 2001</h3>
<p>Putting together the new version, I've noticed a few holes in our knowledge.
One of those is research &#150; there doesn't seem to be any record of when a spell
is trivial to research. I'm working on fixing that, but I'll need a lot of help pegging
down some of the numbers. Have a look, and if you help narrow down the range for a spell
or two, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from May 2001</h2>
<h3>May 29, 2001</h3>
<p>Lots of distractions lately, but things are progressing. I may end up skimping on The
Cruel World, but I may not.</p>
<p>The Crystal Caverns have been good to me. Time for another massive killing spree to close
in on those new spells.</p>
<h3>May 22, 2001</h3>
<p>Still writing. What more do you want to know?</p>
<h3>May 15, 2001</h3>
<p>Now that I've actually gotten to writing about it, I realize that I don't really
know much about the starting factions for the other necromancer races. Oh well.</p>
<p>Still, the About Necromancers section should be done by the end of the week. Hopefully
the Tactics section won't take quite so long.</p>
<p>And I <em>still</em> need that graphic. Bah.</p>
<h3>May 8, 2001</h3>
<p>Hmmm.  I have about three weeks, which should be enough time. More screenshots have
been added in the appropriate places, and the About Necromancers section is coming along
nicely. Still need to get that graphic, though.</p>
<h3>May 1, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm still making progress in the conversion, and I still hope to have things finished
by the end of the month. I'm typically getting a few pages done a day.</p>
<p>It's also nice seeing a few people drop in on the message boards. There's not much
there yet, but in time I hope it will be quite a bit more active.</p>
<p>The Circlet of Shadows is a wonderful thing.</p>

<h2>Grumblings from April 2001</h2>
<h3>April 24, 2001</h3>
<p>Writing, writing, writing. And getting more screen shots. It's a busy life for a
gnome, but someone has to do it.</p>
<p>And now I have a deadline &#150; I <b>must</b> have the new site finished for the
Minneapolis Fan Faire (which I'm signed up for), so I can properly promote it. So...</p>
<p>(scribble scribble)</p>
<h3>April 17, 2001</h3>
<p>I'm still writing. I'll need many more pictures than I originally planned for, but
they shouldn't be too hard to get. I didn't get as much done over the last few days as
I had planned, since I was spending time investigating the influence of Bertoxxulous on
the Karana plains.</p>
<h3>April 10, 2001</h3>
<p>The main pages have been put into place, mostly with outlines. A couple of the
sections are going to be a lot larger than I originally thought. Still, I'm pretty
happy with the progress so far. I should be able to get quite a bit of the update
done this week.</p>
<p>It looks like the next Fan Faire will be in my neighborhood, so I feel somewhat
obligated to show up.</p>
<h3>April 3, 2001</h3>
<p>I think I've finally got the style sheet figured out.  I like the look under
Internet Explorer, and it doesn't blow chunks under Netscape.  That will have to
do. Off to conversion...</p>
