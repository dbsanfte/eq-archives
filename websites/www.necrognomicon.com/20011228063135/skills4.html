<p>Even though we gnomes mastered all of the crafting skills back when the other races were
still working on that &quot;fire&quot; concept, the necromancer is poorly suited to a life
of trade. Merchants will overcharge us for the items we need (if they'll sell to us at all),
and they won't give us a fair price when we sell back to them. As if that weren't
enough, most of the things that come out of the various trade skills are of little value
to the dark ritualist. There are exceptions, of course, but for the most part the necromancer
should stick to killing things and raising the dead.</p>

<h2>Trade Skills</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, there are times when you just won't be able to get what you need from
the bleeding carcass of a random passer-by or an uptight merchant. Sometimes you need a
particular item that can only be created by a skilled trade practitioner. When that time
comes, you need to either learn a trade or find someone who has &#150; preferably
a gnome, unless you want inferior goods.</p>
<p>Advancement in a trade skill allows for the creation of more complex and interesting items.
While the basics of any trade can be quickly learned from your local guildmaster, reaching
a respectable level in any of the trades requires a great deal of practice.</p>
<p>Crafting skill is not limited by an individuals experience or by skills in other areas.
Any number of crafts can be practiced and mastered. There does come a point, however, where
advancement in one trade will hold back all others. Only one trade skill may increase beyond
a skill level of 200; the first to reach 201 becomes the &quot;specialized&quot; trade, limiting
the other trades to a maximum of 200. This only becomes an issue for the extremely talented, of
course, since a skill of &quot;merely&quot; 200 is far beyond what most will ever achieve.</p>

			those first smiths were creating all sorts of useful tools to make the mining more
			efficient, combat more deadly, and cooking more convenient. Once the basic
			methods were mastered, most gnomes turned their talents to the more challenging

<h2>Tinkers Local 19</h2>
<p>Many gnomes, regardless of their primary calling or secondary trades, spend a
great deal of time puttering around with mechanical objects. The gnome necromancer
is no exception, seeing in this yet another opportunity to work with things that,
while not actually dead, are certainly not alive.</p>
<p>All gnomes have an inherent tinkering ability, and guild training is neither
required nor possible. The only way to advance in tinkering ability is to fiddle with
the various gizmos. In addition, a great tinkering skill (greater than 200) will not limit
another trade skill's advancement beyond 200. We're that good.</p>

<p>There was once a time, not so long ago, when the less-gifted races of Norrath laughed
at us for our tinkering. Yes, they laughed! Now, of course, things are different.  Now...
well, they still laugh, but a few of the tinkered items are somewhat useful so the
laughing is really more of a snickering. Their time will come, I assure you.</p>

<p>Talk in the workshops of Ak'Anon hints at great tinkering breakthroughs in the future,
but such talk goes on all the time. The pragmatic approach of &quot;Show Me the Gadget&quot;
is usually best.</p>
