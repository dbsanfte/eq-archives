hallmark of the True necromancer is the reanimation of the dead, the transformation
of an inert corpse into a fearsome minion. Certainly, we are also known for the dark
nature of the Power we hold as well as the abject Terror which afflicts the peasantry
upon our approach, but consider: others such as the cabalist are well-versed in magics
of decay and the powers of spirit, and many professions at the Height of their power
inspire trembling in the populace. In our companionship with the Walking Dead, however,
we are alone in Albion's lands.</p>

<p>Of course, our undead companion is not a lumbering dread monstrosity suitable
only for lurking in graveyards and tormenting local farmers; ours is a lumbering
dread monstrosity suitable for defeating Awesome foes and manifesting the power of
Arawn. This great differentiation does not happen of itself, though, and only comes
with increasingly perfected knowledge of the unliving flesh. Thus we find that the
wise Necromancer holds to a simple Motto:</p>

<h2>When accompanied by Horrific Undead creatures it is best to Understand them.</h2>

<p>While necromantic power is easily capable of rending soul from flesh and
consigning enemies to despair, the essence of that power is Death, and living beings
cannot long endure its presence before succumbing to that Dark Embrace. For those
who would bring this Awful Power to the battlefield in defense of the lands,
this presents a problem: How does one contain death without dying?</p>

			&ldquo;No Pets&rdquo; policy.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The solution to this problem is twofold. First, a vessel is acquired to channel
the power, a Lifeless corpse being the natural choice as the very embodiment of Death.
To this end the necromancer invokes the Grim Forces and summons a body from its
place of rest, animating and controlling it with a continuous flow of power. Once
the link between the master and the servant is forged, the full force of Darkness
may be made manifest through the now-undead vessel.</p>

<p>&quot;But wait,&quot; the observant will exclaim, &quot;how does the necromancer
channel the dark power to the minion in the first place without suffering,
and why is that not done exclusively making the minion unnecessary?&quot; The answer
to this is the second key: The Essence of Death is channeled very slowly in
small amounts, just barely enough to maintain control of the servant at close
distances. While this method results in an extremely long summoning ritual,
alternative methods result in an extremely short-lived summoner.</p>

<p>To be certain, there are elements of this arrangement which are less than ideal.
The thread of power that binds the Deceased to the Reanimator is tenuous, making
control of the minion imperfect and subject to slight delay; also, should
the distance between master and servant become too great, the bond is broken
entirely and the summoned corpse falls inert, returning to its grave.
Additionally, the might of the minion is limited by the experience of the necromancer,
such that the summoned one always possesses slightly less vitality than the
summoner, up to the capacity that a particular frame may possess.</p>

<p>Note well that Death can in no way be Cheated. While the reanimated cadaver
walks in the light, the physical form of the necromancer takes its place in the
cold earth. Only the summoner's insubstantial shade remains, invulnerable to mortal attack
but incapable of direct action upon the world. Upon release of the summoned
minion, by choice or by force, the corpse is spirited back to its grave and the
body of the necromancer returns to the paths of the living. Woe to the one who
sends a corpse back marked with the wounds of battle, for Arawn himself will
duplicate those wounds upon the reanimator's flesh in payment!</p>

<h3>An Overview of the Walking Dead</h3>

<p>As a general rule, the longer a corpse has lain in death's embrace the more
difficult it is to summon, yet the more powerful it will be when brought to
the necromancer's service. Thus the beginning of the Dread Path is found in
graveyards of the recently deceased, while the end may be found in the very
Underworld itself.</p>

<p>Let us examine the necromancer's servants each in turn.</p>

<p>Be ever mindful that there are places in the world which possess a magical
nature of their own, for such can weaken (or indeed completely negate) through
the manifestation of their own power that binding link between the necromancer
and the undead. In these places the minion may become unresponsive, or may
seek to remove itself from the area, or may simply be banished back to the grave.
But hold! If you think that these places are those that the uninitiated call holy,
the churches and temples and sacred groves, then you do not comprehend the Truth
of Arawn; these vortices of power are hearthstones and thresholds, doorways and bridges,
and their magic antedates any Cathedral built by mortal hands.</p>
