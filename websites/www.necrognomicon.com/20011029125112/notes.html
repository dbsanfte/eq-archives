<p>While the bulk of the NecroGnomicon might be thought of as generally useful,
this section is pretty much just about me. That's why it's first.</p>
<h2>Please Allow Me to Introduce Myself...</h2>
<p>My name is Morty Undercrypt. As you should have guessed, I'm a gnome necromancer. Even
though I was led to the dark arts through <a href="childhood.html">a childhood tragedy</a>,
I have embraced the powers of death and revel in their use. This has made me somewhat
unpopular in certain circles, but I have <a href="devour.html">ways to cope</a>.</p>

			alt="Peace and quiet."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">I also like to do a little fishing when I have
			the chance.</td>

</center>
<p>Even though the life of a necromancer can be a solitary one, I do enjoy the company
of <a href="friends.html">fellow travelers</a> when the occasion presents itself.</p>

<h2>If Looks Could Kill</h2>
<p>Style is important. Leaving a wanton trail of destruction in your wake is all well
and good, but presenting a suitably foreboding image while you're doing it leaves a
stronger impression in the minds of those whimpering mortals that you choose to spare.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you win half of the style battle just by being a gnome.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="dressed.html">Dressed to Kill</a>: This basic fashion guide to armor
		will give you an overview of some popular necromantic looks.  Don't feel too bad
		if you don't look as good as the models.</li>
	<li><a href="grimtools.html">Grim Tools</a>: When you're heading to a sacrifice, don't
		go empty-handed!  Accessorize that sinister apparel with just the right dagger
		or stick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tarnished Bone Medal</h2>
<p>Every now and then, I'll summon up an undead minion who proves to be far
more worthy than the typical pile of walking bones. These minions are
awarded the Tarnished Bone Medal (posthumously).</p>
<p>Gebartik is the most recent recipient of the Tarnished Bone Medal. There have
been <a href="bonemedal.html">others in the past</a>.</p>

<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/gebartik01.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="You can pick your friends, you can pick your enemies..."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">It was a long night in the Mines of Nurga, and
			Gebartik couldn't be stopped. He consistently interrupted the goblin
			spellcasters, valiantly chased running burynai, taunted like a fiend, and
			brought goblin pain the likes of which they're still talking about. Some minions
			I hate to leave behind. Gebartik was one of the best.</td>

<h2>Dead Men Tell No Tales</h2>
<p>It seemed like a good idea to collect my general ramblings in one place while
I'm still alive and well. When I die and become a full-fledged lich, I'll be too
busy dominating the world for things like that.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="deeps.html">Death in the Deeps</a>: A brief explanation of why I fish.</li>
	<li><a href="harmshield1.html">Harmshield Test #1</a>: Quite a while ago, I asked
		around to find out if Harmshield would protect the necromancer from fatal injury
		during a fall. Nobody could tell me, so I decided to find out for myself.</li>
	<li><a href="fishtrip1.html">Baiting the Hound Pike</a>: A Bloodsabre travel agent
		hooked me up for a vacation day of fishing in Blackburrow.</li>
	<li><a href="gobmines.html">Goblin Legend</a>: What the goblins tell their young.</li>
	<li><a href="undercrypt.html">Ak'Anon No More</a>: Anyone interested in the future
		of Ak'Anon would be well advised to heed this warning.</li>
	<li><a href="scythe.html">A Necromancer's Epic Quest</a>: A chance meeting in the
		woods leads to a vast search for items of necromantic power. I have yet to complete
		my quest, but this is what I've found so far.</li>
</ul>
