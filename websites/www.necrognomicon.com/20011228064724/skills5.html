<p>There are many languages in the world, and they are encountered in both spoken and
written form. While the gnome necromancer has already mastered the only important
language &#150; Gnomish &#150; a study of other languages can be helpful in communicating
with those lesser creatures who are destined to be our slaves.</p>
<p>All languages can be learned by spending enough time with a tutor, who can speak to you
in the language until you understand it. This process won't take long for gnomes.</p>
<p>Some languages can also be learned from your necromantic guildmaster, but the training
sessions are expensive in more ways than one, so finding a tutor is best. Those languages
which can be learned from the guildmaster are noted below. Note that guildmasters will not
train some languages until the necromancer has acheived a certain level of power.</p>

<h2>Common Languages</h2>
<p>There are a few languages which are normally shared by many races. This makes them
broadly useful, and finding an instructor shouldn't be difficult at all.</p>

			ogre howling &#150; only not as pleasant. Nevertheless, as we necromancers
			occasionally deal with such folk, it can be useful on occasion. The interested

<h2>Racial Languages</h2>
<p>Before interracial trade made the Common Tongue the order of the day, the individual races
mostly kept to their own native speech. This was good, since we didn't have to listen to the
prattle of the lesser races.</p>

<h2>Monstrous Languages</h2>
<p>Many of the less adventuresome races (some would say &quot;monsters&quot;) have racial
languages of their own. As a tribute to how low the humans will sink in their trade relations,
all of these races now speak the Common Tongue to a greater or lesser degree.</p>

<h2>Ancient Languages</h2>
<p>There are a few languages that are no longer natively spoken. For some languages, the native
speakers are no longer to be found. For others, the language has evolved so greatly over time
that the modern version bears only a moderate resemblance to its distant beginnings.</p>
