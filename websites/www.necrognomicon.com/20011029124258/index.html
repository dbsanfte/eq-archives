<p>The NecroGnomicon is a work in progress, and large portions are still under
development &#150; see the list at the bottom of the page for what's being
worked on.</p>
<h2>Daily Grumblings</h2>
<h3>October 22, 2001</h3>
<p>Never again will I underestimate the importance of the Flameless Lantern. Who would
have thought that a case of gnomish spirits and a torch could do so much damage?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I've put all of the pieces back together, and managed to add an update.
My summary of the <a href="pettricks.html">Dead Pet Tricks</a> is now available. I've also
received a few helpful updates regarding some of <a href="petstats.html">pet statistics</a>,
which I've incorporated into the table &#150; thanks for the information!</p>
<p>Previous grumblings can be <a href="appendix.html">revisited</a> if you've been too busy
killing things to drop by.</p>

<h2>The Gnomish Guide to What's Inside</h2>
<p>Here's what you'll find in the various chapters of the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Index</a>: You're looking at it now. I really
		hope you already knew that. If you didn't, you may mock yourself and
		proceed.</li>
	<li><a href="notes.html">Morty's Notes</a>: This is where I put all of the
		odds and ends which amuse me but don't really fit anywhere else, such as
		basic introductions, the latest gnomish fashions, and personal stories</li>
	<li><a href="necros.html">About Necromancers</a>: Here you'll find the gory
		details concerning the skills that a Necromancer acquires, racial
		distinctions among Necromancers, and the gods that make it all happen.
		You'll also find a lot of numbers to satisfy that gnomish mathematical itch,
		but don't worry &#150; I've tucked them away so that the lesser races can avoid the
		trouble of trying to comprehend such matters and having their heads explode.</li>
	<li><a href="tactics.html">Tactics of Terror</a>: An overview of hunting techniques and
		safety tips is provided for your pleasure, along with some of the finer points of
		controlling your undead minions.
		<b>Scheduled for Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="trail.html">A Trail of Blood</a>: Follow the progress of the Necromancer
		as the level of their power increases, with comments about spells and pets. A few
		additional words about hunting styles and my own killing grounds are included.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="world.html">The Cruel World</a>: There are places in the world worthy of
		particular attention. I'll note those, and make occasional comments. If you're wondering
		where I am at the moment, that's here too.
		<b>Scheduled for Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>: Join the
		conversation on the message board with general necromantic chit-chat, tales of woe and
		envy, and feedback regarding the NecroGnomicon. Whining is poorly tolerated &#150; there's
		enough of that elsewhere.</li>
	<li><a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>: Archives and links to other sites of interest are
		all stuffed here. It's fit to burst.</li>
</ul>
