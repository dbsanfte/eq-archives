necromancer requires Training in order to pursue the specialized Mastery of our
<a href="spells.html">three bodies of ritual knowledge</a>. Likewise, those insights
gained while fighting in Albion's wars can be crystallized into
<a href="realmabilities.html">abilities useful in battle</a> with the proper guidance.
By Arawn's will, there are Ten initiators who have the capacity to offer these mysteries to
those who have earned them.</p>

<h2>The Arch-Necromancers of the Temple of Arawn</h2>

<p>Those few majestic reanimators who have achieved complete mastery in every aspect
of the Dark Arts may be approached by even the youngest of Arawn's Chosen, for they
are sworn to Teach that which they know, thus continuing the grand tradition and
expanding the Temple's reach into the affairs of the world. Partaking of this boon,
though, will likely necessitate a journey to one of these Demonic Tutors, as they
are not wont to travel far from their stations.</p>

<h3>The Albion Mainland</h3>

<p>It is fitting that we first consider those necromantic Masters who have
made themselves available in Albion's green and pleasant lands, for it is
here that they serve our allies most closely while simultaneously keeping
watch of such Domestic affairs as seems prudent.</p>

<h3>The Shrouded Isles of Avalon</h3>

<p>Since the current hardships of Avalon (and in particular the forbidden necromantic
practices of Morgana) were the immediate causation of Arawn's decision to send
<a href="races.html">the Inconnu</a> in assistance, it is to be expected that
wise Mentors have made themselves available to those who labor for the isles.</p>

<p>Note that Narah is the sole trainer of Disciples; as such, any who would
don the mantle of Necromancer must first demonstrate to her their mastery
of <a href="spells.html">the base spells</a> in combat against the lesser
foes near the harbor.</p>

<h3>The Shores of Atlantis</h3>

<p>Our understanding of the planes forming the Atlantean trials grows daily,
but those highest in Arawn's hierarchy show little interest in establishing any
permanent presence therein, deeming those areas somewhat Unreal. Thus only a
single guide, which some would call merely a Token, stands ready for the
continued training of those Necromancers daring to face the ancient challenges.</p>

<p>These, then, are the Mighty ones who offer their wisdom to guide the Necromancer
on the path of eternal night. Be not afraid to approach them, for despite their
Ineffable power they gladly share the lessons taught them by time and toil.</p>
