<p>Tinkering being the wonderous thing that it is, legends have naturally arisen
concerning what could be built, if only we knew how. Alas, even tinkering has some
limits.</p>

<h2>A Collection of Misfits</h2>
<p>Some of these legendary items seem to be sheer flights of fancy; others were
reportedly created in the long-distant past. In either case, current attempts to
produce any of these items have only met with failure.</p>

	<tr>
		<td class=spell width=200 align=left>Gnomish Goggles</td>
		<td class=com width=325 align=left>This is probably the most popular of the legendary items,
			as its charges would grant the wearer infravision. Quite a few
			people &#150; well, quite a few of those poor humans, anyway &#150; would
			dearly love to have one of these little contraptions and would pay a handsome
			price for it.<hr></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=spell width=200 align=left>Clockworks I, IV, and XI</td>
		<td class=com width=325 align=left>Rumors of tinkering a personal clockwork pet have been
			around for a long, long time. Unfortunately, the tinkering specifics for the
			clockwork rat (I), spider (IV), and gnome (XI) were lost after the creation
			of the clockwork army. This is perhaps best, given their tendency to turn
			rogue.<hr></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=spell width=200 align=left>Jet Pack</td>
		<td class=com width=325 align=left>This unlikely contraption would, according to legend,
			allow the wearer to float freely in the air. I don't see how, really, since
			some of our tinkered items can get pretty heavy. It would presumably be
			black.<hr></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=spell width=200 align=left>Gnomish Tinkered Pistol</td>
		<td class=com width=325 align=left>The &quot;pistol&quot; appears in drawings to be similar
			to a crossbow handle. Not very intimidating, but rumor makes it out
			to be a range weapon of some kind that causes fairly hefty damage.<hr></td>

<p>By all the gods, if you run across any of these things anywhere in Norrath, or stumble
upon the secret to creating one, <a href="mailto:morty@necrognomicon.com">let me know</a>!
Gnomes everywhere will sing your praises.</p>
