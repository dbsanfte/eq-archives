<p>The prime ability of the necromancer is the manipulation of mystical energies through
the means of spells. Mastering these skills is essential.</p>

<h2>Spellcasting Skills</h2>
<p>The dark path begins with the basic ability to channel power and cast spells
in any of the five schools of magic. Other skills require preparation and previous
experience, and the necromancer is encouraged to seek out the nearest guildmaster
to begin that training as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>Necromantic Research</h2>
<p>As the necromancer grows in power and begins wielding more difficult magics, it is
inevitable that <a href="research.html">certain spells</a> will be unavailable from the
local guild merchants. A bit of probing in the guilds of clerics and shadow knights will
turn up a few missing scrolls, but the rest of the spells need to be recreated using the
<a href="words.html">words of power</a> that have been scattered across the world.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Rumors tell of necromantic research being applied
by certain Tailors in the creation of magical vestments. As unlikely as this may
seem, reports of great veracity Confirm that such is the case. &#150; B]</p>

<h2>Specializations</h2>
<p>Specialization is a refinement of the spellcasting techniques used in the five schools
of magic. Advancement in a school's specialization gives various benefits when casting
spells of that school, including reduced mana usage, a lower chance of fizzling the casting,
and a greater chance of avoiding interruptions. As such, the value of specialization becomes
quite apparent in the heat of battle when a fizzled or interrupted spell can lead to an
unplanned death.</p>
<p>At higher levels of specialization, however, the techniques of each school become somewhat
exclusive. As a result, only one school specialization may increase beyond a skill level
of 50 &#150; the first to reach 51 becomes the necromancer's prime specialization, limiting
the other schools to the maximum of 50.</p>
<p>Specializations advance quickly through use, and should not require any guild training
beyond the single session spent to acquire the skills.</p>

			only on the undead, evocation would be a very narrow specialization indeed.<hr></td>

<p>Choosing the proper specialization is worthy of some consideration. Alteration is easily
the most popular choice, followed by Conjuration as a distant second.</p>
