<p>Unlike the common schools of magic where knowledge and mana are enough to succeed,
necromancy touches upon the soul. In this way, necromancers are closer kin to clerics
than to magicians, and necromantic spells must be backed by the power of a deity if they
are to work.</p>

<h2>The Three Corruptors</h2>
<p>At this point in history, all necromancers follow one of three gods, as their own
tradition sets forth.</p>

<h3>Innoruuk, Prince of Hate</h3>
<p><b>Corruption of the Soul.</b> Back in the dim reaches of history, during a time known
as the Elder Age, Innoruuk looked down upon the new creations wandering Norrath with disdain.
Being the generally irritable sort that he is, he took the first elven king and queen to his
domicile in the Plane of Hate and tortured them for a few centuries. When he was finished,
the quivering blobs that remained were molded into the first of the Teir'Dal.</p>
<p>Which means, I suppose, that if you beat a high elf long enough, you'll eventually get a
dark elf. Odd, but that's apparently how it went. I'll have to run some experiments on that
later myself.</p>
<p>There are also some questions here about the fine art of torturing. How do you really know
when you're done? I mean, if you're going to spend centuries torturing someone, why stop at
all? &quot;Well, 258 years of torture is fine, but 259... that's just too much.&quot; The
only sensible plan I can see here is to torture things until you actually need them for
something. Did we really need a god to teach us that?</p>
<p>Where was I? Oh, Innoruuk.</p>
<p>Despite all that, Innoruuk brought necromancy to the world (or the main continent
at least) and all Teir'Dal necromancers turn to him in hatred for their power. A few
humans worship him as well, for reasons that aren't entirely clear &#150; although I'm
sure that if I were human, I'd hate my life too. The humans were no doubt tricked by their
obviously superior neighbors.</p>
<p>The greatest secrets of raising the dead are to be found in the Encyclopedia Necrotheurgia,
which Innoruuk occasionally entrusts to one of his minions for safekeeping.</p>
<p>When push comes to shove in the realms of the gods, Innoruuk counts Cazic-Thule and
Rallos Zek as his allies (to use the term loosely), and he finds himself opposed by	the
Quellious child and the Marr twins, Mithaniel and Erollisi.</p>

<h3>Cazic-Thule, the Faceless</h3>
<p><b>Corruption of the Mind.</b> While the other gods were busily creating races geared
for civilization and progress, Cazic-Thule took another path. Cities crumble, civilizations
fall, and the fruits of progress can be forgotten; jungles and swamps will always remain,
reclaiming lost lands and devouring those foolish enough to cross them unawares. These
murky realms inspired his creation of the mighty trolls and the crafty iksar.  The
children of Thule are the living embodiments of the other races' fears: regenerating
horrors ruled by the dark primal mind, bent on destruction and devouring their enemies.
The other gods went for utility, and Cazic-Thule went for style.</p>
<p>The iksar have followed Cazic-Thule since their creation, and the Lord of the Plane of
Fear serves necromancy well.  The Heretics of Paineel also follow Cazic-Thule &#150; how
and when that particular alliance was formed is unknown to me at this time, and I have yet
to meet an Erudite who can explain it.</p>
<p>In the great squabbles of the gods, Cazic-Thule sides with Innoruuk and Rallos Zek.  His
only devoted enemies are Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr.</p>

<h3>Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer</h3>
<p><b>Corruption of the Body.</b> It is not known when Bertoxxulous first became interested
in the denizens of Norrath, nor is it known when those denizens first called upon him to
fulfill their dark rituals. The histories do not mention his name, although there is some
conjecture that he may have had some part in the destruction of the Shissar. Bertoxxulous
created no race, only taking pleasure in the decay of all races.</p>
<p>The locus of the Plaguebringer's presence in Norrath is the Shrine of Bertoxxulous, which
is tucked away in the Qeynos Aquaducts. From there, his human followers work to bring the
plagues that will consume the land. Rumors hint that the original residents of Paineel may
have followed Bertoxxulous rather than Cazic-Thule, but this remains to be proven. If true,
it could very well explain the creation of the Shrine and the founding of the Bloodsabres.</p>
<p>Gnomes who follow Bertoxxulous are found in the Mines of Malfunction in Ak'Anon, admiring
his presence in the endless rust and deterioration. The beginnings of the Dark Reflection would
be found in the histories concerning Meldrath, were there any remaining.</p>
<p>Of all the gods, Bertoxxulous alone understands that other deities cannot be trusted. This
being the case, he has forged no so-called alliances. Those who oppose him are many, and
include Karana, Erollisi and Mithaniel Marr, Prexus, Rodcet Nife, Tunare, and Rallos Zek &#150;
but they have yet to disturb his plans.</p>

<h2>Notable Failures</h2>
<p>Other gods have dabbled in necromancy to a lesser degree, but have failed to fully support
the black arts. They are worthy of mention, if not praise.</p>

<h3>Solusek Ro, Prince of Flame</h3>
<p>Before the time of the Combine Empire, Solusek Ro took a dislike to the elves of Takish-Hiz
and their verdant forests. In addition to shifting mountains and slowly turning the forested
city into a desert, he forged a powerful band of necromancers known as the Burning Dead. These
grim warlocks, led by Marnek the Wicked, launched constant attacks upon the druids who were
attempting to preserve the forest and the monks who were attempting to preserve the druids.</p>
<p>In time, Solusek Ro won, although the Burning Dead were scattered before the end. The great
elven forest became the Desert of Ro, and Takish-Hiz was buried beneath the sands. The few
surviving druids and monks were driven mad by their loss, and still continue their fight against
the drybone remnants of the Burning Dead army.</p>
<p>Even though the Prince of Flame no longer has a significant following among the necromancers
of the world, he has neither forgotten nor turned away from the black arts. It is well worth
a necromancer's time to visit the Temple of Solusek Ro and converse with those there concerning
items of power.</p>

<h3>Rallos Zek, the Warlord</h3>
<p>In general, the Warlord cares little for the dead, and fails to grasp the immense power
which lies dormant in the fallen warrior. Nonetheless, a few shadow knights manage to tap
his power to raise the occasional skeleton. His influence in necromantic matters is scant
at best.</p>
