<p>The world of Norrath is an interesting and exciting place. This simple truth provides
all of the justification that we need for our quest to gain complete domination of Norrath
with the help of our undead legions.</p>
<p>While we prepare for that eventuality, there are a number of particularly noteworthy
places to be enjoyed.</p>

<h2>Where's Morty?</h2>
<p>Naturally, the most interesting place in the world is the place where I happen to be.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Places</h2>
<p>My necromantic pursuits result in a great deal of travel, and I've had the pleasure of visiting
many parts of the world that are worthy of a necromancer's presence.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="cityfaction.html">Gnome on the Run</a>: Before you wander through Norrath
		looking for a good place to build your Fortress of Darkness, you might want to know
		if the locals will be willing to sell you supplies.</li>
	<li><a href="firepots.html">The Combine Firepots</a>: An ancient ruin of the Combine
		Empire lingers beneath the waves, its power still intact. Every necromancer
		should be familiar with this marvel of wizardly power.</li>
	<li><a href="undercrypt.html">Ak'Anon No More</a>: Anyone interested in the future
		of Ak'Anon would be well advised to take these plans into account.</li>
<!--	<li><a href="index.html">The Graveyard Tour</a>: With all of the dying that goes
		on, there are surprisingly few cemetaries in the world. I've made it a point to
		familiarize myself with all of the ones I could find.</li> -->
</ul>

<h2>Morty's World of Fish</h2>
<p>Ahhh, fishing... the natural extension of necromancy. When I need a break from commanding
the spirits of the dead or planning my conquest of Norrath, I like to find a secluded spot
where I can reel in a few watery delights.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="deeps.html">Death in the Deeps</a>: A brief explanation of why I fish.</li>
	<li><a href="fishtrip1.html">Baiting the Hound Pike</a>: A Bloodsabre travel agent
		hooked me up for a vacation day of fishing in Blackburrow.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you know of a place that I should visit, for hunting or for pleasure, feel free to
give me some directions so I can take a look.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: As he is currently without limbs, Mr. Undercrypt finds
himself unable to follow any directions at the present time. &#150; B]</p>
