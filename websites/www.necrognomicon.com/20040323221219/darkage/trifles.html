the assembly of these Translations, there were certain pages which seemed to be inserted without order,
covering topics of uncertain relationship to the work as a whole. These wayward strands have
been here collected in a fashion that could be considered Haphazard. Do not think that because of
this the faint-hearted or feeble-minded should look within, however, for the dead guard their Lore with
grave abandon. Indeed:</p>

<h2>Even their least secrets are Not to be trifled with.</h2>

<p>Nonetheless, those who are wise in Arawn's ways may find some knowledge here to further their
pursuits, and nothing more could be asked of any dread grimoire.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="power.html">The Price of Power.</a> For those considering a journey on the Road
		of Darkness, it is worth noting that there are both great advantages and great disadvantages
		to be found along the way.</li>
	<li><a href="trainers.html">The Arch-Necromancers of the Temple of Arawn.</a> When the necromancer
		seeks training in the Great Mysteries, one of these Guides must be sought in their
		accustomed haunts.</li>
	<li><a href="staves.html">The Black Market.</a> The necromantic staff, infused with the unsurpassable
		force of Death itself by rituals too gruesome to declare openly, is a vital tool; due to the
		unsavory manner of its creation, however, it has become an item illegal to possess or sell.
		Luckily, Albion holds a brisk trade in such things.</li>
	<li><a href="mausoleum.html">Mausoleum of Fame.</a> Many are the Chosen of Arawn who have

<h3>Looks to Die For</h3>

<p>When calling upon the Undying forces to do your bidding, do not Insult them by sporting some
tattered vest or garish tunic only an elf could love. Look menacing! Powerful! Diabolical!
You will find it worth the extra effort, and it will help to set you Apart from all of those
unfortunate souls who turned Away from the raw power of death and must therefore be
Consumed by it.</p>

&ldquo;To fear death is nothing other than to think oneself wise when
one is not. For it is to think one knows what one does not know. No one
knows whether death may not even turn out to be the greatest blessing
of human beings. And yet people fear it as if they knew for certain it
is the greatest evil.&rdquo;<br>&#150;&nbsp;Socrates
