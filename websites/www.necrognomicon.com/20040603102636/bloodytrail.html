<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: While Mr. Undercrypt included the first sections of his
private journal within his Tactical commentary, he did in fact take notes right
to the very end. Herein is presented his complete hunting list, by level, as far
as it goes. Note again that many of the Comments may no longer reflect
current affairs. &#150; B]</p>

<h2>Follow the Bloody Trail</h2>

<p>I won't say that these are the best places for a Necromancer to hunt,
but they worked for me to a greater or lesser degree. Some of my memories
are a bit blurry, mind you.</p>

<h3>Level 1</h3>
<p>My rampage of death began in Steamfont, like nearly all
other gnome Necromancers. Since killing gnome skeletons
results in a falling out of favor with the Dark Reflection, I
left those alone.</p>

<h3>Level 2</h3>
<p>I was still killing things in Steamfont, there being no
particular reason to move on.</p>

<h3>Level 3</h3>
<p>I remained in Steamfont, taking down a slightly wider
variety of things. I had a short period of freelancing in the
Mines of Malfunction, but I found that to be troublesome.</p>

<h3>Level 4</h3>
<p>And there I was, still in Steamfont. I wandered around more
of the area, seeking kobolds and avoiding pumas. With my
newly-acquired Gate spell, I ventured out into the world
to test my increased necromantic power. Lesser Faydark was
interesting in a panic-stricken sort of way. Greater Faydark
appeared to be much more interesting &#150; until I ran into
my first elf guard. I had no idea how unpopular I would be
there. Stupid elves.</p>

<h3>Level 5</h3>
<p>Steamfont was the easiest place to be, as I was still intimidated
by all of those wandering elf guards in Faydark. I hunted quite
a lot of kobolds.</p>

<h3>Level 6</h3>
<p>Still, I was in Steamfont. Would I never be able to leave this
place? The pickings were slim, but somehow I managed.</p>

<h3>Level 7</h3>
<p>With little to hunt in Steamfont, I braved the elf guards and made
my way to the Butcherblock Mountains. This proved to be full of
worthy opponents, and I was quite pleased &#150; until, with a
shocking sense of deja vu, I got a bit too close to my first
dwarf guard. Upsetting, but corpse recovery was now routine, and
at least the dwarven guards were too lazy to wander around. By
keeping my wits about me, I was able to do quite well both in the
Butcherblocks and, more rarely, in Greater Faydark at the entrance
to Crushbone. <em>[Note: Leave the Crushbone orcs alone. Killing
them lowers an important faction in Neriak, and having access to
the dark elf city later in life is extremely useful.]</em></p>

<h3>Level 8</h3>
<p>Freedom! With Gather Shadows, I was now able to elude the elven and
dwarven guards with ease. I took the cruise to Freeport and
discovered that, while I wasn't precisely loved in that city, I
certainly wasn't hated. The merchants were tolerable, and the
local Necromancers were competent, even though they do not have
the wisdom to follow Bertoxxulous and so must eventually be slain
and used to populate the undead armies that will sweep across the
world and... well, that's later. Based in Freeport, I hunted the
East Commonlands and the Northern Desert of Ro.</p>

<h3>Level 9</h3>
<p>Hunting was still good in the East Commonlands and Northern Ro, but I
had heard stories about a Shrine of Bertoxxulous in the west, and
so I started my pilgrimage. The trip was long and perilous. Things
were particularly bad in Highkeep Pass, where I discovered yet
another set of guards to avoid, but I eventually found my way to
Qeynos. The Shrine of Bertoxxulous is a grand and wondrous place,
and in a way I truly pity all of those unbelievers who will only
view its grandeur after they have been slaughtered and transformed
into faithful servants. My pilgrimage fulfilled, I went on a killing
spree in the Qeynos Hills and the Western Plains of Karana, wandering
occasionally through the Qeynos Sewers for the sake of amusement.
In the process, I made very careful notes regarding how painfully
Holly Windstalker will die when I come into greater power.</p>

<h3>Level 10</h3>
<p>I continued hunting in West Karana, and also took an exploratory trip
to Erudin, where I was resoundly ignored. I then headed back to the
East Commonlands and Northern Ro. I also did some freelancing in the
Nektulos Forest, where I discovered that the roaming halflings were
about as friendly to me as the elves and the dwarves. This time,
however, I was in no way surprised, nor was I alone. Halflings make
good snacks.</p>

<h3>Level 11</h3>
<p>I continued my necromantic rampage in the East and West Commonlands,
with the occasional trek into Northern Ro. It was fast and furious.</p>

<h3>Level 12</h3>
<p>The Commonlands were becoming routine, and it was time for a change.
Now that I was able to Bind Affinity, I headed back across the
Ocean of Tears and returned to Steamfont. It was like old times,
only better. The heretic dead that used to terrorize me were now
just walking piles of bone chips, and the kobolds were beneath my
contempt. I spent a great deal of time near the windmills and in
the minotaur cave.</p>

<h3>Level 13</h3>
<p>The pickings were too good to leave. I remained in Steamfont,
slaughtering minotaurs, harpies, elementals, and anything else
that got in my way. The living was good, but the killing was
better.</p>

<h3>Level 14</h3>
<p>Steamfont suddenly being much less challenging, I once again turned
westward. Lesser Faydark had camps of suitable enemies, but
companions were few and far between and so I continued on. I
visited Dagnor's Cauldron, having never been there before, and did
find opponents worth my time; however, they were found only
infrequently, and far tougher foes than I wished to confront were
also plentiful. I did not tarry. I returned to Antonica to hunt in
the West Commonlands, taking care to avoid the druid ring. I also
spent some time exploring the first two floors of Befallen &#150; quite
the endearing place, I may choose to retire there in my advancing
years &#150; but the depths were beyond my skills, and so I must
return at a later time.</p>

<h3>Level 15</h3>
<p>Although I could feel Befallen calling to me, I avoided it like the...
well, I avoided it. I took some time to tread the outskirts of
Lavastorm, but I did not find the weather to my liking (although
I must make it a point to visit Najena later). Lured by the promise
of good fishing spots, I spent a quite a lot of time in the Oasis
of Marr.</p>

<h3>Level 16</h3>
<p>I spent a bit more time in the Oasis of Marr, and then took a grand
tour. I chose to learn the elements of Research from my home guild
in Ak'Anon, but the Book of Dark Bindings was mysteriously
unavailable there. I consoled myself by purchasing a couple of books
on tinkering and a few of my new spells. I knew that the Shrine of
Bertoxxulous would have my research tome available, and so off I
went again, taking a short detour through the Beholder Maze along
the way. From the Shrine I headed for the Mountains of Rathe, where
I stayed for a while.</p>

<h3>Level 17</h3>
<p>Having grown fond of the mountains, I stayed in the area, occasionally
heading to South Karana or Southern Ro for a change of scenery. If
I had a recipe for basilisk tongue, I'd be rich.</p>

<h3>Level 18</h3>
<p>Why was I still in the Mountains of Rathe? I hadn't been to a bank
in... in... I couldn't even remember. I hustled through the Desert
of Ro, pausing only to bury a few drybones, and made my way back to
Freeport and the long-forgotten bank. Then, with my newly found
wealth, I headed back to Steamfont and finally acquired some
tinkering supplies and set about making myself a fishing pole. With
my new fishing pole in hand, I then headed halfway across the world
to meet some friends in the Beholder Maze for some wholesale
destruction. And then, back to the Oasis of Marr for some massive
orc carnage.</p>

<h3>Level 19</h3>
<p>Enjoying the warm desert clime, I remained in the Oasis of Marr for a
while. Rumors of an undead army then took me to the Qeynos Hills,
where I helped put the unrestful back in their place &#150; I wanted
to march them all to Surefall, but they just wouldn't listen. That
being done, I headed over to East Karana to deal with reavers and
stalkers, but I soon found myself at the undead ruins in West
Karana, where a short bit of hunting was very profitable.</p>

<h3>Level 20</h3>
<p>Naturally, I headed straight for Qeynos to pick up my new spells &#150; or
at least the ones I could find. I then headed for South Karana to
deal with the overgrowing aviak population. For variety I wandered
into East Karana to deal with gorge hounds, dark stalkers, and the
Mucktails. Attempts to hunt in North Karana generally turned out
poorly.</p>

<h3>Level 21</h3>
<p>It was time to return. I entered Befallen once more. I joined with a
company of three, and we were able to hold our own in the basement,
much to our pleasure. From there I wandered off to South Karana for
aviak hunting, with occasional runs to East Karana for undead reavers,
gorge hounds, and the occasional griffawn. Things were going slowly
until I teamed up with a wizardly friend of mine and headed for the
Ocean of Tears, where we reduced the isle goblin population.</p>

<h3>Level 22</h3>
<p>I sailed straight into Freeport, headed for the Necromancer guild, and
learned how to dodge. Ahhh, how nice. I decided to take a break
from the brisk sea breezes and headed back to the Karanas for a
spot of hunting, but the view there becomes monotonous. I trundled
off to Najena for a while, where I picked up some amusing trinkets.
Then it was back to the Karanas, tracking down the remains of the
Splitpaw clan... then back to the Ocean of Tears to deal with
pirates... back to the Karanas... and back to the Oasis of Marr.
All in all, it took far too long.</p>

<h3>Level 23</h3>
<p>The Oasis held little to interest me after my hunting companions
departed, and so I went off to the Karanas. South Karana, although
highly overpopulated, still provided reasonable hunting both groups
and solo. East Karana was an excellent soloing ground &#150; most of
the wandering nasties were weak and left me alone, and the stronger
ones provided me with a good hunting experience. With my bony
companion I was able to take down Broon, which was some
well-deserved payback.</p>

<h3>Level 24</h3>
<p>Ahhh, the power! The power! I could scarcely contain my necromantic
glee after I picked up my new spells at the Shrine of Bertoxxulous.
South Karana was still overpopulated but full of prime targets, and
so hunting commenced. I then teamed up with a few guildmates and
headed for the Rathe Mountains, where we took down any giant
skeleton or cyclops that we could find. Absolute bloody carnage.
Ha!</p>

<h3>Level 25</h3>
<p>Since I was in the neighborhood, I killed a few more of the South
Karana aviaks before wandering off. I followed a few friends into
Everfrost, and after carefully avoiding the ignorant barbarians
(oh, their time will come, I assure you!) we dealt with a
particular tribe of snowy orcs. Then I spent a bit of time in the
Estate of Unrest, which tended to be either exciting or terrifying,
and paid another visit to Najena.</p>

<h3>Level 26</h3>
<p>I was feeling restless, but not particularly adventurous. I stuck to
places I was familiar with: South Karana, the Ocean of Tears, and
the Estate of Unrest. Coincidentally, these happened to be places
where I could collect the pieces for the Harvester of Shadows,
which I then acquired from those nice folks who follow Solusek Ro.</p>

<h3>Level 27</h3>
<p>I was having a hard time staying focused, and my hunting was limited
to short periods of time. As a result, I spent almost all of my
time alone in South Karana. Just me, my bony companion, and 50
rabid druids at any given point in time.</p>

<h3>Level 28</h3>
<p>The new clan in Paw is tougher than the old one, but with some friends
I was able to get in a little deeper for some more satisfactory
bloodshed and destruction. I later paid a visit to some Erudites
in Lake Rathetear, who were not terribly friendly. I then wandered
all about Norrath collecting the bits and pieces required for
shadowbound armor.</p>

<h3>Level 29</h3>
<p>More power! Mua ha ha! Suddenly, killing became much easier. I
completed my set of shadowbound armor, and then headed back to the
Rathe Mountains. With friends there, we brought down whatever
cyclops or giant would cross our path.</p>
<p><em>It was at this point in time that passage was secured to the
previously lost continent of Kunark, where gnomish curiosity took
over.</em></p>
<p>So much to explore... After arriving at the shipyards, I spent a
short bit of time hunting in the Overthere, but most opponents were
either too difficult or not worth my time. I moved on, and did a
great deal of wandering (but not much hunting) in Warsliks Woods
and the Field of Bone. While I was wandering the Woods, and after
several disagreements with iksar bandits, I came upon a cavern
system that the bandits must call home. I killed them. My
underground trek led me directly to the depths of the goblin mines
in the Lake of Ill Omen, which I proceeded to haunt with a
vengeance.</p>

<h3>Level 30</h3>
<p>After securing my place in goblin folk tales, I headed back into the
sunlit lands surrounding the Lake of Ill Omen. A trip into the
sarnak fortress proved quite interesting, as did a short bit of
hunting with a few friends in the Frontier Mountains. I then
wandered about, killing things here and there, finally finding
myself in the Rathe Mountains once again. When a few friends
joined me, a simple evening of hunting turned into a
slaughter-anything-bigger-than-an-ogre killing spree, which was
both profitable and fun.  We also discovered that, despite her
words to the contrary, Cynthia's comrades really don't like her
much at all and will do little to avenge her death.</p>

<p>I also made a special trip to the Qeynos Hills to visit my dear
friend, Holly Windstalker. Ahhh.</p>

<h3>Level 31</h3>
<p>The Rathe Mountains remained enjoyable and continued to fill my
pockets with coin. There was much bloodshed. When I ran low on
bone chips, I wandered over to the undead shrines in the Feerott.
Quite satisfying, and it seems like the time just flew by.</p>

<h3>Level 32</h3>
<p>I could have stayed in the mountains for quite a while, but my
gnomish wanderlust took over. I hopped on a raft and made myself
comfortable in the Overthere once again. Hunting was quite a bit
more successful than my original attempts there, and I was able
to refine my necromantic skills both alone and in the occasional
group. I also began proving myself to the dull-witted minions of
Venril Sather, for what that will be worth.</p>

<h3>Level 33</h3>
<p>A few more kills in the Overthere provided some entertainment before
I joined a few guildmates in the Frontier Mountains. Why do
mountains seem to provide the best carnage? I then took a side trip
to the area near Firiona Vie, but that wasn't nearly as
satisfying &#150; there's a smell there that just bothers me. Too
many elves, perhaps. So back to the mountains it was, first the
Frontier Mountains, and then the Rathe Mountains.</p>

<h3>Level 34</h3>
<p>Feeling the call of greater power, I took a short break from the Rathe
Mountains carnage to visit the necromantic guilds in Neriak and
Freeport to pick up more necromantic rites. I went quickly back to
the carnage, of course. The Overthere kept me busy, with occasional
visits to nearby areas.</p>

<p>It was at this point in time that my gnomish brethren finally broke
through the Iceclad Ocean, clearing the path to Velious. Naturally,
my gnomish curiosity took over once again.</p>

<h3>Level 35</h3>
<p>After all this time, I've finally discovered where I truly belong.
Yes, I was meant to be a pirate. Yarrr! After getting to know my
long-lost compatriots, I helped keep their camp secure by eliminating
some of the local threats.  A brief excursion into the Tower of
Frozen Shadow left me with a desire to explore it even further,
but I was called away to the Great Divide for a grand hunting
expedition. Many things died, most of them taller than myself.
A wizardly friend of mine then whisked us away to Kunark, where
we visited the Mines of Nurga.</p>

<h3>Level 36</h3>
<p>Since I was in the neighborhood, I headed back to the Overthere for
some quick carnage. The quick carnage became massive carnage.
It was good.</p>

<h3>Level 37</h3>
<p>I wandered away from the Overthere to join a few friends not far from
the eyesore that is Firiona Vie. Despite that persistent elf smell,
we managed to distract ourselves with drolvargs, frogloks, and
leeches. After a bit, my friends left. I was on a roll, so I stayed.</p>

<h3>Level 38</h3>
<p>I picked off a few more frogloks, and then realized that I hadn't seen
the inside of a bank for a while. Back to the Overthere I went with
my overfull bags. Naturally, I killed a few things on the way in.
Then I killed a few more things on the way out. Then I joined up
with a few trolls and dark elves and killed quite a lot more.
It was a necromantic picnic.</p>

<h3>Level 39</h3>
<p>Getting my priorities in order, I took a break from the slaughter to
chat with an ogre in the Overthere and bribe him for my latest
summoning of the undead. I then found my way back to Ak'Anon and
the Mines of Malfunction to acquire the rest of my new dark rituals.
But where to give things a try? Out of curiosity, I headed into
the depths of RunnyEye, not for any serious killing, but to verify
the rumors of the goblin bankers &#150; true! I then headed off
to the Temple of Droga to see if they had a banker as well. They
do not, although I had to kill rather a lot of them to find out.</p>

<h3>Level 40</h3>
<p>I refused to believe that such a large goblin tribe had no bank, so I
interrogated a few more goblins in Droga. Again, the results were
inconclusive. I wandered off and killed, well, a lot of other things,
but this puzzling goblin enigma wouldn't leave my mind. I went back
and questioned more goblins about their monetary habits, just to be
sure.</p>

<h3>Level 41</h3>
<p>My search for goblin bankers pulled me from the Temple of Droga to the
nearby Mines of Nurga, where further interrogations revealed no signs
of banking whatsoever. On the invitation of a friend, I headed off to
the Ocean of Tears for a bit of island hunting, but again, I couldn't
stop thinking about those Kunark goblins. Convincing myself that I
had simply overlooked something, I headed back to Nurga.</p>

<h3>Level 42</h3>
<p>Back in the Mines of Nurga, I made another thorough investigation of the
area and put quite a few of the more experienced goblins under
pressure to answer my questions. They were stubborn, but I continued
my questioning until one of them suggested I go deeper in the cave.
(Those weren't his exact words, but I'm sure that's what he meant.)
Plunging further in brought me to a large spider nest, and I could
hear burynai in the distance. This explained things; there must have
been a bank and other amenities such as the goblins are familiar
with, but the areas were overrun by these pests. I tried interrogating
a few spiders to verify my theory. I thought they were being even more
stubborn than the goblins, but then I remembered &#150; spiders can't
talk. Silly me.</p>

<h3>Level 43</h3>
<p>Having come up with a reasonable explanation for the lack of goblin banking
facilities, I headed back to the Overthere and the only Kunark bank I'm
familiar with. On the way in, I could barely walk 20 paces before
stumbling over another sarnak. It seemed clear to me that there were
too many of these things, so I promptly set about killing the sarnak
hoards. It was an enjoyable sort of work, not unlike tending a graveyard
on a chill autumn evening.</p>

<h3>Level 44</h3>
<p>Suddenly, I realized that I had advanced to a new circle of spells. I went
off to visit my guild in Ak'Anon, tinkered for a bit, and then returned
to Kunark. I had heard rumors that the Dreadlands were crawling with
unpleasant beasts, and so I made my way there. The rumors were true,
and finding some like-minded fellows up for a bit of slaughter wasn't
difficult. Before too long, though, a questing friend requested my
company in the Burning Woods. Off I went. We engaged in the sort of
mad, nonstop killing spree that I prefer, but did not find what we
were looking for.</p>

<h3>Level 45</h3>
<p>Following up on a tip provided to me by a fellow necromancer, I made my
way to the Crypt of Dalnir. The legends concerning the Visceral Dagger
proved to be true, much to my pleasure. Leaving the Crypt, I wandered
back to the Dreadlands, with the occasional excursion back into Nurga
to exterminate some spiders. Why are mines so hard to keep clean?</p>

<h3>Level 46</h3>
<p>I realized that I'd spent a great deal of time lately underground. While
that's all fine and good, I thought a bit of fresh air would be a nice
change. I spent a little more time in the Dreadlands, and then went
back to Velious for a bit of giant-killing. The brisk winds and the
snow, accompanied by the sound of toppling giants, were just what I
needed.</p>

<h3>Level 47</h3>
<p>I was having quite a good time with the giants, but the opportunity arose
to join up with some of my friends in the Crimson Legacy and pay a
visit to Chardok. It was quite educational, despite that unique smell
that only sarnak seem to have. Afterwards, I returned to the
conveniently-close Dreadlands for a while, only to have yet another
opportunity come up &#150; an assault on the Plane of Fear, again led
by the Crimson Legacy. It was death on a grand scale, and quite
enjoyable all around. Back in Norrath, I indulged in some simpler
killing in Trakanon's Teeth and, yes, the Dreadlands again. During
this time, I was also gathering reagents in the first steps of an
epic necromantic quest.</p>

<h3>Level 48</h3>
<p>I killed a few more Dreadlands denizens, then wandered to the Burning
Woods for a picnic before returning to civilization.<br><br>
<em>While my back was turned, some meddling wizard opened up a portal
to the moon. The moon, of all places! Gnomish curiosity grabbed me
by the head and dragged me away.</em><br><br>
Wandering about on Luclin proved less than entirely fruitful. While
the sights were certainly interesting, my time was mostly spent in
the Grimling Forest and the Tenebrous Mountains. I also spent some
time conversing with a fellow necromancer in the Echo Caverns, who
shared some useful necromantic spells I'd not seen previously. With
that, I returned to Norrath to plague the residents of the Lesser
Faydark before coming full circle back to the Dreadlands.</p>

<h3>Level 49</h3>
<p>At the first opportune moment, I returned to Ak'Anon and purchased the
last spells that the Dark Reflection would sell me; I have learned all
that they have to teach. With those additions to my spellbook, I
traveled to Luclin to glean what knowledge I could from the
necromancers there, and brushed up on my research abilities. Then,
in a surprisingly casual way, I returned to Kunark and murdered
most of the inhabitants of the Dreadlands.</p>

<h3>Level 50</h3>
<p>To celebrate my new power &#150; and indeed, when I first began my studies
of the dark arts I considered this the pinnacle of success &#150; I returned
to the Plane of Fear with my guildmates. After a fair bit of slaughter there,
I headed to the western portions of Kunark to test my necromantic skills in
Skyfire. While that was interesting, it was also troublesome; I soon packed up
my gear and moved to the Burning Woods, where the wurms were less magically
inclined and the walking dead were plentiful. To pass some time, I joined up
with a few friends and we fought our way into Chardok, the Sarnak fortress.
We did not reach the Grand Herbalist on that trip, so I began my study on
what would be necessary to penetrate deeper into the fortress. I returned to
the Burning Woods and resumed my hunting, leaving only to assist my guildmates
in their ongoing war with the giants of Kael Drakkel.</p>

<h3>Level 51</h3>
<p>I continued my hunt in the Burning Woods for a short while before making my
way to the Overthere docks and purchasing a few spells. After adding them to my
spellbook, I joined some friends on Luclin for several rousing hunts in the
Umbral Plains. After the fine killing there, I resigned myself to a task that I
had been putting off for, well, quite some time &#150; I headed to the Ocean of
Tears and began my search for the Ancient Cyclops. How can such a large creature
hide on such a small island? I did eventually find him, although a few of the
neighboring seafuries were killed to break the tedium. That being done, I
rejoined the fighting in Kael Drakkel for a while. When the fighting had died
down for a bit, I returned to the moon with a few guild friends for some
hunting in Maiden's Eye. That went well, but duty soon pulled my companions to
other destinations. I returned to the Burning Woods for a relaxing time of
carnage and destruction.</p>

<h3>Level 52</h3>
<p>When I realized I had gained enough power to utilize the scrolls I had been
carrying, I immediately sat down and attempted to scribe the first into my
spellbook. Of course, I was still deep in the Burning Woods, and before I could
finish, a wandering hornet came by and stung me. Bah! My undead minion made short
work of it. I began scribing again. Another hornet stung me. My minion destroyed
it. I moved a few steps away from the cluster of hornets and began scribing again,
only to be knocked over by a tottering ape. That one I destroyed myself. I looked
around, sat down again, and nearly completed scribing the first scroll before a
Sarnak champion kicked my book out of my hands. This absurd mockery of necromantic
study continued for a while. When I did eventually get the scribing done, I was
surrounded by corpses &#150; which, I suppose, is not entirely inappropriate.</p>
