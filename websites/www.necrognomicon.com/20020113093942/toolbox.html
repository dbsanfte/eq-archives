<p>Tinkering is a fine gnomish pursuit with a long and troubled history. Before
getting too far into the toolbox, it's wise to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<h2>The Nuts and Bolts of Tinkering</h2>
<p>First off, keep in mind that there are many stories regarding what can and cannot
be tinkered, whether certain items even exist, and how difficult it is to advance in
skill. Remember that before you start spending thousands of platinum pieces on
components that you've never heard of.</p>
<p>That being said, the process of tinkering is easily embraced by the gnomish intellect,
and can be broken down into six easy steps.</p>

<h3>Find the Tinkers</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox1.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Bom Knotwood is the tinker's tinker."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Nearly everything you need to start out your tinkering
			career can be acquired from Bom Knotwood in Steamfont. Old Bom isn't on the best
			of terms with the Dark Reflection, so don't expect him to cut you any deals.
			You can usually find him puttering around with windmill gears.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">When you get to advanced tinkering and Bom doesn't have
			what you need, Rylin Coil in Ak'Anon can give you some further direction. Look
			for Rylin and his assistant in the lower caverns.</td>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox2.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="It's amazing how he keeps everything free from rust."></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox3.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Tin Merchant V needs to have his black box adjusted."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">If you're stuck in Kunark, a few standard tinkering supplies
			are available from Tin Merchant V at the outpost in the Overthere. The prices aren't
			very good, so it's only useful for picking up an extra cork or two if you happen to
			need one. If you're curious about the presence of our clockworks in a primarily
			Teir'Dal outpost, all I can say is, &quot;Mua ha ha....&quot;</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">Adinel Jailbar, currently with the Pirates of Iceclad, has
			a number of items which the master tinker will be thrilled with. Apprentices will
			likely find the recommended experiments far too costly, and are advised to practice
			&quot;traditional&quot; tinkering before moving on to most of the new gadgets.</td>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox4.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Yarrr, me tinkering mateys!"></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Study Your Gimblestan</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox5.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="True tinkers will keep their own journals, too."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">The legendary tinker Gimblestan wrote a number of journals
			regarding his experiments and his travels. Many of those volumes have been lost
			over time, consumed in explosions or dissolved in acid when a particular passage
			wasn't properly understood. The remaining journals have been faithfully copied and
			contain the tinkering recipes for many popular items. Every gnome should be proud
			to have the complete Journals of Gimblestan in their library.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Acquire a Toolbox</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">The toolbox is the centerpiece of tinkering. You can't tinker
			without one. Standard toolboxes are usually available from the same vendors who sell
			the components; a smith can also forge one fairly easily. The Pirates of Iceclad offer
			a larger and better-equipped Deluxe Toolbox, which their advanced recipes require.</td>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox6.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Even a beginning smith can fashion a useful toolbox."></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Trade All of Your Platinum for Components</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox7.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="I hate this part."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">Unless you're limiting yourself to Animated Bait and the
			like, you're going to be spending vast quantities of coin to get the fiddlybits
			that you'll need. Put a wrench in your coinpurse and accept it. Tinkering isn't
			cheap.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Insert Part A Into Slot B</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250">Follow the instructions for the item that you're attempting
			to create. Place each required item into your toolbox, making sure that nothing is
			stacked. When all of the items are in the toolbox, invoke the Spirit of Gimblestan
			and combine them.</td>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox8.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Find a place where you won't be disturbed."></td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Cackle or Curse</h3>
<center>
<table border=0 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=10>
	<tr>
		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/toolbox9.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Success!"></td>
		<td class=story width="250">You are now either holding your newfangled invention with
			pride, or cursing the gods and bashing your head into a nearby wall. Either way,
			you may have learned something from the attempt if the item provided enough of a
			challenge.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>Such is the fate of the tinker.</p>
