am I? Well you may ask; indeed, the very question lies at the Heart of all knowledge.
While I shall for now keep my True name from prying eyes, it is Fitting to provide
some Measure of myself that my words may be Suitably judged. Allow then this
brief Moment wherein I may put aside the Work for a glance at the Worker.</p>

<h2>Please allow me to Introduce myself...</h2>

<p>I am called Bifrons Shroudweaver. As is often apparent, I am an Inconnu necromancer
in the service of Arawn. Of late, this service has taken the form of scribing the Grim
Lore of our art, the Translation of this tome.</p>

<p>Although I find Caer Gothwaite much to my liking, my future lies in Inishail Island.
When the stars are right, I shall in those ancient grounds raise up a Citadel to serve
as a mortiferous Beacon; the endless Catacombs beneath shall serve as the Barracks
of my legions, and beneath the Crypts will be found such works of the Dark Arts as
send Pious men to tremble before their hollow altars. And when the Candles appear upon
the Graves of the world, and the army of the dead outnumbers the armies of the living,
Order shall be restored to these lands in the Peace of Arawn. Those who bear Witness
to these days shall ask, &ldquo;Whence came this dread company?&rdquo; But none shall
think to look to abandoned Inishail.</p>

&ldquo;Let children walk with Nature, let them see the beautiful blendings and
communions of death and life, their joyous inseparable unity, as taught in woods
and meadows, plains and mountains and streams of our blessed star, and they will
learn that death is stingless indeed, and as beautiful as
life.&rdquo;<br>&#150;&nbsp;John Muir
