<p>Although the rudiments of spellcasting are still under study, the young necromancer
is ready for more challenging spells and a wider array of victims. Important lessons are
being learned, although it's still a bit early for individual styles to develop and show.</p>
<p>Now is the time to visit your necromantic guildmaster and learn the basics of Meditation.
While contemplating your spellbook's runes, you will gather mana faster than you would by
merely sitting and observing the countryside. (In due time, burying your head in the
spellbook won't be necessary, but that's a long way off.)</p>

<h2>Level 4 Spells</h2>
<p>Several key spells are introduced to the necromancer at this level, including Fear and
Clinging Darkness, which will soon become trusted favorites in the magical arsenal.</p>
<p>The School of the spell reflects which <a href="skills2.html">magical skill</a> is called
upon.  Mana is drained from your mana pool immediately upon casting the spell; if you do not
have enough mana to cast a spell, you will know when you make the attempt. Cast Time is in
seconds. Reagents must be in your inventory to complete the spellcasting, and are consumed
every time the spell is cast &#150; so save up your bone chips.</p>

			the battle when they realize that they are losing, and they begin to run away.
			This can cause problems, as they may very well be running towards reinforcements.
			The Darkness spells turn that running away into a crawl, or a complete standstill;
			your cowering enemy will stand there helpless as you administer the finishing
			touches. The value is obvious. Darkness is also a good choice for pulling
			targets towards you, as they approach you slower and give you extra time to get
			into position or cast another spell. Embrace Darkness. Druids call this Snaring,

<h2>Tactics</h2>
<p>With Fear and Darkness, two more tactics become available to the necromancer. They won't
be useful immediately, since the mana cost will be prohibitive at these lower levels, but
together they provide a valuable means to defeat powerful enemies.</p>

<h3>Kiting</h3>
<p>One your enemy has been striken with Darkness and is running slowly, you can easily
outpace them. Run ahead of them, stop, then turn and cast a damaging spell on them. Repeat
until your enemy is dead.</p>
<p>The advantage to this tactic is that it avoids getting your head beaten in by something
stronger than you.</p>
<p>The disadvantages are many, however. If you're using a pet, your enemy will likely stop
to kill your pet before it chases after you, which can be a drain on mana and bone chips.
Also, all of our &quot;damage over time&quot; spells do less damage if your victim is
running towards you, so you'll end up using more mana to cause damage. Since most of our
damage is done through pets and damage over time, this isn't a terribly good tactic for
necromancers, but it is possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have an even better tactic.</p>
<h3>Fear Kiting</h3>
<p>Fear Kiting is similar to standard Kiting, with one important exception. After the target
has been hit with Darkness, strike them with Fear. They will then run away, slowly, while you
cast more spells on them and your pet rips apart their backside.</p>
<p>The advantages are amazing. Properly engaged, the enemy is doing no damage to you, your
damage over time spells are working to maximum effect, your pet is in no danger, and (if you
keep a proper distance) you can recast Fear or Darkness as necessary without interruption. This
tactic will allow you to defeat opponents significantly more powerful than yourself.</p>
<p>The disadvantages are important to know too, though. The most significant restriction is a 
necessity for space. Since you cannot control the course of the Feared enemy, you need to be
fairly certain that they won't be running into others who would assist them. Large open spaces
are generally the best choice. Fear Kiting can also be a severe drain on mana if multiple
castings of Darkness and Fear are necessary. Furthermore, if Fear is resisted or when it wears off,
the enemy will almost certainly head directly for you and ignore your pet, even if it's taunting.</p>
<p>This tactic isn't very popular in groups with most melee folk, as they dislike having to chase
their enemy around. Rogues seem to enjoy it, though.</p>
<p>The disadvantages, though, are small compared to the advantages. Fear Kiting is a standard
necromantic tactic. Learn it.</p>

<h2>Hunting Grounds</h2>
<p>At these levels, you should be exploring the edges of your previous hunting grounds. Begin
venturing farther away from your hometown, but be careful.</p>
<p>Gnomes will still be in Steamfont, hunting kobolds and clockworks. There's also good hunting
to be found in the Butcherblock Mountains, right in the first area you see when you enter from
Greater Faydark. Watch for guards.</p>

<h2>Morty's Bloody Trail</h2>
<p>Again, my early journals aren't terribly interesting. Here they are, nonetheless.</p>

<h3>Level 4</h3>
<p>And there I was, still in Steamfont. I wandered around more of the area, seeking kobolds
and avoiding pumas. With my newly-acquired Gate spell, I ventured out into the world to test
my increased necromantic power. Lesser Faydark was interesting in a panic-stricken sort of way.
Greater Faydark appeared to be much more interesting &#150; until I ran into my first elf guard. I had
no idea how unpopular I would be there. Stupid elves.</p>
<p><i>(Note: The elven guards no longer try to kill me, and I'm not sure why. I don't recall
doing anything that would impress them terribly much. I've also seen young gnome necromancers
making their way in Kelethin without fear. Either things have changed, or the elves are easier
to impress than I imagined. Still, be cautious.)</i></p>

<h3>Level 5</h3>
<p>Steamfont was the easiest place to be, as I was still intimidated by all of those wandering
elf guards in Faydark. I hunted quite a lot of kobolds.</p>

<h3>Level 6</h3>
<p>Still, I was in Steamfont. Would I never be able to leave this place? The pickings were slim,
but somehow I managed.</p>

<h3>Level 7</h3>
<p>With little to hunt in Steamfont, I braved the elf guards and made my way to the Butcherblock
Mountains. The mountainous terrain proved to be full of worthy opponents, and I was quite
pleased &#150; until, with a shocking sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, I got a bit too close to
my first dwarf guard. Upsetting, but corpse recovery was now routine, and at least the dwarven
guards were too lazy to wander around. By keeping my wits about me, I was able to do quite well
both in the Butcherblocks and, more rarely, in Greater Faydark at the entrance to Crushbone.</p>
<p><i>(Note: Leave the Crushbone orcs alone. Killing them lowers your standing with an important
faction in Neriak, and having free access to the dark elf city later in life is extremely useful.)</i></p>
