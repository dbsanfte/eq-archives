<p>The art of surviving a typical exploration trip depends not only upon black magic and
a keen blade. Sometimes, just knowing which way you're heading can make all the difference.</p>

<h2>Adventuring Skills</h2>
<p>Even though all of these skills are immediately available to the neophyte necromancer,
it requires a great deal of practice to advance them. No guild training is necessary, nor
is such training recommended. Seriously, if you need a guildmaster to show you how to drink,
you should consider a less challenging profession &#150; I hear that the Deathfist Clan is
recruiting new pawns.</p>

			skill, some may find it amusing to pose as a beggar, and then blast uncharitable
			souls into oblivion when they refuse to cough up some change. Begging techniques can
			be practiced on the raised dead, who conveniently provide the typical response.<hr></td>

<p>In all honesty, these skills are primarily for convenience, and neglecting them won't
get you into much trouble (although if you neglect swimming, you'd best stay out of the
water).</p>
