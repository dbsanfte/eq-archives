<p>When I first stumbled across Venenzi Oberzendi in the darkness of Nektulos Forest, I gave it
little thought. After our short conversation, however, I realized that I had happened upon
some of the most powerful necromancers still alive. And thus my quest began.</p>
<p>If you want to find out for yourself what these folks are up to, now would be a good time
to turn your attention somewhere else.</p>
<p>In the interest of recordkeeping, I'll note my conversations as they took place. I won't
include my mumbling.</p>

			You say, &quot;Who is your master?&quot;<br><br>
			Venenzi Oberzendi says &quot;You do not know of my teacher? The great Kazen Fe'cae! I am

			Lake Rathetear and tell Kazen you wish to study the dark arts.&quot;<br><br>

			You say, &quot;What great project?&quot;<br><br>
			Venenzi Oberzendi says &quot;I'm not sure what he is planning on doing. Perhaps he plans

			You say, &quot;I wish to study the dark arts.&quot;<br><br>
			Kazen Fecae looks you up and down, his eyes glowing with a soft red light. After a moment

			you prove yourself to follow the twisted path. If you prove to be as coldhearted as I then
			I will let you become my servant.&quot;<br><br>
			You say, &quot;How can I prove to be as coldhearted as you?&quot;<br><br>
			Kazen Fecae says &quot;The wandering 'knight' Sir Edwin Motte recently slew one of my lesser
			servants. This foolish knave travels from town to town pretending to be 'good.' Separate
			his head from his body and return it to me so I may work my magics upon it. This fool will

			&quot;This poor fool here &#150; I think I will keep him in my bag from now on. You have
			done well, my new apprentice. Take this symbol and know that you can do other tasks to

			gives you and he will instruct you. If I give you a symbol, speak its name to me so I
			may instruct you.<br><br>

			and bone.&quot;<br><br>
			You say, &quot;What is the symbol of the apprentice?&quot;<br><br>
			Kazen Fecae says &quot;You have a long way to go before I teach you the true secrets
			of life and death. Visit Venenzi Oberendi in the Nektulos forest and show her the
			symbol. She is collecting reagents for one of my experiments and is taking far too
			long. I do not wish her dead, yet. I simply need the reagents soon. Retrieve the
			reagents and give them to my assistant Emkel Kabae. I do not wish to handle them
			myself.&quot;<br><br>
			You say, &quot;What reagents is she collecting?&quot;<br><br>
			Kazen Fecae says &quot;The reagents are the same types the great sorcerer Miragul
			used to cheat death and become a lich. I do not wish to become a lich as Miragul did,
			I have greater aspirations than to simply live forever as a hollow shell. I will rise
			up a being of spirit only, with a will of my own.&quot; Kazen's eyes glow sickly red
			as he stares off toward the horizon.</td>

<p>I'm still attempting to find the manisi herb in Chardok. I don't find myself in the company of a
small army very often, so my visits are few and far between. If you're planning on paying the sarnaks
a call and wouldn't mind some necromantic company, <a href="mailto:morty@necrognomicon.com">let me
know</a> and I'd be happy to accompany you. In return, when my undead legions hold Norrath in their
bony fingers, your army will hold a place of honor in the fright-filled minds of the cowering
population.</p>
