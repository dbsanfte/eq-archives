<p>Not far from Qeynos there lies a fishing paradise, sequestered in a
series of caverns. Underground springs feed pools and streams that quickly
collect into a single deep lake. The water is clear and cold, there's plenty
of shoreline, and the fish are always biting.</p>
<p>The gnolls are always biting too, but that's just part of the charm.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a wonderful time. A catch of 17 fish, and a new friend in western
Antonica. I must remember to look him up the next time I'm passing through.</p>
<p>Where to next? I hear there's a lake in Surefall Glade. Seems like the perfect place
for some fishing and hunting.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Sketches found amongst Mr. Undercrypt's
possessions suggest that a Fishing Trip did indeed take place in Surefall Glade,
but no written record of such a trip has been found. A marginal comment on
one such sketch (&quot;Bears can read?&quot;) offers Little elaboration. &#150; B]</p>
