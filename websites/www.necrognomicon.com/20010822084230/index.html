<p>If you're looking at this now, you've stumbled upon a work in progress.
Good for you!  You've got a healthy dose of gnomish curiosity.  Unfortunately,
I have to kill you because of what you've seen.  I'm sure you understand.</p>
<p>You probably should have headed to the <a href="http://www.mentalviruses.com/morty"
title="The Real NecroGnomicon">old version</a> until this one was finished.  Oh
well, too late now. Call yourself Kabober.</p>
<h2>Daily Grumblings</h2>
<h3>August 21, 2001</h3>
<p>Not many changes today, I'm finishing up my guild's web site. There's a new Tuesday,
some of the missing images have been put into place, and some wording was changed here
and there.</p>
<h3>August 20, 2001</h3>
<p>The next step in the Trail of Blood, Shadow Walker, has been completed. I also added
a new fish recipe to the Seafood section, and fixed a few typos here and there.</p>
<p>Previous grumblings can be <a href="appendix.html">revisited</a> if you've been too busy
killing things to drop by.</p>

<p>Tuesdays past are <a href="appendix.html">available for reminiscence</a>.</p>
<h2>The Gnomish Guide to What's Inside</h2>
<p>Here's what you'll find in the various chapters of the NecroGnomicon.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="index.html">Index</a>: You're looking at it now. I really
		hope you already knew that. If you didn't, you may mock yourself and
		proceed.</li>
	<li><a href="notes.html">Morty's Notes</a>: This is where I put all of the
		odds and ends which amuse me but don't really fit anywhere else, such as
		basic introductions, the latest gnomish fashions, and personal stories</li>
	<li><a href="necros.html">About Necromancers</a>: Here you'll find the gory
		details concerning the skills that a Necromancer acquires, racial
		distinctions among Necromancers, and the gods that make it all happen.
		You'll also find a lot of numbers to satisfy that gnomish mathematical itch,
		but don't worry &#150; I've tucked them away so that the lesser races can avoid the
		trouble of trying to comprehend such matters and having their heads explode.</li>
	<li><a href="tactics.html">Tactics of Terror</a>: An overview of hunting techniques and
		safety tips is provided for your pleasure, along with some of the finer points of
		controlling your undead minions. I've also added some comments about what to do
		when you find yourself in a group of people who follow other, less interesting
		professions.
		<b>Scheduled for Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="trail.html">A Trail of Blood</a>: Follow the progress of the Necromancer
		as the level of their power increases, with comments about spells and pets. A few
		additional words about hunting styles and my own killing grounds are included.
		<b>Under Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="world.html">The Cruel World</a>: Like many gnomes, I travel quite a bit.
		Here are the notes on what I've found, conveniently sorted by continent and location.
		If you're wondering where I am at the moment, that's here too.
		<b>Scheduled for Development.</b></li>
	<li><a href="http://pub45.ezboard.com/bnecrognomicon">Words of Darkness</a>: Join the
		conversation on the message board with general necromantic chit-chat, tales of woe and
		envy, and feedback regarding the NecroGnomicon. Whining is poorly tolerated &#150; there's
		enough of that elsewhere.</li>
	<li><a href="appendix.html">Appendix</a>: Archives and links to other sites of interest are
		all stuffed here. It's fit to burst.</li>
</ul>
