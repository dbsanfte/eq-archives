<p>While the bulk of the NecroGnomicon might be thought of as generally useful,
this section is pretty much just about me. That's why it's first.</p>
<h2>Please Allow Me to Introduce Myself...</h2>
<p>My name is Morty Undercrypt. As you should have guessed, I'm a gnome necromancer. Even
though I was led to the dark arts through <a href="childhood.html">a childhood tragedy</a>,
I have embraced the powers of death and revel in their use. This has made me somewhat
unpopular in certain circles, but I have <a href="devour.html">ways to cope</a>.</p>

		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/akfish.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Peace and quiet."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">I also like to do a little fishing when I have
			the chance.</td>
	</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Even though the life of a necromancer can be a solitary one, I do enjoy the company
of <a href="friends.html">fellow travelers</a> when the occasion presents itself.</p>
<p>Over the course of time, I've acquired most of
<a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=247832" target="_new">my
necromantic gear</a> from my deceased victims, although a number of items were
bestowed upon me as a result of questing.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: In his current state, his only Gear is a rather
large book. &#150; B]</p>

<h2>If Looks Could Kill</h2>
<p>Style is important. Leaving a wanton trail of destruction in your wake is all well
and good, but presenting a suitably foreboding image while you're doing it leaves a
stronger impression in the minds of those whimpering mortals that you choose to spare.</p>
<p>Thankfully, you win half of the style battle just by being a gnome.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="dressed.html">Dressed to Kill</a>: This basic fashion guide to armor
		will give you an overview of some popular necromantic looks.  Don't feel too bad
		if you don't look as good as the models.</li>
	<li><a href="grimtools.html">Grim Tools</a>: When you're heading to a sacrifice, don't
		go empty-handed!  Accessorize that sinister apparel with just the right dagger
		or stick.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tarnished Bone Medal</h2>
<p>Every now and then, I'll summon up an undead minion who proves to be far
more worthy than the typical pile of walking bones. These minions are
awarded the Tarnished Bone Medal (posthumously).</p>
<p>Lebarn is the most recent recipient of the Tarnished Bone Medal. There have
been <a href="bonemedal.html">others in the past</a>.</p>

		<td class=story width="250"><img src="images/lebarn01.jpg" width="250" height="250"
			alt="Taunting attacker, master."></td>
		<td class=story width="250">It was another cold night in the Dreadlands, but
			nothing could hurt me with Lebarn watching my back. He was fierce and loyal,
			the scourge of the drolvarg and the drachnid. It's this kind of fiendish
			power that makes a necromancer proud.</td>

<h2>Dead Men Tell No Tales</h2>
<p>It seemed like a good idea to collect my general ramblings in one place while
I'm still alive and well. When I die and become a full-fledged lich, I'll be too
busy dominating the world for things like that.</p>

<p class=trans>[Translator's Note: Of course, Mr. Undercrypt's path to Lichdom took
<a href="demise.html">a rather severe detour</a>. Should he once again regain a
corporeal form, he assures me that his plans for Domination will be
reinstated. &#150; B]</p>
