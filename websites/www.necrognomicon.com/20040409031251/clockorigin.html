<p>It is unclear exactly how gnomes came upon the power of necromancy. The histories which
may have contained this information have long been lost, and were probably destroyed by
the Eldritch Collective.</p>
<p>It may have happened like this. It probably didn't, but who's to say?</p>

<h2>A Clockwork Origin</h2>
<p>Long after the basic mechanics of gears and springs were mastered, the gnomes of Ak'Anon
looked for more ingenious ways to incorporate what they had learned. Many clever devices
were constructed, and ambitions ran high. Creating a fine tool was certainly a wonderful
thing, but what about tools that would run themselves? A small scrubber, perhaps, that would
move about and keep the caves clean?</p>
<p>The first attempts at self-controlled tools resulted in shambling jumbles of metal that
even the surviving inventors admitted were dangerous. A different model was needed. It was
eventually determined that natural forms, such as rats and spiders, exhibited the necessary
structural stability and compact design that would work best.</p>
<p>The task was quite challenging, as the inner workings of the proposed mechanisms involved
a new &quot;blackbox&quot; technology that would provide motivation and decision-making to
the unit. Further research was done, and some of it took on a rather grisly aura. You see,
if you wish to put together a clockwork rat, you need to disassemble a living rat to see how
it works. If you wish to put together a clockwork merchant....</p>
<p>As the development of clockworks progressed, unusual materials were pressed into service,
and strange magics were called into play. The many forms of the clockworks were eventually
developed, and they were met with great enthusiasm. Ak'Anon quickly became the cleanest
cave in the world. There were small problems, of course &#150; everyone was taken aback
by the complete and utter &quot;cleaning&quot; of the rogue's guild one day &#150; but the
clockwork cleaners, scrubbers, and merchants were undoubtedly tinkering's greatest
success.</p>
<p>The inventors wanted more. Their creations were useful, but each one had to be carefully
designed to do only one job. The clockworks were incapable of learning, susceptible to rust, and
prone to turning rogue if their inner workings were damaged. New plans were drawn up for
machines powered by living tissue and controlled by a once-living brain, and attempts were
made to construct this ultimate clockwork.</p>
<p>Without going into the messy details, those attempts failed.</p>
<p>The bones were willing, but the flesh was weak. Mechanical support of an organic structure
gave way to raw combinations of steel and bone. Dark rites were being performed to completely
strip away worthless living tissue so machinery could be put into place. Invocations to
Bertoxxulous were heard. Before long, the unreliable blackbox was replaced by a conjured spirit.
The dark rituals grew more complex until the power of the spells was so much greater than the
power of the machines that the metal was discarded.</p>
<p>The ultimate tinkering had been achieved. Necromancy.</p>
