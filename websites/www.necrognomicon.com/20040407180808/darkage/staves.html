from a Viper which wounded a virgin, vertebr&aelig; from a Heretic, nails from a coffin
that was Intended for someone other than its occupant... these things and others more Horrific
form the components of a ritual, one of the darkest of the Dark Arts, necessary in the
creation of a staff fit for focusing Death's pure spirit. Such staves form the
backbone (as it were) of the Necromancer's equipment, but their sale is forbidden
in civilized lands.</p>

<h2>The Black Market</h2>

<p>While it may seem Unfair that the primary tool of the reanimator has been
declared anathema, a moment's observation will confirm that this has not
in any way prevented the necromancer from purchasing what is required.
Clearly, there are vendors who carry such accoutrements.</p>

<p>How is this accomplished? The method is at once both absurdly Simple and deviously
Effective. All staves created for merchant sale are required by King's decree to show
the profession for whom they are intended, the better to avoid accidental or intentional
deception in sales. Necromantic staves have no such marker, only runes suggestive of
their intended use. Thus, should the merchant's inventory be inspected by one of the
King's guard, the forbidden tool will appear to be merely a &ldquo;found&rdquo; item
acquired in trade &#150; with no indication that there are hundred more hidden in a
padded box beneath the floorboards.</p>

<p>The savvy Necromancer will, of course, be intimately familiar with these macabre
runes and have no trouble in distinguishing which staff may be best suited for
personal use. The only challenge is in finding the merchants who ply this
proscribed trade.</p>

<h3>The Albion Mainland</h3>

<p>The sordid and enlightening tale of the Egasa Family having been exposed in great
detail in another document, their story will not be here repeated. Who now knowing
these terrors could believe the fa&ccedil;ade of the simple purveyors of wizardly
wares?</p>

<p>The final fate of Lord Egesa is still unknown, and may remain so
eternally. Divinations agree that he no longer walks among the
living, but neither can his soul be found in the stygian vastness
of the Underworld by any known necromantic evocation.</p>

<h3>The Shrouded Isles of Avalon</h3>

<p>The residents of the Avalonian settlements, realizing as they do their
dependence upon necromantic assistance to defy Morgana's undead legions,
are less Strict in enforcing inconvenient decrees.</p>

<h3>The Shores of Atlantis</h3>

<p>Although the Avalonians may appear somewhat Lax in their treatment of contraband, those who have
taken up residence in the Atlantean ruins are the embodiment of Disinterest. Focused as everyone
is on their own Projects, a merchant could likely sell Arthur's very bones without fear of notice.</p>

<p>The canny may wonder at their observation that the Inconnu do not make trade in
their one most Needed piece of equipment; and indeed, any Necromancer is exquisitely
careful to avoid concurrent possession of more than a few ensorcelled staves, certainly never
keeping the inventories required of a successful merchant. When questioned upon this
fact the Inconnu remain silent, offering only the shadow of a smile before turning away.</p>

lost to time, or whether some Conspiracy on the part of the family kept it from my hands,
