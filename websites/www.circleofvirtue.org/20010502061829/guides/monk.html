<p><font size="3">Well to get started I give you my background.&nbsp;
I've played 5 charecters, and every single one of them has been a
monk.&nbsp; I've played them all to level 7, excpet Zhao whom
I've played to level 13.&nbsp; To say I'm an expert on monks
would be an extreme overstatment- but I have read every post on 3
different monk message boards, so I have heard from the best.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Guide to playing as, or playing with a monk in
a group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">(More the latter because I think I'm the only
monk in COV)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">When you are grouping with a Monk, he/she will
serve one of three rolls: as a main tank; as a secondary damage
dealer; or as a puller.&nbsp; These rolls depend on the make-up
of your party as well as your level. I will explain how the monk
will compliment your playing in each of these capacities, and how
you can best compliment him or her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I first would like to mention this: If a monk
does not know what he/she is doing- they are a danger to the
group.&nbsp; They can be an exp sponge and more. After the monk
has hit level 17, if they don't know what they are doing they are
an EXTREMELY large danger to a group. But, of the other hand a
group with a well played monk- should never die even under the
worst of situations.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Special Group Related Monk abilites:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Mend- before level 20 mend is a bit unreliably
(mine at level 13 only works 80% of the time) after level 20 it
never fails.&nbsp; It heals 25% (1.5 bubbles) Hit Points instanly.&nbsp;
It has a 6 minute recovery rate.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Feign Death- allows the monk to fall dead to
the ground and have the MOB think he/she is dead and forget him/her
after he/she gets up.&nbsp; This ability is learned at level 17,
and any monk worth his/her headbands will have this maxed at
every level.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Bind Wound- Monks more than usually any other
class get this built up.&nbsp; It allows you to heal 1 HP for
every 4 points of skill per bandage- up to 50% of your life total.
At level 13 I heal 20 points per bandage.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">First: Monk as a main tank.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Monk: When you are the main tank, you have to
sit there and punch and special attack away. Don't stop.&nbsp; If
you are about to die, don't stop. A MOB will miss you enough that
you should just sit there and let the rest of your party take
care of you.&nbsp; If the MOB moves on to another charecter,
follow it and smack it from behind.&nbsp; But no matter what- do
not run until the MOB is dead.&nbsp; If you dying and are playing
with a secondary tank (every other tanking class has taunt) they
should taunt the MOB off of you- so don't stop whacking.&nbsp;
After level 17, when you have Feign Death, if you can't kill the
MOB **NEVER FEIGN NEAR THE GROUP!!!** pull the MOB away from the
group-tell them to zone, gate, evacuate whatever- then fiegn.&nbsp;
This will save your group. And always remember to turn auto
attack off before you feign.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Healing Class: Don't bother healing a monk
until he only has 2 bubbles.&nbsp; He/she doesn't need it until
then- and has an uncanny abilty to have the MOB miss him/her when
at 3 and two bubbles. When he's at 2 heal him to four- and then
wait.&nbsp; The monk can mend 25% back up- and will usually do
this early on in the fight, which is why healing before they are
down two 2 bubbles is not a good idea, having the monk mend- and
the cleric heal at the same time- is very frustrating as it
wastes mana.&nbsp; Don't panic.&nbsp; A monks best ability is to
not be hit.&nbsp; The MOB's miss a lot. So don't worry when his
points start dropping fast, just worry when they get to two
bubbles.&nbsp; After the MOB is dead- wait for the monk to bind
him/herslef up to 50% before you cast more heals on him/her- just
med.&nbsp; A monk has fewer hit points than a tank- he/she does *not*
take more damage. The life bar looks like it drops faters because
the MOBS are dealing a greater percentage of damage only- but
they hit less often.&nbsp; At level 13 my block and dodge go off
every third round.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nuker: Well, when grouping with a monk, there
is some difficulty in strategy.&nbsp; First of all, memorize all
of your debuffs and buffs, these will help the group more than
nuking.&nbsp; Keep the monk well buffed and the monster well weak
and you should never accidentally taunt the MOB.&nbsp; Unless the
Monk is going to die- never nuke the MOB until it hits 1/2 life.&nbsp;
If you have a meele weapon- heck go in and whack on it a bit- let
the healer take care of the monk- and then pull off when the MOB
hits under half life and kill it.&nbsp; If you don't get it in
one shot- then the monk can usually pull it off of you becuase he/she
has dealt the most damage, other wise keep nuking and let the
monk hit max damage from behind- and the healer should keep you
alive.&nbsp; Just remember- your buffs and debuffs are the best
way to keep everything safe in a group with a monk.&nbsp; Heck-
your down time is much lower when you don't have to nuke the heck
out of a monster, right?</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Secondary Tank: This would only apply to
Shamans and Druids and Maybe an extra Cleric becuase Rangers,
Paladins, Warriors and Shadow Knights make better tanks than a
Monk.&nbsp; Basically- just whack at them and cast buffs and
healing when necessary, you won't deal more damage than the Monk,
so the MOB won't turn on you.&nbsp; Just keep hacking away.&nbsp;
If the monk is going to die- pull off and heal him instead of
trying to taunt the MOB off, if you can take the MOB- tell the
Monk to feign, but otherwise let him take the damage- he can heal
faster for less mana- and get hit less often.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Monk as a secondary tank:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Monk: As the secondary tank, your job is soo
easy, smack the baddies from behind- and watch the best numbers
you've ever seen pop-up on your screen.&nbsp; Bind the tank after
the battle and laugh at how you never have to mend.&nbsp; The
only bit of strategy is *if* you pull the MOB onto you, turn auto
attack off, use your specail attack only, and let the tank
retaunt the MOB on him/her.&nbsp; You are basically a Human DOT.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Healer: you should never have to heal the monk
as a secondary tank.&nbsp; If you do have to heal the monk-
follow the above rules, never heal unless he/she is down to 2
bubbles.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nuker: Just slam it, but don't worry about it
too much- a Monk and a Warrior at level 13 can do upwards of 64
damage a round, that is not counting an uncommanly uquiped
Warrior, critical hits or max monk damage. The MOBS hits should
just plummet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Tank: Hit it hard. When it look at you, hit it
hard, when it look at Monk, hit it hard. I hope that was easy
enough. :) Actually, please for god's sake have your taunt skill
maxed so you can pull the MOB off the monk- in an awesome group
it won't matter, but a Monk *can* outdamage you, so unless you
want to give your healer a heart attack all of the sudden having
to worry about the monk, taunt durring the whole attack.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Monk as a puller:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Monk: When below level 17, pull using a thrown
weapon and run backwards to your group with your auto attack on,
never pull from a group of enemies- and only pull when absolutley
necessary, your not a puller until you hit level 17. When you hit
level 17 you are the best puller in the game.&nbsp; You can now
do what is called &quot;Feign Pulling&quot; This allows you to
enter a whole room of MOBS that are all KOS all Swarm MOBS and
bring only one of them back to your group.&nbsp; This is
acomplishes by agroing a MOB, pulling it away, then feigning,
waiting for on of the MOBS to walk away a bit, standing up and
letting the mob follow you for a sec again and dropping- after a
while you will have only one MOB which you can safely bring back
to your group.&nbsp; Remeber, never have autoattack on when you
try to fiegn, and if the MOBS are getting too close to the group
and might go agro on them, zone- they won't mind you zoning more
than they would mind you dying- and pratice somewhere <br>
like BB or the Derv Camps in North Ro, before you try doing this
in somewhere like oh... the Plane of Fear.&nbsp; If you know how
to do this- you will be a necessity for any group going to the
planes.&nbsp; For a better description of this- check the monk
message boards or give me a tell online- I have a pretty good
grasp on how it works.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Cleric: Don't heal a monk when he/she is
feigned, it stops them from feigning.&nbsp; Wait until they stand
up.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Nuker: Wait until a tank (either the monk or a
warrior) starts smakcing it to nuke it, definatly wait for the
monk to be standing to do anything.&nbsp; Don't cast anything on
the monk while he is feined or the MOB will start running back to
him- which can cause trains.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Tank: The monk will bring the MOB back- and you
start hitting it, he/she will have dealt minimal damage, so the
MOB will go agro on you then the monk should start dealing damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Secondary Tank: Let the monk hit it a bit after
he/she brings it back to the group- then whack away.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">That's pretty much it, any other questions drop
on the message board and I'll answer them.&nbsp; Monks are
incredible in a group as well as some of the nicest people- they
can't loot much and aren't power gamers becuase, well, you can't
really twink a monk.</font></p>
