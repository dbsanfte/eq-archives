<p align="center"><font size="3">AKA, Serapth&#146;s Guild to
Grouping</font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">Over the last few weeks, I have joined a fair
number of groups ranging greatly in competence and level. I
started to recognize some traits that can easily tell you if the
group you are with have the right stuff, or will get you killed.
I&#146;m also going to mention a few group based strategies that
hopefully will help you out over time. But before I begin, I want
you to realize a few things about me, to explain any bias I
display. First off, I primarily play a wizard. I have played a
half a dozen other classes and tend to stick to casters, so most
of my opinions will be biased as such. Secondly, everything I am
about to say is purely my opinion. It comes with no guarantees
what so ever, you follow my advice and die, oops sorry. You
follow my advice and do well, excellent. If you totally disagree
with something I say, please feel free to email me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Pulling:</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The number one cause of group death seems to be
the way it pulls. I have been in many groups where more than one
character is out hunting for a mob to kill. THIS IS A BAD IDEA. I
guarantee if you follow this system, you will end up with
multiple pulls at the same time, and way more mobs that you
wanted to fight, and yes it will get you killed. Dedicate one
player to pulling, my personal favorite are Rangers, as that is
what this class is designed for. Whoever does make the pull, tell
the group what the mob is, how high it cons and ask if they want
it first. Granted, this isn&#146;t always possible, in situations
where you are racing with 20 others groups to grab a mob, but if
it is, do it. So here is my first rule of moron detection&#133;
if someone in your group makes pulls just because they are ready,
without asking the group first&#133; <b>this is a moron, and he/she
will get you killed!</b> Nothing like sitting there with all
healers and nukers at 0 mana, when some idiot yells &quot;Incoming&quot;.
Get rid of this person as fast as possible, this is not a group
oriented player, or at the least, not a smart player. One last
thing that people seem to forget, if you&#146;re the one pulling
and you form a train as a result, zone it! Don&#146;t bring the
whole zone to your group so everyone can share in your misery.
The worst thing that happens is your group will have to wait a
few minutes while you zone back in. This wait, I prefer greatly
over being killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Camping:</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">In the wonderful land of Norath, your going to
spend A LOT of time sitting on your ass, waiting for things to
spawn or mana to come back. As hard as it is to believe that you
can screw up sitting, well, you can. Most important thing about
camping is position. First scenario is, your in a an open area,
like North Karana or Oasis killing randomly spawning mobs. Most
popular thing to do here is to sit at zone edge, and pull back.
This in and of itself isn&#146;t a bad idea, but it does have
downsides. First off, you are going to get trained, and you are
going to get trained often. Secondly, you are going to have a lot
of competition, from all the other groups with the same idea as
you. I always get a kick out of walking into a zone and seeing 80%
of the people clumped together at the zone border. Third, and
final point. Unfortunately, EQ is full of jerks, you can really
help that, and these people know you are at the zone, and seem to
take great pleasure in causing you pain. Just listen out for
shouts like &quot;Who trained the </font><font size="2">#$@#$@ing</font><font
size="3"> spectre on me!!&quot; and you should be ok. Now here is
the downside, there really isn&#146;t a better way to camp. The
best you can do, is go off to the side a bit, within a short
distance of the zone itself. You have the added risk of not
making it back to the zone, but I think the tradeoffs are worth
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The second scenario is, you are in a dungeon
environment, like Cazic Thule, Befallen, or such. Here everything
changes&#133; you can camp the edge of the zone, like above,
which has all the same drawbacks, with even bigger trains. If you
decide to venture deeper into the zone, the most important thing
to keep in mind is visibility. Those five to ten minute meds are
dangerous as hell, but they are necessary. I realize at this
point, your goal is to recover health and mana, so what im about
to suggest seems a bit stupid, but I personally find it
worthwhile. Invis between fights. This spell is cheap on mana,
almost all casters have it, and it will save you big. Ditto for
undead, although only Clerics, Paladins and Necros can help you
here. I know this is a pain in the ass, but it is well worth the
minute it takes to cast it on everyone, as well as the additional
30 seconds it takes to get the mana back. Keep in mind, if you
are a druid/ranger you can camo yourself, and really help keep
mana costs down. Ditto for enchanters&#133; mem and cast whatever
appropriate illusion spells that keeps you from being KOS. I do
realize, that you wont always have the ability to go invisible
after every fight, in this case, tuck everyone as tightly out of
view as possible. If one of your group members is sitting in
plain view, while the rest of you are smartly hidden, guess what <b>this
is a moron</b>. Get rid of them or they will eventually get you
killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The final scenario I see is, you are in a wide-open
area, but need to camp something a distance from the zone. A good
example of this would be the Orc Camps in East Commons or Bandits
in West Karana. This is far more dangerous then the first
scenario, and much safer than the 2<sup>nd</sup>. Unfortunately,
you don&#146;t have too many options here. First of all, and this
kind of a no brainer, but if you can SOW everyone. Its not really
worth buying it for each party member, but if you have a shaman
or druid nearby, its well worth the mana. Don&#146;t just SOW
tanks, SOW everyone. However, if you have a bard in the group,
and are organized enough to all flee as one group, you may be ok
here. Secondly, in this case, I think invisibility is a bit of a
waste, and not worth the tradeoff. Other than the occasional
wandering mob, you shouldn&#146;t have much to worry about. All I
can really suggest in this situation is med in the same formation
you fight, so if you do get hit, everyone can pop up and start
fighting right away. I personally suggest forming group so that
you have a front line of tanks, then about 5 feet back the
healers, and behind them, the nukers. But stay nicely packed&#133;
if you put too much distance between characters, the tanks are
gonna have a hell of a time pulling the mob off your casters.
Also, it is much simpler for healers to get those heals off. And
if you have to run, please tell your group first&#133; </font></p>

<p><font size="3"></font>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Fighting</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ok, this section could be an article onto
itself, so I&#146;m only going to mention a few specific points.
First off, talk during the fight&#133; most people don&#146;t do
this, I think all people should. If you&#146;re a caster, give
regular updates on mana status, its nice to know your healer has
50% mana left when your down to 2 bubbles of heath left, instead
of hearing out of the blue, &quot;I&#146;m oom&quot;. Same for
nukers, tell the group when your about to hit hard, so they get
ready to pull the mob off of you. Secondly, don&#146;t root a
snared mob, ever! Root lasts one tenth the time as snare, and
casting root on a snared mob breaks the snare. Third, share the
damage. I&#146;m not sure why this doesn&#146;t happen naturally,
but it doesn&#146;t. If one tank is going down hard, stun the
mob, back that tank out for a bit, and send the other tank in. If
you are a nuker, and your tank is getting pummeled, its time to
hit the mob HARD. Granted, your HP&#146;s suck, but you can delay
the mob long enough for the tanks to switch, and for the healer
to heal. At this point, the tank that just got pulled off should
immediately go back at the mob, your nuker isn&#146;t gonna last
long. This is where a smart healer really comes in handy. The
brief second the nukers pull bought should be enough time to get
the tank back into the fight, with barely a skip in the action.
Fourth, use /assist! When you pull a mob, and get more than you
wanted, target the puller and use /assist. If you cant mez or
stun the 2<sup>nd</sup> mob in any way, ignore it, and drop the
first one. Another option if your SOWed here, is for one person
in the group to pull the 2<sup>nd</sup> mob out, and go for a
little run around the zone until the first mob is dead. Final
point, in a dungeon&#133; KILL THE RUNERS, at all cost, do not
let them run. Use snare, if it fails, use root. Tanks leave
whatever you are fighting to take down runners if your casters
fail here. This however, is the groups nukers main responsibility&#133;
you see one run, target it, and hit it with your hardest, least
resisted spell, NOW!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Group Roles By Class</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is a brief overview of how I think each
class should act within a group. Some of these classes I have
little experience play or grouping with, so some will be better
covered than others. If you play one of these classes and would
like to dispute/change or append information to what I have said
below, please email me.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Warrior</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class is perhaps the most straight forward
and well defined. You take damage, dish out damage, and taunt
like mad. Nice thing is, even a bad tank can do a good job. An
effective tank see&#146;s and reacts quickly to a mob rushing a
caster. Additionally, when two or more tanks exist, an effective
warrior knows when to back out and let the other tank start
taking the damage. This class can be a puller when equipped with
a bow, but given the highest hit points, good armor and damage,
this class makes the best in the trenches tank you will find.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Shadowknight</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class is a little hard to describe. I
personally am not a huge fan of grouping with shadowknights, as
they really seem to be a solo oriented group. They do not excel
at anyone particular area, are no where nears as good in the role
of tank as any of the melee classes. The one area I would find a
SK incredibly useful is camping a named spawn, where they can use
harm touch. Their spells don&#146;t seem to be that useful to a
group, once again, seemingly solo oriented. However these
characters can function quite well in a tanking position, and
should follow the basic rules defined to a warrior. One nice
perk, is some of their spells can prove a fairly effective taunt.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Ranger</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ill be honest here&#133; I love rangers, or at
least rangers that play properly. They are not a primary tank, so
there melee skills don&#146;t come close to that of a warrior,
more inline with a paladin (duel wield is a nice perk). Where a
Ranger shines is for pulling mobs. If you are in a group that has
a ranger, this is who should be doing the pulls. Combine the
ability to track, snare, and good ranged skills into one package,
and it becomes obvious why. However, after the pull, if there is
another tank in the group, the ranger should back off from the
attack a bit to become the secondary tank. These players are
nowhere near as hard as a Warrior, and should play as such. After
fighting, this character can chip in a bit in the healing area as
well.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Paladin</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class is a little hard to understand how
it should be played. This is basically a 75% warrior / 25% healer.
If I am grouped with a paladin I trust, I love having them around.
If I am grouped with a paladin I don&#146;t trust, or don&#146;t
know, I would prefer a Warrior. What sets a paladin away from a
Warrior is Healing Touch which can be a saviour in the face of
certain defeat. Plus, paladins can make a very effective healer.
Here is where I see most people make a mistake with paladins&#133;
you are not clerics&#133; once healing touch is gone, you are
nowhere near as effective (as a cleric)&#133; don&#146;t play
like a healer. During the fight, act like a tank, which paladins
can do quite effectively. Paladin should not be casting healing
spells during fight, unless a cleric/druid or shaman is absent.
After the fight, a paladin can massively improve recovery time,
by offloading a lot of the work from the cleric.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Rogue</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">I used to hate this class. Verant screwed this
class from day one. Not a very effective tank, and no ability to
cast spells&#133; yeesh useless. Well that&#146;s what I used to
think anyway, now under certain circumstances this is one of the
best characters you can add to a group. Rogues are good at two
things in a group. First of, they come in a close second to
Ranger in the pulling category, the innate hide ability is like a
free invis every pull. Secondly, the backstab. Combined with
poison backstab is incredibly effective. Then again, if you don&#146;t
have another tank that draws the mobs attention, the rogue loses
its best advantage. Once I discovered Tishans Clash, I have come
to look at Rogues in a completely different manner. They are
almost a nuker class. I could do , for a quarter of the mana of
my highest DD spell, the same amount of damage with a rogue and
stun. I hit for 38 with Tishans Clash, mob is stunned, rogue runs
around back and backstabs. The rogue I was grouping with was
getting in hits for up to 120 points of damage. This is in
addition to the fact that the mob is now stunned, so the other
tanks can keep meleeing and not take an ounce of damage. I now
love grouping with this class. But if your rogue plays like a
tank, and doesn&#146;t take advantage of his backstab, well <b>this
is a moron.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Shaman / Druid</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">These classes play almost identically, so I
will clump them together. Shamans are more effective in hand to
hand combat, and seem to be somewhat more effective at DD. They
are somewhat indispensable in a dungeon, as snare keeps nasty
trains to a minimum. These characters can play in one of two
modes primary offense, secondary healing, or vice versa. The
decision should be based on the composition of the party. If you
are grouped with 2+ nukers, dedicate yourself to healing/buffing.
If you are grouped with a cleric or two, start with the dots, DD,
and damage shields. The key to playing this class is to know
which mode to be using, or knowing when to mix both. I find a
druid/shaman useful in almost any party, plus I&#146;m addicted
to SOW. Also keep in mind, Druids become the 2<sup>nd</sup> best
travelers in the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Cleric</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">A cleric&#146;s role in a party is very cleanly
defined. Keep people alive. A cleric will very often be the
reason why a party does well, or the exact opposite. I hate
watching clerics that let a tank get down to the last bubble
before doing a complete heal. Don&#146;t judge off number of
bubbles, judge based on rate of the fight, keeping in mind that
spell takes a few seconds to cast, and in the few seconds, a lot
of mobs can shred that remaining health. A good cleric knows when
to heal, and you shouldn&#146;t here the group yelling &quot;Need
heal&quot;. The cleric should be watching your health more than
the fight itself. Where this character changes massively is vs.
undead&#133; at this point they function almost like a nuker,
with very mana efficient high damage spells. In this case they
have to judge the ability to do damage vs. the need to heal. In
between fights all buffs should be cast. This is a great class to
have one of in a group, but I tend to find a second cleric kind
of useless. By far the best buffer in the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Bard</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">I don&#146;t get this class to be honest </font><font
size="3" face="Wingdings">J</font><font size="3"> They aren&#146;t
casters, aren&#146;t tanks, aren&#146;t healers, but can do it
all. So as for handing a bard advice, I&#146;m not even gonna try.
Here is what I have notice though, when this class is played
well, they are an exceptional class to group with, especially
when the bard knows how to twists songs together. When played
poorly, this class seems to be relegated to that of a weak tank.
One sign of a good bard, is the group after a fight shouldn&#146;t
have to ask for the health song, it should already be playing.
Another effective bard trick seems to be to enhance vision of the
group while waiting for a tank to pull. Plus the speed song is
nice, and they seem too able to taunt exceptionally well. Once
they get to higher levels, bards become my best friends, I love
the mana song.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Necromancer</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class isn&#146;t really targeted at
grouping as far as I can tell. I have however grouped with
necromancers on a couple of occasions with great results. The one
area where necro&#146;s really shine is when you have a smaller
group, and need a second tank. As far as DOT&#146;s and DD
spells, this class is quite effective, although no match for a
wizard. The majority of their spells are geared toward soloing
and their pets, with the exception of their offensive spells. I
do like their pets though, and they may even be a bit too
effective, although like all pets, they can be dangerous as hell
in a dungeon. Basically treat a necromancer as a weaker wizard
with a tank built in. Nice thing about any pets, at least from my
perspective, is that they can easily be sacrificed. Lost mana and
a few bone chips is a low price to pay, compared to the death of
a party member.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Mage</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class plays a lot like a necromancer with
buffs. In a solo environment they are incredibly effective, while
in a grouped environment they weaken rather greatly. This is
perhaps the best class to solo, but in a full six member group,
there pet isn&#146;t always welcome, and without a pet, they
become somewhat weaker wizards. If they can get a good line of
site, their bolt spells do a nice bit of damage, only problem is,
in a full group, hitting with a bolt spell is a bit of a trick.
There shock spells however, aren&#146;t near inline with a wiz.
The added buffing and summoning abilities are a nice perk,
especially at upper levels where they can make a party able to
breath underwater indefinitely, or able to fly. I played a Mage
up to level 20, and found that solo, I was incredible, easily
able to take down yellows, and some reds. Group however, where my
pet wasn&#146;t needed, my usefulness was greatly diluted.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Wizard</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">As you can tell right now, I really like this
class </font><font size="3" face="Wingdings">J</font><font
size="3"> . Wizard is an interesting character, in that they are
by far the best nuker in the game, while also being the most
fragile. Their gate abilities are the best in the game. In a
group environment, the wizard sort of controls the tempo of the
fight. A wizard cant start a battle blasting outright or that
said wizard will be dead within seconds. An intelligent wizard
meters out spell damage effectively, such that they can
contribute to the fight from the first moment, but don&#146;t do
enough damage to pull the mob to them. A wizard has a few
responsibilities in a fight. 1) A wizard is there to put in the
killing blow. This class is all about offense, and that is what
you are there for. 2) In a dungeon, a runner is deadly, if you
see one break to run, take it down. 3) At higher levels, a wizard
should reserve enough mana to get off an evacuate spell, and
should pay enough attention to know when to evac. One last thing
a wizard can do, but many wizards wont, as its very risky to
their own health, is taunt. When you see a tank is about to die,
hit and hit hard&#133; 99% of the time, the mob will agro at you,
giving your tank a chance to recover. You have the ability to
pull a mob to you anytime you want, learn when to do so can save
a group members life. Just be sure you trust the group to do the
right thing now, as if they screw up, you&#146;re the one that&#146;s
gonna die. If your grouped with idiots, I really don&#146;t
recommend this tactic. Another thing I&#146;ve started doing
lately, is if the battle is going really bad, and the healers are
oom, pull the mob to you and run it around, giving your group a
chance to med and recover. Seeing as you are normally at the back
of the group during a fight, you get a few steps as a head start.
I wouldn&#146;t recommend this without sow. Final note, when you
get the spell Tishans clash, use it! This should be the spell you
use more than any other spells.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Enchanter</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">This class is perhaps the strangest in the
game, and Ill put it bluntly, Verant screwed you. I tried to play
a enchanter, made it to about the sixth level and said screw it.
For the start of your life, you are effectively worthless. Sorry
to say that, but your DD spells blow (all or nothing resists </font><font
size="3" face="Wingdings">L</font><font size="3"> ), your pet is
the worst in the game (bad stats, plus inability to give it
commands). However once into your teens this class starts to
change. This class depends on a group, no doubt about it&#133;
but then again, most groups depend greatly upon an enchanter. At
level 28, with an enchanter and another wizard, I can take down
Sand Giants&#133; no other class could give me this ability. The
addition of clarity to the spell list is no doubt incredible, but
to a group what really shines are spells like Mez, the ability to
reduce a mobs resistance and good buffs. This class is unique in
that it makes every other class better. Kinda ironic, in the low
levels this is the worst class to group with, then in the upper
levels, you are perhaps the most sought out. So if you&#146;re a
low level enchanter now, stick with it, and you will be one of
the most popular players out there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Ideal Party Composition</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">3 or less characters:<br>
1 pure tank<br>
1 hybrid caster (mage or necro)<br>
1 hybrid healer ( druid or shaman)</font></p>

<p><font size="3">or</font></p>

<p><font size="3">1 hybrid tank<br>
1 cleric<br>
1 wiz</font></p>

<p><font size="3">6 characters (lower level &lt;20<sup>th</sup>)<br>
1 pure tank<br>
1 hybrid tank<br>
1 bard<br>
1 cleric<br>
1 wiz<br>
1 hybird caster or healer</font></p>

<p><font size="3">6 characters (over 20<sup>th</sup>)<br>
1 tank<br>
1 rogue<br>
1 bard<br>
1 shaman or druid<br>
1 enchanter<br>
1 wizard</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Those are just opinions once again, but they
seem to be a good complement group.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><u>Final Comment</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Once last thing I take into account with all
the people I group with is how much I like and trust them. If
someone I like just happens to be very bad at playing the game,
oh well, best I can do is try to teach him or her. This is about
fun after. Where my style of play changes greatly is based on how
well I know and like a group. If I do like the group, im more
likely to take a risk, cast down to my last ounce of mana, and
get beaten to within a sliver of my life. If I don&#146;t like
the group much, if something goes very wrong, I will do what I
can to help, but I am not going to sacrifice myself for my group.
Keeping a list of players you like, and grouping with guild
members is by far the best way to play. You will find that if you
repeatedly play with the same people you will handle problems a
lot better. In the end, do what you want.. this is just my random
ranting. I hope someone somewhere finds something here useful.
Any feedback is appreciated.</font></p>
