<p><a name="1"></a><font size="3">I. <strong>DEFINITION</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">The Circle of Virtue is a guild on the Rathe
server. It is a guild dedicated to the path of light, and helping
those good creatures of Norrath who are beset by evil.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Within the Circle, guild members are treated as
family, supporting each other above all else.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="2"></a><font size="3">II. <strong>INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>The guild is composed of three parts: Guild
Leader, Council of Officers and The Circle.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>GUILD LEADER</b> - A member of the guild who
has the rank of Guild Leader. The Guild Leader has the
responsibility of guarding and overseeing the guild as a whole,
and making certain that the reputation of the guild remains
untarnished. The Guild Leader will be available to anyone in the
guild for assistance in resolving disagreements, and may call
upon other Officers in closing any issue. All decisions of the
Guild Leader are binding, so long as they do not conflict with
the rules set forth in the Charter. The Guild Leader will decide
all issues not directly covered in the charter. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>COUNCIL OF OFFICERS</b> &#150; The Council
of Officers consists of the Elders, Baronies, Justicary and
Duchies. Each Officer shall have a specific responsibility within
the guild.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Elder &#150; An Officer of the guild who once
held the rank of Guild Leader and has stepped down.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Barony (Baron/Baroness) &#150; An Officer of
the guild who handles affairs and problems regarding events
outside the guild, and assists the Guild Leader in governing the
guild.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Justicary (Justicar) &#150; An Officer of the
guild who resolves disagreements between guild members, and
assists the Guild Leader in governing the guild. The Justicary
consists of two Justicars and an Inquisitor. The Inquisitor is
head of the Justicary.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Duchy (Duke/Duchess) &#150; An Officer of the
guild who aid the Guild Leader, Barony and Justicary in resolving
disagreements as they arise.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>THE CIRCLE</b> &#150; The Circle consists of
all guild members who are not Officers. There are four ranks
within The Circle: Page, Squire, Knight and Captain. Advancement
in rank within the Circle can be achieved by completing a Quest
given to you by an Officer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Page &#150; The first rank of the Circle, and
the rank to which all new members are assigned.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Squire &#150; The second rank of the Circle,
and one that is attained by the completion of a Quest given by an
Officer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Knight &#150; The third rank of the Circle.
This rank is achieved by completing a more challenging Quest
given by an Officer.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Captain &#150; The fourth rank of the Circle.
This rank is achieved by completing a difficult Quest given by an
Officer, along with great service to the guild.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="3"></a><font size="3"><b>III. INVITATION POLICY</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">For admittance into the guild, you must be a
minimum of level 15 and have three Sponsors, one of whom must be
an Officer. All three Sponsors need to have been in the guild at
least one month.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One Sponsor must accompany the person
petitioning for admittance into the guild for one real-time hour
within Norrath. The behavior of the Petitioner during these times
will determine whether they are recommended for admittance into
the guild. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Part of the admittance process is to go to the
guild website, read the Charter, have some knowledge of who the
Officers are, and post a message on the Message Board. Once you
have been admitted, you will need to post your character
information using the Member Information Update Form. The Officer
who invited you will introduce you to the guild and answer any
questions you have about the guild.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="4"></a><font size="3"><b>IV.</b> </font><strong>CODE
OF CONDUCT/PRINCIPLES</strong></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>We are as a family, and all members
shall treat each other with respect, regardless of rank, level or
length of time in the guild.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Absolutely no Kill Stealing, Ninja Looting,
blatant rudeness, or vulgarity (to anyone, not just guild members)
will be permitted in a guild member. Kill Stealing is defined as
killing an NPC or Creature in combat with (or being camped by)
another player for your own gain. Ninja Looting is defined as
looting an item that multiple people in your group may want
before a decision has been made as to who gets the item.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Guild members are encouraged to group together,
to request assistance from the guild and assist each other in
achieving goals and equipment. Requesting items from higher-level
members in the guild is discouraged.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Keeping your character in a continuous
Anonymous state is discouraged. Not only does it not allow your
fellow guild members to identify compatible levels with whom to
group by typing /who all &quot;circle of virtue&quot;, it implies
that you do not wish to be <i>bothered</i> by requests for
assistance. This mind-set does not suggest the definition of
virtue that the Circle wishes to represent.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Roll playing is also encouraged, as it gives
your character some depth, and gives other players more
information about how to react to your character (you could be
afraid of ghosts, have a certain code of honor, or have some
other personality quirk.) Some people have developed character
histories which are posted on the website. Roll playing is not
required, though.</font></p>

<hr>

<p><a name="5"></a><font size="3"><b>V. GUILD MEETINGS</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Guild Meetings are held on the First and Third
Sundays of each month at 5:00pm PST (Pacific Standard Time) at
the Wizard Spires in North Karana. If you cannot be there, please
try to participate over guild chat.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Meeting attendance is not always mandatory, but
strongly encouraged so that you know what issues and events are
taking place within the guild. If you have any announcements or
questions that you would like to be addressed in the guild
meeting, tell the Officer running the meeting in a private
message before the end of the meeting.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Always feel free to make comments or
suggestions during guild meetings, but please keep chatter, spell
casting, fighting and other types of spamming to a minimum during
meetings so that they can be as short as possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This charter is subject to change as we grow.</font></p>
