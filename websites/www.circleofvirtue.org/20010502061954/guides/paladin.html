<p><font size="4">Introduction:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The paladin is a holy fighter that fights for
justice and truth. Understand that the paladin is roughly 80%
warrior, and the remaining 20% are a cleric. Do not choose to
play a paladin if you think that your going to be a great caster
and kill all the evil forces that you see on sight. Why? Simply,
because paladins aren't 100% casters at all. If you play your
cards right and follow the fact that you're a warrior/cleric
hybrid class, with the majority being a warrior, you should be
able to have a happy life playing a paladin.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Skills:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We follow the level cap formula just like a
warrior. (Level x 5) + 5. Which means, during your first level,
your combat skills will cap at 10. To giveyou a quick
understanding of the combat skills and when they're enabled.Level/Skill:
1/Taunt, 6/Bash, 10/Dodge, 17/Parry, 20/Double Attack, 30/Riposte,
40/Disarm. 'Bind Wounds' is enabled at Level 10, I never
practiced this skill since I like to use my spells then waste 5-6sp
just for some HP.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The spells are enabled at Level 9, along with
the spellcasting skills which also follow our combat skill
formula. (Level x 5) + 5. We have the basic: Abjuration,
Alteration, Conjuration, Divination, Evocation and, of course,
Channeling. Meditate hits the road at Level 12, and once it does,
we paladins are truly complete.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Attributes (Stats):</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Ah, the stats of a paladin, there are three
primary ones, Strength, Wisdom and Charisma. Obviously, they're
the primary ones for a reason, but I'll explain that later. For
now, I'll give a brief explanation for each attribute.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Strength (STR):</em> Strength affects your
ability to hold how many pounds of weight before your encumbered
(I always am). This also affects how often you attack for the
maximum damage your character can hit with. Strength also attacks
your 'Attack Rating' on the 'Persona' screen.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Stamina (STA):</em> Stamina has a few uses.
The most obvious one would be how much HP you start with and how
much extra HP you get per level, which is quite appealing indeed.
It also affects your fatigue bar (yellow bar). I have heard that
the higher the stamina, the longer your fatigue bar will last,
and the faster it will recover. I also heard rumors that it
affects how long you can stay underwater.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Agility (AGI):</em> Agility affects your
character defensively, and that is true indeed. The higher the
agility, the higher your base 'Armor Class' is at the beginning.
It also affects how often you get hit during combat. I have heard
that Agility has a small affect on the 'Attack Rating'.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Dexterity (DEX):</em> Dexterity affects
that when you are wielding a weapon/item that has a special
effect, the check to determine when and how often the effect goes
off is based on your Dexterity. I've also heard that the 'Attack
rating' is impacted by Dexterity.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Intelligence (INT):</em> Intelligence
affects how fast your skills raise. Trade skills, combat skills,
spellcasting skills, the whole lot. Having a low Intelligence can
be bad, as it'll take a long time for your skills to raise. It is
not a big disadvantage, just an annoying one.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Wisdom (WIS):</em> Wisdom affects how much
mana you have once you hit Level 9. It also affects how often you
succeed when you're working on your trade skills and combining
all those little ingredients together.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Charisma (CHA):</em> Charisma affects your
factions and the prices that the NPCs will offer to you when
you're buying/selling. This can have a use if you're saving for
some things and are desperate for a load of cash.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Levels and Equipment:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The following part basically walks you through
the basic rules of the first 20 levels of your life as a paladin.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 1-5:</em> The first 5 levels should
be pretty straightforward. Go outside and fight those rats or
skeletons and other level 1 monsters. Make sure you con them
before you attack, if it's white/black, go and kill it. Avoid
yellow and red monsters because you WILL get killed. If say, you
get attacked by a 'Fire Beetle' train (typical for early players),
don't be afraid to flee to the guards so they can take care of
them! Since you most likely won't be able to afford a
'Lightstone' or a 'Greater Lightstone' yet (unless a high-leveled
person is generous and gives you one for free). You should
probably keep a 'Fire Beetle Eye' in your 8 primary slots as a
lightsource (this applies to humans and Erudites, the other races
have night vision). 'Sense Heading', 'Taunt' and 'Lay on Hands'
should be hotkeyed to one of your keybanks. Keep 'Sense Heading'
and 'Taunt' maxed at level cap at all times because these two
skills are very useful. As for 'Lay on Hands', only use it if
necessary, or else you might not be able to use it when you
really need it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 1-5 Equipment:</em> Basically, the
first 5 levels, don't worry so much about equipment. You should
most likely be wearing your guild tunic. There's also a
possibility that you obtained some gold and might be able to buy
some patchwork armor from some tailors. If not, don't worry about
it too much for now. There are also occasions that a couple of
generous teen-leveled people will get out 'Dervish Cutthroat
Rings' for free to new players. These rings help your dexterity
point by +2. If somebody do give you one of these, you'd probably
keep them for some time.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 6-10:</em> There are three waypoints
here. The first one, at level 6, you obtain your first combat
skill 'Bash'. If you are planning for the sword-shield weapon
route, make sure you put a practice point into 'Bash' or this
combat skill won't rise. 'Bash' allows your character to deal
damage while equipping a shield. Which gives you a reason to
obtain one for the extra damage and the improved armor class. The
second waypoint, at level 9, is the level that you get your first
rank of spells. You will feel more like a paladin once you obtain
your spells. Buy everyone level 9 spell at your local paladin
guild vendor as each on of them has their uses. Finally, at level
10, you receive your third waypoint, and that is to obtain
'Dodge'! 'Dodge' is a great combat skill and is an automatic one,
put a practice point into 'Dodge' and watch it fly. This skill
will raise very fast.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 6-10 Equipment:</em> You should
probably be in full patchwork/leather/raw-hide at this point. If
you've been saving your money, maybe you can buy a few piece of
banded. You should be able to throw away your rusty swords by now
and probably bought some 'Sharpening Stones' at your local
blacksmith and tarnished your own weapon. You should most likely
be either wielding a tarnished/bronze weapon by now and possibly
a shield (if you're going the sword-shield weapon route). I would
recommend the 'Shiny Brass Shield (SBS)' if you could afford it,
or just buy a 'Round Shield' at the paladin guild vendor. A SBS
sells for a normal 20pp (pp = platinum) and you might be able to
pursuade the person selling the shield to you to lower his/her
price if he/she is a high-leveled person.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 11-15:</em> Again, there are two
waypoints within this level range. Firstly, at level 12, you get
meditate. Once you obtain this skill, put a practice point into
it and just start meditating. Don't bother putting extra points
in it because it raises itself VERY fast! Once you obtain
meditate, you'll then notice how you'd live without it (although
the spellbook is quite annoying to look at)! Ah, the second
waypoint is another good one, and that is your second rank of
spells! I would encourage that you buy all the level 15 spells
and maybe except 'Hammer of Wrath' unless if you have a use for
it.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 11-15 Equipment:</em> Around this
time, you should probably be in full banded, banded/bronze or
full bronze. Along with some possibly 'Blackened Iron' armor
pieces, and maybe other magical armor pieces. You should have
obtained a 'Fine Steel' weapon by now, it is better to buy it
from a player because the prices at the blacksmiths are
ridiculous. Your rings and earrings will stay at the +2/+3 status
most likely, as to the fact that +4/above rings/earrings are
simply not within your grasp as to the fact that you definitely
can't afford it at this time.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 16-20: </em>Ah, two waypoints here
again. The first waypoint is at level 17, the new automatic
combat skill is 'Parry'. This is a good skill and again, put one
point into it and watch it fly! As this skill nears the 50s, you
should probably see it once in a while per battle. When 'Dodge'
and 'Parry' reaches the 90s, these two skills will help out in
your combat greatly and you should see it go off a couple of
times in each battle. Soon, there are just simply attacks that
don't hit you! The second waypoint, is at level 20, which is the
level where you get 'Double Attack'. You might would've noticed
that it's really hard to 'Taunt' beasties of fellow warrior/ranger
group members because they're either dual wielding/double
attacking. They out-damage you too greatly that you just can't
'Taunt' those darn baddies off them! With 'Double Attack' here,
you should be able to become a better tank now. Oh, yes, the
extra waypoint is at level 20 is the ability to get your last
name! Just type /surname &lt;insert surname&gt; and you're done!</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>Levels 16-20 Equipment:</em> By now, you're
banded armor should probably be gone, or maybe a couple of pieces.
You'd most likely be wearing bronze armor or some 'Blackened
Iron' armor pieces. Of course, your money is limited, so. Weapon/armor?
It's your choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>I choose Weapon:</em><br>
Hm.well, if you've decided to go towards the weapon equipment
waypoint. You'd most likely be of to buy a 'Combine' weapon at
your nearest 'Gypsy Camp' (the only one I know of is at Oasis of
Marr). In case you don't know, 'Combine' weapons have the same
stats as the 'Fine Steel' weapons, but the 'Combine' weapons hit
for 'Magic' damage. Some beasties require 'Magic' damage to be
harmed (such as Ghouls and the like). 'Combine' weapons are
useful in the undead zones (Befallen, Unrest, etc.), or else
you'd be seeing those INVULNERABLE messages every 1 or 2 seconds!
A normal 1h slash 'Combine' weapon will range around the 40-60pp,
depending on which one you're buying (I believe 'Combine Long
Sword' and the 'Combine Scimitar' has like a 10-15pp difference).
If you decide to buy a 2h slash 'Combine' weapon, expect to pay
around 100-120pp I believe. Of course, you can always go off and
buy a unique weapon. These weapons are dropped by specific
beasties and cost varies to servers. Of course, our guild resides
in 'The Rathe', so the prices are based on 'The Rathe' prices.
Typical unique weapons are like the 'Shiny Brass Halberd (SBH)',
the 'Bone Bladed Claymore (BBC)' and other weapons. Of course, if
you can afford it, a 'Blackened Iron Bastard Sword (BIBS)' is an
appealing offer. These three weapons are all 2h slash, keep that
in mind. The SBH costs roughly 70-90pp, the BBC would be 80-100pp
and the BIBS would be around 300pp. The SBH's stats are: 16
damage, 47 delay and magic damage. The BBC's stats are: 17
damage, 45 delay and a nasty -9 AGI penalty towards this sword. I
believe that the BIBS are: 20 damage, 47 delay and magic damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><em>I choose Armor:</em><br>
Hm.armor you say? Well, you're best bet will most likely be
'Banded', 'Bronze' and 'Blackened Iron' armor I would say. Their
costs vary since the quality of the Armor Class varies in itself.
Of course, along with armor, rings come into consideration too.
With a mixture of 'Banded'/'Bronze' and some magical rings, it
would definitely yield around +100pp I'd suppose. This also
brings up the matter of a shield. That is, of course, if you are
ever going to use a shield. If you've been following the Sword-Shield
route all along, you'd definitely be using a SBS by now. I have
heard that the next shield up would be the Cracked Darkwood
Shield. I've asked around and I heard that a reasonable price
would be 300pp. I would have to agree with this, since the
Cracked Darkwood Shield has a +9 STR bonus. Quite the opposite
compared to the BBC. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Final Note:</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I've played my paladin for a long time. I think
it is a fun character and it's nice to buff people and heal
people when they are in need. That is what a paladin's all about,
if you role-play him correctly, you'll have more fun when you're
helping people. Cure poisons or diseases when people need it. You
might be rewarded with a donation, but that doesn't really matter.
You're simply wasting a little mana to help somebody. It's an act
of generosity. I've cured diseases over the past weeks and it's
nice to hear somebody say 'Thank you'. I simply reply with a 'Np'
and wave at him/her and just leave. Although I'm very serious
when I wrote this guide, but what the heck!? It's a game, go out
there, and have fun! That's what games are all about.And my
personal quote.</font></p>
