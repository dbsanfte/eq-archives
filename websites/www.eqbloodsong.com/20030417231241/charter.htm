guild dedicated to freedom from constraint attained through
abandonment of fear, enhanced self-expression and the extensive
use of alcohol. Members need an underlying goodness of character
without feeling the need to follow a strict set of rules and
regulations. This almost chaotic and anarchistic attitude makes
any finite definition of Bloodsong difficult. Each of us
expresses the Bloodsong attitude according to their own
worldview. </font><font size="4" face="Verdana"><br>

color="#800040" face="Verdana" size="2">The origins of our guild are
traced to the inns and taverns of Halas. The original idea was a
fairly earthy one drunken Barbarians relishing the rush of blood
in a hearthy atmosphere. They call this the Bloodsong in the
north, that freedom from anxiety that sings through the veins. In
such a condition one feels invincible, as the fiery liquor
courses around your body and as channels of vitality empower the
mind and spirit, one can face the impossible and succeed. As a
bard, I would define it as a wild night of song, so powerful a
man becomes lost outside himself. Seeing the world as a whole and
finally understanding his role within it. Jendaiyen, Half-Elven
Bard of Freeport What Jendaiyen is expressing is that euphoria
attained in abandonment to our primal natures. As any shaman will
tell you, we are but complicated animals that have lost our link
to primal drives we constantly suppress. The nature of our guild
is an attempt to recapture the power these drives supply. The
glory of wild combat, with little care of living or dying, is how
Bronwyn expressed it. To feel the Bloodsong coursing through your
veins, you must try to go beyond yourself and touch the divine,
to understand the fire of Zek, the glory of Mithaniel or the
ardor of Errolisi. In this state, Bloodsong members believe
themselves channels for the cardinal attributes of their deities,
instruments of the forces of nature itself. What many may see as
an amoral and irresponsible abandonment of society&#146;s
constraints we see as the ultimate expression of appreciation and
devotion to the sublime. Iconoclast </font><font size="4"

color="#800040" face="Verdana">To truly leave behind the shackles
of constraint one must understand that money should be shared,
not hoarded. (Bloodsong Rogues take it upon themselves to help
misers to appreciate the need for redistribution) This is not to
say that a member cannot save for anything, they just realize
that freedom from the love of money releases the spirit to truly
enjoy itself. Can&#146;t argue with that one, sharing the spoils
of war in the comfort of a tavern is what I look forward to. Of
course I don&#146;t like being taken advantage of so don&#146;t
expect a free ride. Trading is more fun when you feel that
you&#146;re getting a good deal AND making the other guy happy,
that feel-good factor must be worth its weight in platinum.

in corpse retrieval, or a greenhorn&#146;s request for
information and guidance these are all challenges to be met
without though of personal gain. </font><font

for life! The unmatchable stamina of Barbarians helps here, but
the rest of us take this as a challenge and try to match them
blow for blow! </font><font face="Verdana"><br>

ridicule. What enjoyment will be gained from being shunned by
others because of sundry and pestering behavior? When one&#146;s
actions or opinions are not appreciated, back off. We don&#146;t
need to ram our ideals up their noses. </font></p>
