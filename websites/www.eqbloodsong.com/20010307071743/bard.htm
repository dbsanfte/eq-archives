<P ALIGN="CENTER">As our ancestors retold to us their story of love and war, so do we set down with pen the task of immortilizing our glorious deeds for those who will come after. Gather 'round and pour a mug of ale. Listen now, and remember. For your children's children will retell these tales__forever.</P>

<P>Through mountains high<BR>
And Winters cold<BR>
'Till dark draws neigh<BR>
And Time grows old<BR>
We'll Face our Battles<BR>
Fierce and Bold<BR>
For Bloodsong<BR>
<BR>
Through Dragons' teeth<BR>
And Giants' den<BR>
We've come to face our deaths again<BR>
With blood and sin and kin again<BR>
For Bloodsong<BR>
<BR>
With Flagons deep and Tankards wide<BR>
Our faces full of ale and pride<BR>
We'll drink until the devils cry<BR>
Our Bloodsong<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">Friendship</P><p><B><font color="white" size=3>
<P>A moment<BR>
And it is gone<BR>
A breath<BR>
Before breathlessness<BR>
What will defies the incessant turning of the wheel?<BR>
And what remains?<BR>
<BR>
A touch<BR>
Yet lingers when the fingers have left<BR>
<BR>
A song<BR>
Felt once the words have faded<BR>
<BR>
A deed<BR>
That lives once we have ceased<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And Friendship...<BR>
The magic which turns a soloist into a choir<BR>
A tree into a forest<BR>
A community from strangers<BR>
<BR>
Sharing our selves<BR>
Our love<BR>
Our pain<BR>
Validating the experience of being alive<BR>
<BR>
Such is the pulse of life<BR>
brief and uncertain<BR>
Beautiful beyond imagination<BR>
Tragic beyond compare<BR>

<P>The moments heave in endless breath<BR>
The turning rythmns of the world<BR>
Although each birth betrays a death<BR>
So must our bulging sails unfurl<BR>
<BR>
The journey 'cross the oceans wide<BR>
The only way the truth is found<BR>
The great unknown is e'er my bride<BR>
To her my helpless soul is bound<BR>
<BR>
And as the sun begins to set<BR>
Behold! The mystic moon does rise<BR>
So lest ye ever do forget<BR>
Know change is but the great disguise<BR><BR>

<BODY>
<P>Our hearts you raised with courage true<BR>
Their hearts you cleaved with steel in two<BR>
With sword and spell in equal skill<BR>
The foulest fiend your deeds did kill<BR>
And so my friend I bid farewell<BR>
When next we'll meet I'll not foretell<BR>
But one last wish I send to thee<BR>
May your cup be full and your spirit free<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">What is Love..</P><p><B><font color="white" size=3>
<P>What is love that enraptures me so<BR>
That it has my heart racing<BR>
As it turns my tongue slow<BR>
It can fill me with pleasure<BR>
As it fills me with pain<BR>
And makes pale mystery of the wind and the rain<BR>
It sends my soul soaring through the galaxies above<BR>
Yet I'm stuck with this answerless question<BR>
What is love...<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN="CENTER">And Killed My Heart</P><p><B><font color="white" size=3>
<P>My love she left me by the hill<BR>
To spill my tears to empty ground<BR>
The sound of her still haunts my ears<BR>
My fears of loss in love I've found<BR>
<BR>
In battles fierce and painted red<BR>
She said she'd stay right by my side<BR>
My bride now sleeps in another bed<BR>
She fed me honey coated lies<BR>
<BR>
So I do sit upon this hill<BR>
And still I wonder what will come<BR>
My run with love has taken ill<BR>
And killed my heart for another one<BR>
<BR>
