(visit www.everquest.com for more details)<br /><br /><br />Return of the Casino<br />------------------------<br /><br />** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! **<br /><br />Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven again houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play!<br /><br />Tradeskill UI now live<br />------------------------<br /><br />Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the "combine" button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination.<br /><br />Item Changes<br />------------------------<br />- The name of Berserker armor has been changed to Bladesmans armor.<br />- The beastlord epic weapon will no longer "proc" for wielders below the 46th level.<br />- Many text changes in item descriptions.<br /><br /><br />General Bug Fixes<br />------------------------<br />- A Tormentors hoof is now flagged as a tradeskill item.<br />- Chaotic Stab, a rogue AA, will no longer cause full damage on frontal attacks. <br />- Altered some NPC factions in the Plane of Tactics arena to prevent a problem with charm.<br /><br />Combat Abilities<br />------------------------<br />- Fixed some text on the Focus Will Discipline.<br />- Assassins Strike should now work correctly.<br />- Sneak Attack should now work correctly.<br />- Thief's Vengeance is now working correctly.<br />- Indirection should now work as intended.<br /><br />Spells<br />------------------------<br />- Corrected a few spell descriptions.<br />- Corrected some spell sound effects.<br />- Arachnae Venom and Fellspine should now stack with the warriors provoke abilities.<br /><br>
