    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Bloodsong is always looking for people that would
    like to become part of the Bloodsong family. Most people become interested
    in joining Bloodsong because of exposure to existing Bloodsong members.
    Members of Bloodsong are always on the lookout for potential new blood. We
    are looking for mature, fun loving players of all classes and races who
    enjoy helping others and just having a great time.&nbsp;Unless you are
    invited into Bloodsong by special invitation, you mush be at least level 10
    to join.</font><p><font color="#FFFFFF">If this sounds like what you are looking for in a
    guild, send us an E-mail. Tell us how you heard about Bloodsong and tell us
    a little about your character like your name, class, where you are hunting
    lately. If you have spent time hunting with any members of Bloodsong, let us
    know who that was. This E-mail helps us better understand if you would be a
    good addition to Bloodsong.</font></p>
