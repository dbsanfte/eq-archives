	So, Aethdor was calmly wandering around Dagnor's Cauldron and came across this:<br /><img src="http://www.eqbloodsong.com/images/praklion.jpg"><br /><br />Luckily he got out of zone fast enough to avoid being eating by the Praklion of the Cauldron ... but that means we didn't get the chance to see Dirmik running around naked... waving his water sprinkler...<br /><br /><br>

	Update 2/18/04 <br />------------------------ <br /><br />Headlines <br />------------------------ <br />Favor points adjustment <br />Improved server stability <br /><br /><br /><br />Tribute System <br />------------------------ <br /><br />- You may see a change to your accrued favor points as we implement the second change to the Tribute System. As you know, many items were overvalued and have since been reduced. Now we will be adjusting the accrued favor pool to reflect the amount you should have received for items turned in prior to the changes. We know that this may take away some of your accrued points and for that we apologize, however this change will bring the system more in-line with our intentions. We hope that you agree that it was a reasonable and necessary change. <br /><br /><br /><br />Server Stability <br />------------------------ <br /><br />- We have made some coding changes to the front end to improve connectivity and stability and reduce the number of 1017 errors. <br /><br />The EQ team apologizes for the server instability in the past week. This instability occurs at peak times, and is seen to our users as "1017" errors. Normally within a few minutes these users are able to log back in, but on some servers this problem has occurred more than once in a single evening. <br /><br />We're working to address the problem, and expect that in the next couple of days we'll have everything resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance you'll run into this problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times - if you do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20 minutes. <br /><br />Gates of Discord has been immensely popular - many of our old customers have been coming back to try it out, and many new customers have arrived to give EQ a try. Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in addition the people who are online are also playing more and for longer than usual. Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, high level content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of content is particularly taxing on our servers, and coupled with the unusually high usage, we're seeing a resulting instability during our peak times. <br /><br />Our first effort was to remove the casino, which improved our server stability. Since then, we've been working on two different fixes, the first of which will go live at the 3am patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night). The second will be later this week. Both of them are meant to improve performance during peak times and address the 1017 errors that you may be experiencing. Each of them we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, and we expect our second fix to resolve the problems. <br /><br />We apologize for our service instability in the past week; we're working hard on this problem - it's cutting into our play time too.  <br /><br />We'll give you another update in the next day or two as we make progress, and let you know how things are coming. <br /><br /><br /><br />Items <br />------------------------ <br /><br />The following items had their "Cleave" effect removed due to stacking issues; <br /><br />Bracer of the Heartstriker <br />Bracer of Exploration <br />Bracer of the Stoutheart <br />Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat <br />Rayin's Chestplate of Abhorrence <br />Pressl's Tunic of Balance <br />Kizash's Tunic of Savage Heart <br />Luvwen's Chestplate of Melody <br />Nadien's Chainmail of the Archer <br />Nodnol's Chainmail of the Scoundrel <br />Harlad's Chainmail of Fury <br />Trimdet's Chestplate of Chivalry <br />Gem-Studded Band of Struggle <br />Glowing Spiritstone Necklace <br>
