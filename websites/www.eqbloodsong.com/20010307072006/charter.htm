&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloodsong is in essence a guild dedicated to freedom from constraint attained through abandonment of fear, enhanced self-expression and the extensive use of alcohol. Members need an underlying goodness of character without feeling the need to follow a strict set of rules and regulations.  This almost chaotic and anarchistic attitude makes any finite definition of Bloodsong difficult. Each of us expresses the Bloodsong attitude according to their own worldview.

<p><font size=+4>Bloodsong Charter</font></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The origins of our guild are traced to the inns and taverns of Halas. The original idea was a fairly earthy one drunken Barbarians relishing the rush of blood in a hearthy atmosphere. They call this the Bloodsong in the north, that freedom from anxiety that sings through the veins. In such a condition one feels invincible, as the fiery liquor courses around your body and as channels of vitality empower the mind and spirit, one can face the impossible and succeed.  As a bard, I would define it as a wild night of song, so powerful a man becomes lost outside himself. Seeing the world as a whole and finally understanding his role within it. Jendaiyen, Half-Elven Bard of Freeport
	What Jendaiyen is expressing is that euphoria attained in abandonment to our primal natures. As any shaman will tell you, we are but complicated animals that have lost our link to primal drives we constantly suppress. The nature of our guild is an attempt to recapture the power these drives supply. The glory of wild combat, with little care of living or dying, is how Bronwyn expressed it. To feel the Bloodsong coursing through your veins, you must try to go beyond yourself and touch the divine, to understand the fire of Zek, the glory of Mithaniel or the ardor of Errolisi. In this state, Bloodsong members believe themselves channels for the cardinal attributes of their deities, instruments of the forces of nature itself. 
	What many may see as an amoral and irresponsible abandonment of society’s constraints we see as the ultimate expression of appreciation and devotion to the sublime. Iconoclast

<p><font size=+2>Codes of Practice</font></p>

<font color="white">Generosity</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">I hate kill-stealers! Bronwyn</font>
To truly leave behind the shackles of constraint one must understand that money should be shared, not hoarded. (Bloodsong Rogues take it upon themselves to help misers to appreciate the need for redistribution) This is not to say that a member cannot save for anything, they just realize that freedom from the love of money releases the spirit to truly enjoy itself.
Can’t argue with that one, sharing the spoils of war in the comfort of a tavern is what I look forward to. Of course I don’t like being taken advantage of so don’t expect a free ride. Trading is more fun when you feel that you’re getting a good deal AND making the other guy happy, that feel-good factor must be worth its weight in platinum. Atkins



<br><br><br>



<font color="white">Enjoyment</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">It’s why we join afterall. Bruennor</font>
Each trip to a new town should involve a visit to at least one tavern, and the drinking engaged in therein should be in the company of others. Showing others the Bloodsong spirit is every member’s goal! Our generosity of spirit is shared in this way. 




<br><br><br>





<font color="white">Self-sacrifice</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">The first step in any cooperative group!  Atkins</font>
Self-sacrifice is not the pious martyrdom of Monks, Clerics, and Paladins but the heart-felt willingness to assist others in need without thought of reward. A character fairing badly in battle, a plea to assist in corpse retrieval, or a greenhorn’s request for information and guidance these are all challenges to be met without though of personal gain.



<br><br><br>



<font color="white">Energetic Nature</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">Live fast and die young!  Rulek</font>
In battle, a Bloodsong member (even if a spellcaster/healer) is expected to be an active energetic member of the group. Whether in combat or at play, vigor and exuberance should be displayed. Remember we have a zest for life! The unmatchable stamina of Barbarians helps here, but the rest of us take this as a challenge and try to match them blow for blow!



<br><br><br>



<font color="white">Emotive Displays</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">Don’t suppress it, channel it.  Iconoclast</font>
Never keeping ones feelings to oneself, a Bloodsong member will punctuate his conversations and actions with a range of energetic expressions and emotes. Indeed, between members this becomes something of a contest and often borders on the absurd or extreme.



<br><br><br>



<p><font color="white">Open-mindedness</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">Free your minds people!  Lilasie</font>
Narrow mindedness of any kind is an anathema to Bloodsong. All are welcome. The lifestyle and moral code (good/bad) of  some characters sometimes makes them unable to abide the spirit of our guild. Should they seek the freedoms from their constraints, Bloodsong members will oblige. 



<br><br><br>




<p><font color="white">Live by Example</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">Man, I’m never sober.  Senaddar</font>
Combining the concepts of most the preceding codes, Bloodsong members strive to show through example the wisdom of their beliefs. No preaching of rhetoric are needed. They manner in which a Bloodsong conducts themselves show to all that they believe in the rightness of their actions.




<br><br><br>




<p><font color="white">Live and Let Live</font><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="yellow">To each their own.  Trinyti</font>
A Bloodsong member must understand the need for balance. Not everyone is happy with the idea of personal freedom and are willing to shed those bonds of rules. A Bloodsong member seeks to bring joy and enlightenment into people’s lives, not irritate them with cruel jest or ridicule. What enjoyment will be gained from being shunned by others because of sundry and pestering behavior? When one’s actions or opinions are not appreciated, back off. We don’t need to ram our ideals up their noses.
