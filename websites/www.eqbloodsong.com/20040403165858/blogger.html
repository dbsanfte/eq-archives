	<strong>Patch message April 1st, 2004</strong><br /><br />Headlines<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Collision checking has been improved again.<br />The next round of healing balance has gone live, in light of the Gates of Discord expansion.<br />Also, melee changes for the Tanking classes have gone live, for the same reason.<br />Tradeskill changes.<br />Some general improvements and bug fixes.<br /><br />Collision checking<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Players have reported numerous issues with mobs getting walled. Changes have been made to ensure mobs will no longer get stuck in walls. As is the case with players already, mobs will now also make automatic use of the /rewind option if they get stuck in a wall, corner or object.<br /><br />Also, collision detection has been improved with regards to the bolt spells of Magicians and arrows being fired at mobs. Instead of poofing when hitting an inanimate object or another player, the bolts and arrows will now bounce off of them instead. We hope this will bring more realism to the game mechanics involving bolts and arrows.<br /><br />Healing Balance<br />--------------------------<br /><br />As part of our ongoing efforts to balance out the healing classes, we have made several changes, for which your input has been invaluable. The following changes have been made, which primarily address player concerns with the Gates of Discord expansion:<br /><br />- Druids and Shamans had the spell mana cost of their percentage Complete Healing reduced from 600 mana to 500 mana. Also, Shamans had the healing power of their Complete Healing spell upgraded to heal 2350 hitpoints at most instead of the 1950 hitpoints up to now.<br />- Shamans gained several powerful short duration heal over time spells, both single target and group target, starting at level 55 with Spiritual Infusion up to level 65 with Pulse of Life. Some of these spells can be found on shaman spell vendors, but some also come from Parchments or from Gates of Discord drops.<br />- Druids gained several new direct healing spells, starting at level 50 with Nature’s Mending up to level 65 with Tunare’s Lifeforce. As with the Shaman spells, they can be found in various locations.<br />- To reduce the demand on Clerics for resurrection type spells, Shamans have gained a new line of resurrection spells. These spells, when cast on a player, enable the Shaman to send the unfortunate character back to its latest corpse, restoring a certain amount of experience lost in the process. The spell line starts at level 34 and receives upgrades several times up to level 64. Alternately, they can function as a normal resurrection when cast on a corpse.<br />- In order to make sure Clerics remain interesting for groups, we’ve made several changes to the Cleric class. We’ve raised the skill cap for Offense, 1H Blunt and 2H Blunt to 225, Defence to 235, Bash to 200 and Dodge to 150. Furthermore, we’ve added a self-only invis spell at level 52 which can be obtained in Gates of Discord.<br /><br />Melee balance<br />--------------------------<br /><br />As players have experienced Gates of Discord – in particular the various Trials – we have noticed shortcomings in the secondary Tanking classes. We have made several changes to bring them back in line with the Warrior class.<br /><br />- Shadowknights, Paladins and Monks can now use the Fortitude discipline at level 65.<br />- Shadowknights and Paladins can now use the Defensive discipline, starting from level 62.<br />- Shadowknights and Paladins can now use the Evasive discipline, starting from level 58.<br /><br />Besides these discipline changes, we have also moved Shadowknights and Paladins to the Warrior hitpoint table.<br /><br />Warriors have gained a +5% innate bonus to their Armor Class to compensate.<br /><br />Tradeskill changes<br />--------------------------<br /><br />- We encountered a serious bug with the new Tradeskill UI, which has been corrected with this patch. Unfortunately, this made it necessary to wipe the list of favored and learned recipes. We apologize for this inconvenience, but there was no other option to remedy this bug.<br />- Tradeskill containers that are on your character will now need to be emptied before you can use them.<br />- Removed the Coldain Velium Tempers from the vendor in Thurgadin. It was never meant to be sold again as standard stock, but the sneaky Dwarf managed to find an extra stash. We took it away from him.<br />- Shadeling Silk Threads can now be used with “old world” skins instead of Spiderling Silk Threads, to make Leather Paddings.<br />- Changes were made to the Elemental crafted armors, so the rare Temper will now only be needed for the final combine. A new Temper is needed to make the various subcombines, for which the components drop in the appropriate Plane.<br /><br />General improvements and bug fixes<br />--------------------------<br /><br />- Removed the 85% rule from accessing zones with a raid force. To enter a zone for a raid, people will now each need the proper flags again, to fix the headaches players have been having with getting raids zoning into these zones.<br />- Corrected an issue with corpses disappearing into a wall. Corpses will now also auto /rewind when they would normally end up in a wall or object.<br />- The new sky has been fully implemented for all zones now. In zones that can have a starry night, the stars at night will also rotate like the sun and moon and they will scintillate as well. We are aware this may cause some performance issues on lower end machines, but we will keep an eye on this.<br />- Fixed a bug with pet Armor class and Attack. Armor class and Attack for pets were incorrectly receiving a bonus that was implemented when we were testing pet changes. The bonus has been removed so pets should now be as they are intended.<br />- Grand Librarian Maelin will no longer clear your planar progression flags when you hail him.<br />- Aid Grimel will now return the correct earring again for the final stage of the quest he gives.<br />- Access to the Plane of Time is once again restricted to just those people who really have access to the zone through their flags.<br />- Access to the Tower of Solusek Ro is now available for all people who are level 65, without needing the proper flags.<br />- Made several minor changes to remedy pathing issues.<br />- Aeksola Faerlonifer in Shadowhaven sells Sapphires again instead of Blue Diamonds.<br />- Reduced the chance to get good items in the Casino somewhat, as the current gain was higher than we had intended.<br /><br /><br>

	So, Aethdor was calmly wandering around Dagnor's Cauldron and came across this:<br /><img src="http://www.eqbloodsong.com/images/praklion.jpg"><br /><br />Luckily he got out of zone fast enough to avoid being eating by the Praklion of the Cauldron ... but that means we didn't get the chance to see Dirmik running around naked... waving his water sprinkler...<br /><br /><br>

	Update 2/18/04 <br />------------------------ <br /><br />Headlines <br />------------------------ <br />Favor points adjustment <br />Improved server stability <br /><br /><br /><br />Tribute System <br />------------------------ <br /><br />- You may see a change to your accrued favor points as we implement the second change to the Tribute System. As you know, many items were overvalued and have since been reduced. Now we will be adjusting the accrued favor pool to reflect the amount you should have received for items turned in prior to the changes. We know that this may take away some of your accrued points and for that we apologize, however this change will bring the system more in-line with our intentions. We hope that you agree that it was a reasonable and necessary change. <br /><br /><br /><br />Server Stability <br />------------------------ <br /><br />- We have made some coding changes to the front end to improve connectivity and stability and reduce the number of 1017 errors. <br /><br />The EQ team apologizes for the server instability in the past week. This instability occurs at peak times, and is seen to our users as "1017" errors. Normally within a few minutes these users are able to log back in, but on some servers this problem has occurred more than once in a single evening. <br /><br />We're working to address the problem, and expect that in the next couple of days we'll have everything resolved. In the meantime, there's a chance you'll run into this problem if you're on a crowded server during peak times - if you do, you can normally get back onto the servers within 15 or 20 minutes. <br /><br />Gates of Discord has been immensely popular - many of our old customers have been coming back to try it out, and many new customers have arrived to give EQ a try. Our simultaneous usage numbers are quite high, but in addition the people who are online are also playing more and for longer than usual. Gates of Discord introduced many new instanced zones, high level content, and re-introduced the casino - this type of content is particularly taxing on our servers, and coupled with the unusually high usage, we're seeing a resulting instability during our peak times. <br /><br />Our first effort was to remove the casino, which improved our server stability. Since then, we've been working on two different fixes, the first of which will go live at the 3am patch Wednesday morning (Tuesday night). The second will be later this week. Both of them are meant to improve performance during peak times and address the 1017 errors that you may be experiencing. Each of them we expect to be an improvement on connectivity, and we expect our second fix to resolve the problems. <br /><br />We apologize for our service instability in the past week; we're working hard on this problem - it's cutting into our play time too.  <br /><br />We'll give you another update in the next day or two as we make progress, and let you know how things are coming. <br /><br /><br /><br />Items <br />------------------------ <br /><br />The following items had their "Cleave" effect removed due to stacking issues; <br /><br />Bracer of the Heartstriker <br />Bracer of Exploration <br />Bracer of the Stoutheart <br />Vadd's Chestplate of Elite Combat <br />Rayin's Chestplate of Abhorrence <br />Pressl's Tunic of Balance <br />Kizash's Tunic of Savage Heart <br />Luvwen's Chestplate of Melody <br />Nadien's Chainmail of the Archer <br />Nodnol's Chainmail of the Scoundrel <br />Harlad's Chainmail of Fury <br />Trimdet's Chestplate of Chivalry <br />Gem-Studded Band of Struggle <br />Glowing Spiritstone Necklace <br>
