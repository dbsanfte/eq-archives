              The raid Will be held at the Kerra Island near Tox forest in Odus!
              For those who don't know the location it'll be my pleasure to tell
              U on the guild chat! We won't meet at Kerra. We will meet at the
              Tox forest docks so everybody will know how to get there (probably
              more raid incoming from me) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) -->

              can dish out. Sounds like it is going to be great fun! Check the <a href="http://http://pub20.ezboard.com/fbloodsongbloodsong.showMessage?topicID=179.topic">Forum

              - Just a few more days until the photo contest ends. Only 29 days
              in this month. To be fair, I will not accept late entries. Any
              E-mail link will get to me. I have a few more to add to the
              contest page which I will try and get done tomorrow. I will also
              try and get the captions added where people have requested it.
              Once all the pictures are on the web page, the pictures will be
              judged by a non Bloodsong member. Good Luck to all who enter.
              Remember that grand prize is 1000 platinum!&nbsp;</font></p>

              <p>- A great time was had by all at the party. Not too many
              deaths. A group went to East Karana and helped me with my Epic by
              killing the Dark Elf Corruptor. Course I messed up the next step
              and get to do it again. But it was fun and I appreciate all the
              help. All in all, it was a good time.</p>

              <p>- We had a couple new enlistments in the last couple of days.
              I'm trying to get better at keeping up with this.&nbsp; Toasty
              joined up with us this last weekend he is a Erudite Wizard of
              around 14 when I last saw him. Hunting kitties.&nbsp; Tialar is a
              49 Wood Elf Druid. He was last seen camping the king's room in
              Perma. Dalvaras joined up with bloodsong today. He was in Greater
              Faydark and I forgot to get his details. Sorry Dalvaras. Wenliren
              joined Bloodsong today. He is a Rogue of the 11th season. I met
              him in Qeyenos.&nbsp;</p>
