	7/14/2004<br /><br />Headlines!<br />-------------------<br />Veeshan's Peak has been re-worked. Enjoy the new challenge.<br />A new Adventure Zone appears on Stormhammer.<br />You can now remove augments without losing them.<br /><br />Veeshan's Peak!<br />-------------------<br />With this revamp we have Updated the level and NPC list for the zone: Please note that this zone is now an elemental level zone! The entry quest to Veeshan’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified. However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <br /><br />- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality.<br />- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them.<br />- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them.<br />- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot.<br /><br /><br />New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer<br />-------------------<br />Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone. This is a 2 group adventure zone for characters of level 65. <br /><br />Can you help the Eldritch Collective find and rescue Professor Bartleby Beckelbracker? Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies.<br /><br /><br />Augment Removal *<br />-------------------<br />- You can now purchase special "distillers" that will remove augmentations without destroying them. These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock. The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it.<br /><br />- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don't want to keep it. You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot. The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete.<br /><br />- For those with custom UI's, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window.<br /><br /><br />Pets *<br />-------------------<br />- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet.<br /><br />- Pets can be shrunk again. Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size.<br /><br /><br />Tribute Changes *<br />-------------------<br />- Some items have had their favor value lowered.<br /><br />- Players will now "Pre-pay" for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br /><br />- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they've selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br /><br />- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player's benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the benefit will do when activated.<br /><br />- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active and gray when they are not.<br /><br /><br />Item Changes<br />-------------------<br />- Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls. It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone.<br /><br />- Malcohm Thimbleton, in the Plane of Knowledge will now swap out some Robe Graphic items for Tunic Graphics. *<br /><br />- The Staff of Revealed Secrets now has a 2hb weapon model instead of the little stick it had before. Enjoy your bigger stick.<br /><br /><br />UI Changes<br />-------------------<br />- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your inventory screen. *<br />- By mousing over your buff icons, you will now be able to see the buffs remaining duration. *<br /><br />Berserkers<br />-------------------<br />- Berserkers now have innate crits beginning at level 12.<br />- Tainted Axe of Hatred now comes in stacks of 20.<br /><br /><br />Additional Notes<br />-------------------<br />- You now have the ability to sell back LDoN items and augments to the adventure merchants for a percentage of their original cost. *<br /><br />- We have increased the number of NPC debuff slots from 30 to 50. Necromancers rejoice. *<br /><br />- The Doppleganger AA's re-use timer has been reduced to 30 minutes. *<br /><br />- Sprint and Planeswalk have had their movement rate increased. *<br /><br />- Beware! Many named mobs in Gates will now summon. <br /><br />- The Hide all traders option, for the Bazaar, will no longer need to be reset each time you enter the zone. *<br /><br />- /stopspellcast will no longer give spells recast delays.<br /><br />- Leadership: Group/Raid mark npc should now update for people that are added to the group or raid.<br /><br />- Main assist will no longer clear if the main assist zones.<br /><br />- Bards should once again play the stringed instrument animation when playing a stringed instrument song.<br /><br />- Hynid fleshrippers, tide feasters, and shore stonemites in Natimbi no longer hit so hard.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-- The EverQuest Team<br /><br />*Denotes a change requested by the community <br /><br /><br>

	<strong>Patch message April 1st, 2004</strong><br /><br />Headlines<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Collision checking has been improved again.<br />The next round of healing balance has gone live, in light of the Gates of Discord expansion.<br />Also, melee changes for the Tanking classes have gone live, for the same reason.<br />Tradeskill changes.<br />Some general improvements and bug fixes.<br /><br />Collision checking<br />--------------------------<br /><br />Players have reported numerous issues with mobs getting walled. Changes have been made to ensure mobs will no longer get stuck in walls. As is the case with players already, mobs will now also make automatic use of the /rewind option if they get stuck in a wall, corner or object.<br /><br />Also, collision detection has been improved with regards to the bolt spells of Magicians and arrows being fired at mobs. Instead of poofing when hitting an inanimate object or another player, the bolts and arrows will now bounce off of them instead. We hope this will bring more realism to the game mechanics involving bolts and arrows.<br /><br />Healing Balance<br />--------------------------<br /><br />As part of our ongoing efforts to balance out the healing classes, we have made several changes, for which your input has been invaluable. The following changes have been made, which primarily address player concerns with the Gates of Discord expansion:<br /><br />- Druids and Shamans had the spell mana cost of their percentage Complete Healing reduced from 600 mana to 500 mana. Also, Shamans had the healing power of their Complete Healing spell upgraded to heal 2350 hitpoints at most instead of the 1950 hitpoints up to now.<br />- Shamans gained several powerful short duration heal over time spells, both single target and group target, starting at level 55 with Spiritual Infusion up to level 65 with Pulse of Life. Some of these spells can be found on shaman spell vendors, but some also come from Parchments or from Gates of Discord drops.<br />- Druids gained several new direct healing spells, starting at level 50 with Nature’s Mending up to level 65 with Tunare’s Lifeforce. As with the Shaman spells, they can be found in various locations.<br />- To reduce the demand on Clerics for resurrection type spells, Shamans have gained a new line of resurrection spells. These spells, when cast on a player, enable the Shaman to send the unfortunate character back to its latest corpse, restoring a certain amount of experience lost in the process. The spell line starts at level 34 and receives upgrades several times up to level 64. Alternately, they can function as a normal resurrection when cast on a corpse.<br />- In order to make sure Clerics remain interesting for groups, we’ve made several changes to the Cleric class. We’ve raised the skill cap for Offense, 1H Blunt and 2H Blunt to 225, Defence to 235, Bash to 200 and Dodge to 150. Furthermore, we’ve added a self-only invis spell at level 52 which can be obtained in Gates of Discord.<br /><br />Melee balance<br />--------------------------<br /><br />As players have experienced Gates of Discord – in particular the various Trials – we have noticed shortcomings in the secondary Tanking classes. We have made several changes to bring them back in line with the Warrior class.<br /><br />- Shadowknights, Paladins and Monks can now use the Fortitude discipline at level 65.<br />- Shadowknights and Paladins can now use the Defensive discipline, starting from level 62.<br />- Shadowknights and Paladins can now use the Evasive discipline, starting from level 58.<br /><br />Besides these discipline changes, we have also moved Shadowknights and Paladins to the Warrior hitpoint table.<br /><br />Warriors have gained a +5% innate bonus to their Armor Class to compensate.<br /><br />Tradeskill changes<br />--------------------------<br /><br />- We encountered a serious bug with the new Tradeskill UI, which has been corrected with this patch. Unfortunately, this made it necessary to wipe the list of favored and learned recipes. We apologize for this inconvenience, but there was no other option to remedy this bug.<br />- Tradeskill containers that are on your character will now need to be emptied before you can use them.<br />- Removed the Coldain Velium Tempers from the vendor in Thurgadin. It was never meant to be sold again as standard stock, but the sneaky Dwarf managed to find an extra stash. We took it away from him.<br />- Shadeling Silk Threads can now be used with “old world” skins instead of Spiderling Silk Threads, to make Leather Paddings.<br />- Changes were made to the Elemental crafted armors, so the rare Temper will now only be needed for the final combine. A new Temper is needed to make the various subcombines, for which the components drop in the appropriate Plane.<br /><br />General improvements and bug fixes<br />--------------------------<br /><br />- Removed the 85% rule from accessing zones with a raid force. To enter a zone for a raid, people will now each need the proper flags again, to fix the headaches players have been having with getting raids zoning into these zones.<br />- Corrected an issue with corpses disappearing into a wall. Corpses will now also auto /rewind when they would normally end up in a wall or object.<br />- The new sky has been fully implemented for all zones now. In zones that can have a starry night, the stars at night will also rotate like the sun and moon and they will scintillate as well. We are aware this may cause some performance issues on lower end machines, but we will keep an eye on this.<br />- Fixed a bug with pet Armor class and Attack. Armor class and Attack for pets were incorrectly receiving a bonus that was implemented when we were testing pet changes. The bonus has been removed so pets should now be as they are intended.<br />- Grand Librarian Maelin will no longer clear your planar progression flags when you hail him.<br />- Aid Grimel will now return the correct earring again for the final stage of the quest he gives.<br />- Access to the Plane of Time is once again restricted to just those people who really have access to the zone through their flags.<br />- Access to the Tower of Solusek Ro is now available for all people who are level 65, without needing the proper flags.<br />- Made several minor changes to remedy pathing issues.<br />- Aeksola Faerlonifer in Shadowhaven sells Sapphires again instead of Blue Diamonds.<br />- Reduced the chance to get good items in the Casino somewhat, as the current gain was higher than we had intended.<br /><br /><br>
