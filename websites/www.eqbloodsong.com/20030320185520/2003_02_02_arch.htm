			<blockquote><b>Patch Message (02/06)  February 6, 2003 3:00 am </b><br>------------------------------ <br><p><p>** Interface ** <br><p>- All settings for the Songs window should now be saved properly when the player logs out. <br>- Fixed a bug that could cause the Bit Depth and Refresh Rate setting to not save properly upon exit. <br>- Users of Windows XP should no longer be seeing their Windows mouse cursor or other windows 'bleed through' into the game. <br><p><p>** Gameplay ** <br><p>- Changing from an old model character to a Luclin model character at character select should no longer result in the character having no hair. <br>- Fixed a bug that caused merchants to charge a little extra or less (1 copper). <br>- Merchants will no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for starting equipment (they have never actually purchased such items). <br><p><p>** Spells ** <br><p>- Fixed a problem with the Giantsbane Spell quest NPCs not spawning in Skyshrine. <br>- Failing to hide while invisible will now make the invisibility icon disappear. <br><p><p>** Trade Skills ** <br><p>- Many Planar Recipes can now be used in collapsible containers. Some Planar Tailoring can only be done in the Tanaan Loom as opposed to the Planar Sewing Kit. Nothing that was previously made in the Loom was added to the collapsible tailoring kit. Skills changed were Baking, Sewing, Jewel Craft, and Fletching. <br>- Added gnome cultural recipe book to Ak'Anon. <br>- Changed the weights on Spiritstones to be more in line with Faithstones. <br>- Changed Collapsible Jeweler's Kit to 6 slots from 4. <br><p><p>** Zones ** <br><p>- Grummus is much more likely to stay in his home. <br>- Fixed the door to the Ak'Anon zoo, by request of the Zookeeper's Union #23. <br>- Newly created Wood Elf Druids will now make their first appearance in the world much closer to their guild master. <br>- Fennin Ro is now more durable, more in line with the other elemental plane gods. <br>-Rallos Zek now moves considerably faster then before, as do his cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from his lair(s). <br>- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt Scar. The fact that the key was not needed was a bug. We do understand that few people actually walk through this area considering the other methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their doors open. <br><p><p>** Items ** <br><p>- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the Two-Handed Practice Sword. <b></blockquote>

			<blockquote>PATCH MESSAGE, FEBRUARY 4, 2003<br><p>General Notes<br><p>Note: Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to work properly. In order to get them to show up, you may need to set DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file. You can do that by typing /dopropertinting in game. <br><p>ALSO NOTE: We have changed a lot of UI Files. Here's the list: <br><p>UI File Changes<br><p>EQUI.xml <br>EQUI_Animations.xml <br>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml <br>EQUI_FacePick.xml <br>EQUI_NoteWindow.xml <br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml <br>window_pieces04.tga <br>EQUI_JournalCatWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br>EQUI_JournalTextWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br>EQUI_JournalNPCWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br>EQUI_BigBankWnd.xml - NEW FILE <br>Interface and Gameplay<br><p>The melee button for Ulaks, Martial weapons and Two-Handed Piercing weapons should appear to be depressed when attacking. <br>Increased the size of the Notes window in the new UI. <br>/viewport fixed. <br>Fixed bug where action and hot-buttons for innate abilities would revert to numbers (1-6) instead of their name when a skin was loaded using /loadskin.

This means, for example, that summoning haste will work on Beastlord and Necromancer pets. <br>Fixed a bug that caused pet health bar to disappear if when trying to charm when a pet already exists. <br>Divine Barrier now does all of its healing in a single burst instead of as regeneration. <br>Removed the erroneous message "Returning to your own perspective" that occurred when a character was changed into something using an illusion. <br>Quests<br><p>Dillon the Drowned should now respond properly when hailed. <br>Corrected a problem with a 'quest' for the hermit in South Karana. <br>Animist Poren now gives the correct recipe for his Handwraps Quest (shadeling silk instead of shade silk). <br>Noirin Khalen now gives out the proper jewelry book. <br>Supreme Loachsmith Psorin now returns items that he does not need or want. <br>Items<br><p>Removed Rogues from the list of classes on the Elegant Darkwood Katana, since it is a two-handed slashing weapon. <br>Removed the "secondary" tag from the Flametongue, as this item is for Int. casters only and they can't equip this item in their secondary slot. <br>The Nathsar Greatsword and Fester now have the proper inventory icon. <br>Tradeskills<br><p>Added new potions for Vah Shir Shaman (and all other Shaman): Shadeweaver Portal. <br>Renamed one of two items called Figwort. The Figwort sold in Shar Vahl has been renamed Ground Figwort to reduce confusion. <br>Renamed one of two items called Drachling Silk. The Drachling Silk that was once no drop is now tradable and named Drachnid Silk. <br>Adventurers have learned new techniques for fighting Cyclopes. These great beasts are now much more likely to have their eye intact when killed. <br>Fixed the recipe for the potion "Soul of Incorporeal" to use a "feather". <br>Fixed the recipe for the potion "Troll's Essence". <br>Fixed the cast time on any 5 and 10 dose potions that were inconsistent with their single dose versions. <br>General Bragmur in Iceclad should now avoid ice flows that he was having a problem crossing in the past. <br>Terrorantula Silk, Feather, branch of sylvan oak, branch of planar oak, Drachnid Silk, and Drachling Silk are now stackable. <br>Silicorrosive Grease is now tradable and stackable. <br>Potions Aquatic Haunt and Serpents Drink no longer require reagents. <br>Grandmaster Alchemist will now have a way to prove their ability. <br>Alternate Advancement<br><p>Extended Notes now works on area of Effect songs as well as group songs. <br>PvP<br><p>Fixed a bug with Root and Snare spells that prevented the target player character from being affected until they zoned. <br>Fixed a bug with mesmerization spells being unbreakable by normal means. <br>Zones<br><p>Fixed some text and grammar errors in Skyshrine. <br>Ikurenm the Sly should no longer disappear when trying to chase his enemies. <br>Repaired some "safe spots" in Echo Caverns, Paludal Caverns and Grieg's End. <br>Fixed a pathing issue in Kurn's Tower that was causing some NPCs to disappear. <br>The Golem Master in Charasis now looks like a golem. <br>The Orc Arsonist will no longer have his torch disappear when looted (as long as he had it to begin with). <br>The Sands of Fire event will now be restricted to the intended four groups. Alternate methods of getting characters into the event have been removed. <br>Corrected doors in Kaladim, Blackburrow and Erudin that opened the wrong way and one door in Kaesora that was way off its hinges. Also, the Dwarves have installed a door in one of their guard huts to prevent drafts. <br>Moved an oven in North Freeport that was poking through a ceiling. <br>Wraith of a Shissar should no longer attack its compatriots, so they should no longer be killing it in retaliation. <br>Corrected some respawn issues in the Plane of Air. <br>Rallos Zek is much less likely to need to leave the arena in order to deal with his enemies... <br>Miscellaneous<br><p>Changed "wode" to "woad" in the face picker. <br>Corrected a spelling error in the text of the Purify Body ability (affect to effect). <br>PCs under illusions should appear with hair if the race can have hair, even if the PC's race can't have hair. Fixed a few other bugs with illusions and their effect on hair and eyes. <br>Vah Shir will now see "punches" when punching instead of "hits". <br> </blockquote>

			<blockquote>LOY GUILD MANAGEMENT, FEBRUARY 4, 2003<br>Source: <a href="http://www.legacyofykesha.com/">Legacy of Ykesha Website.</a><br><p><p>The Legacy of Ykesha™ provides an improved guild management system with features that are useful to both those who manage guilds as well as regular members. Here's what the window will look like (its appearance may change). <br><p>Anyone who is in a guild may access this window to see the complete list of members of their guild. Each member's name, level, class and rank in the guild are displayed. If the character is online at the time, it will also display what zone they are in. The list of members can be sorted by Name, Level, Class, Rank and Zone. This should make keeping track of your guildmates much easier. <br><p>Click here for more details. <br> <br><p><p>AFFLICTION FOCI CHANGE, FEBRUARY 4, 2003<br>With the patch on February 4th we fixed a bug with Affliction foci, but we failed to mention it in the patch message. We corrected a bug that was allowing these foci to work for too many spell types, including things like snares and slow. Affliction foci now only work on damage over time spells. <br>We apologize for not mentioning this fix in the patch message. <br><p>The very high savings in cast time and mana, as well as the extended duration, were planned to only work on damage over time spells. These spells needed more help than all other detrimental spells. The affliction foci for haste and mana are dramatically better (more than twice as effective) than other items of the type. The extension focus is better than any other as well, though not to such a degree. These items are only so much better than others because they were intended only to improve the effect of damage over time spells to bolster their value. <br><p>We fixed a similar bug in June of 2002. Some time between then and now the bug resurfaced. The bug was fixed while another was being addressed, and because it wasn't the targeted bug fix it didn't make it into the patch message. We certainly wouldn't have left this information out on purpose. <br><p>We understand that this change has an effect on some players. But these foci have always been intended to work exclusively on DoT spells, and we do not plan to undo the bug fix. We'll look at other detrimental spells and see if there are some lines that should benefit from similar focus items, but that will be done on a case-by-case basis and not by reverting this recent bug fix. <br><p> </blockquote>

            <b>Who we are</b></p>
          <p>Bloodsong is in essence a guild dedicated to freedom from constraint attained through abandonment of fear, enhanced self-expression and the extensive use of alcohol. Members need an underlying goodness of character without feeling the need to follow a strict set of rules and regulations. This almost chaotic and anarchistic attitude makes any finite definition of Bloodsong difficult. Each of us expresses the Bloodsong attitude according to their own worldview. </p>
