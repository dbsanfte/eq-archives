      <tr>
        <td><p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've seen
        some posts from people putting Clan Spiritslammer in the
        same Uber neighborhood as the Watchers, SR and LOH. Well
        just to throw a dose of reality on all of you, here is a
        list why Clan Spiritslammer is NOT uber (all true).<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1) Planning a Severilous
        raid 9/10s of the guild had to ask what zone he was in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2) Getting a group of 6
        together for Disco in Sebelis. Upon arrival, 4 of the 6
        forgot their Seb keys at the bank. One of them forgot to
        camp his Seb key altogether.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3) At a Vox raid, our
        cleric had to heal his party from the pit while fending
        off bears and spiders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4) One of our warriors
        asked and got irate at a shaman's pet when the pet
        wouldn't answer a request for a port.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5) A group of us asked a
        Necro's pet once for a corpse summons.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6) We constantly make
        the mistake of &quot;Well SR can do it with 1 group, how
        hard can it be?!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7) One of druids has
        fallen into the same pit trap in Howling Stones 9 times.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">8 )One of our warriors,
        after receiving a 10 minute lecture about being careful
        of where you walk in Sol A, promptly took a nose dive
        into the lava 30 seconds after zoning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">9) The same warrior then
        proceeded to take 15 more lava baths in Sol A.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">10) We always forget we
        need to be in the same zone for corpse summoning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">11) The guides and GMs
        of Brell know all our names by heart because we manage to
        find every single terminal bug in any zone.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">12) Our justification
        for doing Chardok zone when we were all in our late 40s
        was &quot;Well we can always just zone out&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">13) Same for Sebelis.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">14) Same for Howling
        Stones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">15) One of our druids
        was so worried about forgetting his Howling Stones key,
        he accidently destroyed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">16) We've sold an SMR, a
        Dragoon Dirk, a Mith 2 Hander, a TBB, a Kunzar Cloak, a
        Mammoth Cloak, and an Evil Eye Bag (full at the time too)
        to various merchants all around Norrath.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">17) Our druids (all of
        them) always have to ask &quot;Which evac is it for
        EJ?&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">18 ) In Sky we killed
        eachother off for corpse summoning and revives only to
        discover that there was no one for corpse summoning and
        revives left.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">19) Our paladin (cough)
        looks like an Ewok in Kylong armor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">20) No single person in
        our guild quite knows the entire family tree... even
        after reading it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">21) We can do Fear in
        less then 3 hours, but can't get to any place in Velious
        in under 5.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">22) To this day, when
        someone says &quot;Can we pull something?&quot; 3 people
        head out in different directions to pull.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">23) Camping the AC in
        south ro, we were KSed by a 46th level solo mage (there
        were 5 of us, most all 55th levelish, grouped).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">24) When a particular
        druid of ours attempts to port us, it is truly a mystery
        if we will actually port somewhere, port to the desired
        location, or watch the druid gate there while we go no
        where.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">25) While trying to port
        to Gfay once, we ported to Hate.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">26) Most people power
        level their alts and lower level guildmembers by helping
        to kill a mob they are fighting on a consistant basis. We
        just train ours and go conveniently link dead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">27) We once petitioned
        that the Noble Dojorn in Sky dropped a Runed Totem Staff.
        We later found out that Thorondar gave the Noble Dojorn
        the staff so it would have a worse damage/delay.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">28 ) We constantly sell
        extra loot and then try to buy it back when we realize
        that we actually needed that item.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">29) We can kill
        Trakanon, however most of our members have died to green
        cons while trying to cross most of the zones in Kunark
        and Velious. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">30) One of the criteria
        for membership is &quot;What's the largest train you have
        ever pulled?&quot;. Well we want to be the best at
        something /shrug. (P.S. - Conanb still owns this record
        /rude).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">31) One of our warriors
        was killed by the same Avocet 5 times.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">32) One of our paladins
        (sniff) was killed by Dorn 7 times (each one a purposeful
        attack).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">33) One of our druids
        tried to kite Grim Feather at 20th level.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">34) One of our druids
        has said the word &quot;ow&quot; approximately 2000 times
        MORE then any other person.... ever.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">35) One of our warriors
        and one of our mages were lost in Lake Rathe for over 2
        hours trying to find the SK zone. They kept swimming
        around the zone.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">36) Our 60th level
        shaman still can't find his way through everfrost to find
        Halas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">37) A raid newbie once
        asked me &quot;What's a death touch&quot; to which Cazic
        Thule replied &quot;KRUUNCH!&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">38 ) One of our paladins
        (hurumph) once got a rez and ran off to rejoin the
        fight.....forgetting to loot his corpse.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">39) One of our paladins
        (like we have more then 1) once got rezzed and proceeded
        to continue to pull Fear.... naked.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">40) All of our clerics
        and druids have Sarnak Battle Shields but none of our
        melee do.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">41) Cartumandua
        continually takes most of our phat lewt and just oggles
        it an hour out of every day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">42) One of our clerics
        continually complains about the crappy BP he has (he has
        a Trak BP).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">43) We have one high
        level enchanter, and he is on heavy medication (he says
        it's for his back).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">44) Our bard seems to go
        LD only when playing his levitate or EB song.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">45) Our other enchanter
        goes LD anytime the word &quot;incoming&quot; is said in
        guild/group/say/ooc/shout.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">46) Ruut (our troll SK)
        joined the guild because he heard we got phat lewt alot
        and thought we were all pretty skinny compared to him.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">47) None of us day to
        day can decide what the hell faction we want in Velious,
        so we usually wind up at Karnors.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">48 ) One a few occasions
        we've told a guildmate we're camping the Hand (in
        Karnors) and they proceeded to go to Lguk.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">49) One of our Necros
        paid 2K for a purchaseable spell.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">50) One of our Necros
        spent 3 weeks researching a purchaseable spell.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">53) Our paladin (guess
        who) looks like a bowl of Lucky Charms.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">54) Our bard looks like
        a float at the Gay Pride Parade.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">55) Our ranger looks
        like a newbie twinked with epics.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">56) Our other enchanter
        looks like someone crapped on his head.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">57) Our 60th level
        shaman appears to be now in full banded!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">58) Our monk wears a
        @#%$ brown dress, a jar jar binks hat and humps legs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">59) One of our clerics
        looks like she has a pickle stuck up her ass (but then
        again, all high elf women look like they got a pickle up
        their ass).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">60) Our Pally STILL
        hasn't figured out emoticons.</font></p>
