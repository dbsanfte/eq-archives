            <b>Who we are</b></p>
          <p>Bloodsong is in essence a guild dedicated to freedom from constraint attained through abandonment of fear, enhanced self-expression and the extensive use of alcohol. Members need an underlying goodness of character without feeling the need to follow a strict set of rules and regulations. This almost chaotic and anarchistic attitude makes any finite definition of Bloodsong difficult. Each of us expresses the Bloodsong attitude according to their own worldview. </p>
