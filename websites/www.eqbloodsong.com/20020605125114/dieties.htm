        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sorebottom O'Boredom, <br>
        god of camping. Sorebottom is a dull and lazy god who
        requires the same devotion from his followers. They
        worship him by sitting on their arses for hours or even
        days at a time at his various holy places like Highhold
        Pass, Temple of Cazic Thule, Najena, and Guk. His
        followers pay homage to him by auctioning off their goods
        to the highest bidder. Their prayer chants include
        'Selling/trading rubicite for a good wizard item', 'Get
        in line', and 'You kill-stealing bastard, I've camped
        this spot for 3 days straight'. Sorebottom and his
        followers are the arch enemy of 'Wizfire' <br>
        <br>
        Wizfire, <br>
        god of kill-stealing. Wizfire is an evil, selfish deity.
        He is primarily worshipped by wizards, but some druids
        and mages worship him also. Wizfire requires vast number
        of sacrifices to sate his hunger for blood, so his
        followers travel the lands killing everything in sight.
        He is the arch enemy of Sorebottom, with whom he shares a
        parasitic relationship. Both are worshipped in many of
        the same places, but Wizfire and his followers live off
        the same prey. Wizfire and his followers are hated
        throughout the land. <br>
        <br>
        Nurph, <br>
        god of class balancing. Nurph is a very feared god, more
        appeased than worshipped. He is like a plague, feared by
        all players, who live in fear that his chilling hand is
        not placed on their class' head. Nurph requires
        sacrifices, which he gets primarily from druids, shamans,
        and necromancers in the form of spells and abilities. He
        has no worshippers or holy places, although his avatar,
        Arudune is sometimes seen stalking the land, looking for
        good spells or successful strategies to feed to his
        ravenous master. <br>
        <br>
        Playorun Economie, <br>
        god of trade skills. Playorun is a greedy god who takes
        his due from every successful trade skill in the form of
        profits. No skill is safe from his grasping hands, as he
        leeches the bank accounts of any foolish enough to try
        them. He is also worshipped by the many merchants in the
        land who buy items for but a fraction of their worth and
        sell them for hundreds of times their value. Whenever an
        enterprising mortal tries to outwit Playorun, by making
        money from a skill, he calls upon his brother, the god
        Nurph to smite the offender and any who would follow him.
        <br>
        <br>
        Powyrgamyr, <br>
        god of levelling. Powyrgamyr is crazed god, worshipped by
        hordes of raving, lunatics. These madmen roam the land
        killing everything in sight, never stopping, never
        sleeping, until they eventually drop dead from
        exhaustion. They are like a plague of locusts, destroying
        everything in their path in their mad quest to appease
        their god. Once a mortal gives his soul to Powyrgamyr, he
        breaks off all relationships, leaving friends and family
        behind, as they embark on their holy quests for
        experience, fame and wealth. Those that survive the
        quest, usually turn from Powyrgamyr and become
        worshippers of Twynker. <br>
        <br>
        Twynker, <br>
        god of newbies. Twynker is a kind god, worshipped by many
        newbies. The basic philosophy of the worship of Twynker
        is reincarnation. His followers believe that if they live
        a good and productive life, amassing wealth and items,
        they will be reborn into newbies, and be allowed to live
        off the gains of their previous life. As such, the
        followers of Twynker are viewed with jealousy and hatred
        by other mortals. They must endure much hatred and
        insults, but the consolation that they have better stuff
        than anyone else helps them cope. You can see Twynker's
        followers wherever there is a gathering of newbies. They
        are the ones killing rats, bats and fire beetles while
        dressed in full rubicite armor. <br>
        <br>
        Roel Playor, <br>
        god of perpetual low levels. Roel Playor is a benevolent
        god, worshipped by mortals through out the land of
        Norrath. They are well known for their verbose language
        and strange way of speaking. Most of them are kind,
        gentle beings who only want to live their lives in peace
        and harmony with the land and its inhabitants. However,
        their religion has recently been infiltrated by the
        followers of Wizfire. They are usually dark elves,
        trolls, and ogres who hide behind the teaching of Roel
        Playor, as an excuse to appease their god, Wizfire. These
        heretics are also known as azhoels. <br>
