	Well, it had to happen.<br /><br />The guilds <a href="http://www.waster.net/wudan/">Wudan</a>, <a href="http://www.mimrz.com/">Magus Imperialis Magicus</a>, and <a href="http://www.ascendingdawn.com/cgi-bin/index.pl">Ascending Dawn</a> over on Rallos Zek not only woke the sleeper but decided to go ahead and kill him.<br /><br />It took about 3 hours and 170 people to do it- but they managed to do what until now was considered to be impossible.  And, the loots- <strong>NOTHING</strong>!!!  Apparently Sony didn't think that anyone would ever actually kill the Sleeper.<br /><br /><br>
