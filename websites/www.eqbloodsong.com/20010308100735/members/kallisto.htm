<tr><td><font size="4" color=#00ff00>Kalli's Theory:<td><font size="4">I have this theory that if we're told we're bad than that's the only idea we'll ever have. Anyone can start a conflict, it's harder yet to disregard it.  I'd rather see the world from another angle.  We are everyday angels.  Be careful with me 'cause I'd like to stay that way.

<p><font size="4"><font color=#00ff00>Description: </font>Kallisto is more of a lover than a fighter.  Her friends are very important 
to her. Her one brother Manwen of the Crystalline Knights is the best thing since red wine to her. Her fiance Bladecurser Mooseslayer puts the twinkle in her eyes.  She may flirt to a fault, and be especially keen on naked barbarians, but her heart will always belong to Blade.

But don't let her cuteness fool you.  This little druid knows exactly what she wants.  Woe to the one who stands in her way.  And who would really want to with a big brother like Manwen looking after his little sister and Bladecurser the famous slayer of moose always at her side?
