    <p align="left"><font size="4">Bloodsong is having a picture contest. All
    members of Bloodsong before February 1st may participate. The contest starts
    now and runs through the month of February. There
    will be three categories. Humor, Scenic and the Heat of battle.</font> <font size="4">There will be one grand prize and two first place prizes.
    After the grand prize is chosen, one first place prize will be awarded from
    each of the remaining categories. Each <u> member may enter in three pictures</u> to
    any of the three categories.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
    The grand prize will be at least 1000 Platinum. The prize pool may increase
    with time from donation of other members of the guild.&nbsp; The two first
    place prizes will be 500 platinum each. In addition, all three prize winners
    will receive 2 tailor made, 10 slot, backpacks.&nbsp;</font></p>







    <p align="left"><font size="4">The pictures can be 640x480, 800x600, or
    1024x768.&nbsp; If you know how, please convert the pictures from BMP format
    to JPG. Email your pictures as an attachment to <a href="mailto:contest@eqbloodsong.com"><font color="#00FF00">contest@eqbloodsong.com</font></a>.
    Include your characters name and what category you would like your picture
    entered.</font></p>







    <p align="left"><font size="4">If you have any other questions send them to <a href="mailto:celi@micron.net">celi@micron.net</a>.
    </font></p>







    <p align="left"><font size="4">You can take a picture, or screenshot, by
    pressing the minus &quot;-&quot; key that is located on the right side of
    your keyboard. This is the one by the 10 numeric keys. By switching the
    screen mode so the picture is across the whole screen will work the best
    (F10 or F11 I think). Look at some of the pictures on our website site for
    examples. The pictures are
    stored in the same directory as the Everquest executables are. Like in C:
    Program Files EverQuest or <a href="file:///C:/Program">C:\Program</a>
    Files\EverQuest. They will be called something like EQ000001.BMP. Each
    picture you take will get the next number. You can usually look at these
    pictures in your web browser or other picture viewer by double-clicking on
    the picture file icon or dragging the file icon over and dropping it on the
    web browser window. You can send pictures as attachments by dragging the
    file icon onto the mail text window of your E-mail and dropping it. Another
    method, that should work for everyone is to right click on the picture icon
    and select the &quot;Sent <u>T</u>o&quot; from the menu that appears. The
    contest runs to the end of February so we all get a chance to stumble across
    some great pictures during our adventures. Please don't send me three
    pictures and ask me to remove one so you can add another. Good Luck!!</font></p>
