Earlier today someone broke into the Tholuxe server message board and hosted some pictures on this site that were used to deface the <a href = http://www.tholuxe.com/>Tholuxe Forums</a>.<br><br>

I will not stand for this, so I have disabled all of the scripts that allow members to publish text or pictures and will be shutting things down over the next week. I have backed up all of the existing documents and am in the process of deleting everything on the server and closing down the account.<br><br>

From what I can tell this was neither a clever nor a bold accomplishment on the part of the 'hacker'. They simply used their MK login to upload a picture to this server and guessed the password for the admin account on the Tholuxe site.<br><br>

If there are any former MK members that are interested in putting the guild or the site back together again please get in touch with me and I'll be happy to send over everything I have. Since I left the MK guild there have been a few members on a few occasions that have asked about rebuilding the guild. I'll be happy to help out in any way I can, but leadership was turned over to a former member almost 8 months ago... and they have not been seen since.<br><br>

To all of the great friends that I have made over the past few years who are still playing EQ, I want to thank you for the good times we had, and I wish you the best. The old <a href = http://pub92.ezboard.com/bmistyknightguild>MK forums</a> are still active and I will be stopping in over the next few days to talk, exchange contact information, and say my good byes.<br><br>
