                        Most of you know that you can determine your coordinates in a zone by using the /loc command. Most of you have it Hot Buttoned. However, I continually run into people that do not know how to travel using loc. Just like using Lat/long in RL, loc'ing is much more accurate and can bring you right to a designated spot in a zone.<br><br>Let's familiarize with the mapping system for EQ.<br><br>Zones are divided for purposes of location into 3 axes: X (vertical), Y (horizontal) and Z (up and down or elevation). Picture a zone map you have down loaded from eqmaps.com and place it on a flat table. This is how the zone is set up. It is not like a map hung on a wall, it is placed on a flat surface. If you place the map in front of you with the name of the map at the top of the page, you have it oriented correctly. The "Y" axis are the numbers across the top of the map going left and right from center. The "X" axis are the numbers running up and down the side of the map from center and the "Z" axis numbers (normally not shown on maps) would be the numbers starting at (0,0) and actually extending up out of the map page as if they were posted on something you set on the map that stuck up. "Z" numbers are elevation (2450, 1200, 800). "800" is the Z number.<br><br>When reading a zone map, all of them have a (0,0) point and then numbers read along the side of the page up or down from the "0" line. Those are the "X" axis numbers. It is the first number you see in a /loc coordinate: (2450, 1200). "2450" is the X number. The "X" numbers run North and South of the center line on the map.<br><br>"Y" numbers run East and West from the center line on the map. (2450, 1200) "1200" is the "Y" number.<br><br>"Z" numbers are elevation from the zone's "sea level" if you will. "Sea level" is a specific elevation on the map. For our example, the surface of the table your map is lying on is the zone's "sea level". Anything above or below it is a "Z" number. E.G. (2450, 1200, 400). "400" means I am on a hill or somewhere in the zone elevated above the zone's "sea level". (2450, 1200, -200) means I am below the "sea level" of the zone. Perhaps in a dungeon, or swimming under the water.<br><br>Bonus Tip: All zones contain a safespot. That is a spot where no mobs roam or spawn that you are safe while standing on it. If something weird happens to you, often times you go to the zone's safespot. That is usually (0,0) in almost all zones.<br><br>Ok, I have edited this post 5x now. I have recently noticed that the negative numbers for the X or Y axis in zones can run either way from center line. Some zones have the positive X numbers running North (or up) from the center line and some have them running South (or down) from center line with their opposites running the other way. When you print out a map from eqmaps.com be sure to look at this if you want to figure out what direction you are travelling. Otherwise, it does not matter much because loc'ing is simple manipulation of coordinates using your left and right cursor keys as your move.<br><br><br>Let's loc!<br><br>Now you say, "Necrro, all of that is soo interesting, NOT! How do I loc?<br><br>Having made your /loc hot Button go somewhere familiar to you and pick a spot. Record that loc. Now start walking while continually hitting your /loc hot button (not running until you get used to it). Notice how the X and Y numbers change (we will not talk Z axis numbers because that is almost never needed). The X and Y started at (2450, 1200). Now stop. What are your numbers? X was going down and now is 2300 and Y is 1000 (2300,1000).<br><br>(2300,1000) means you have gotten closer to the center line on the map for the X and Y axis numbers. Plot that on your map (just for the exercise not during the game). You have actually walked in a South Westerly direction in the zone.<br><br>"Necrro? WTF? how you know that?"<br><br>Remember that on your map I started at 2450 for X. That means I am 2450 units of EQ measurement (don't know the name of their measurements and it does not matter) North (or up) from the center line of the map vertically. X numbers only go in two directions from center, North or South (numbers along the side of the map running vertically). I was at a positive X number 2450. So to decrease this number I must move South or down on the X axis (the numbers on the side of the map) to 2300.<br><br>Y started as 1200. Y runs East or West of center. To decrease that number I moved West (or left)(numbers along the top of the map horizontally) 200 EQ units. Since most people do not move exactly north or south or east or west, we combine those numbers to represent your diagonal zone movement or in this case a southwesterly track.<br><br>Loc'ing does not involve figuring out any of this stuff, I want you to know it because if your sense heading sux you can use it to track your direction just like you can use the direction of the clouds in EQ zones that always travel E-W or the point of a dropped weapon that always points North when dropped on the ground.<br><br>If you continue walking you can use very small left or right arrow cursor movements or the mouse (not as accurate for loc'ing) to change how fast the numbers of X or Y change. Once you get used to manipulating those numbers. You can run to any loc in the zone. That is why peeps shout for the loc to Misty or the PoD lift in Great Fay or the Kurns Tower in FoB. They take that number and loc to it by running and hitting their loc button over and over.<br><br>Loc'ing is much easier to do than to explain. Practice it and it will speed your travels. Sometimes even track is not helpful (Tim Deep eh Toddan!) Loc will always work, even if you are completely blind and cant see where you are going).<br><br>While I don't recommend this as it will take a lot of time with all the new zones, way way back long long ago Pre-Kunark, I took my Wizard out at 16 when I got invis, to see the world. I made a full notebook of locs for all the interesting things I saw in each zone in Old World Norrath from Faydark to Odus. I learned to loc like a pro and to have exact locs of things I wanted to see. You dont need to do this, but some exploration and practice is helpful.<br><br>
