More than 600,000 lives were lost between the two warring sides. Of those deaths, nearly 10 percent happened within the prisoner of war camps. <br>
<br>
One camp run by the southern Confederate states was Camp Sumpter, located near Andersonville, Georgia opened in March 1864. It was designed to hold about 10,000 prisoners on its' 16 acre site and was surrounded by a 17 foot high stockade fence. The grounds were situated in a shallow valley between two hills in which a small stream flowed through. This stream provided the only drinking water for the entire prison population. Over time the stream became clogged with rocks and debris as the camp was expanded and turned about 5 acres into uninhabitable murky marshland. At times the men had to trudge through mud waist high to reach the small amounts of fresh water that still flowed through. <br>
<br>
Eventually, however, even that one small source of fresh water became putrid and undrinkable from human waste and laundering dirty clothes in it. The surface became coated in a greasy slick of rancid cooking oil form the cookhouse upstream. In June nerarly 60 percent of the recorded deaths at the camp were listed as dehydration-either naturally occuring or from the severe diarrhea brought on from drinking the contaminated water. Many prisoners dug small wells of their own, but they dried up quickly or were over-run with contamination.<br>
<br>
On July 1, 10 additional acres were opened up. A number of prisoners were killed in the rush to occupy the new area. The new space didn't last very long though, as new prisoners were being brought in at the rate of 500-1000 a day by mid-July. The death rate slowly increased over the summer from 1 in 26 on May 1 to 1 in 10 when the prison reached its' peak capacity of 32,000 in mid-August. That equals out to about one person per 25 square feet! Despite the exploding prison population, nothing whatsoever was done about the rancid water and horrible living conditions within the stockade. The prisoners begged for fresh water; however even though the commander running the camp was truly sympathetic to the plight of the prisoners, there was simply nothing he could do to help. <br>
<br>
The prisoners began daily prayer vigils and services, twice a day asking for divine intervention in their water crisis, offering fervent prayers for fresh water and relief from the horrible conditions they were suffering in. Although there are no recorded temperature readings from the area at the time, current average high temperatures for Andersonville run around 93 F for early August. <br>
<br>
On August 9, 1864, a severe thunderstorm bore down on the camp. For most of the day the torrential downpour pelted the prisoners who had no shelter to hide from the storm, as nearly all the trees had been cut down. A number of lightning bolts were recorded to have struck in and around the camp, killing even more prisoners. One bolt in particular struck the stump of a pine tree just outside the prison wall. Some time overnight, a small earthen dam outside the prison walls burst, sending a wall of water rushing through the camp.<br>
<br>
When the prisoners woke the next morning, they were overjoyed to discover that the putrid marshland had been flooded out and all the filth and vermin in it had been washed away! But a more important discovery was soon spotted. At the base of the pine stump that had been struck by the lightning bolt at the peak of the storm, a fresh water spring now gurgled up from the ground! Although it was just outside the prison walls, the captives used tree branches to reach out to it and carve a channel to direct the flow into the camp. At last they had fresh water! To all, it seemed as if their prayers had been answered!<br>
<br>
Through the end August and into September, the Union forces made significant headway into Confederate territory and many of the prisoners were re-located after the burning of Atlanta in September, but the camp remained active through the end of the war. By the time the prison finally closed, a total of 13,000 men lost their lives within its' walls, making it the deadliest camp of the conflict. <br>
<br>
But the legend of the miracle spring lived on. In fact in 1897, a group of camp survivors held a reunion at the site of the spring to once again drink for the waters of what is now called Providence Spring. Some local skeptics claim there was already a spring in the area and that it was probably just covered up in the building of the stockade; but there is no denying the dramatic fashion in which it reappeared if that is indeed the case. The sudden appearance of the spring was witnessed by thousands of prisoners.<br>
<br>
So, what do you think? Was this a case of divine intervention or merely the coincidental uncovering of a lost and forgotten pre-existing spring?<br>
<br>
Let the debate begin... <br>
