(LONG)</span><hr size=1> Hi! Again, the tempermental, high-strung leader, is talkin.... <br>
<br>
Ya know.. bein leader of a guild is rough sometimes. Mix in RL things and wow, ya get a lot of 'stressors'. Well, last nite, I was feelin rather *shitty*. I ended up talkin to a dear friend (from when I was lvl 7) and guildmate. He and I talked until near dawn. Had some great conversations and relaxed a bit.<br>
<br>
I finally went to bed only to have this same friend wake me 4 hours later with a cell-phone text message. I yawned, stretched, and headed in game to see what was up.<br>
<br>
It was decided that we were both gonna go /roleplay and hide. Go do somethin FUN. Remember the PAST and the more fun times of EQ.<br>
<br>
So, we set off. We went to Nk and started headin to WK. WK is one of the first places we ever met. We were playin with Jack-O-Lanterns. We decided to quest the Lanseux of the Wolves just CAUSE. Y'all remember when that weapon was THE thing to have? Before Kunark? We started the quest for the Lanseux but got a bug up our butts to hit the barbarian with a spell and take off runnin.<br>
<br>
Remember the days when everything could kill you and an accidental spell cast would mean death? Well, it was GREAT runnin from a NPC that couldn't TOUCH us!<br>
<br>
We stopped at the Brother Quinn(?) tree and proceeded to slaughter the poor guy there. DOH! Faction HIT! But? Who cares!<br>
<br>
We headed off to North Qeynos and buffed all the newbies in the area. Great things, Donal's, free mana buffs and newbies think we are givin them the greatest gift!<br>
<br>
From there, we went and played in Qeynos hills. Killed the necro near the lake where Haddin(?) spawns. We got 4 fresh fish, 4 fish scales, a fishing pole and 2 pots of bait. So, we stayed there and fished till it was gone. Spilled our beer a few times, too.<br>
<br>
We then set off to Black Burrows. Remember the gnolls? Where we first realized what the word TRAIN meant?  He killed a few with his 'uber' warrior weapons and I cast a few 600+ dmg AoEs for the hell of it. Buffed a few of the peeps in BB with those wonderful Donals and set off for Everfrost.<br>
<br>
Lord! Do ya remember the first time in that zone? How BIG and confusing it was? We went to Perma Frost with the intention of killin just a few IGs and gaining his epic piece. Course, I was for SURE I was gonna die... <br>
<br>
We killed a few IGs... and then it was time for the Priest and last IG. Damn Patriarch kept healin the Priest and ran me oom healin my warrior friend... so I camped out and the warrior died.<br>
<br>
I came back, rezzed warrior, and we set up to try again. While gettin ready, I scanned the zone. Saw 2 Mythic Legion members in zone. I hailed one and told them that we needed just a weeeee bit of assistance killin the Priest. The Mythic member said sure and brought his friend with him.<br>
<br>
We took out the Priest and the other IG with no problems. Was great. Well... as warriors are prone to do... my friend got cocky. He walked into the back and accidentally pulled 2 IGs and a spidee down on top of the 4 of us.<br>
<br>
My friend, the 2 Mythic, and myself fought valiantly. Tried very hard. My warrior friend died so I told Mythic to get the *hell* out. They evaced and I proceed to get my butt stomped into the ground.  A few mins later, one of the Mythic hails us and said to consent him. Embarrased as I was, I didn't wanna consent him.. but finally I did.<br>
<br>
I finally got all the way back there and rezzed my warrior friend and myself. We thanked the 2 Mythic members and they went on their way. My warrior friend and I chuckled a lil bit and then decided to log for a break before tonite's planned raid.<br>
<br>
Basically, it was a day of FUN and relaxation. Time for remembering what it was that made this girl an addict to EverQuest.<br>
<br>
What did we gain from today? Well, here's a list...<br>
<br>
5pp<br>
35g<br>
67s<br>
127c<br>
2 permafrost crystals<br>
1 bloodstone<br>
1 vial of Human Blood (a_farmer_00 in Wk died cause he looked at me funny)<br>
1 Bronze Mask<br>
1 Symbol of Loyalty to Vox<br>
1 rune of Rallos Zek<br>
1 Zaharn's Coronet<br>
4 fresh fish<br>
4 fish scales<br>
1 fishing pole<br>
2 pots of fishing bait<br>
<br>
Oh, and the warrior took 2 lvl 49 rezzes, I took 1. So, we lost some exp today. But was it worth it? Hell YES. Would I do it again? HELL YES.<br>
<br>
Think about this hellofalong post and take a step back... try to remember the stupid things ya did as n00b and see if ya can find that love for EQ all o'er again. I did and I feel much better for it.<br>
