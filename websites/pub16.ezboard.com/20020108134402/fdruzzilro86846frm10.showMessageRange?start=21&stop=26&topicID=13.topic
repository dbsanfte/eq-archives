Do you know anything about any faith, such as catholicism even?<br>
<br>
Islam does NOT preach killing people as part of it's religious foundation, btw.<br>
<br>
Oh, and 3 of the major belief systems in the world are all tightly intertwined... islam, christianity and judaism.  Jews and Islams (so it goes) were the original children of God, with Jews being the descendants of one brother in the family tree and Islam being the descendants of the other brother of the family tree.  Then, Christians grew out of the jews because of the acceptance and belief in the jewish messiah (Christ) who the jews do not acknowledge as anything more than a gifted Rabbi (teacher).  The original christians are the catholics.<br>
<br>
After that, you have the eastern orthodox (which are basically catholics with a different pope, and then an explosion of other christian sects who either have different interpretions of events or passages, or rebelled against the papacy (which heavily abused it's powers in the past and drove many people away causing the splinter groups).<br>
<br>
Now, NONE of the major religions (eastern or western) have &quot;kill thy neighbor&quot; as a fundamental tenant.  You are confusing the message and the messenger.  Saying that islam teaches intolerance and murder because some of the radical fundamentalist leaders preach messages of hate is like saying that christianity teaches us to kill people because of the inquisition, or the crusades.  Go buy a book and study some before you paint anyone with such sweeping condemnation, because right now you're talking out of your hat.  You are mixing up the POLITICAL leaders of these countries and their own political agendas with the underlying core beliefs of an entire faith system.  Remember, in these countries religion and politics are tightly bound in one another, and religion is quite often used as justification to further some political agenda.<br>
<br>
Oh, and just in case it matters, I'm catholic... and a practicing catholic at that.  My best friend is buddhist, and several of my coworkers are Islamic (and TERRIFIED that they'll be persecuted because of the shortsightedness of people such as yourself).<br>

The United States and much of Europe are called &quot;Christian nations&quot; whether that is a true representation or not.  Regardless of religious demographics, the generations alive today are not those responsible for the atrocities of the past.  The same can be said about Islamic nations for the most part as well, but in some societies, it is easy to play the &quot;religion card&quot; to incite violence among otherwise peaceful people.  America is called the Great Satan in some places, but is that really because the people of other nations really thing we are evil?  No, it's because a select few (politicians, terrorist supporters, etc.) KNOW that religion is very serious to their people.  <br>
<br>
For a populace who adhere to a very strict religion, tightly knit with politics in their society, having a leader tell you that the Christians and Jews are responsible for your nation's hardships might be all it takes.  The terrorists responsible for the attacks might be condemned by their leaders on TV, but they are actually martyrs, proclaimed heroes for killing thousands of civilians.  I'd bet that a lot of the people who stage such attacks often have no idea what it is that the conflict is about, but they see an opportunity to be immortalized as heroes who went to war with the Great Satan.<br>

So I do have some knowledge of different religons.<br>
     Secondly I did not claim that religions preached the killing of others, what I am trying to say is that alot of violence has been attributed to the religious ferver of some people.  I DO NOT condemn people for having faith in any religion.<br>
     Yes I agree that alot of good has come from religious sects but let me ask you this does all the atrocities that has happened due to religions outweigh the good? <p>Gain An'Sydnor <br>

<br>
Can this question truly be answered?  You're dealing with relative terms here, and asking for a direct answer implies that words such as &quot;good&quot; and &quot;atrocities&quot; mean the same thing to everyone.  <br>
<br>
I believe that only the individual can answer that question.  To even attempt to answer it on a grand scale is rife with conention, disagreement &amp; discussion.  Many have tried, none have succeeded, for if we were to answer this question, would we not have found the single religion that would be the perfect &quot;fit&quot; for everyone? <br>

This information was gathered during a cell phone call home from one of the passengers. The person at home conferenced in a 911 operator and part of the call was recorded.<br>
<br>
What happened (according to the news) was this...During phone calls home the passengers of this 4th plane found out that the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon had been hit by planes. They knew then that their plane would be the next to go down and that they would die. The passengers devised a plan and then they took a vote. The vote passed and they decided to act. This is why the plane went down where it did in an unpopulated area rather than at its supposed target...The White House.<br>
<br>
Very heroic of them to give their lives to save others. There is no greater sacrifice and no greater act of heroism than that.<br>
