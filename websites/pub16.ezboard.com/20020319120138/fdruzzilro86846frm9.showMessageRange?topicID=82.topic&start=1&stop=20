I had no idea why, so I went to my good RL friend in Vindi and asked for an Explanation. Here is exactly what I was told:<br><br>When we want a mob thats up, we just go in and kill it. We don't care about the other guilds planning raids for weeks. We kill it if its up if someone doesn't get it before us.<br><br>THAT is why I left Druzzil Ro in the first place for Sullon Zek. I have ALWAYS though the waiting lists to get a mob or go to a plane was BULLCRAP! I had always dealth with it because I wanted to stay with my friends. Now, that Vindi has &quot;pushed the evenolope&quot; with ignoring everyones raids they've had planned for weeks do you think more guilds will take suit with the &quot;kill it if its up&quot; attitude?<br><br>I'm personally hoping the answer is yes. This stupid crap of waiting for weeks to even months on some spawns is STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID! WTF can't we just go kill Uber_Named_Mob_103874722 if it is up? Because some people get upset that they can't possibly organize a raid without 2 years notice?? I THINK ITS ALL BULL CRAP!<br><br>Vindi has finally gotten the right idea on how mobs spawns should be handled throughout ALL of EQ. FCFS! In all seriousness who really wants to sit for WEEKS behind other guilds waiting for one monster? <br><br>I don't know if anyone else agrees with my views, but I think what Vindi is doing to Druzzil Ro is just what the server needed. Enough with the pansies that think waiting inline for months is a good thing. Those guilds that can take the iniaitive to get the Uber_Mob_001 when it pops should have it!

At 60 you &quot;EXPECT&quot; the world to drop to their knees in front of you and worship you.

If the 24 hours was an issue, then why wasnt any effort made to reduce the ammount of time waiting for a guild to complete their rotation?

Its more. On Sullon with the regualr player base of 700 people,I can't go 1-2 days of doing nothing in the endgame. The Evil team has an IGB of sorts. If the guild that wants the mob tells ALL the others that they want it and will take it down shortly they USUALLY get it and this is ALWAYS done INGAME Sometimes though the more uber guilds would go take down uber_mob_02 just because they wanted it. Not to smite some_piddly_guild_01. I'd have to be crazy to sit around and wait for some_piddly_guild_01 to not only plan the raid (2 days usually for most guilds), then to get everyone there at the same time (usually a day after planning), then on that 3rd day the guild is finally ready to take them down. <br><br>I know the above scenario is for emergency resets and the planned patches make it a bit easier, but even planned pathces screw up the raid tables. FFA is not only easier, but better in the long run. <br><br>Why shouldn't the first ones there be allowed to kill the mob?! It doesn't make sense that IF Some_piddly_guild_01 can actually get there before some_uber_guild_02 that the the piddly guild shouldn't be allowed to kill the mob because uber guild has it planned to kill. Or visa versa. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulavidicus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lavidicus</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/24/02 2:51:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=82.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.njcrew.com/logos/lavi.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication's Play Style</span><hr size=1> My bad on the refference to the number of Ubers on each server I hadn't seen the thread on Graffe.  I only saw one on another board dont remember the link and for the most part some servers had at most 2 or 3 and some even 1.  Anyways I still dont think its right that &quot;piddly_guild_1&quot; should not get time to set up for a raid.  Remember when your guild was less then Uber you prob did the same granted I can and will never try to prove that.  Why cant the smaller guild have a few days to prep BEFORE the mob spawns to figure out a game plan.  Some people take for granted that the Uber guilds here know how to kill almost every mob in the game already and that these other guilds have never had a chance at even attacking it.  Thats why I like the IGB it assured them their chance.  If they failed someone else came in and killed the mob after their few attempts.  if everyone knew the strats on everymob and DRo was closed to new players then sure FFA would be an interesting environment.  IGB just lets everyone get their shot.  Who is anyone to take that away from someone.  Its just not right.  I mean it should be limited like no lvl 5 through 20 guild should try to reserve NToV that would be silly.  All I am saying is think of the newer players and take them into consideration when thinking about the IGB it is giving them the right to see and experience everything they are paying $10 a month to see just like you.  As for putting their &quot;time&quot; in like I see on some threads if they are anywhere from 55 to 60 then I think they put in their time already. <p> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20012">Lavidicus' Gear</a><br><c><img src=http://www.njcrew.com/logos/lavid2.gif></c><br><i>"There is no teacher but the enemy.

Sometimes they'd get it, sometimes they wouldn't. Oddly enough even though Evils on Sullon outnumber Newts 2-1 and goods 5-1 Evils are by far the most cooperative and cohesive of the three alignments.<br><br>and I know vinidi wants the FFA in effect. Has anyone actually bothered to ask them if they could kill uber_mob_01? I'm thinking no. I'm thinking you all went to Vinidi and whined and moaned about the IGB, but never actually asked them to let you take Uber_mob_01.<br><br>right now on Dro I'm a midbie Won't be seeing endgame encounters for a while yet, and I'll have to find some_piddly_guild_01 (No offense to the less than uber guilds meant)to join to do these endgame encounters with because Vinidi and other Uber guilds wouldn't let me in right away so I know that sayingall this might bite me in the behind some day.<br><br>However, I truly think that IF someone can get there first with an adequate force to drop uber_mob_01 they deserve to do so.<br><br>I Personally feel that if I was in Uber_Guild, that if someone asked me to do Uber_mob_01 and I didn't already have a force moving in to kill it. I wouldn't mind if they did it.<br><br>On Sullon I can say we've had guilds ask to do some of the hard mobs and just said &quot;If you can get there first&quot; and left it at that. Other times we just say, &quot;Sure we can wait for the next one.'<br><br>Boards should NOT be required to play EQ.
