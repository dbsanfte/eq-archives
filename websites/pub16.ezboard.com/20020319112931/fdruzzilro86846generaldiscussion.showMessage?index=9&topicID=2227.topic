Lets make an everquest example.<br>

<br>
Decent guilds A, B, C, and D are all in line for Ubermob A.<br>
<br>
Uberguild A kills ubermob A, decent guilds a,b,c,d<br>
are like oh...well we'll get him next time.<br>

Next time mob is up uberguild A is at them again, because they happen to be better organized, higher level, etc.<br>

<br>
What dro has is a reservation system. Vindi and Hoss (maybe) never checked here, the other top tier guilds do.<br>
<br>
The breakdown is not bad. The guilds using dro reservations aren't after the mobs that were on the IGB, and for the most part, the former IGB guilds arent after whats posted here.<br>
<br>
So lets just move along and plug away at it. Some recent events happened that are a bummer, but if NTOV or Dain or someone is spawned, you can bet at least some of the top guilds arent racing into kael arena to mess up someone's plans on this site.<br>

1.) What occurs on the IGB has nothing to do with this board, or the reservations it holds(with the light exception of CT/Fear).  IGB guilds don't/won't be looking at this board in any different way then they ever have before (whether that's ignoring it for some guilds, posting intentions for some guilds, or just reading and not posting for others).  The &quot;uber&quot; guilds, the former existance of an IGB, and the way things are done forthcomming from those guilds, should have so minimal bearing on the descisions of the smaller guilds it's not even a real topic.<br>
2.) Smaller/Medium (whatever adjective won't offend) guilds are in some cases making excuses regarding their lack of willingness to participate in the rotations here, and using the former IGB, Vindication, Hoss, blah blah blah for reasons to now ignore this board, when quite honestly it has no relevance.<br>
<br>
I agree totally with Epiph, if you're in a &quot;uber&quot; guild, don't fuck with the (insert proper non-uber adjective here) guilds, check out what they're doing, and back off if it's something they're planning and you would interfere with.   If you're in a &quot;adjective&quot; guild, either follow the rotation, or have the balls to say you don't want to share, I personally wouldn't blame anyone for either, I just think pointing the finger to reap rewards is gay.<br>

Saying the server is FFA basically means that its First come, first serve right now. If your to slow you don't get the prize. Thats how it is in the Real world and thats how it is on a lot of servers.<br>
<br>
For the meantime thats just kinda how some guilds are going to use the FFA tactic. If not enough are going to validate the rotations/reservations then your gonna be SOL. GM's don't care about Reservations or Rotations, all they care about is who was there first? I know its a crappy thing, but its reality brought into the game that at one time we all coveted as fantasy. /shrug thats just how I see it. I myself am not a fan of FFA, but I do know what FFA is, and yes thats what its looking like this server is drifting towards if the IGB doesn't go back into place. <p>[60 Hierophant] Spense (Half Elf)

I could say the same thing about all the people screaming for the IGB. They use that as a cop out for easy loot. Druzzil Ro is FFA. I know, the truth hurts.Deny it all you want. Guilds are not going to respect any reservations on this board. Well, if your killing in maybe hate plane where nobody gives a crap, sure...reserve all you want hahaha. The irony and hypocricy is so thick you couldn't stir it with a hammer.<br>
<br>
I think it's funny I'm hearing the same arguments by L'Malla that everyone jumped all over Vindication for. I see the same attitude when it is they who are the ones stepping on toes. &quot;gotta learn to play with the big boys&quot; <br>
I seem to remember L'Malla becoming 'Big Boys&quot; thanks to the IGB they seem to have forgotten about. I see the same &quot;leapfrogging&quot; arguments leveled against them and see the exact same excuses as they blasted Vindication for. So...tell me, are you just misunderstood? You claim to want IGB but your treating the loot nipple craving &quot;little people&quot; as if they were n00bs in EC. I never thought I'd see elitistism coming from your ranks as rife and stanky as I do now. I hate being right, I really do. You came here screaming about NTOV leapfrogging, then you make a co-op effort to thwart mobs from Vindication and now your screwing struggling guilds in Fear. What the sad thing is, is that Vindication did what they did saying they were pro FFA. L'Malla is doing it and saying they are pro-IGB. Does anyone else smell the bullshit here?<br>

Ever hear of adapting and having to do whatever you can to survive? Thats kinda what that whole ordeal forced us to do. The point your failing to grasp here is that we as a guild &quot;L`Malla&quot; want the IGB back. But in the meantime with no one respecting it we are doing our best to survive in this FFA world.

I can probably make a comment on everything else in that entry, but my memory power is not as staying as others is.<br>
<br>
I just want to add a tidbit about this little peice though.<br>
<br>
everyone knows i wont bullcrap you or anyone else around. if it comes from my mouth, you better beilive i mean it. ( besides when i being a total `tard and making ubergoober items up =) ... )<br>
<br>
But as far as this goes....the way i take it ....and way i am looking at it...You are saying....Dont be like everyone else. If they want to step on your head to steal mobs, dont follow in thier footsteps....sorry hun, your a sweety, but i  have to say FUCK THAT. If some people are going to leapfrog over my guilds head. or my hightly raid party's head. and were supposed to let this happen and be teletubbies about the entire situation...OH HELL NO.<br>
<br>
Thats why everything went wacky when Vind wanted to declare thier FFA thing. People did not want to lose out on thier respectful chances at mobs. We pay the same 10 bucks a month as the next guy and my copy of EQ aint no diffrent form yours. So that dont give Player XYZ reason to screw over Player ABC. <br>
<br>
If someone pushes the envelope and wants to run after mobs ahead of people doing it respectfully...people will rush in and try to make sure they get that mob. Because people do NOT like being fucked over by brain dead 12 year olds with nothing better to do.<br>

<br>
That is a very broad, all-encompassing statement, from one person who is plainly pro-FFA.  Zoulle, who do you speak for in saying that guilds won't respect reservations here?  The topic has already come up, and several guilds have stated that they WILL respect reservations posted here.  That doesn't mean that all guilds will do so, and the word &quot;respect&quot; is purely situational in a case where there is actually a dispute over a spawn, but a significant number of guilds will continue to use the reservation system here.<br>

Clearly, what you mean to say is that *some* guilds will not respect the reservations of other guilds if they deem them to be insignificant.  Obviously, there is no BINDING reservation system that can be enforced, but there is an agreement between several guilds and players on this board, that they will honor each others' reservations.  I don't think anyone expects YOU to honor them, as you are vehemently opposed to the entire concept, but this is just another example of people sticking their nose into other people's business.  If YOU don't care about reservations, and would rather piss on lower level players than see them work things out in a civil fashion, why are you bothering to post here?  You don't appear to have any interest in the affairs of the board and/or server community, except as a naysayer and shit-stirrer.<br>

It's not hard to do. It only takes a minute to look and see if anyone else is planning to be where you want to be. I don't think of it as a reservation or a stamp of ownership for the zone/mob in question. To me it is more of a &quot;FYI  We're going to be in this place at this time, doing this.&quot; <br>
<br>
Most zones can support more than one raiding group, even if one of the groups could handle the whole place themselves. As long as you communicate with each other and cooperate once you're in the zone then everyone can do their thing and fun will be had all around. If you're both there after the same target then, unfortunately, one side will go away disappointed. Offer to help them accomplish their goal and maybe they'll return the favor some time when you need it.<br>
<br>
There is no reason for the middle level and smaller guilds who post their raids here to stop respecting each other. Maybe it wouldn't hurt you big guys up there to take a look at the raid boards here once in a while. You guys might only want to go to Fear to kill CT, but I'd like to get a shot at Fright, Dread or Terror so I can get my Tear and finish off my epic.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

Think about it anyway. It only takes a minute and it can help to maintain our happy and fun loving minds.<br>

This is primarily in rebuttal to Darklord and various other individuals who make the same blanket assumptions/accusations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got me where I am today, and my guild (Mythic Legion), was kind enough to award me the baubles I have in appreciation for my efforts alongside my guildmates.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (being the people that assume lower level guilds did this for me, as in for all players in the 'Uber' guilds) did not get me to where I am today, or get me a single piece of my gear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have put things onto the EQ market and given away things to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> never had the chance to get at the levels <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> will now see them.<br>
<br>
So stop assuming <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> owe <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> anything, and play the game and enjoy it.<br>
<br>
And FWIW, I love seeing new faces, getting tells from younger monks about how to pull X, Y, or Z mob, giving out droppable items, mass slaughtering in a lowbie zone so newbies can loot for free cash (since I can't buff them very well aside from Spirit of Ox or Resist Cold), or just hanging out somewhere and sending grats tells to folks who are still in zone shout/ooc mode for their DINGs. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15409">Sensei Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

How did todays lowbies help get me where I am now?  I have been playing since Beta 2, have had multiple 50+ characters and have been in ML for over 2 years.  I came over from Fennin Ro, helped with the first Naggy, Vox, Efreeti Lord, Ghoul Lord, AM, Guk King, etc., etc., etc. kills on the server.  In no way have the current &quot;lowbies&quot; helped get me where I am today.  I got there myself.  Granted, I was at one time what would be considered today a &quot;lowbie&quot;, but when release came out, I was considered uber.  My first character was the first lvl 50 bard on Fennin, Mlavagite.  You can say what you want but in no way do the current lowbies help get me anywhere.  We help them and I shall continue to.<br>

Without that, anything from him, imho, is pretty much just hot air without anywhere to go, and thus it will dissipate fairly quickly. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15409">Sensei Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>
