<br>
Many conservatives, liberals and libertarians are protesting the <br>
numerous invasions of your liberty that Congress and the Bush <br>
administration have imposed during the past two months. <br>
<br>
But without realizing it, many of the protestors brought these <br>
invasions on themselves. <br>
<br>
This is America? <br>
<br>
I do share their concerns, however. <br>
<br>
First, Congress rammed through an &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; bill that violates <br>
the civil liberties of all Americans, not just terrorists. <br>
<br>
The new law allows federal officials to search your home when you're <br>
not present and not even tell you your home has been searched. You <br>
could come home one day and find your computer, file cabinets and <br>
legal papers have disappeared. You'd naturally think it was a <br>
burglary, but the burglars would be government employees (shades of <br>
Watergate). <br>
<br>
Warrants can be issued in secret, and you may not be allowed to see a <br>
warrant - or contest it - covering a search of your property. <br>
<br>
This is America? <br>
<br>
Government officials can go into any company anywhere and search <br>
records of your purchases and credit history, discover the websites <br>
you've visited, or monitor your e-mail - without evidence of a crime <br>
and without telling you, and they can order the companies not to tell <br>
you about the search. <br>
<br>
Then the Bush administration, apparently invoking the divine right of <br>
kings, decided that people can be tried and executed by secret courts <br>
(using secret evidence not available for you to refute), that <br>
government agents can eavesdrop on attorney-client conversations, and <br>
that federal agents can conduct searches without judicial oversight. <br>
<br>
This is America? <br>
<br>
And understand that the so-called &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is only two <br>
months old. This is just the beginning. What's still to come? <br>
<br>
In previous wars, citizens were imprisoned for speaking out against <br>
the government, newspapers were closed for protesting the war, <br>
private publications were censored, and people of foreign ancestry <br>
were put in concentration camps. We have a lot to look forward to. <br>
<br>
Don't be deceived! <br>
<br>
The press implies that the new civil-liberties invasions will apply <br>
only to terrorists. <br>
<br>
Not true. <br>
<br>
They apply to you, because anyone can be suspected of being a <br>
terrorist - including you. In fact, the new definition of &quot;suspected <br>
terrorist&quot; includes people speaking out against government policies. <br>
<br>
And if law-enforcement officials are to decide whose civil liberties <br>
will be denied, one of them may become convinced you're connected to <br>
the terrorists in some way, try you in a secret court, sentence you, <br>
imprison you and even execute you - with no opportunity for you to <br>
appeal the verdict or your sentence. <br>
<br>
This is America? <br>
<br>
An administration official told The Washington Post &quot;The U.S. <br>
Constitution doesn't protect anyone hiding and planning acts of <br>
violence.&quot; But what he meant was, &quot;The U.S. Constitution doesn't <br>
protect anyone we suspect of hiding and planning acts of violence.&quot; <br>
They don't know who's actually guilty until after a civil, public <br>
trial - conducted with all the traditional rules of evidence. What <br>
they have arrogated to themselves is the power to decide whether or <br>
not you will be protected by the Constitution. <br>
<br>
This is America? <br>
<br>
If you're not frightened by this, you're simply not paying attention. <br>
<br>
Won't be limited to a few people <br>
<br>
Have you been told that some of these invasions apply only to aliens -<br>
 or some other small group of people? <br>
<br>
Don't be reassured. When has any invasion of liberty not been <br>
expanded to cover all people eventually? <br>
<br>
The clearly unconstitutional RICO laws were supposed to apply only to <br>
organized crime - but hardly a single Mafia kingpin has been <br>
prosecuted using RICO, while abortion protestors and stockbrokers <br>
have been jailed by these laws. The clearly unconstitutional asset-<br>
forfeiture laws were only to nab big-time drug dealers, but all <br>
across America the property of innocent people has been seized. <br>
<br>
It's only a matter of time until every new oppression applies to all <br>
Americans. <br>
<br>
Why this happened <br>
<br>
I said that many of those protesting these invasions brought this on <br>
themselves. How? <br>
<br>
It's very simple. <br>
<br>
Attorney General John Ashcroft justified the unconstitutional police-<br>
state tactics by saying, &quot;I think it's important to understand that <br>
we are at war now.&quot; <br>
<br>
And there you have it. As Randolph Bourne said, &quot;War is the health of <br>
the state.&quot; Once you grant the government war-making powers, you <br>
grant the politicians the power to do anything they want. After all, <br>
you can't put your own personal liberty ahead of the good of the <br>
Fatherland, can you? <br>
<br>
Congress didn't declare war. There were none of the usual pre-war <br>
negotiations to try to avoid going to war. We're not even at war with <br>
any specific nation. But just utter the magic word &quot;war&quot; and all your <br>
rights can be stolen from you. <br>
<br>
So if you hollered for war, you hollered to have your rights taken <br>
away from you. <br>
<br>
Who gave your rights away? You did - if you supported the idea that <br>
the politicians should be free to do anything they want to satisfy a <br>
national lust for revenge. <br>
<br>
Isn't it time to start taking back your liberty?<br>
