Is this what you are talking about?<br>
<br>
You know when you have watched too many horror movies when your friends are cringing in terror and all you can do is yawn. While Ring, a blockbuster success in Japan, does deliver some chills (especially to those who can get scared easily), it is ultimately disappointing. <br>
<br>
The movie starts off very well, with a girl who tells her friend about a videotape she had watched a week ago. In it were some disturbing (not gory) images then a phone call at the end of it. The phone call indicated that she was going to die at the end of the week. In the movie, this premise is an urban legend that they brush off, but as the girl goes downstairs, the TV suddenly turns on and she found dead the next morning. It is the second most chilling scene in the movie and sets the tone. The next day, a reporter, covering the case finds out about the legend and begins a search for the tape. She finds it and she is given the same call. In one week, she is going to die. Of course, she won't take it lying down, so she enlists her ex-husband and they begin researching the history of the tape. <br>
<br>
The actual investigation takes 80% of the movie and it is non too exciting to watch. We do get a sense of dread as each day is counted, and the investigation itself is interesting, in a Changeling, sort of way, but many things pop up that begin to throw water on the flame we call reality. We learn that her husband is suddenly Psychic and this psychic allows the reporter to magically appear in scenes that happened years ago, a la Mummy Returns. However, the background story in and of itself is fairly boring and there are little twists and turns. It is more interesting when they dissect the videotape for evidence and clues. <br>
<br>
The last day (the movie is broken over a period of 7 days) is the most terrifying, due to self-motivated fear. We all know what is going to happen at 7:00 p.m. and as the main characters become more frantic in their actions to find a solution, the viewer also shares in the sense of despiration. When the phenomenon finally happens, it is a scene right out of a 1980's Lamberto Bava movie, but much better done. It is scary scene that caused several people in our viewing audience (both ladies and one guy) to gasp. It is a well crafted scene. However, the ending of the movie is poorly done. How does the reporter figure out the answer? There could have been 100 different answers to why she was spared, but of course she knows the right one. <br>
<br>
Anyway, the fear that eminates from this movie is like that of the Blair Witch Project. It is self-created and those who are fearless when watching horror movies may not be too impressed. However, all my friends who watched the movie said it was scary as heck, so hence my recommendation for the casual horror movie lover....Rating: B- <br>

<br>
The story revolve around a pyshic mother and daugther and a extremely religious father. Believing that the child was cursed one day he pushed her into a well and sealed it up. <br>
<br>
The story didn't explain how the tape came about, but it showed several scenes of the past, and ended up with a picture of that well. <br>
<br>
Anyone who watched that tape to its end will die exactly 7 days later. That is, unless the tape viewer makes a copy of tat tape and pass it on to the next person. (Which of course the heroine in the story didn't realise until then last moment, which is why she survived, as she had made a copy and gave it to the man.) <br>
<br>
Before death come, there will be a telephone ring, which of cos is met with silence by anyone picking up the phone. Then the TV will itself turn on, showing the scene of that cursed well. Then slowly it will showed a long haired girl in white, walking with unusual slumped posture climbing out of the well. Then the girl (with her hair covering her entire face) walks slowly to the TV screen. Eventually she climbs out slowly, out from the TV monitor, and emerges into real life Thereafter she kills with a stare from her baleful eye and pointing fingers. <br>
<br>
It is believed that the girl didn't die in that well, but survived for several days, and so her pschyic energy and hate for all life imbaled that tape with such evil energy. <br>
<br>
Believe me it is a frightening movie and should not be watched alone, and especially if you lived alone.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udeanericksonfans.showPublicProfile?language=EN>deanericksonfans</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/2/02 12:57:18 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: cursed tape</span><hr size=1> Oh, so it's a chain tape. :)  <p>"If you want my take on history, there's something you should know.
