Quite a waste of money.  Great special effects but you might as well just rent The Matrix one more time.<br>
Plot was a failed combination of Jackie Chan's &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot;.  Jet Li is out to kill all the other versions of himself in all the other parallel universes.  Oddly, there are only 125 versions, seems pretty finite for a 'limitless multiverse'.<br>
Jet Li is no actor, weak supporting cast, plot holes abounding, and stale dialogue.<br>
<br>
*ooo (1 of 4 stars)<br>
<br>
If you like the &quot;wire-fu&quot; (and I do), do yourself a favour and rent &quot;Twin Warriors&quot; with Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, much better.<br>
<br>
---------------------<br>
On the other hand, we rented &quot;Duets&quot;.  We'd heard mixed reviews about it but took a chance.  <br>
Nice ensemble.  3 separate plots, well written, nobody was given 'the spotlight',  good balance.  No complaints.<br>

yeah its typical that you watch a movie and think that. you spend most of your brain thinking where you've seen that actor, and end up not thinking too much of the movie itself (8 like for zoolander, ended up spending last half of the movie thinking where the actor playing hansil was in. ended up remembering he was from a movie with jackie chan. felt so good that night!

Did &quot;Monsters Inc&quot; also have the trailer for Star wars episode 2? I heard it did.<br>
<br>
I saw a couple movies lately. &quot;From Hell&quot; was decent. The Hughes Brothers took quite a bit of factual liberty with the Ripper story, but nontheless the movie was ok. &quot;Training Day&quot; was garbage. I'm really surprised Denzel Washington took that role. Real letdown of a movie. &quot;The Others&quot; was by far the best of the three movies I have seen lately. It was a fairly spooky movie with great cinematography and a good setting...the ending was a real mindscrew, kinda like in movies such as &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;. Anyways &quot;The Others&quot; is worth seeing IMO.<br>

The Episode II trailer was more of a teaser than a trailer... was spooky hearing Vader breath the whole way through it... no dialogue at all just short glimpses of stuff that will happen... looks like it will be a VERY dark movie and lots of Anakin/Vader plot stuff will come to light... why must I wait 7 more months to see it... DAMN YOU GEORGE LUCAS! There was also a pretty cool Lord of the Rings trailer too... <br>
<br>
MOnsters, Inc is almost worth seeing just for the trailers...<br>

K-PAX - Damn good movie and makes you really think about everything that happened and what it means in the end. Is he an alien... mentally scarred schizophrenic... or neither?<br>
<br>
Thirteen Ghosts - Shannon Elizabeth's breasts were - *cough* - I mean Shannon Elizabeth's acting was... ummm... big and round and - *COUGH* - No, Shannon Elizabeth's breasts were deserving of an Oscar nomination - *COUGH COUGH* - ARRGH, No wait... okay... Shannon Elizabeth's acting still sucks and her breasts are the only reason to go watch this cinematic suck-fest. In a nutshell, it's an episode of Scooby Doo gone REALLY, REALLY wrong. All that's left out is the villain grumbling &quot;... and I would have gotten away with it too if it weren't for these meddling kids...&quot;, in the end. 'Nuf said.<br>
<br>
X-MEN (DVD) - Damn good movie, especially for one based on a comic book. Hugh Jackman is an awesome Wolverine, and it was a risky move for him to take the part, considering he's a newcomer to the USA audience. James Marsden is a convincing Cyclops, but had little more of a role than the fearless leader and jealous boyfriend. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey was great, but it's strange seeing a 38-ish actress play the part of a young woman who is no older than 21. Rogue... ugh, since when is Rogue a 15 year old girl? Anna Paquin is good at acting young, stupid and pathetic though; I'll give her that. Ian McKellen WAS Magneto. Same for Patrick Stewart as Prof. Xavier. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was... well, blue. Hot as hell though, and she only had one line... but we know what her mouth is for, and it ain't for talking... *grin*. The rest of the cast was merely decent (*cough* Halle Barry couldn't have been a more boring Storm), but made for a great movie overall.<br>
<br>
The Faculty (on USA Network) - Ancient alien parasites have taken over the minds of the faculty and students at a high school in rural Ohio. The only way to kill them is to stab a pen full of crystal meth-ish shit (made by some paper-thin character played by that dude from Halloween: H2O) into them and make them dry up like a slug having salt poured on it. If the few kids who have managed to avoid being taken over and to push their clique-boundaries aside (heartwarming, hmm?)... can't defeat this alien menace, then they're GPA could really suffer. Or they'll end up dead. Whatever. <br>

The Hughes Brothers took quite a bit of factual liberty with the Ripper story, but nontheless the movie was ok. &quot;<br>
<br>
Close, but not quite true. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
To be precise, &quot;From Hell&quot; is based on the graphic novel written by Alan Moore &amp; Eddie Campbell, which is loosely based on Stephen Knight's &quot;Jack the Ripper:  The Final Solution&quot;.  This is detailed on the webpage you've listed in your next post, but I just want it to be very clear that the Hughes Brothers did not modify the Jack the Ripper story whatsoever.  They simply adapted Moore &amp; Campbell's work for the big screen.<br>
<br>
Neither of those books claim to be factually true, and in fact they expound upon the Jack the Ripper story.<br>
<br>
&quot;From Hell&quot; is excellent reading if anyone ever gets the chance to check it out.  I've got both the original issues as well as the graphic novel in my comic book collection, and I highly recommend either version to anyone interested in the Jack the Ripper story or the movie &quot;From Hell&quot;.<br>

But if you compare it to the actual real Ripper case, then yes they definitely did take some liberties. I was looking at it from a purely historical/factual viewpoint compared to what the Hughes Brothers put up on the screen. True, they based their movie on that comic book, which in turn was loosely based upon Knight's book. I call that the romanticized version of Jack the Ripper. Its definitely the coolest theory in idea, but its about the least credible =/.<br>

Have you ever read through that casebook site? Its very informative, very well done website.<br>

<br>
Yes, that was the point of my post.  The historical comparisions are best left elsewhere, and of particular note is the appendix in the back of the &quot;From Hell&quot; graphic novel.<br>
<br>
I am not claiming either version of the story to be accurate or correct.  Rather, I'm making the point that the movie is an adaptation of a comic book which is an adaptation of a novel.<br>
<br>
Many long, drawn-out debates have already occured on &quot;From Hell&quot; in various forums regarding what you're addressing here.  My point was something else entirely.<br>
<br>
&quot;Have you ever read through that casebook site? Its very informative, very well done website.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, I have.<br>

<br>
The point I was originally trying to make was that when someone makes a movie about Jack the Ripper, its generally compared to the real historical event/circumstances or criminal case in this situation, before anything else. Thats why I said upfront they took some factual liberties in regards to the real Jack the Ripper case, and since it was based on the graphical novel of the same name, the same idea is implied to that as well. The same thing could be said about the Knight book, but to a much lesser extent since its a bit more academic. All in all I would have rather seen them make the movie based off of solid research and derived opinion instead of a comic book. Something more credible. The way I see it is the comic book was pure fiction that took a lot of factual liberties with the real Jack the Ripper case, the Hughes Brothers took their movie straight from the comic book...so yes they did end up taking factual liberties with the original story by proxy IMO. But I think whats commonly mistaken here is that this is not a movie about the real Jack the Ripper case, it is more about an adaption from a fictional graphic novel based on the Jack the Ripper case. I apologize for being so anal about this, but its a real pet peeve of mine when Hollywood dabbles in history...because a lot of people don't know better and Joe Six Pack ends up going home at night believing Inspecter Aberline was a heroin addict who committed suicide after the Ripper case, Sir William Wallace (Braveheart) wore highlander garb and was a Scottish commoner, and Roman Emperor Commudus was slain in the arena by an old ex-general. <br>
