<br>
It could be a bad router somewhere else in between, or yeah, it could be your ISP (just because you don't get disconnected from your ISP doesn't mean it doesn't suck).<br>
<br>
Try doing a traceroute to druzzilro.everquest.com<br>
<br>
That should help pinpoint the problem router.<br>
<br>
For me when stuff happens, its usually some crappy California server (no offence to anyone from California but GAWD that place sucks as far as power shortages and morons running routers).<br>

<br>
If the lag is REALLY bad the hotkeys and buttons don't work and I'll type the /w friends command manually.  This has saved me countless times.  Try it and let me know if it works for you.<br>

<br>
Consider the analogy of a 2 lane street.  If you have can normally have 10 cars driving single file on one side, and 10 cars on the other side going the other direction, with no problems.  However, if you double how many cars are on that street, you'll end up with collisions, or cars trying to compete for the same space/bandwith.  Getting from point A to point B can take longer, or maybe you won't get there at all and you'll accidentally take a detour that gets you at a dead end.<br>
<br>
As an online game, VI PAYS their online providers for their connections to the internet - be it Sprint or UUNET or BBNPlanet or Savvis or whomever.  VI will pay for certain levels of bandwith.  It'd be VI's fault if they pay FOR EXAMPLE a 28.8 modem connection from Sprint, when they know they should have a OC12 (this is just a very simple example).  <br>
<br>
It's the responsibility of VI's (probably) Network Operations to see what traffic they're getting, and make sure they are paying for MORE than what they think they NEED!  <br>
<br>
Just like they need to make sure they have enough bandwith, they also need to make sure their equipment along that path can handle the traffic.  You don't get a $10 hub when you need a multithousand dollar cisco router.  You'll get people/connections dropped because of that too.  Each server, from what I've vaguely heard, is not just one machine too - Druzzil Ro is multiple machines, and those machines better be able to handle the load on them, and between them.  Again, you don't want cheapo network cards.  You need to be able to monitor what's being used, and make sure you've got better equipment than what you need.  If one of the network cards are flaky, people can be dropped because of that.<br>
<br>
There is no way we'll know how well their system is setup/provisioned, and how well they keep track of traffic, and probable attacks from outside the system.  It does seem funny that most of the time, it can't be just &quot;coincidental&quot; that the players will notice outages (and try to get VI to admit to them), before any paid employee in the chat rooms will know about them (or admit to them).  Frankly, sometimes I think that if they DO have a separate network operations group, they're probably not letting the poor chat room slaves know about outages or problems.  I'd wager that VI doesn't pay for better than what they need - and that they're just scraping by, and not caring if people go LD and die because of that.  <br>
<br>
True, there WILL be times that a WHOLE SERVER will boot everyone, and then it's very obvious it's a VI issue, but I'd wager there are more times that it's an issue where the culpability lies in VI's court, than they admit.  Heck, they don't even keep their own Scheduled and Unscheduled downtime webpages updated all the time.  It's much easier for them to say it's nearly always the fault of the customer.   <p>-=-=-=-<br>
