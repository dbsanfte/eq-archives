<br>
i was out clubbing one night i was just leaning against a wall when one of the most weird experiences in my life happened.<br>
<br>
Its hard to describe but here goes<br>
<br>
i walked away from the wall and turned round for some reason and standing there against the wall was me .now it was weird because i could see every detail ,how i was standing ,who was standing near me everything.i didnt feel scared or anything in fact i felt really peacefull.<br>
<br>
it lasted for about 10-15 seconds then i was 'back' i could remember every detail of the experience even the feeling of peacefullnes.<br>
<br>
Now i have had similar experiences before but nothing as vivid as this (quite a shame really i would LOVE to experience that again <p>Regards GMT (Adrian)

<br>
Right here goes,<br>
<br>
Astral Projection, or OBE's is the projection of our 'negative'(not negative as in depressed) selves, just like a photograph has a negative, so do we.  This negative is called ethereal self, spiritual self, true self, etc there are many names for it.<br>
<br>
Like the picture that Bluetack posted, (I have seen it before many times, for some reason I keep getting this posted to me..lol, but I have huge faith)what you saw on your computer, was different to what you saw when you closed your eyes.....<br>
<br>
This is so in 'life'..what others see of us in life, and what we project of oursleves in life, is not what we project in death.  This is because that which we all can see, and touch ( like furniture, humans, animals, houses, etc, ) produces a negative picture of that which ALL of us can't see or touch (like dreams, visions, pictures of the mind, spirits etc), which also empowers the difference of 'this world' and the 'spiritual world' if you like.  Interestingly enough, in 'this world', a mans wealth is based on his assets, ie.money, posessions etc, but, in the 'spiritual world' or 'negative' world a man's wealth is based on his spiritual enlightenment and development while living on earth.  <br>
<br>
Many are blindfolded into thinking that they must posess this, or have money, a nice house etc, but really, some of your life should be devoted to developing yourslef spiritually,as, when you die( or should I say your body dies), your spiritual self will be placed on the apprpriate higher plane.......unless you have not developed any or very little of it, wherby you will just have to come back = reincarnation.<br>
<br>
Think about it, suffering, as emotionally disturbing as it may be, produces a positive effect by showing you thast there is always a new and different angle to look at things in your life, or anything for that matter - and it should also help you learn something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The main factor of life is about 'suffering as individuals' although life can be enjoyable too becuase you have to exprience each given emotion.  (So what about OBE's then Sarah?  -- oh yes sorry!..lol )<br>
<br>
OBE's are the projection of your spiritual self, and can either be drug induced,(mentioned only becuase they can - however I do not recommend the use of drugs) - or you can learn them (a very long process, if anyone tells you they did it within the first couple of tries, they are not being honest), or they can be against your will (meaning that they just happen as in my case)... My first OBE frightened the life out of me!  It really shook me up and scared me, and the first place I was taken to during it was a library.  I did not know what astral projection was at this time, I had never heard of it. I couldn't sleep properley for weeks, and I had a few more OBE's - but then something hit me one day -I realised I had been shown a library because that is where I would find the information of what was happening to me, so I started on my exciting and frightening journey of exploring the world of the occult..<br>
<br>
In the occult world there are many esoteric (secret,private, hidden) factors and practices which go on to this day.  As an onlooker, I learnt all I could, and realised this formed a part of my 'spiritual learning' on earth - I will reveal more I suppose as time goes by <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
If you expreience an OBE then there is a possiblility that it will come to show you something, raise your own perspective on self awareness, or take you on another life path, or impress on your mind to think about things more deeply, there is always a reason for the experience, and I have been to good and what only can be considered as <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   places in my projections, but like life, the good has to be taken with the bad.<br>
<br>
Try to be calm about it, and most of all, don't let it 'control' your life.  OBE's are powerful expriences that can impress the subconsious self into becoming totally focused on this type of thing that normal life obligations go out the window.  If any of you want to learn more about the occult, or related things, do it with an open mind, and please be careful.....I know from experience that there are a few <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   people out there that will try to influence you if they suspect your new to the workings of the unexplained.  Be very careful about this, never give ANYONE you may meet your address, and NEVER put all your cards on the table.  Do not show fear, show confidence.  You may think I am over reacting,- <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   surrounds us just as goodness does -  and you can meet this type of person anywhere when you start your research....even in libraries in the 'occult' section <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>

<br>
But, question.  I've had flying dreams, underwater breathing dreams, and dreams so vivid I could swear they were real life experiences.  It's only when I wake up that I am disappointed to find I was 'dreaming'.  The experiences described in lucid dreams, in the explanation above, I've had in regular dreams as well as lucid dreams.  Does that mean anything?<br>

As for Astral Projection, I don't know that I've done that, either.  I can do certain things, but Astral Projection and OBE are something that I am just not sure I've experienced.  If I did, I was not conscious of it.<br>
<br>

Im so glade I found this page!! I have alot of OBE. But the onlys ones that know are my family and theripist well now you guys.<br>
<br>
My firist one happend was when I was 4. I came home and told my mom I saw me and my best friend out side playing but I was sitting in my desk with her next to me. But I could see me and here both out side swinging.<br>
<br>
It happend a few weeks later I was bowling with some friends and I saw myslef at the other end of the bowling ally and I was watching my self bowl.<br>
<br>
Then when I was 6 me and my friends were playing outside and I was cold so I went in to get a sweater I saw myself (like I was looking out a window) run inside.<br>
<br>
It happend at the movie theater but I just saw myself walk into the bath room and that was it.<br>
<br>
Yes I know this arnt OBE but I though I would share<br>
<br>
My brother moved to TN a few months ago. Last week me my mom and my dad were camping and my brother called and asked us were we were. Then I said to my mom &quot;I bet Ryan was calling because hes driving up here to suprise us and wants to know where we are so he doesnt go to the house&quot; two minutes later my brother showed up!! He said &quot;suprise,I called you guys to know where you were so I wouldnt go to the house.&quot;<br>
            He never told me or anyone he was coming up.<br>
<br>
It happens all the time! Sometimes I have dreams and they will come true. Like you know how you wake up before you die in your dream? Well I had a dream a few nights ago I was hit by a car and I saw the blood on me and on the ground and paramedects came put me on a streacher and took me to the hospital and I died but I saw my dead body in the bed and I saw my own funeral...<br>
<br>
Im very confused about that...My mom and theripist are the only ones that know that story. Im affaried to tell anyone else because Im affaried they wont belive me... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Just wanted to add my two cents worth.  <br>
<br>
I've been giving out my name left - right - and - center - in my dream!  Apparently I was having a dream where a woman was collecting names, addresses, usernames/passwords and all sorts of things.  <br>
<br>
A couple of nights later I dreamt I was walking down the road and these little email printouts pop up in my hands asking me all sorts of questions.  Mega nerdsville !! I have to get out more!<br>
<br>

&quot;I know from experience that there are a few  people out there that will try to influence you if they suspect your new to the workings of the unexplained. Be very careful about this, never give ANYONE you may meet your address, and NEVER put all your cards on the table. Do not show fear, show confidence. You may think I am over reacting,-  surrounds us just as goodness does - and you can meet this type of person anywhere when you start your research....even in libraries in the 'occult' section.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
I spoke to someone who mentioned that it might have been a family member and sure enough, when I did the research, we did have a Benjamin Ohrmundt in our family who died in the Civil War.  It was probably the freakiest thing that has ever happened to me.<br>
