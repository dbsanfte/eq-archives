However I think this whole FFA thing is bad in general for D-Ro. <br>

To me the reason for the IGB was for those guilds that CAN take out a mob to get a fair shot at it. <br>
<br>
Just because the ubers have gotten better than the rest of us at setting up and doing things doesnt mean they should  have the right to dominate these spawns. <br>

I just discovered thjis board and this topic.  I am a 51st Cleric and never been guilded, a topic of infinite observation both by people I rez and others.  I have never once intentionally gone ANONYMOUS.  There have been times since I attained level 49 when I have felt like a rich college freshman being rushed strongly by all the Frats.<br>
<br>
For a long time I was oblivious to the presence of guilds, then for a longer time yet, to their pervasiveness and importance.  Heck I had really never paid attention to the term &quot;uber&quot; until recently and until 2.5 weeks ago I had never seen the term HOSS.  Several weeks ago a dear friend of mine, with whom I have played EQ almost from my start back in May, and I decided to investigate, and ultimately join, a guild.  Since then we have been looking, and in some cases, going on raids with guilds that we were interested in, or that had indicated an interest in us.  In many cases these were guild of people who we had met and enjoyed in game.  It has beena fascinating odyssey that is not yet over.<br>
<br>
Reading though about post 50 level gaming a couple of things have become clear:  You CAN make level 60, albeit slowly, by not being guilded, and that you probably CANNOT obtain the gear that makes possible some activity without being guilded, or having a group of people of guild like level and resources.  And it is pretty clear from game design and some of the things Sony is directly quoted as saying that the design does in fact require guilding or extreme high level cooperation.  <br>
<br>
In the Uber Quest to decide what guild is best to join we have discovered a lot of things....  there are guilds that have earned themselves some pretty despicable reputations...hearing that from one person can be disgruntlement, 2 or 3 related people can be sour grapes, but multiple unrelated people and it becomes a pretty clear pattern with a high liklihood of containing substantial trurth.  As a result there some guilds I will not consider.<br>
<br>
One of the things that had always bothered me about the guilded, was grouping with them and sometimes in the midst of great danger being told &quot;Guildie calling, gotta go&quot; and having them disband and leave with no time to replace them or head to safety.  My friend and I decided early on we would never join a guild that condoned this, let alone encouraged or required.  For the most part I now believe that much of that was excuses offered for bad behaviour by immature players.  That is not to say I don't understand leaving for a genuine emergency as long as your leaving does not create and leave behind yet another emergency.<br>
<br>
Leaving other playes in your group at risk seldom can be justified.  Sometimes it can be an oversight but a pattern indicates selfish or immature behaviour.  Nothing illegal, but wrong from an interaction basis and likely to get one placed on my &quot;no group&quot; list if not my &quot;no rez&quot; list.  By the same token there are people who will do all they can to help group members and others suceed without risking others.  There are guilds like that too...they both go to the top of my list.<br>
<br>
I was online during the &quot;sleeper&quot; raid the other night and saw all of the rumours, flames, observations, comments, huzzahs and complaints.  I was told definitevly that the sleeper was awakened...  I was also told definitevly that it wasn't as the 4th warder was not killed.  I still do not know which is truth, not the consequences except speculation I have picked up as sites.<br>
<br>
The lawyer in me can find all sorts of &quot;holes&quot; in the EULA and the rules of behaviour and the sprite in me wants ot exploit every one, and I may.  BUT, if in fact Sony/Verant created a once per server &quot;sleeper&quot; encounter then they must have anticipated that someday some group would do that encounter, as apparently has happened on other servers.  And if they didn't want the dragon killable, they would make in UNKILLABLE... instead of having a billion HP or whatever.  Ditto the warders.  <br>
<br>
Yes it may well be unnice or unsportsmanlike to kill something that ends the potential enjoyment of many other people on the server..... and yes FFAing raids instead of coordinating may adversely affect the enjoyment of others who are members of coorperating guilds and point up the non-cooperators as being Adam Henrys (as we used to call them in law enforcement.)  But it isn't illegal....yet.<br>
<br>
This kind of behaviour has svereal consequences besides the visceral satisfaction of &quot;having done it&quot;.  1.) It can cause prospective &quot;good citizen&quot; guild members to go elsewhere to more well behaved guilds; 2.) It can cause creative legalists (like me) to find all sorts of devious, nasty, but also entirely legal ways to express displeasure at the arrogance; 3.) Eventually it can cause Sony/Verant to change the rules and limit our in game freedom.  Scuba diving for example is essentially a self-regulated activity here in the US and it will likely stay that way until and unless someone continually abusses the privilege, then the government will move in and regulate.  And Sony, just like any other consumer corporation, does listen to its customer base (Look at the change in the Cleric Epic recently.)  There are a LOT more $9.95/mo on this server that are NOT in Uber guilds than there are in.  So the actions of a guild exercising its freedom to do so, may result in a loss of that freedom for them and all others, by rules change or change of game design.<br>
<br>
All of these things I have seen and heard and whatever happens form here on will have an impact on my decision as to where to go, what to do and whom to join.<br>

Vindication was not just Seekers. People from other high end guilds that were already established at that time gear/skill wise also joined the ranks. The IGB at that time wasn't a spoon feeding loot program. It was 3 guilds who had established power through FCFS means to cordially work out a means of not stepping on each other's toes. It wasn't even a rotation since HOSS was in HOT on dragon faction and no where near NTOV at the time. To try to argue that IGB was the same then as it is now and that Vindication joined  was the only reason they became uber is ridiculous. Who's clueless here?<br>

Kindness? I doubt it. Respect? yea I would say so. What have you done in this game to earn my respect? Get your sebilis key? You want respect and for people to &quot;share&quot; with you, to manage their mob killing times around your work schedule, kids going to bed ect yada yada. You just expect entitlement to this. Why should they? I'll say it again to you and grazel , I don't care about you. I don't know you, I don't want to know you. I don't give 2 shits about your loot situation and it's not my problem or responsiblity to help you get phat loot. This is what you can't understand. This is a game who's primary focus based on the designers wishes is to collect loot. It's that simple. Having the best loot creates a certain standing in the community. Your not entitled to any of this, you need to earn it. And one other thing that is really stupid is this /rich/poor class envy loot crap. Seekers was a &quot;rich&quot; guild loot wise so they were branded greedy whores who screwed everyone over. But people screaming about loot here expecting free handouts who train in HOT are innocent victims of FFA. /cry I feel your pain. Your wasting time, start killing mobs if you want loot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 278<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/25/02 2:04:19 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Zoulle, I never asked for your respect and if I had the respect of people like you I would be like you.  That is about as far from what I want in this game as possible.  My life has meaning outside of a game.  I have had offers from uber guilds and happily turned them down because loot means next to nothing to me.  I do not know you nor would I want to.  So I guess we are both overjoyed that we never run into each other.  Strangely I am one of those &quot;weak&quot; people that would much rather help others than myself.  One of those &quot;freaks&quot; that would rather everyone enjoyed the game, rather than just myself.  After all the game was designed to have a very integral social level.  A level a good number of people seem to be missing out on, but that is their choice and it is fine by me they choose not to take full advantage of it.  What is not fine by me is that they prevent others from doing so.  I earned my levels.  I was not PLed or twinked.  I doubt everyone in uber guilds can say that, in fact I have seen many ubers PLing people that were in their clique so &quot;earned&quot; is a very relative term. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

To some players, standing is based on the armor your wear and the weapon you wield.  The vast majority of the people who aren't getting along with each other adhere to this notion.  Loot equals standing, am I reading that right?<br>
<br>
On the other side of the coin are those who feel that *reputation* is more important than *standing*, and they are certainly two different things.  Your standing, if based on loot and level only, is like judging a person by their salary and the car they drive.  Reputation is based on how you interact with others, how you got where you are, and how you earned what you have.  Once you feel that you have a high enough standing, you no longer need to care about your reputation, right?  If I can be lvl 60, kill the hardest mobs in the game, and have the best gear possible, why should I care how I got there or what people think of me?  My standing will be among &quot;the best&quot;, even if I have to walk all over everyone to get there.<br>
<br>
Reputation be damned, as long as my standing is better than the guy next to me.<br>

<br>
Vindication...if it were you that were staging to go and hit a particular high-end mob...and L'malla leapfrogged you...what would your posts on this subject look like?  I doubt that it would be &quot;Hey no problem...we worked hard and they came and finished it off...no big deal...on to other business&quot; (this seems to be what everyone is complaining about) I think we would be reading the same posts except guess who would be calling foul?<br>
<br>
To Hoss...While I regret that I will never get my hands on a primal weapon (this considering that the sleeper was awakened) I congratulate you on your accomplishment.  It seems absurd to me that ANY guild would do this for the purpose of not allowing anyone else to gain primal weapons...This was a unique encounter and you pulled it off (from what I hear) Congratulations and I weep.<br>
<br>
To everyone else...rules are meant to be guidelines...to have a rule for every contingency is ludicrous and impossible...think about it.  Therefore...most rules are meant to give us an idea about how to behave (I am not talking about laws here like no murdering etc).  When we come upon a situation we are forced to make a judgement.  It seems to me that many times that judgement seems to be for some...WE are more powerful therefore we will take over because we want to do this...to hell with what they have done...they are not as powerful as we are.<br>
<br>
Question for all those &quot;Uber&quot; guilds...when was the last time you DID something for someone else just for the hell of it (and I am not talking about a cleric rez here or C2 there...I am talking about a large number of you doing something for another group...like buffing stations or something like that just to be nice?)  You don't want to be &quot;hated&quot; for being powerful?  Be gracious in your power.  No one likes tyrants (not accusing anyone just trying to get some to look within instead of without).<br>
<br>
Final statement...What goes around, comes around...if ya act like an ass...it will come back to you...If you are considerate..it will come back to you. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=isabelle>Isabelle</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/25/02 2:50:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=56>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: heh</span><hr size=1> Ahhh Sir Somberlain  the difference as you so elequently put it is in deed Reputation to some and Standing to others.<br>
While we rail against those who have chosen the easy route of obtaining the uber loot while ignore the reputation it stained them with, i would like to applaud as well the members of the uber guilds who tried there hardest to work within the IGB and for the servers best interest. The only true failure would have been to have not tried to intercede.<br>
  The Fact we have become a FFA Server and that the Sleeper was relieced is undenyable, but since that incident very many of the uber guilds have retained ther composition and dignity. They deserve the spotlight as well as those who have lost sight of the honor and nobility the rest of us have chosen as our uber loot. <br>
It is not impossible to be a player of both Reputation and Standing but it sure takes a whole lot more work.<br>

Kindness does not have any relavence in competition my friend. See, that's the point you will never understand. EQ is a competitive game. Your loot reflects that. It reflects your skill as a player. Your not trying to earn love no, you are correct. But you are demanding the same courtesy and respect Vind shows HOSS when you havn't done a thing to earn it. Respect implies kindness? How so? Did Russia imply kindness by not nuking us during the cold war? Face Reality, oh I forgot reality is too offensive for some people. Am I selfish and vicious? I think you need to read some of your posts and ask yourself that very same question. <br>
<br>
I was reading up on some new changes and came across this today. <br>
<br>
The following are going to be perm changes to Everquest as dictated by the spirit of the IGB.<br>
<br>
1.Every char will start out at lvl 60. Since time and work is an issue with some of our customers, we feel it's unfair to make people level up as it would imply some players are better than others skillwise.<br>
<br>
2.No class shall be better than another. All classes will have the exact same hp's, ac and stats. We will make all caster spells identical as to not allow a class to have a better spell than another. We hope this will finally resolve wizard's bitching about how shitty their class is. <br>
<br>
3.All char will start out with the best armor and weapons in the game. We will also remove all equip except the best and will no longer upgrade equip in the future. This will resolve poorly equiped char's jealousy of uber guilds and even the playing field among all players.<br>
<br>
4.No mob will be more difficult than another mob. We no longer wish a mob's death to be based on skill. We just want everyone to have an equal chance at the encounter and being able to defeat it. Mobs will no longer drop loot, therfore dropping the incentive uber guilds would have at killing it. this way,everyone will have (in our eyes) equal chance at engaging that mob.<br>
<br>
5.Guild system will now be abolished. Because the new &quot;spirit&quot; of Everquest is driving for equality and tolernace of less skilled players, we at sony interactive, feel guilds imply a mob mentality of us vs them , we are better than you. Players will also all have the exact same name. &quot;Default_EQPlayer&quot;. We don't wish those who can't think of a good name to feel inadequate. <br>
<br>
We hope you will enjoy these new changes. we know grazel will.<br>

So I will ask....<br>
<br>
Almost any action we can take in a game like this can have an adverse impact on other players.  When I participated in fights on Orc Hill, the Orcs we chose to kill were targets another group could have had.  the delay for them to respawn was and adverse impact on others.  My decision to pursue my own character's interests upon ocaission instead of constantly healing and ressing others has an adverse impact upon them.  We all have our reasons....<br>
<br>
So... Any Hoss Officer...would you please explain why it was that your guild elected to wake the sleeper?  Was there a piece of loot unobtainable otherwise?  Was it an element of some quest?  Is it going to lead to more plotlines or looting opportunities?  Was it better experience than otherwise attainable?  Or......?<br>
<br>
Any officer of Vindi.....  why did you elect to leave the IGB system of raid coordination and go FFA?  What guild / member needs were served?  <br>
<br>
Of course there is no obligation for anyone to answer, and as always anyone can comment, but what I am asking for is the comments of a guild officer giving a somewhat &quot;official&quot; position so that we can continue to discuss this matter in a more informed posture.<br>

When was the last time a smaller guild actually asked a &quot;uber&quot; guild to help them?  A guild that is generally planes ready rarely will ask for help from an uber because of raid times.  Most guilds are all raiding something around the same time.  Who knows what that &quot;uber&quot; guild might say if actually asked.  As for individual things, many <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> people</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> from &quot;uber&quot; guilds help out anyone that asks, without question.  <br>

Respect is to hold in high esteem.  To regard highly.  It has nothing to do with kindness...your assuming too much when <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> you</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> want kindness from it.  <br>
