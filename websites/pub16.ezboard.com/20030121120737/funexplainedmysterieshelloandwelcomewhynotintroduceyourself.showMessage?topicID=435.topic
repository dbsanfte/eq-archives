The weirdest experience I've ever had since the age of 21 is sleep paralysis (when you feel like you can't move and there's something in the room with you and other ghastly experiences)<br>
I'd like to hear of other people's experiences, as mine freak me out..........<br>

<br>
What you experience depends on circumstances and probably imagination.<br>
<br>
I had such an experience in a Chemistry class in colege. It was a bitter cold day, and I was sitting by the heater in the back of the class to keep warm. I distinctly heard the professor say &quot;Dave, you  better turn down the heater before someone falls asleep. Dave, Dave...&quot; I could hear him perfectly, I could even describe the lecture later, but I couldn't move for the life of me.<br>
<br>
It's odd, and a little scary, but nothing abnormal.<br>

I've been reading about it and some say it's when you're half asleep and awake and that it's your brain hasn't quite connected to the body yet....hence you can't move......I don't worry about it too much....it's just at the time it's freaky especially if it's a really realistic dream and I'm thinking that someone is attacking me....<br>
The dreams are realistic but obviously when I wake everything is normal.<br>
I get mine when I'm really exhausted so that probably explains it but I'm interested in other peoples experiences.....<br>
Hope you don't fall asleep in any more classes.....it used to happen to me in biology watching slides....yaaaaawwwwwnn.<br>

<br>
I think I may have had it a time or two, but I will relate the scariest one.<br>
<br>
When my husband and I were newly married, we lived in a basement apartment.  My husband (Paul), works nights, so what we did have for windows, were covered in tinfoil so he could sleep in the daytime, and at night the room was dark as pitch.  <br>
<br>
One night I awoke, unable to move, with a person standing above me (I thought), I only saw a silouette, but my impression was that it was a man, dressed in a cloak with a hat on.  I felt great menace from this person, who was by this time, close enough to touch me, so I began screaming as loudly as I could.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The next few moments were kind of a blur, but my screams woke Paul, who began thrashing around, trying to get his bearings enough to help me.  His movement amplified my feeling of being attacked, so I screamed all the louder.  A short time later, I was once again able to move, an the feeling of being threatened, was gone without a trace.<br>
<br>
The next day, our upstairs neighbor commented that she had heard the screams, and thought someone was being killed.  She didn't feel compelled to check it out though.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I don't know if this is at all like what you experience, but I feel for you if you get this often, because this one still shakes me up 12 years later.<br>
<br>
Great to hear from you, come back soon,<br>
<br>

mine are pretty similar and sometimes I get some one standing over me with a mask and long cloak....also a whirring or hissing sound......<br>
Sometimes i can see myself in the bed with two people sat beside me looking at me in the bed and I'm watching myself and them.....it's freaky to dream this way...<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :z --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/sleeping.gif ALT=":z"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The worst one was when I was asleep and woke up and had a bird or something flapping at the side of my head (i couldn't move)  then the cloaked figure was standing at the end of the bed with his arms raised as if it was gonna strike me......<br>
I just laid there thinking if you are gonna kill me make it quick .......after that it sort of faded away and then I was able to move again, put all the lights on and check the whole house for anybody.....I couldn't sleep for an hour or so after that.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek3 --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/ylamazed.gif ALT=":eek3"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I probably get it every couple of months but it's not as frightening as it used to be as I know it's not real and I am just having a very vivid dream....<br>
Hi GMT...thanks for the welcome....great site no?<br>

At the time I had no idea what it was, but I found it very scary. I used to manage a tour company and worked long hours. It didn't really bother me as I enjoyed my job, but after one particularly stressful week away with little sleep I returned home and sunk into bed. My brain seemed to fall asleep before I did <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I recall feeling pinned to the bed, completely awake but unable to move. I knew I was awake but was unable to move at all, call out, anything. I don't believe it lasted too long as I don't recall falling asleep for real, but it was vivid enough for me to remember quite acurately exactly how I felt at the time. Pretty un-nerving. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sabeanqueen>SabeanQueen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderating Queen</span><br>  Posts: 129<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/21/02 6:55:31 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=435.topic&index=8>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.btinternet.com/~kjingleby/catwoman.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://unexplained-mysteries.netfirms.com/pi08.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: sleep paralysis...anyone else get it?</span><hr size=1> I've just been thinking about it. At the time I did feel as if there was something in the room with me, nothing that I could see, just a sensation. Weird how my memory is working now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I recall now being quite scared at the time, and I remember hearing a low knocking noise. As it turned out, even thought I was awake/asleep I could still comprehend things around me, enough to realise that the knocking noise was actually me at the time, shaking slightly and knocking the bed against the wall. Maybe that's the posint when I fell asleep? Realising I was safe?<br>
<br>
