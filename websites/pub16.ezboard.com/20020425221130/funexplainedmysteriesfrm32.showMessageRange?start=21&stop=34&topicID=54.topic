<br>
Sorry. Couldn't resist. Anne Rice's characters have less dimensions than the surfer girls in the Gidget movies. All of her male vampires are the exact same guy with different clothing. Literally. And her female vampire's are the Lesbianist Movements Dream spokesmodels. Not that I have anything against the Lesbianist Movements, just they all seem to fit that stereotype. <br>
<br>
Willim DaFoe's Shadow of the Vampire character is supposed to be the vampire from the 1930's german film Nosferatu.<br>
<br>
As far as best vampire? <br>
<br>
Best Evil Vampire:  Lance Henrikson, &quot;Near Dark&quot;<br>
Most Tragic: Same dude as above. He loved his family.<br>
Gary Oldman also get's topnotches even though everyone keeps making the same Stereotyped Dracula movies, forgetting that Dracula was a bloodthirsty psychotic knight guy who didn't have time to be a pansy.<br>
<br>
David Bowie also made a good tragic Vampire. <br>
<br>
Bauhaus &quot;Bela Lugosi's Dead&quot; was meant to be a joke, but apparently no one took it that way.<br>
<br>
And I'm sorry I keep running off topic, I don't mean to. <br>
<br>
Best Lesbian Vampire Movie: The original! Vampiros Lesbianos. Italian. Really. The Lesbian Vampires. Many places you could find that if you know where to look. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's actually Torn Prince and it's a blatant rip-off of the ghost in 13 Ghosts which overall was a pretty schlocky movie, but the ghosts rocked beyond all belief. The Torn Prince's imagery just amazed me, and then deducted from the website, you can find out that all the ghosts have a sort of background, and the Torn Prince's was one of unfulfilled destiny which just kinda struck a nerve with me. Your right though, if I had named myself the Thorn Prince that would've been really cool and I wish I had now.

<br>
Yes, the last movie to appear with Dracula in it was Dracula 2000, no I have not seen it however, due to the fact that all I could garner from the previews was another teen monster movie and after the fall of Wes Craven with Scream, I just didn't feel the need to see anymore of those even though I'll probably end up renting it...well...today since I have nothing better to do.<br>
<br>
Dracula in Dracula 2000 is played by Gerrard Butler. <br>
<br>
I know alot about vampire movies, because I know alot about horror movies. I'm going to film school soon here hopefully, so I can produce my own schlock that will be ripped apart in message boards by people like myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
It's 4:52 in the morning here and I've just wrapped up tonight's movie/correspondance finishing course marathon for tonight. I hate my old high school and their need to screw me over like a two bit hooker. It's their fault I have to do this crap. I'm to old to be staying up on three hours of sleep dammit.<br>
<br>
Anyways. Tonight's choice of movies were &quot;Dracula 2000&quot; as requested, &quot;Terror Tract&quot;, &quot;Amityville 1992: It's About Time&quot;, and &quot;Phantoms&quot;. &quot;Phantoms&quot; I've already seen and don't really need to elaborate beyond the fact that it's good background noise. Generic horror movie with all the big monster evil thing's cliches. Overall worth renting if only for brain deadedness.<br>
<br>
Now. Dracula 2000. I went into this movie biased, like I said, I didn't expect much. I was very pleasantly surprised. This had to be the most refreshing vampire movie since Modern Vampires. They kept the sort of dark demeanor that seems to coat vampire movies but dropped all the crap which may make some hardcore vampire fans not like this movie at all. Dracula isn't portrayed as some evil porn star, but as an incredibly tragic figure played very well by Gerrard Butler. Probably one of the best aspects was the added mythology which I'm not going to reveal in case anyone who reads this would want to see it. It was also nice to see some of the older mythologies regarding vampires brought back, such as silver and the fact that crosses don't really keep them at bay, just sort of piss them off. One of the most entertaining aspects of this movie was searching for and finding many, many references to older versions of Dracula, like the Skull from germany, 1922 with the two enlarged incisors, obviously a reference to the orginal Nosferatu. Also the three female vamps return in different forms, Carfax antiques a reference to Carfax Abbey that Dracula purchased in the novel and so forth. Oh, and the main girls were named Mary and Lucy and if you don't get that, you've never seen Dracula, or read the book.<br>
<br>
Now, on the downside. Beyond Mary, Simon, and Dracula the acting was horrid. Some of the action felt a little to much like it was put in there just because of the recent trend in movies to have fight scenes with martial arts, especially the ending one. It seemed forced I guess and unnecessary. I felt gipped, there was like, 5 seconds of nudity and this is just my blatantly male part speaking but I wanted to see that one reporter chick nude dammit. But oh well. <br>
<br>
Overall, not revolutionary, but definately not bad. It'd get a B on my grading scale.<br>
<br>
Oh, go rent Terror Tract, NOW. Of all the movies i watched tonight, Terror Tract was my favorite. You can get it at blockbuster, and don't worry about the box, it's an anthology, not a dentist rip off. It get's an A even through all of the purposely bad acting at parts when the bad acting is actually funny when in the scene. Trust me, this movie is great.<br>
<br>
Amityville is...amityville. Yeah. Generic haunted house movie, nothing major happening there. Good brain dead watchiness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=timetraveler>time traveler</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(3/6/02 9:03:43 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=54.topic&index=31>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Dracula 2000</span><hr size=1> I was pretty sure you wouldn't hate this movie.

In other words what is appalling to us was not necessarily viewed a so demonic by those people.  And now for my historical debate-  how much of his reputation was earned and how much exagerated propaganda by his enemies.  I believe at least some of it was propaganda-it worked as well then as it does now.  I'm not saying he was a misunderstood innocent.  Just stop and look at what a ruler had to face in eastern Europe at that time!Could any of them have gotten anywhere if they weren't brutal?  And I am not saying that he only used violence when absolutely necessary, just that wouldn't any one be a little cold and insensitive living in that environment, under that kind of pressure, fighting brutal enemies? <br>

<br>
Vlad Tepes did make a forest of impaled citizens of his kingdom. However, they were all criminals. Now, whether or not he dined there may be propaganda. The problem with the propaganda theory is that propaganda is supposed to fill the purpose of the person who says it. So if his enemies were saying it, then they wouldn't say he impaled his citizens, but their countrymen, their mothers, their sisters, thus giving the army a personal cause to win a war with the Son of the Dragon. <br>
<br>
Also we have the corpses. 10,000 men and women in around 5 years. Romania's prison's were overflowing before. Then they weren't. An extreme form of capital punishment.<br>
<br>
The true moral question about The Impaler is whether or not the ends justify the means. Crime was almost abolished in Vlad Dracul's kingdom, but did that justify the killing of over 10,000 men and women?<br>
<br>
<br>
Dracula was not a tragic figure. He was mentally unstable, and beyond bloodthirsty. Many kings had successful reigns without resorting to such cruel acts of torture on their own citizens. <br>
<br>
However, he was still a military genius. He conquered armies far greater than his own. But so was Hitler.<br>

When he transformed to young Vlad, he was so irrestible. I could have easily fallen for his seduction.<br>
