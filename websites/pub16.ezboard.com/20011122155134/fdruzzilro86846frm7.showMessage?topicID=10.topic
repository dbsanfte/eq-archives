Again, it is based on &quot;real&quot; events.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Cirrean, Daughter of Cazic -- Part II<br>
<br>
<br>
Fuel for the Fire...<br>
<br>
The return trip through East Karana was fairly uneventful.  Other than having to avoid that meddling paladin Sir Morgan and his pitiful squire, it was a little more than a brisk walk. Cirrean spent a bit of time in Northern Karana, slaying scythe beetles and dispatching the scavenging highland lions that came too close.  Stopping at a guard tower for the night, Cirrean learned from the soldiers that little had changed back in Qeynos.  Not especially eager to spend any more time than needed in the company of the lonely, leering guards, Cirrean wasted little time in moving on.  Once in the western plains, she remembered why she didn't make this journey more often.  It was a long haul by any standards, even for the occasional druid or shaman who had some speed spell.  There were a few passing bards who stopped for a brief chat, but they were usually in a hurry to their next paying gig.  The outline of the Qeynos Hills on the horizon were surely a welcome sight.<br>
<br>
Cirrean's arrival in Qeynos was something less than exciting.  A couple of the Darkpaw gnoll brothers were creating a traffic jam along the main road, so she felt obligated to remove their heads from their hunchbacked shoulders.  The guards, once rather threatening, were amiable enough.  A couple felt the need to whistle at Cirrean, who had stowed her ringmail in her pack in favor of her light violet gown for the remainder of the trip.  This attracted some unwanted attention and a crude proposition or two, but an icy glare was usually enough to stop such juvenile behavior.  As attention went, some wandering eyes did less harm than the attention that the local paladins might pay to an armorclad foreigner.<br>
<br>
It was the lackluster return to the Bloodsaber shrine beneath the Arena that was disappointing.  Kane Bayle was not present when Cirrean arrived, so she decided to pay a visit to one of the clerics near the entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;I understand that Commander Bayle was concerned with the loose tongue of his lover, honored cleric.  Is this still the case?  I had heard that she posed some risk to the organization, if she were made aware of our Lord Bayle's involvement.&quot;  Looking at the man through long lashes and carefully smoothing her gown, Cirrean hoped to find out what sort of reception the commander might offer.<br>
<br>
The cleric was clearly unimpressed, however.  &quot;You ask many questions for someone having been gone so long.  One of our agents in Highpass found the remains of the Clothspinner woman, Milea.  Her sister Nerissa had been snooping around the barracks here in Qeynos, and apparently attempted to contact Milea via messenger regarding something she found.  You wouldn't happen to know anything about that would you?&quot;  The man's gaze was piercing, but Cirrean met his eyes and sneered.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't think there is much to tell you, but I have this to SHOW you,&quot; she retorted, pushing the singed handkerchief in front of his face.  &quot;I didn't even know that I had killed the woman you seek until after she was already dead.  I just wanted a bit of amusement, but now that I know the whole story, I would...&quot;.  Her excited words were stopped short by a mailed hand firmly grasping her shoulder.  Turning on her heel, Cirrean found herself looking up at Kane Bayle.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, our mysterious assassin is a mere girl, eh?&quot; Bayle chuckled, arching an eyebrow as he gave Cirrean a looking over.  &quot;Milea did have quite the fiery temper, so I imagine it was quite a spectacular fight.  A pity that her sister had to put her nose where it didn't belong, and also a pity that you wasted your time.&quot;<br>
<br>
Not especially impressed with the commander's rank, Cirrean hissed a response.  &quot;How is it that I wasted my time?!!  If Milea's sister had successfully contacted her, your secret order here would be exposed!  Trust me, I've seen what they do to heretics in Erudin, and this would be no different.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You wasted your time,&quot; Bayle calmly replied, &quot;because we made sure that Nerissa Clothspinner never sent that note.  I have long been aware of her suspicions, and anyone who has actually agreed to help her has never made it beyond Qeynos Hills!  My men have very clear instructions in that regard.  However, I will admit that you did me a favor.  Milea never would have had anything to do with the Bloodsabers, even though she would have been given both rank and wealth.  While I don't trust you, I see your potential.  Perhaps you can someday hold the place which would have been Milea's, if you earn that trust.&quot;  The words were promising, but Cirrean knew that men like Kane Bayle did not give favors.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am not interested in earning your trust, swine!&quot;  Cirrean flinched as her words echoed throughout the entry chambed, but she ignored the questioning glances.  &quot;I serve Cazic-Thule, not you or your diseased lord Bertoxxulous,&quot; she continued, &quot;but I recognized that you have the makings of a new empire here, one which places strength over wealth and political posturing.  I simply wish for a place in that empire.&quot;<br>
<br>
Bayle frowned for a moment, but then nodded.  &quot;Very well, you decline a place at my side...for now.  However, you still must earn my trust if you wish to stand among us on the day that Qeynos is reborn under the eye of the Plague Bringer.  Go out, and continue to do as you have done.  We will speak again, when that time is near.&quot;  With that, Bayle's mouth formed the words to a spell, and he vanished.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Winding Road to Victory...<br>
<br>
Armed with new spells and supplies, the young shadow knight stormed out of Qeynos, ignoring the fact that the sun was soon to set.  &quot;If I must prove myself to this man,&quot; she thought, &quot;I will do so by utterly slaughtering all who would oppose the cause which I have joined.&quot;  No sooner had the thought crossed her mind than one such opponent crossed her path.  Lashun Novashine, wandering missionary of the Temple of Life...and an apparent religious fanatic, nearly ran into Cirrean as she headed up the road towards the eastern hills.<br>
<br>
&quot;Peace, dark one.  Where are you headed in such a hurry?  You look armed for war, yet Rodcet Nife would have you lay down this tools of death and take part in healing this land.&quot;  She couldn't tell if the gleam in his eye was conviction, or madness.  It did not matter.  This would be a fitting start to her new campaign.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, I am armed for war you fool.  Your precious temple will burn, but you shall not live long enough to see it!&quot; she snarled, unsheathing her sword and pointing it at Novashine.  &quot;Cazic-Thule has prepared a grave for you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Lashun Novashine stepped back a pace, then intertwined his fingers and closed his eyes, inaudibly asking his deity for the means to smite the evil witch before him.  It was not meant to be, though, for Cirrean was uttering the words to her own spell.  Darkness, darker than the coming night, engulfed the priest.  When he reached out his hands to project his spell, the dazzling blast fired blindly into the air.  Cirrean whirled around behind him, blade low.  With a flick of her wrists, the man's legs were cut from under him, but she did not stop.  Moving in front of him again, she laughed as Lashun looked up at her, seemingly kneeling before her.<br>
<br>
&quot;The righteous sons and daughters of Qeynos will not stop until I am avenged, and you know it to be true!&quot; the bloodied cleric said, even has he cried out in pain.  &quot;Rodcet Nife will...&quot; he started, but was stopped short.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh yes, Rodcet Nife shall find his blessed temple to be filled with the diseased and dying! Cazic will drive out the weak in the face of fear, and Bertoxxulous will kill the brave in their beds!  You are a pitiful fool, to think that your own &quot;sons and daughters&quot; are above greed and bloodlust, anymore than the guards who even now stand at the gate and ignore your cries.&quot;  Cirrean was beyond any rationale now, bent only on rooting out the untainted forces of good and leaving them to die before all to see.<br>
<br>
Amidst a growing crowd of horrified onlookers, Cirrean Shadakine drained the life from Lashun Novashine, and then walked off towards the east to continue what she had begun.  In the growing shadows of a nearby glade, a decorated soldier of the Qeynos Guard and a richly dressed Tier'Dal looked on with tight-lipped smiles. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uellixiasundance.showPublicProfile?language=EN>ellixia sundance</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(3/15/01 8:04:35 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Cirrean, Daughter of Cazic -- Part II</span><hr size=1> Keep em coming... <p><font face="Verdana">
