&quot;The absence of fossil evidence for intermediary stages between major transitions in organic design, indeed or inability, even in our imagination, to construct functional intermediates in many cases, has been a persistent and nagging problem for gradualistic accounts of evolution.&quot; Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), 'Is a new and general theory of evolution emerging?' Paleobioloby, vol. 6(1), January 1980, p.127.<br>
<br>
&quot;All paleontologists know that the fossil record contains precious little in the way of intermediate forms; transitions between major groups are characteristically abrupt.&quot; Stephen Jay Gould (Professor of Geology and Paleontology, Harvard University), 'The return of hopeful monsters'. Natural History, vol. LXXXVI(6), June-July 1977, p.24.<br>
<br>
...and also taken from my personal webpage, &quot;Chatting With an Evolutionist&quot; (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.hopeofzion.com/creation/chat.htm)">www.hopeofzion.com/creation/chat.htm)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>Whether an honest mistake or an attempt at sleight of hand to promote their doctrine, errors do occur when studying fossils.  For example,  an error came to light when National Geographic, a well known and highly regarded magazine, recently (10-15-99) published an article on &quot;a true missing link in the complex chain that connects dinosaurs to birds&quot;.  THEN, on 2-3-2000, they printed a retraction (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/events/releases/pr000203.html)">www.nationalgeographic.co...0203.html)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> of sorts when further investigation revealed it to most likely be a composite fossil and a hoax.  Apparently not all fossils are what they seem and beyond being tampered with.  Answers In Genesis have a follow up article (<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/docs/4229news3-2-2000.asp)">www.answersingenesis.org/...-2000.asp)</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--> that you may be interested in.

I believe &quot;transitional fossils&quot;, for the most part, are interpretive.  For example, if a scientist were to find the remains of a platypus in certain strata, it would be &quot;fact&quot; that this was a transitional fossil between ducks and otters.  We know today that, because these animals all co-exist, that there is no &quot;chain&quot; of ancestry.  It's what the scientist <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>wants</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> to see.<br>
<br>
Why do they want to see evolution in everything they find?  Simple, they don't want any sort of accountability.  We are our own gods.  You can sense that tone in anyone who actively promotes evolution.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have to save the earth.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> must protect endangered species.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>We</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> must punish criminals.

<br>
Yes indeed, being responsible for <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ourselves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> is scarey isn’t it..?<br>
<br>
It’s much easier I guess to let ‘God’ take responsibility for everything, even to the extent that we look away (metaphorically, maybe literally if the Christian God actually exists?) while God sends down plagues &amp; a Genocidal flood, or orders the ethnic cleansing of tribe after tribe of people, or makes His personality &amp; ‘morality’ known by issuing a disgustingly inhumane set of ‘Laws’, or prepares to send countless numbers of ‘His children’ to suffer eternal suffering for simply choosing not to believe in (or ‘worship’) Him.. <br>
<br>
Maybe it’s no coincidence that Humanists/ atheists tend to be more likely to worry about the ecology of the planet, or what sort of world we leave to future generations etc, it’s precisely because we see <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>ourselves</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (~i.e. human beings) as being *responsible* for these things, whereas I guess Christians can happily leave the future (&amp; everything else) to God, while many of them are also busy squandering resources &amp; <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>contributing</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> to the mess we’re making of the planet….?<br>

Towelfrood, do you think that this statement is accurate?  I know of no study that would suggest this.  And, if I may, this borders on being inflammatory.  I recylcle, I use organic fertilizers on my lawn and garden, I don't wear fur, I'm concerned about the air we breath.  <br>
<br>
This statement seems to be a departure from the prior style of debate that you had demonstrated here.  <br>

Just my opinion, adjusted for inflation.... <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chargerfan1>Chargerfan1</A> at: 1/21/03 6:30:57 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=towelfrood7>towelfrood7</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 105<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/21/03 2:47:16 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Creation of Mankind</span><hr size=1> Chargerfan,<br>

Yes you’re right.. that was a bit inflammatory I guess ~ I don’t know of any evidence to suggest that Christians are less likely to be concerned about ecology etc than Humanists (infact it could just as likely be the other way around I guess?).. so that was a little rhetorical &amp; splurgey I suppose... ho hum <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Actually there should be great concern over the welfare of the earth on the part of Christians.  It's linked to their judgement.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> - Revelations 11:18<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
We have a stewardship type of responsibility, but it is not exclusively our domain.  There will be a reckoning.<br>
<br>
By the way, you mentioned not knowing of any evidence that Christians should be or are concerned about the environment.  You're not alone.  Most Christians are not aware of this either.<br>

The two topics have little to nothing to do with each other.  Evolution in no way discusses the creation of earth or the universe or of any life.  Unfortunately, Mat4Zion ane I part ways at this point. <br>
<br>
While abiogenesis vs creation is the proper discussion topic, it is not the fault or tactic of science to avoid the discussion.  It is quite the contrary.  It is the lack of pro-creationists who can debate the topic knowledgeably that is the problem.  Finding a scientist who is knows the Story of Creation is far easier than finding Anyone who knows about abiogenesis.  Why does this matter?  Well, I'm a chef and if I decided to try to decide what was better, French or Italian cooking,  I'll take the french side (although I own an Italian restaurant) and my opponent is a patron of my restaurant.  IF in answer to each of my points he says. &quot;I dont believe you, make something I like better than Rissotto di Pesce.&quot;  Will we relsolve anything?<br>
<br>
Saying in answer to abiogenesis &quot; I dont believe you, make something come to life (and even if you do I wont like it more than Rissotto).&quot; Is pointless and precisely why the discussion rarely happens.<br>
<br>
Even Matt4Zion, while being aware of abiogenesis, is under the mistaken notion that it has never been done.  It has.  Granted, scientist didn't create a man, or a beaver, or even a fly in a laboratory.  But they have created self replicating dna from inorganic ingredients - the essence of life.<br>
<br>
Fossil Record:  No paleontologist believes for a minute that a fossil record of every living thing in history exists.  Do you seriously think that the 200 or so types of dinosaurs that we know of were the only ones alive during their time?  The world today, having lost a great deal of land to cities and man, still holds millions of kinds of animals.  We have only a few fossils in relation to what we wish we (or  could have)  had.  It is not surprising in the least that we have nothing that you call a transitional fossil.  The fact of the matter is that the ones we have ARE transitional fossils.  The Theory of Evolution doesn't state that we would have half and half of any animal.  We, all living things, are in a constant state of change.  We, me and you, are a transitional animal.  Some day, man will not have an appendix.<br>
<br>

Ok, you missed the point.   <br>

The point is this, if the public school system is going to teach it as a part of the &quot;facts of evolution&quot; (and they do!) then I insist that you demonstrate those &quot;facts&quot; (which nobody can).<br>

Interesting points.  But, may I ask why you believe that the the fossils that we do have are transitional?

That is to say, that I disagree with your notion that the fossils that we have, say of any sauropod, is a transitional animal.  <br>

Chargerfan.   Lets not be silly.  No one thinks Darwin got it right on the first try.  He laid the ground work for what we call the Theory of Evolution today.  As far as I know, his work did not require the existence of transitional fossils - but even if it did, we now know that evolution is a work in progress - all fossils are transitional.  Just as your remains would constitute a  transitional fossil (remember your appendix).<br>
<br>
Now suppose you are one of those people who believes that evolution happened in spurts, certainly transitional fossils might be possible... but how would you know if you found one?  Knowing that something is transitional requires you to know what came before and after.  So in reality we are not missing single pieces of the puzzle, we are missing the box cover with the complete picture.  Who is to say that a sauropod fossil is the &quot;before&quot; the &quot;after&quot; or the &quot;transitional&quot;.<br>
<br>
The Pre-Cambrian explosion is often cited as proof that evolution is not a &quot;slow and gradual&quot; event.  I have to ask, how it proves anything?  It may well be that evolution can happen in many ways, slow and gradual, or when certain criteria are met, in spurts.<br>

I'm not talking about speciation.  I referring to transitional.  Perhaps from an insect to a mammal.  This would be clearly evident from the fossil record, if ever discovered.<br>

The Cambrian Explosion is in question due to the complex organisms that suddenly appear without any precursors.  That's a problem if you believe that they are derived from their ancestors.  <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

No scientist would ever tell you insects evolved into mammals.  Insects evolve into other insects.  Keep in mind that evolving does not require a greater level of sophistication or complication,  it is simply a change to a more succesful form, sometimes that form is simpler than the original.<br>
<br>
The Pre-Cambrian Explosion is a mystery.  It may simply represent a spurt of evolution caused by a stimulus that we are not aware of, yet.  We cant say what the explosion was or was not.<br>

Prokaryotes.  If they to sit at the base of the family tree, then insects and mammal are different branches.  They may not even have a common ancestor other than prokaryotes!  Why would you expect to find a link between the two?  Insects may have branched off early, while the original prokaryotes continued to evolve and mammals may have branched off later from a form of prokaryote vastly different from when insects branched off. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=chargerfan1>Chargerfan1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/31/03 9:29:46 pm)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Creation of Mankind</span><hr size=1> Sorry, but my last post today, I've got to leave work!!<br>

No, but at some  point a singular celled organism floating in the primordial soup had to evolve into an inverterbrate or a vertabrate.  There should be millions of examples to support this, since all life presumable originated from a common ancestor.  There is none.<br>

You are right in proposing that at some point a single celled animal began evolving, but in no means was it neccesarily a SINGLE single celled animal.  Like the Cambriam explosion, a hereto unknown stimulus may have caused Millions to begin evolving.<br>

A common problem with debating evolution is that one side of the debate doesn't really know much about it.  What you are claiming the Theory says, is absolutely wrong.  Like much of the scientific evidence offered by Matt4Zion with his links, the authors of the pieces know more about what they believe than what they are trying to disprove (which they some how think will give credence to their beliefs!).

<br>
I dont think you have to be an expert to discuss Creationism or Evolution.  But many people have the mistaken notion that they are at odds with each other.  This isn't necessarily so.  Evolution does not deal with the Creation of life.<br>
<br>
Another problem is the terminology, the language.  If you want to discuss the science of either standpoint, you have use scientific terms and &quot;theory&quot; is one of them.  And as a scientific term, it has a distinct meaning.  <br>
<br>
I'm curious... I find that much of Creation proof, is actually trying to disprove scientific knowledge.  Does this seem right to you?  It seems to me that it does nothing to further the Creation standpoint.   <br>
<br>
Earlier someone wondered why atheists feel the need to trot out all the science to refute Creation.  I wonder why Creationists, who have faith, feel the need to try to disprove science?   I addressed the atheists standpoint (you may be surprised to find out that I am not an atheist - it just scares the hell out of me that religious belief's so often lead to one group oppressing another, in the name of GOD!)<br>
<br>
For example, I never discuss (or debate) the existence of God (a God).  I have faith that he/she exists and nothing anyone says will change that.  If people believe, have faith, in creation, why do they attack science? <br>
