Orlando Bloom    <br>

<br>
Mini biography<br>
<br>
Born in 1977 in Canterbury, Orlando Bloom's plans of becoming an actor developed quite early, when he realized that &quot;Superman&quot; Christopher Reeve was an actor. His first memorable appearance, a cameo in the critically acclaimed movie Wilde (1997), earned him - only 20 years old by that time - various film offers, which he all turned down in favour to play theatre for about three years. On stage, he appeared in plays like &quot;The Seagull&quot;, &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, and &quot;Trojan Women&quot;. Peter Jackson then &quot;discovered&quot; the classically handsome Bloom for his much hyped Lord Of The Rings trilogy in 1999. After doing three movies with Jackson, he's worked with Ridley Scott on Black Hawk Down (2001). <br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Personal quotes<br>
<br>
(on salary) &quot;I don't care much about the money at all. Frankly, if I get the chance to kiss someone in a movie, they wouldn't need to pay me at all.&quot; <br>
<br>
On his character Legolas and the way Legolas moves: &quot;Legolas doesn't speak a lot - he prefers to let his actions speak for him. Legolas' moves are smooth and elegant, like a cat. You know how cats can jump and land steadily on their paws? That's what I'm trying to do. There's a strength in that, but it's very balletic. It's also bloody hard to do without falling over!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;It's all very surreal. I've had two very fantastic experiences. In Lord of the Rings and in Black Hawk Down. I feel very lucky. I'm sort of doubly excited.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm rather accident-prone, I have to admit. I've broken my back, my ribs, my nose, both my legs, my arm, my wrist, a finger and a toe and cracked my skull three times.&quot; <br>
<br>
On how he got the part in Black Hawk Down - &quot;My character breaks his back, and I had mentioned I had done that when I was up for the part. Who knows why one actor gets a job and another doesn't? I think it was just good timing that I happened to be there and I had had the experience - I mean, I was lucky.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;I broke my back. I fell out of a window... some friends had a roof terrace on the landing before their apartment, and I fell off the drain pipe. It gave way, actually, and I fell three floors. I was told I might not walk again. So, for about four days,I was contemplating that as a serious part of reality. Then they operated, and I walked out of the hospital in about twelve days.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;Vig used to call me 'elf boy', and I'd call him 'filthy human'. As an Elf, I never got a scratch on me, never got dirty. And Vig would come out with blood and sweat all over him. And he'd say to me, 'Oh, go manicure your nails.&quot; <br>
<br>
On his 2002 Empire Award: &quot;I think my mum will have [my award] in pride of place somewhere beside my grandmother on the mantelpiece.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;We have these digs at each other. Viggo will go on about Elves and how they're always doing their nails and brushing their long, blonde hair, and being all prissy. And I just say: Well, at least I'm going to live forever! Got that? LIVE FOREVER!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;You have to be quite serious about tattoos [because] they're there forever.&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;For a young actor like me to have the oportunity to work with the genre of actors and directors on 'Lord Of The Rings' is unbelievable. There was no, should I should I not. Tt was like, where do I sign up! It was just bonkers. It was like here, have a life.&quot; <br>
