The reason given is that every man except Noah was wicked (Gen. 6:12). Apparently this is good enough reason to kill not only a huge amount of people (including, obviously, many babies and children who could not possibly have done anything wrong) but also nearly all the animals living on land.<br><br>Gen. 19 - God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their inhabitants (which must have included many innocent infants and children). <br><br>Ex. 12 - God kills all the first-born in Egypt. <br><br>Ex. 21:20-21 - God makes it allowable to beat a slave to death unless he dies quickly.<br><br>Num. 15:32-36 - God orders a man stoned to death for gathering sticks for a fire on the Sabbath.<br><br>Num. 16:27-35 - God kills men, women and small children by making the ground split under them. He also kills 250 men by fire.<br><br>Num. 16:49 - A plague from God kills 14,700 people.<br><br>Num. 21:3,6 - God gives the Israelites power to utterly destroy the Canaanites. A few verses later (v.6) he sends fiery serpents that killed many Israelites.<br><br>Num. 21:35 - Another act of genocide, this time it was the people of Og that were exterminated.<br><br>Num. 25:9 - God sends another plague, this time killing 24,000.<br><br>Num. 31:9,17,18 - The Israelites take women and children captive. Later God says, &quot;kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately. But keep alive for yourself all the young girls who have not known a man intimately.&quot; <br><br>Deut. 7:2 - God orders the Israelites to utterly destroy without mercy any people he gives them for defeat.<br><br>Deut. 20:16 - The Israelites are commanded &quot;not to leave anything that breathes alive&quot; in the cities God gives them as an &quot;inheritance&quot;.<br><br>Jos. 1:1-9,18 - Joshua is given God's blessing and permission for the violence and slaughters in the following chapters.<br>Jos. 6:21-27; 7:19-26; 8:22-25; 10:10-40 - With God's blessing and permission, the Israelites kills and &quot;utterly destroys&quot; an enormous amount of people, including women, children and old people.<br><br>Judges 20:23,28 - God tells Israel to slaughter the entire tribe of Benjamin.<br><br>1. Sam. 6:19 - God murders 50,070 men for having looked into the Ark.<br><br>1. Sam. 15:3,7-8 - On God's command, and with his help, Saul &quot;utterly destroys&quot; the Amalekites.<br><br>2.

Also we are talking &quot;humans&quot; and war. Religious wars have occurred all throughout time and look at Ireland even today. Yep, people. Not necessarily the &quot;will of God&quot;.

The author telling the story to get a message across in a manner that people at that time could grasp. &quot;The Wrath Of God&quot; stuff. So sad.<br><br>At any rate (and referring to all the other quotes), the Old Testament is the Book of &quot;Law and Punishment&quot;. Lots of wars and stuff.

Goddesses and good spirits were invited into the circle, which sometimes had powerful, protective stones placed at North, South, East, and West points. Each point was associated with the Four Elements. North was the most powerful direction. It represented the element of Earth, the celestial bodies revolving around the North Star, and encompassed all secrets, darkness, and the unknown. South was the element of Fire and therefore associated with the sun. This point signified the meeting of East and West - intuition, insight, reason, and logic - and the channeling of the powers of intellect, clairvoyance, and nature. East was the direction for the element of Air, symbolizing clarity, spiritual awareness, and mysticism. West represented imagination and inspiration, as well as emotions and reason.

(Or conversely, ‘is Christianity the Bible’)? Does one equal the other?&quot;<br><br>If you are referring to only the Old Testament, no, it does not equal Christianity. Jews go by the Old Testment. Those who abide by the New Testament as well as the Old Testament are Christian. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You ask:<br>&quot;The thing I don’t understand is this: if there is a supreme creator being, how do we know what Her [just to be pedantically awkward &amp; PC!!  ] ‘Will’ actually is?&quot;<br><br>For Christians and Jews at least, &quot;Her&quot; (I don't feel there is a gender either, but Her is closer than Him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) ..... will is written in those Scriptures of the Bible and Torah. <br><br>You say:<br>&quot;If the Bible represents Gods will, then the Jews were acting in accordance with Her Will, as they ethnically cleansed all those cities during the Roman War : arguably, so were the Inquisitors who were so determined to identify ‘sorceresses’ so that they should not be ‘permitted to live’ any longer.&quot;<br><br>Remember there is human factor involved. Humans (presumed by divine intervention) wrote the scriptures and humans fought the wars. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You state:<br>&quot;ask Christians about what the Bible actually SAYS, and they tend (in my experience) to become confused, muddled and evasive, and resort to ‘the Lord works in mysterious ways’ type statements.&quot;<br><br>Yes, there are many Christians who do not know the Bible the way they could. It is easy to see how you would reach that conclusion. However, there are also many Christians that can quote you chapter and verse for about any situation you may encounter. It's an individual thing once again. <br><br>You say:<br>&quot;Either the Bible is ‘the Word of God’ or it isn’t:: if it is then inhumanity &amp; atrocity ARE an integral part of the tapestry of Christianity, and the Jewish nationalists, Christian crusaders, zealous Inquisitors etc WERE doing Gods willl .. if the Bible does not represent ‘Gods will’ then what does? How can we possibly know what ‘Gods will’ actually is?&quot;<br><br>It is all in how one chooses to interpret the scriptures. Some take them literally. Some realize that &quot;Fear the Lord&quot; means &quot;Hold the Lord in Reverence&quot;. Some realize that &quot;Suffer the little children ...&quot; actually means to &quot;Encourage the little children&quot;. So much is lost in the translation of the scripture and the interpretation of what is said. Again, you have human factor involved.<br><br>You ask:<br>&quot;How do we know that [if God exists] that His/ Her word was not actually contained in some of these, now largely forgotten gospels? Some still exist – such as the Gospel of St Barnabas, the most famous I think.&quot;<br><br>Paul, we don't know ... unless we have access to those scriptures not in the Bible and can interpret the linguistics properly. Again ... still ... would we know? I wish I could answer you. <br><br>You say:<br>&quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls also contain zillions (well, okay, quite a few!) versions of Biblical texts, many of which are different and all of which are much older, compared to the versions that appear in ‘The Bible’.&quot;<br><br>That is true. And the Rosetta Stone was the key to their interpretation. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You say:<br>&quot;I simply distrust Christianity (Judaism, Islam etc) as ‘isms’ – as ORGANISED belief systems… basically, I don’t feel they have any basis I’m afraid.&quot;<br><br>Paul, you may just be correct.<br><br>You ask:<br>&quot;were the witch trials simply the product of mass-hyteria and the sexist/ misogynistic attitudes of the time. wipped up by paranoid, reactionary religious institutions … how far has society/ have religious institutions etc really moved on?? Do the same attitudes still exist, but maybe reflect themselves in different ways today…&quot;<br><br>First of all, it could have been a combination of all of the above. Do the same attitudes still exist today? I'm afraid for some ... they do. Sad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>In your next post, you ask:<br>&quot;Anyone heard of 'The Magic Circle' by John Waterhouse? It's a painting of a sorceress drawing a circle in the ground, around a cauldron&quot;<br><br>No, I've not heard of it. It is a lovely painting. Thank you for the link. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>You quoted:<br>&quot;A magic circle was cast to purify and create a perimeter of space wherein evil magic could not enter. Goddesses and good spirits were invited into the circle, which sometimes had powerful, protective stones placed at North, South, East, and West points. Each point was associated with the Four Elements. North was the most powerful direction. It represented the element of Earth, the celestial bodies revolving around the North Star, and encompassed all secrets, darkness, and the unknown. South was the element of Fire and therefore associated with the sun. This point signified the meeting of East and West - intuition, insight, reason, and logic - and the channeling of the powers of intellect, clairvoyance, and nature. East was the direction for the element of Air, symbolizing clarity, spiritual awareness, and mysticism. West represented imagination and inspiration, as well as emotions and reason. The circle itself was a mark of infinity and eternity. <br><br>A witch would cast a magic circle by turning clockwise, beginning at East, following the revolution of the sun. The magic circle was drawn with either a a magic wand or an anthame (a black-handled ceremonial dagger). A charm or spell was recited as the witch cast the circle, asking the presence of friendly or helpful spirits to attend.&quot; <br><br>*** That sounds very much like Wicca to me. It sure does. Wicca ... TRUE Wicca is a wonderful practice and way of life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Paul, as always, I have enjoyed talking ...

WHY did they write them? What did they actually SAY?  Why did ‘the Church’ reject them so completely?  Did anyone believe in them &amp; try to live by them (I know, from what little I’ve read, that often the answer is Yes – people did, inspite of the Church).  Ultimately, is there anything (significant) that distinguishes these forgotten ‘scriptures’ from the writings that were included in ‘The Bible’??<br><br>Obviously, the answers to these questions – especially the LAST one – do come down to perspective – as an atheist/ humanist I’ll have a different perspective to Christians….
