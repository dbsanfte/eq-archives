<br>
It's time for a fun and creative activity where you get to interact with your fellow EverQuest players (while they're not playing EverQuest)  <br>
<br>
I set before you a challenge to take this subject as far off the initial subject as possible!  <br>
<br>
The topic is starting off as dead horses.  I cordially invite you to talk about what is the best class in EverQuest with which to beat a dead horse.  When the subject of dead horses is exhausted, we will need someone to change the subject.  This is the tricky part...  When this gets to about the third page, I will need someone to pick out something small, yet mildly annoying on a post which is on the first page.  <br>
<br>
Skills will be judged on the following:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Persistance-</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How much can you drive a subject into the ground?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Artistic Aversion-</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How smoothly can you twist a subject after it's driven into the ground? <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    Attention to Detail-</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> How well can you nit-pick?<br>
<br>
The contest shall continue onto Friday.  At that time, the winner shall be decided by our panel of judges (druzzil ro staff).  The winner shall earn an esteemed status title in place of that &quot;newbie&quot; or  regular &quot;member&quot; status.<br>
<br>
This is all meant in good humor, so see what fun you can have with it.  I now leave it to all of you, and the dead horses, so take it away <p>Alihja Zanzibar <br>

They have great stats to beat them with, 113 str 105 sta and an 87 agi for when the horse tries to beat back. They have no exp penelty, just the Warrior class bonus. Thus making them level fast, allowing them to raise there skill in dead horse beating fast. People say all the time &quot;Warriors can't solo a dead horse&quot; I beg to differ, with a sow potion and a wieghted axe, I quad kite dead horses. As a matter of fact, once when Dead Horse kiting in CS I picked up a sucky Drooids quad with my own. I with my wieghted axe Kited 8 Dead horses, and finished the encounter with 4 red bubbles of hit points and over an entire blue bub in level 4.

<br>
If you'd stop for one second and quit stomping all over the rest of the classes and the guilds you'd realize that the true satisfaction in this game doesn't come from beating dead horses, it comes from helping your fellow players.  Of course, you're too UBER to even CONSIDER passing the time of day with someone who doesn't share your uber guild tag and you seem to forget that you were once a noob too.<br>

Sk have a nice hp/ac so they wouldn't die right away. As I am swinging them by their feet into the decayed horse I think they would get turned on by the smell of rotting flesh and guts hanging from their helm. Their worthles pet can stand and do that little skelly hackle laugh.<br>
<br>
If it were a dead Clydesdale (budwiser horse) I would have to pick a Barbarian Rogue. I could never understand how these big ass people could hide and sneek so well. Maybe its that bright blue camo paint on their faces. Joo cant see me! standing in the corner of a room with there thumb and finger over your head. I cruch your head! These big oafs would make a good beating stick I am sure their skulls could take it. <br>
<br>
Now. <br>
The best class in game as a matter of fact is cleric. You can not be in a major raid situation without one. You cant feel comfortable in a grouping situation with out one. I have been in many groups and for many nights without a cleric but it always involved looking for one to rez you or someone in the group, sometimes the entire group. <br>
<br>
I know people are going to come back and say Enchanters would be the best class in the game. I would strongly disagre, enchanters just make things simpler. I have not been in a situation where a cleric or another root capable class cant take the mob away and root out of damage range. If its a caster mob or healer simply switch mobs your attacking.<br>
<br>
Ok the spell checker isnt working so forgive my misspelling.<br>

Oh, and for your comment about being able to pull it away and root... bulthar herd leader.  Mezzable, but unrootable and unsnareable.  And better bring a BUNCH of SK's to swing at him too because he's one bad mofo.<br>
<br>
Of course, he's not bad at all to all you uber guilds out there with all your phat lewtz so why don't you do us noobs a favor and come kill HIM whenever he's up so we can hunt the rest of the bulthars in peace.

<br>
Every Dead Horse I have witness being beaten has always been carried in by a Troll. Somehow the Troll seems to be capable of controlling the minds of others, which leads me to believe they must be Enchanters. With this power they then have their newly charmed pets beat the poor dead horse into the ground. Nothing beats a dead horse better than a mob of other players enticed (enchanted?) by a Troll.<br>

A dead horse moratorium. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/umarethskellymasta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mareth Skellymasta</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/28/01 2:44:01 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> PLAY the &quot;Who can beat a dead horse?&quot; contest</span><hr size=1> Sorry Macchin but you failed 3 times at taking down the dead horse, so we went ahead and took him.<br>

<br>
Why do want to beat on a dead horse anyhow? I mean, common...A dead horse!?! Gimme a Frozen Turkey any day of the week, they really need a good beat-down. <br>
<br>
1st...<br>
The Frozen Turkey is far superior in it's &quot;splatability&quot; than the dead horse. Take the inards for instance. Does the dead horse have inards nice and neatly packed in a sack waiting to removed and beat upon? I think not. <br>
<br>
2nd...<br>
The Frozen Turkey is more managable than the dead horse. What if you don't want to beat on it. What if you want to, say, heave it upon the head of a lazy drood as he is making you sick with his quad-kiting, zone farming, and his arrogance. You just can't heave a dead horse...no, the Frozen Turkey is king in the tossing arena.<br>
<br>
3rd...<br>
The Frozen Turkey is the baddest mob in EQ. If you can take down the Frozen turkey you rox. Only my guild has taken down the FT, across all servers. Even Verant has asked us to help the devel team with a new megga-mob. <br>
<br>
and another thing...<br>
<br>
Why is guild XYZ always trying to own the dead horse beating department? My guild went to do the HorsePlane on Saturday and XYZ guild was there. They didn't even have it reserved. So since I had all the guildies together, we weren't going home empty handed, so I log onto my other mega-phat machine and checked the reservation board for TurkeyFrostPlane...it was open. But what do you know, ABC guild was there, they didn't have a reservation for Saturday. I yelled at ABC's Guild leader and he told me to buzz off! So I /petition'ed and got told to buzz off by the GM also....stupid Verant Customer service<br>
<br>
<br>
You all SuxoRs<br>
My guild RoxOrS all of NoratPH .<br>
Can I get a Rezz...<br>
what do you mean 100pp!?!?! <br>
I'm petitioning.....<br>
<br>
<br>
Dead horses....sheesh...those are for wussys.<br>

<br>
Enchanters are awesome at beating a dead horse, this is where we shine.  For example, we cast Clarity on ourselves for mana regeneration, then cast a haste.  Then we use our incandescent wand to beat on the horse.  This is where a lot of players will get confused.  They think the damage is what is important . . . untrue.  One needs to beat the dead horse thoroughly, but not to pulp.  Blood and entrails all over the place is not pretty.  Incandescent wand will not break the skin of the dead horse, yet makes a good thump sound each time it is struck against the dead horse.  With haste, we are able to hit more often.  Plus, when we are low on stamina, we cast invigor from our ample mana supply and continue.  Thus, we complete the job faster and with less mess.  <br>
<br>
An additional bonus is the ability to mezz the horse if indeed it is a monk horse pretending to be dead.  Nothing worse than stepping up to a dead horse, and on the first hit have it pop up at you.  When this happens to enchanters, we cast a stun, mezz and then flirt with the toughest warrior in the zone to convince him to kill the horse for us.  After the warrior kills the horse, then we get to beat the dead horse.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Note:  This is NOT good with Frozen Turkeys.  Tried it and broke my wand!  Thanks a lot for suggesting it!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
