One thing I wish everyone would do is not send me a tell asking for port.  If I'm porting and you do a ooc that you're looking for one, then fine.<br>
<br>
But send me a tell looking for a port and my flat fee is 500pp.  That covers the port as well as being harrased for the port. <p><FORM><SELECT>

You don't like people sending you tells for ports?  Put on roleplaying or anonymous.<br>
<br>
People harass me for clarity, etc all the time as well.  Live with it.  If you are too busy, say so.  It isn't an amazing convenience to type:  /r Sorry, busy right now.<br>
<br>
If you aren't in a group, and can port a person, I don't see why the fares should go up to 500 pp for a port.  That is rediculous.<br>
<br>
As for what I pay, I usually donate 300 mana in enchanter buffs.  If you aren't willing to TP me for that, I *will* find someone who will.<br>
<br>
I know druids solo a lot, and yes, Clarity, Insight, and Gift of Magic will help a LOT.<br>
<br>
If I'm in a good mood I'll donate 35-50 pp.. I've paid 70-100 depending on how soon I want a port. (I'm at KC, I shout for 4 minutes looking for a port.  if I don't get one, I'll offer 70pp.  I usually get about 8 tells within 10 seconds.)<br>
<br>
I've also given 50+ druid spell drops for ports lol.<br>

All I can say is hey we are at the porter's mercy basically wnen you are stuck and need one bad so charge what ya will.

If you are going to a higher zone, usually means that there is more risk involved, most cases thats iceclad ( pain in the ass port, dervishes) but also those are later ports and we wiz / druids (more wizzes <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  like me ) die often and rezzes can be hard to come by and donations help there too.<br>
<br>
As a wiz I do go anon but the damn staff of the wheel sticks out like a sore thumb, hehe. Remember we also need to pay for items, my peridots for manaskin are 10pp per and a normal session for exp is 15 of em. Thats just from bieng blindsided or doing crowdcontrol, not from overburning. And since a normal 4hr session in KC is about 2-3 blu in exp, lvls cost money.<br>
<br>
Like most other wizzes, and clerics I know when I'm in a grp I tend to automatically filter out ooc and yells, because I'm paying attention to grp chat. That and trying to keep a eye on guild chat, so bieng as such it's usually my grp mates that tell me a person is looking for a tp and is offering pp.<br>

Trust me when I say its not worth it.  Unless you really need to get someplace, send a tell to Fizbanic and pay the 500p. Worth every copper in the end. Of course, I have to promise to keep Clarity and Haste on people to get them to group with me, but we're not talking about me here, we're talking about Morathu. Well, I guess we were supposed to be talking about Teleports. Where am I again?  Oh yeah, 10-20 plat is fine, although I am with Tremaile in the fact that a Clarity (and a few other buffs) refresh is more than worth the time/mana used in a port. I'll still offer the 10p, though most say its not necessary after the buffs. As for the out of the way places, well, I am all for capitalism and dont really have a problem with 50p or more for the out of the way places. <p>Tychor Westwinds<BR>

It's like gooing into town and hving every Noob around you begging you for gear or plat.  I bet it gets annoying,  if not tell me what you main is and I'll create a new character that will send you a tell every 5 minutes asking for something.<br>
<br>
Another thing that is wrong with /anon /role.  Doesn't matter if I have it up or not, one look at me and you'll know I'm a druid in all my gear looking like leather I look like either a level 5 character or druid.<br>
<br>
I'm a druid and haven't grouped at all.  Just because I'm not grouped doesn't mean I have to port someone or should even consider it. I'm not there to serve others when they want to go somewhere when they say they want to.<br>
<br>
You play an enchanter,  you cast clarity and sit med and about less then a minute you have the mana that you expended back.<br>
<br>
Say I'm in EW and I port you to WC from a tell you sent me.<br>
<br>
We meet I port you to WC,  then port myself to either IC or GD.  Then have to run back to the EW zone and to where I was camping.  All this is taking me away from something that I was doing.  This is why the fairs are that high, as well as the harrasment.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile You don't have to really go anywhere or waste time seeing loading please wait.<br>
<br>
The reason that you would see 8 tells after stating a price is just this,  all druids that are in zone and see that /ooc Donating for port  are just waiting to see how much you're paying  and then when you said the amount,  we then figure it is worth taking us from what we are currently doing.<br>
<br>
Think its selffish?  yes it is now go bug a wizzy for a gate. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rease,  if I'm in bb and someone needs a port to wc then about 40 seconds, 20 there 20 back.  <br>
<br>
But take my example of ew above and it will take longer.<br>
<br>
I port for 15pp normally.  I'm just saying that if anyone gives me a tell then I'll qoute them 500pp this stops them from giving me a tell in the future. That is the main reason that I qoute that,   <p><FORM><SELECT>

If you don't like the price of a TP take the boat or just use the sneaker express.  Its just that simple and no reason to complin about it.  Wizards do not logon just to make sure everyone has a TP, we like to play EQ too. One bit of advice I can give you all is when in the zone and have room in your group invite a Wizard into your group, that goes a long ways with a Wizard who usually has a hard time finding groups.  I personally TP when I have time and for my friends even when I do not, but I no longer advertise my TP services to a zone for platinum.  The reason I do not sell my TP services is because I am sick and tired of the moaners an whinners that complain about the price of a TP if it is more then 10pp.  Another thing I cannot stand are people who search out porters across zones and then feel you should drop everything you are doing to TP them for 10pp.  I am sorry, but if you are bold enough to search out a Wizard across a zone and expect them to drop what their doing to TP or TL you better be offering at a mininum of 50pp and really should be offering 100pp.  If you think this is to much, then stop sitting on your butt whinning about it and just take the boat or run to the zone you want to adventure in.  Most porters are not greedy and want all your platinum they just want to play the game like the rest of you and not be pestered all the time.  Nothing pisses off a Wizard more then giving a player a free port to DL and then later on going into Karnors Castle and asking that same player to join their group and they reply &quot;oh sorry where not looking for a Wizard&quot;.  All I can say is take care of your Wizards and they will probably take care of you.<br>

Just a quick funny story, in SK yesterday running thru with my necro 18 to grp with a buddy. All of a sudden someone challenges me to a duel. After five tells I get back a response from the 24 mage that he was just looking for a fight, to which I asked If he would like to fight my wiz.He said that was too high and then proceeded to ask for a port. Hmmmm. Offered 5pp, doubly insulted I told him I'd write the donation to charity of my EQ taxes and that it was on the house. Oh well.<br>

I understand that wizards/druids do not play the game to port people around but that is a huge part of your class.  I would never think to tell anyone how to spend there ten dollars therefore I am not gonna tell ya how to play...I will just express my opinions on it. /ooc for a port is acceptable sending individuals a tell in most cases is pretty rude unless they are a friend of yours.  I would say that there are certain zones where sending a individual tell is acceptable considering the amount of people that frequent them i.e. Wakening Lands (why oh why am I bound in Skyshrine) also certain situations (died in Seb, if you could help I would promise many gnome cookies in your future).  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utiberinusmaximus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiberinus Maximus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(5/30/01 12:08:03 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Take the boat if you don't like the price </span><hr size=1> Well, as a wizard there are a few things that I have to say about all of this charging stuff.<br>
<br>
Druids are not the only ones who can port so when you OOC looking for a port to BB and a wizard offers to TL you to Gfay for free, your an idiot not to take it (and should know they are next to each other on the map).<br>
<br>
Seems that druids have big problem with porting lately or they think they are the only ones who can or are obligated to do so, dunno why...maybe they are just grouchy dogs - lol.   (Look at the bright side, we dont have nasty little critters at our TP sites waiting to kill the evil races) Anyway, the new TLs are easy and lower mana than a port and I am happy to do it if you come to me and its a quick thing, will not even charge you for something that simple...may need your help one day too or that buff your class has which helps us (SoW, Symbol, Resolution, Clarity).  Heck, depends on your people skills with many, asking the right way goes along way...and that doesnt mean which channel you ask in (ooc, shout or tell), means being considerate about it and understanding the hastle you may be causing.<br>
<br>
I agree with the &quot;dont send a direct tell unless you have some PP to spare&quot; crowd.  If you have been begging in ooc, trust me, we have all read it already.  Thats just paying for us having to leave the group or stop what we are doing for your impatience.  Dont whine about it, just accept it.<br>
<br>
As for the amount of time, thats the porters call...I can port to DL, but I still bind myself at KC so I can get back real fast if I do have to leave to help someone...<br>
<br>
Last but not least...fell inkies always free. muwhhahaha <p>Tiberinus Maximus<BR>Dark Elf Wizard<BR>Worshiper of Innoruuk</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utychor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tychor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(5/30/01 12:44:45 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fair donation for port?</span><hr size=1> Could not agree more with not pulling a wizard/druid out of a group to do a port. The one exception to this would be if Morathu is in your group.  If he is and someone is looking for a port, then all of his group members should pay the person looking for a port for taking Morathu away from their group. Again, well worth the money, IMHO.  This, of course, only applies if he can get someone to group with him in the first place. Unfortunately, that person is normally me. What I am trying to say is, if you need a port, send me a tell. I'll send you a Morathu and 20p.  You have been warned... <p>Tychor Westwinds<BR>

I have, from time to time, taken an offered donation for a particularly hairy port (CS, for instance), but I never ask for cash.<br>
<br>
However, I also never look for riders and I never respond to auctions.  I port myself around, I port my friends and guildmates around and, when I am honestly not otherwise engaged, I will port some of the folks that ask politely.<br>
<br>
I will NEVER port someone who isn't at a wiz or druid pad (as appropriate) in MY zone or at some other really convenient location.  In fact, I rarely port anyone who isn't standing right in front of me when they ask.  If I'm already on my way to IO from WC, a stop in DL to help out someone who asked courteously isn't a problem.  If I am running through WK and get a tell from some dolt in Tox who needs to get to Freeport. . . well, I hope you have your filter on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

Say you do a Circle of Commons to pick me up at the druid ring (I will never ask for a port if I'm not at a ring)<br>

OMG!  You are inconvenienced less than 200 mana.  You will regenerate that fast enough and enjoy brain buffs from 30 mins to an hour afterwards!!!!<br>

Please do not bitch at me without doing a bit of research please.<br>

I will never send you a tell asking for a port, and I will not clarity you when you ask me.<br>

<br>
I completely understand where druids can get upset o'er port requests. In fact, if I ever have need of port, first thing I do is /who all GUILD. Second, I do /who all friends. Seeing no porters online and NOT in heavy combat zones, I do this... /auc WTB Port to someplace. Payin 100pp.<br>
<br>
Why do I pay 100 everytime I port? Because I am cleric 53. I get paid nearly 100pp EVERYTIME I do a rez. So, I feel it's worth it to me to pay the same for callin a druid outta wherever and whatever they are doing.<br>
<br>
Now, if I am unable to rez or don't wanna be bothered, do I go /roleplay? Nope. I am PROUD of all I have accomplished and refuse to hide my level status. (If any of ya ever see me /roleplay, it's cause roomie stole my character to plvl himself again) Anyway, if I don't wanna rez someone, I put up a specialized AFK. Here it is...<br>
<br>
/afk I'm sorry, but the number you have reached has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Please hang up and try your call again. If you need assistance, please dial 0 to reach an operator.<br>
<br>
Now.. if you send someone a tell and you get that AFK, more than likely you are gonna laugh ya ass of. If you are smart, you will dial 0 and then I will talk to ya. If a person needs a rez near me, and they are smart enough to press 0.... I go rez.  (most times)<br>
<br>
Now, that's my 2cp on how to deal with peeps askin for rez, ports, money, clarity, etc.<br>
