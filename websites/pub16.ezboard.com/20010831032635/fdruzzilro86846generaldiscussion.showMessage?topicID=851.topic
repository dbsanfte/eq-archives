<br>
I come before you today to make a statement about how generally disappointed I am with the people of this game. How very disheartening it is to see people being treated like mere scum by the majority of you who are in the higher levels.... the elite you might say.<br>
<br>
You call us &quot;newbies&quot;, &quot;noobs&quot;, and my favorite &quot;egg&quot;. You ignore our friendly greetings with an elitist sneer, ignoring us and lacking the kindness to exchange a simple greeting.<br>
<br>
You demean our accomplishments because they are slight compared to yours. You stand idly by and watch us die as we yell for help, no doubt laughing at our misfortune. <br>
<br>
You assume we are dolts, you assume we haven't taken the time to do research how to play our class, and how to group. You assume level equals maturity.<br>
<br>
You assume that after we have worked very hard to get a piece of gear, you have the right to procure it from us then sneer at us when we refuse the &quot;going price&quot; for it. Is it not worth more to us? No no, we are &quot;eggs&quot;, we can just get another, and you will grace us with your platinum from on high. The fact we were not selling it the first place was definitely lost on you.<br>
<br>
You take our &quot;mobs&quot;, our &quot;camps&quot; without asking. After all, you are the elite; you deserve your belts and your faction, far beyond us. And if we have the audacity to protest then you &quot;train&quot; us. No doubts because you can’t simply kill us scum directly with your &quot;Wurmslayers&quot; and your &quot;nukes&quot;.<br>
<br>
No doubt there are exceptions, but I wonder if you all think REALLY HARD that you just might find you’re guilty of one of these if not all at some time.<br>
<br>
Bravo Druzzil Ro Community, Bravo<br>
<br>
Perhaps you could extend us eggs a small amount of respect?<br>
Or it that too much to ask.<br>

<br>
You sound like a decent type, but often lower level types can cause higher level types to live in fear of running through areas where lower level types, often making insistent demands.. And it can make things hard for decent types as you sound to be.. Which is too bad. <br>
<br>
I'm not too sure what to tell you really, at any point through the game, you can meet any type of person.. There are good and bad all the way from level 1 to 60. <br>
<br>
But anyways, maybe you just need to find the right area or the right friends.. Maybe if ya let us know your race and class, we could offer suggestions of places that might be appropriate, enjoyable and maybe even safer from the people that might make the game less enjoyable..<br>

In defense of the us 'elitists', I beg your pardon. <br>
<br>
First, (I think I can get an amen from 95% of the people here) if you are a newbie and act this mature within the game, you will get our respect, period. <br>
<br>
The disrespect given to lower levels that you speak of is the apathetic attitude that we (higher levels) have aquired due to non-respect for what we have achieved. If you want to argue this fact, we'll be here for days. But like it or not, your brothern and sistern of imaturity have tainted our view of the lowbies. <br>
<br>
&quot;sow me,plz&quot; , &quot;gimme plat&quot;, &quot;gimme ph4t lewtz&quot;<br>
<br>
These phrases do not earn respect. These phrases are chanted where ever we go. And where do these phrases come from? Newbies. <br>
<br>
Granted, there are bad apples at the top, I'll give you that. But just as you don't want to be lumped into the same barrel with everyone else, neither do we. Most of us have worked damned hard for what we have. Most of us have given time and effort the like of which you have neither touched nor begin to imagine. <br>
<br>
Respect is a two-way street. <br>
Respect is earned, not given away like candy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Grifter, just remember, respect starts with me.<br>

Grifter- eqchip said it, and I find it hard to imagine an 'elitist' would be desperate for anything someone of your level may have.  And if someone did offer you money for something that you werent selling, this is no different than being inspected by 25 low levels in EC or Gfay as we make our way to the bank and harangued for items they didnt work for, or can even contemplate the difficulty behind in getting.  <br>
   Like eqchip said, there are people of both caliber at every level.  I try my darndest not to blame all the new players for the bad manners of a few beggars- and I hope you will excuse me while I run through freeport/gfay invis because I dont want to be harrassed by ill mannered low levels, any more than you want to be harrassed by hi levels.

On the contrary, I feel the original posts was one of the most disrespectful immature posts I’ve ever read, not only because it's inflammatory and based outside the realm of fact, but because it groups a huge number of people into one small category and makes totally false accusations. <br>

<br>
i run around the lo level zones a lot lately for the fact im not up for leveling much, just working on small stuff for resist and all. i try ta help as much really to very, i mean VERY complete strangers in the game, from res, escorti, CR, etc, small stuff.<br>
<br>
but the truth is people(here referred to elite) of hilevel either gained their furtunes on their own, with a guild, or simply bought/ebayed. the fact is they are self sufficient. if u cant do that, then dont be a begger, no ones likes a begger.<br>
<br>
secondly, i know there are many jerks out there, that just sickens me even when i play my alts, these big jerks coming in level way above than they need to be , camping over others, ks'ing, etc. u name it, just shows what the eq community oif d-ro is made up of. <br>
<br>
thrid, to some, this game is a serious game considering people put in their time and effort to: attain their goals, attain friendship, whatever the case may be, they devote their time and patience. its bad enuff the server is getting populated why not just respect each others time, effort, camp, etc. <br>
<br>
anyways, stopping my rant, out ta backstab<br>

And frankly, what he describes reminds me of field of bone.. And recall also that while he refers to people in this game, one must think on his perspective, and what he refers to is likely that which most sticks out in his mind. <br>
<br>
If you feel that he's talking about you and has the wrong idea, which I doubt is his intention, then challenge him to write down the names of who does this maybe get a count of how many people do this and compare it to the number of people in the zone, or do a /who all ## ## and see how many people of that level are on.. I'm sure you'll find that the people that dismay you are far from a majority of players in the game.<br>
<br>
I dunno, it just didn't seem harsh to me, maybe because I know who I am and I'm not one to do things he describes.. When I hear a yell for help in EC tunnel I'll try to attack the first thing I can target running by.. When someone asks for a heal, I'll start using the bandages.. I don't respond to beggars, but it didn't sound like begging.. just asking for respect. I sure as hell never once in my life have intentionally trained.<br>
<br>
Anyways, also think of how often you are in levels these days that you were in at level 10.. And think of the kinds of people that would go there.. Well, that's not representative of the population, so maybe the guy just needs more enjoyable hunting grounds..  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uoogrifteroo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>oO Grifter Oo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/14/01 6:36:52 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: R.E.S.P.E.C.T. find out what it means to me.</span><hr size=1> Far be it from me to paint such a broad stroke, as to assume that all high levels are like that all the time.

<br>
I cannot and will not attempt to excuse the poor mannered individuals. Nor will I dispute that what you have you have earned (of that there is no doubt). Nor will I dispute that you solely have rights to what is yours.<br>
<br>
The point of the post was (and still is) to adjust your eyes downward a bit and to show you that “eggs” are people also. And though we haven’t earned a large degree of respect perhaps we may just deserve a little (also known as common courtesy).<br>
<br>
Allow me to quote Ducet:<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
“On the contrary, I feel the original posts was one of the most disrespectful immature posts I’ve ever read, not only because it's inflammatory and based outside the realm of fact, but because it groups a huge number of people into one small category and makes totally false accusations.”<br>
---------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
I prefer insightful over inflammatory, I beg your pardon for making you look hard at yourself.<br>
<br>
Based outside the realm of fact? No, I listed nothing that didn’t happen to me. And as such that it DID happen, there are no false accusations. I have refrained from naming names only saying that they were part of our server community (which is fact).<br>
<br>
As far as “it groups a huge number of people into one small category” that is done everyday to us eggs by a vast majority of the server population. How does it feel?<br>
Inciting isn't it? Makes you want to tell people about it, doesn't it? Maybe you should post about it? I did.<br>
<br>
I digress, I look forward to meeting you all in game. Hopefully I'll have some fishrolls and malted milk for you. Untill then farewell.<br>

<br>
That’s funny, you did say “How very disheartening it is to see people being treated like mere scum by the majority of you who are in the higher levels.... the elite you might say.”<br>
<br>
You’ve gone past naming names to include “a majority of you…” Quite inflammatory, dontcha’ think?<br>
<br>
You also accuse ‘us’ (high level people) of the following…<br>
<br>
“You call us &quot;newbies&quot;, &quot;noobs&quot;, and my favorite &quot;egg&quot;. You ignore our friendly greetings with an elitist sneer, ignoring us and lacking the kindness to exchange a simple greeting. You demean our accomplishments because they are slight compared to yours. You stand idly by and watch us die as we yell for help, no doubt laughing at our misfortune. “<br>
<br>
I fear that’s also a hasty generalization. <br>
<br>
“And if we have the audacity to protest then you &quot;train&quot; us. No doubts because you can’t simply kill us scum directly with your &quot;Wurmslayers&quot; and your &quot;nukes&quot;.”<br>
<br>
Not only is this particular statement false in most cases, but I doubt it actually even happened to you. I could be wrong, but I can’t think of many places where some disgruntled players would train a level 10. Its really not possible in any low level dungeon… <br>
<br>
Anyways, Grifter, It seems to be that you may be bringing this onto yourself. You don’t seem to be respecting anybody in these posts, just whining and making broad generalizations that not only disturb, but also are false in a basic way. I agree, as in life, some people aren’t very nice, lack social skills, or are all together selfish. This is not the case with most people as you may think. People do not target you because of your level. You are not being abused by everybody. Inconsiderate people exist in EQ as well as in life. You might have to deal with them in both relms.<br>

<br>
I don't know how the word, &quot;newbie&quot; got to be known a bad word (along with the other creative spellings it has).<br>
<br>
<br>
For me, that FIRST day of EQ was spent with 80 other people (most of them L33t&quot; now) In a crowded newbie zone fighting over moss snakes.  I thought that was stupid, so I parked myself off in a corner and flipped to 3rd person view to check out how cool my character looked while it was casting spells.  I discovered that the guards did NOT like me to cast spells on them, and I learned quickly to move my attack button off of &quot;a&quot;.<br>
~~  Oh, look, it's my guild trainer!  Maybe he has a quest!&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;H.A.I.L.&quot;-- - LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br>
<br>
Those beginning days of EQ were spent fishing on the docks in Erudin to make plat to pay for level 8 spells, (They cost 4 whole plat!)  I stood there watching that boat go past (when it wasn't broken) and wondering what the land next door was like.  Now people <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.rutabaga-paradox.org/slacker.html"> ask for plat </a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> like it's no big thing.  <br>
<br>
There are a lot of people within the game who are more concerned with levels and loot, and don't spend much time enjoying the road.<br>
<br>
I hope you all enjoy the road.  It's magical and seems to wind on forever.  <br>
<br>
That's all I have to say for now...  &quot;N00bz&quot;<br>

<br>
If I'm collecting CB belts and lower lvls show up to get exp, I leave 'em the camp.  If it's already camped, I find something else to do.  <br>
<br>
I've never trained a single person intentionally, and never ran a train thru another group.  I've never zoned a train without warning, even when warning meant I had to stop and almost die while typing it because I'd forgotten to set a hotkey.  <br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure what lvl range you are talking about as high level, but I can tell you a lvl 50 player cannot create a train in a lower lvl area or dungeon without individually smacking each mob in the train, in which case they will not agro on anyone else unless the trainer zones them (or dies) and their are people sitting at the zone (or near where he dies).  The only exceptions I can think of on that are some of the kunark zones where lvl 20 Goblin will still attack a 52 warrior for no good reason heh.<br>
<br>
I've never not returned a greeting, I'm even polite when I tell beggers &quot;no&quot;.<br>
<br>
I've never watched anyone die, I've always tried my hardest to help if I hear someone yell, and even stop to ask people if they need help when they look to be in trouble.<br>
<br>
I'd never heard of an &quot;egg&quot; until I read your post.<br>
<br>
I've never considered &quot;newbie&quot; to be a degrading term (I considered myself a newbie up until my warrior hit 50 and my mage hit 40, and I still feel like a newb most of the time hehe).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say we think we can procure an item from you and sneer when you refuse the &quot;going price&quot;.   I can't think of anything I would possibly need from a lower lvl, and I've never asked anyone to sell me a piece of equipment that I didn't see them auction first.<br>
<br>
I wasn't even rude to the lvl 6 Paladin that tried to invite my warrior (when he was lvl 40) into a group and then insulted and slammed on me when I tried to explain that he would die where I was going (Mistmoore) and would not get exp grouped with me.<br>
<br>
Yes there are players like the ones you describe, but I do not agree with you about them being the majority.  They may be a majority *in certain zones* but they are not a majority on the server by far.  EC (and your reference to belts led me to believe this is the zone youw ere having problems in) is a horrible zone to judge the server pop by.  Trade scammers, begging alts (chars created simply to beg), ebayed characters and people simply looking to cause problems hang out there a lot.  I'd strongly suggest the Orc camp in WC, Crushbone, WK bandits or other places to hunt if you're bothered by actions like you described, cause quite frankly, you will see a lot of it in EC.<br>

Consider things in this light: That being a TRUE newbie (A) on a server that has been active for however long it's been (year or whatever) would be different than for being a (B) newbie on a server that started within the last month or less..<br>
<br>
What people would start new characters? Lets just generalize and say there are 2 catagories, people playing for the first time with nothing to equip their characters with and people starting new characters (regardless of reason).. People of the latter catagory often have available (regardless of their choice to use it or not) equipment to give their new character a better start than their first character.<br>
<br>
Now let's expand on the equipment situation. First macroeconomicly.. As the server ages, more and more items have enterred the economy.. The demand for things become less as the practicality of better things becomes better.. Fighting batons for monks which used to be permacamped in Dalnir and sold in EC when you could find a seller for 1k+ pp now are rarely camped, and I think that if you can find someone to buy em you might get 300 pp. Rare drop robes from dalnir's? Where they used to be 5-6k pp, you probably can't even sell em anymore.. Heck, if you go through uper guk will you even keep mesh armor any more?<br>
<br>
So, on a microeconomical scale what does this mean? Well, it doesn't mean too much for the TRUE newbie.. they're probably going to be just as unequipped, barring the generosity of someone who otherwise would probably destroy mesh armor or fine steel weapons, as they're likely to be unable to gather up 10 pp total in their life till they're about level 20. On the other hand, consider the newbie alt who now can have better equipment passed down to him..<br>
<br>
Now lets consider where do newbies come from.. Given the two sources, after a game comes out sure lots of people buy them.. When a game that used to be $50 is being sold for $10 though, why do companies do that? Well, because the business case has been satisfied to pay off the development costs, etc, and every piece of software sold now is basicly making more profit for them.. and in order to further increase the volume, which also had tapered off and likely is probably near a standstill (perhaps they have inventory that they just want to move out and selling for $10 is more profitable than destroying it).. At any rate, Kunark was good for bringing new players in, Velious was to accomodate the growth of the upper level population.. There aren't so many true newbies.<br>
<br>
So, now, think about what would make someone want to make a newbie other than a new customer, such as Mr. Grifter, who is a rare entity. Generally, it'll be someone who expects to enjoy the lower levels more than the upper levels.. Kragstomper, Ducet.. I think I at least a little bit know you guys or the guilds your in.. They seem like a good bunch of people, you folks probably really enjoy the game. At the higher levels, who wouldn't? The most exciting things in the game are things like planes and dragons, things which verant designed to encourage a really rewarding feeling from teamwork....<br>
<br>
But as to who would create a newbie, I'll just call them twinks.. Maybe some people might actually start a new character and not equip it, but I'll use twink anyways just to have a sucinct distinction from someone who just bought the game...<br>
<br>
The twink will be someone who is not enjoying the high level game. The nicer ones will probably be the ones who are just frustrated or maybe just want a break.. There probably wouldn't be as many, these people most likely eventually would go back to their higher level characters.. Some might just be on for comunication during a wipeout. Some might be trying to get another character of another class on a second account.. This type won't be newbie level too long. <br>
<br>
Then there's the reasons that probably come from people who aren't so nice... Most generally the people that are out for themselves, who maybe have or had higher characters that didn't enjoy the game because their loot-whoreness made them a reputation and they couldn't get the things they wanted or they were dispised everywhere they go, and that made it less fun... Or there's the soloing people who never got to join in on the best things in game that can't be done without a lot of cooperation..<br>
<br>
Now, since we can see how the lowest level range might have become something more difficult to enjoy for the true newbie, also think of how the twink's life might affect the higher-level folks ability to cope with them.. Still, though, most of us of the higher-level range will still at least try to be polite and maybe even help out if one is not demanding.. <br>
<br>
Well, not sure what to say past that.. anyways, good luck bud, I've rambled on long enough for now I guess. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unorykoangelcry.showPublicProfile?language=EN>NorykoAngelcry</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/15/01 9:56:27 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: R.E.S.P.E.C.T. find out what it means to me.</span><hr size=1> I think there are many good points brought up here.<br>
<br>
While I do feel that there are many higher levels that are rude, there are an equal amount that are good. You can't just put us all in the same boat here, that isn't fair. Many of the reasons you find high levels looking down upon the lower levels is that the lower levels are just alts of some middle level character, trying to get some free stuff to better equip their mains. I don't believe in begging(for the most part. . SoWs for corpse run, etc. . those I feel are ok), and thus, I don't believe in giving out, EXCEPT when I want to give away things. Having someone send me a tell asking for free stuff will almost always get them a 'No' as a response. But if I see some low level character struggling to fight, and I take pity, I  might give him some pp, or some armor or a weapon.<br>
<br>
I often find myself going out of my way to ress someone, who could be either a good friend, or a complete stranger. I am not talking about going across the zone. . . I am talking about going accross the continents or world. I was in EC, and went to WC to meet a druid, who then ported us to Iceclad, where we ran around for about an hour trying to find his corpse. He finally found it, and offered to pay me. I figured, why take the money, this is only a game. He could keep it and get some better stuff for himself, so I turned his offer. He seemed shocked at this, and I told him I never accept money for resses. He was shocked again that there were Clerics out there that give free Resses. I laughed cause I thought it was funny. Clerics with their 'ress sticks' charge more then most clerics without them. I find that pretty funny, because the Epic Weapon gives FREE / Unlimited casts of the highest level ress. WHY I ask would you charge. . you should be grateful you got the help to get it, and should give these resses away.<br>
<br>
Now, these were just a few examples of things that have happened to me. I will state that there are good seeds and bad seeds, both in the high end game and the low end. It sounds to me Grifter that you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. I have a great deal of friends in this game, and almost none of them have ever been rude to me, even before I called them friends. If you stick it out, you will find some good people, and hopefully, you won't have to wait too long =)<br>
<br>
Good luck in all that you do Grifter(and everyone else)<br>

<br>
If you are lvl ten and have the cash available only to a lvl ten, trust me you arent buying the stuff a 50+ has to sell. I destroy more loot than a ten can afford.<br>
<br>
I also have made full sets of banded for youngin's free because I felt like it, or if I was playing a alt and a character needed , then I'd relog make and tell.<br>
<br>
Taking players back to sk because they forgot to bind and then binding at gypsies.All free and the list goes on.<br>
<br>
But the point is, it takes me ( I know it varies but a average) of 2hrs at a good area to get one damn blu bubble. I have over 60 days played on one character, I know I know that above the ave  but it was the first char I did and I am good in a lot of trade skills.<br>
<br>
I never recieved any powerleveling, rezzes, etc except from people of my own level.<br>
<br>
Lets put it into perspective its like having Joe Smo come into a master jem cutters office and ask for him to put a engraving on a gumball ring....for free.<br>
<br>
If you need advice , visit the boards. If you need a hand tell in OOC and more than likely someone will help you. If you need to aggravate someone, no matter how nicely worded or how educated you are...do it on your own time.<br>
<br>
Now that I've said my peace, hope you all have a nice day , a good weekend and may all your quest camps spawn in the first 5 min.<br>

<br>
Sadly to say, theres a lot of dorks who play EQ. People who base their RL ego on a &quot;game&quot;. Those are the ones who feel because they are level 50+, invested 100 days+ in to EQ, and have some nice loot that it somehow means you, the newbie, is a second class citizen, and they, are somehow a better person than you. Theres a person behind every 'toon, and often in this anonymous world it allows their dork-ass self to become something mighty and powerful and treat others like the way they get treated in RL.<br>
<br>
Its pretty pathetic to be quite honest. I guess in anonymous situations-pseduo worlds like EQ is when its a true test of character. Yes, the character behind the 'toon.<br>

<br>
Having said this, I see it if I can do it why not others?  Why should I be harrassed to Pl others?  Or provide PP/Ph4t lewt?<br>
<br>
When I level,  I always head to the nearest newbie zone (not meaning new to game, but low level area, just easier to say), and celebrate by buffing the lowbies there.  <br>
<br>
Yes, there are going to be bungholes anywhere you go in life, there is no avoiding it.  Eq is not immune to them.<br>
<br>
You say &lt;You ignore our friendly greetings with an elitist sneer, ignoring us and lacking the kindness to exchange a simple greeting.&gt;<br>
<br>
Until you reach a high level and after 1000+ requests for pp, equipment, or power leveling.  You Cannot begin to understand or even comprehend the attitudes the others have towards lower levels.  These requests usually come after a friendly greeting.<br>
<br>
I can show you how it feels.  I can just spam you with requests all day asking for things,  then maybe you begin to see.<br>
<br>
I don't know where you're fighting but when I was growing up, there were always high levels coming around and buffing me up without me asking.  They were kind to instruct me about my class or what armor I should keep an eye out for and the general prices.<br>

<br>
I remember being a newbie, and it was most certainly the best time I spent in EQ <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    I made some stupid mistakes, but I never expected anything from higher levels... The first time I sent a tell to a high level was to ask for advice concerning specialization... at level 30.<br>
<br>
Most newbies (and I'm not saying all newbies) just take it for granted that high levels are supposed to help them. That's wrong. Two days ago, I parked my main in field of Bone for 3 hours, with the AFK tag on my head... I mean, I was really afk. Man, i wish I had taken the log. I think I got about 100 tells asking for buffs, sows and stuff. I just looked at the screen from time to time and was amazed to see all these people just standing before me and saying &quot;sow plz&quot;. I think high levels are more often annoyed by newbies than newbies are annoyed by high levels...<br>
<br>
Jerks? I have met a lot. From level 1 to level 60. Stupidity and lack of respect has nothing to do with level believe me. And, as far as i'm concerned, every time I played my alts, even at level 5, I have never experienced such a behavior as the one you're mentionning. I haven't died once in EC because everytime I ran to the tunnels one of these &quot;arrogant&quot; high level was here to kill the mob that was chasing me... Not talking about all the free buffs i got while I was soloing in South Ro from these high levels camping the AC.<br>
