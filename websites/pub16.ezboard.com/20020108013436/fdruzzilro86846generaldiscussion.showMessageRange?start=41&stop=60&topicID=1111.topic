I started this game 6 months before it hit beta.  My main is a level 200 Warrior that has been in full planar armor since a month before they invented the planes, but I can't play him anymore because he is so powerful that Verant won't let me log him on since I solo'd the Sleeper a year before Velious was released.<br>
<br>
I currently play 18 characters, the lowest of which is level 75, because I am so much more uber than you.  I actually invented the term uber (34 years before German was a language) to descibe myself as a method of distinguishing me (who knows everything about everything in this game) from you (who think you know something about something, but don't because I know so much more than you and you can't possibly have anything intelligent to say about it anyway so shut up)....and n00b, and egg....and every other EQ term that you think you can use just because you understand what it means.  You can't.  Only I can because I know the STORY behind the terms I invented, so stop using my words you friggin moron. <br>
<br>
n00bs like you make me sick.  By the way, I will be out of game for a while since I lost my french fry making job because I stopped going to work 6 months before Beta came out so I could play EQ 24 hours a day and now I can't pay my monthly service fee.  Luckily I don't have a girlfriend to spend any money on, so I think I'll be back online soon if I can remember where my front door is and go outside and collect cans to sell.<br>
<br>
So all you people with your n00b ideas and your complete lack of EQ knowledge, shut the hell up and listen to the only person who ever played this game that knows anything about it...ME.  The best class to beat a dead horse is a dead druid.  After all, no other dead class can charm dead animals as effectively as a dead druid, after which, the dead horse can be beaten on by as many other dead mobs as the dead druid sics the dead horse on.<br>
<br>
The fact that you didn't know this proves how n00b you all are.<br>
<br>
Fourteenyearold Dropout<br>
Level 102 Monk<br>
Level 99 Enchanter<br>
Level 99 Necro<br>
Level 97 Cleric<br>
Level 96 Warrior<br>

Level 95 Mage<br>
Level 93 Wizard<br>
Level 88 Ranger<br>
Level 88 Shadowknight<br>
Level 85 Bard<br>
Level 75 Rogue that I just started today<br>
And I don't play a Paladin because only dumbass n00bs play Paladins. <p>Phread

I'm totally offended of some peoples cheesy remarks!<br>
Do you guys not realize that their are 19,500 dairy producer/members<br>
 in 45 states in America, and maybe a small percentage<br>
 of them do not care to drag their<br>
work home with them and just want to play everquest<br>
and read these boards.  I know if I was one of the <br>
loyal cheese makers  in one of 33 manufacturing plants<br>
in 15 states, I'd be offended of all this cheese talk!<br>
<br>
And for the loyal members of DFA (Dairy Farmers of Amer.)<br>
who can not get enough cheese..I think the only other<br>
class that could take a dead horse (other than a paladin) <br>
would/will be a Cheese maker...WHICH...we will see in the <br>
new expansion Shadows of Luclin.  The only races available <br>
to this class will be the Omish or Quakers. Needless to say<br>
I'M VERY EXCITED!<br>

Unfortunately you don't see the other side of the story, what about all the people playing Everquest that could not play Paladins due to some defficency in their moral fiber.  How can you justify your constant and mindless as well as vicious nittpicking at a class of people that has a problem that could not possibly be their fault.  I can not believe that such people as yourselves can feel justified and good about being who you are, you are just a bunch of horrible, mean, and untidy Pallybashers.  I just feel sick thinking that players like you are out there.  When the GREAT CREATORS at Verant designed the game they were of such character as to place the class of Paladins in the game, the defenders and paragons of virtue, for some people that want to personify that kind of person in the game to have an outlet for their personal state of greatness.  But NOOOOOO, you all have to nit pick the class with demeaning situations like beating a dead horse.  I personally feel disgusted that offensive and racist people such as yourselves play a game that can be graced by the greatness of Paladins.<br>

What ya gonna beat it with, the duck staff? No, you gotta beat it with something, stern and sturdy, and rough and mean and vicious, because they're mean, they're mean and they're dirty, and they gotta be punished!!!! And Whom do ya get to beat this dead horse with as it lies there laughing at the Necro-duckmaster, or the Bard can't-sing-a-song-if-his-life-depended-on-it-dancin'-around-pretending-to-be-singing?!?!...why it's a warrior, a gruff, anxious, weighing-800-pounds-from-gear-and-weapons, because that's what they do. They carry stuff, and they take hits from stuff, and they hit stuff, hitting stuff with some stuff sometimes. And where do they put all this stuff??! They put it in their backpacks, 8 friggin' backpacks. When's the last person you've seen carry around 8 friggin' backpacks??!?! A WARRIOR!!!!, That's who!! Because you can't get nuttin' done without that midget, pint-sized, eat anything in his path, green-skinned, trashcan wearin', take no caca from dragon, or beast, or brownie, or butterfly!!!!...That's the deadhorse beater!!!! And let me tell you this my interesting Judeo-Christian-friends, not only does he fight, and carry 8 friggin' backpacks, while takin' a foot up the keister from a hillgiant_01 as his corpse swears revenge, he also stops and bandages that same dead horse he's been beatin' this whole time...*cough*... <p><HTML>

... this one time, at EverCamp?  I grabbed a flute from a bard and then I....  <br>
<br>
<br>
... walked around a newbie zone and punched a bunch of giant rats ...  and they chased me?  And then?  I ran around some more, proclaiming that I was the pied piper...  <br>

... and then? I remember this one time at EverCamp?  Gordon said that poisons would make rogues into &quot;the necromancers of melee&quot;  - HEEEEY!  I almost forgot about that, because when he said it, I laughed so hard that I fell off my chair?  ... and then I hit my head on my chair?
