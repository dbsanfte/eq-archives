I personally don't believe that there is one Angel of Death, or that they are the cause of your death (as in sands through the hourglass etc), but I do tend to lean towards the idea of a spirit arriving as you die to lead you through into the next life. It's also a classic catch-22 situation, to prove that there is life after death you truly need to die, if you are dead you cannot prove your theory and it doesn't matter anyway.  <p><html>

<br>
Wow! I was just doing more research on this very subject!<br>
<br>
I have to agree with torn prince and midnight vampiress on this one.  I had a similar experience with a being who calls himself Azrael... and although muslim literature names him an angel of death, he was a very human jewish priest.  The study became so intense and there was so much material to share I ended up putting it on a website.<br>
<br>
Spiritual contact affects us each in deeply personal ways... but we do have to be careful of our own ghosts.  Religious programming, political propaganda and personal perceptions of the same, sometimes have us name something before we've even asked a question.  Thats why spiritual communication can often be a maddening experience... it's hard to tell what's real, when current realities are challenged.<br>
<br>
If it's an experience you can't seem to get past or let go, you might want to open a dialogue by asking questions and just wait out the answers... they come out eventually. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udrakewick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>drakewick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(5/18/02 9:24:32 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: the angel of death</span><hr size=1> one question I propose to all is how do you all know what the angel of death looks likes?

<br>
I've covered the first book, which he authored himself, the second which twisted his story and laws, the third and fouth books which the Christians made up to promote Christianity by using his name, the bit in the merkabah that associated him as an angel, the bit in the koran that accused the jews of calling him &quot;the son of God&quot; and I'm closing in on the editing process used when the muslims went to war with the jews and re-named him an angel of death.<br>
<br>
Ironically, although the muslims still bash jewish doctrine, they still refer to him with the PBUH line (Peace be unto him).<br>
<br>
This dude was human... but as anyone knows, some good wine and alot of table gossip blew his story way out of proportion... politics finished it... same bullshit, different day, that's all folks.<br>
<br>
Some people like darkness because it hides the flaws... and in the case of naming Azrael as an angel of death... there are a ton of holes in that story!  Political propaganda and religious bias were all factors to the legend... and you do know how it was actually &quot;told&quot;?  Good, righteous people are treated nice and comforted... bad people are ripped to shreds... I can't believe people buy that stuff in this day and age.  I suppose in another 2500 years people will think Jesus Christ used to climb down people's chimneys and leave alot of presents.<br>
<br>
But this story got so melded, it's taken me 2 years of solid research just to find all of it's pieces! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukrazymusicman.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Krazy Music Man</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/14/02 6:26:20 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: angel of death</span><hr size=1> I get the same felling around my wife lol<br>

I like your style.  The bottom line though is that heaven and hell take up the same space... the magic key is your perspective... which do you choose to see?<br>
<br>
Most people really don't know any better, but judging from their books (which are a complete mess), that doesn't surprize me.<br>
<br>
You can't even see death... it's not a person.  It's just a door-way... no different than birth.  And I ask you, do you really want to go back in time to fish up those memories?  Yuck!<br>

You write: &quot;A spirit claiming to be an angel isn't that uncommon.&quot;<br>
<br>
snip<br>
<br>
What is even funnier though is when an spirit is mistaken for an angel<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Such is the case with Azrael... and Jesus Christ for that matter.  Did you know they were both written as the son of God?  Both were ressurected from the dead to become a &quot;sign unto their people&quot;.  This type of fiction was a popular theme for the time... a reality the church does not want anyone to know... so they hid away all the stories that named other religious leaders.<br>
<br>
It took me quite awhile to get my hands on the piece that transformed Ezra (human priest and scribe) to Azra-el, son of God (bene Elohim).  I finally got hold of it through the Muslims.<br>

But, yes, I do laugh when I see angels portrayed in the pop-gear... wings and harps or now, black robes and scythes!  The funniest of problems I've encountered during my research was a dispute over the naming of angels.  The other laughable problem is transliteration of names.  For instance, do you know that Azra, Ezra, Esdras, Uzayr, and Ophelia are all the same word (Hebrew: help) and that adding the &quot;el&quot; to the end of one's name was just the Hebrews way of establishing the equivilent of the Christian's version of sainthood?<br>
<br>
But the one most important thing to remember is that these religions were insecure amongst eachother... and were competing heavily for public audience.  Just keep that in mind when next you read about the parting of the red sea or death riding upon his horse to apocalypse and all that... they are no different than your grandfather's fishing tales!  Doesn't mean dear ol' grandad never went fishing... but it does imply that he may not have caught a whale<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Besides, life is far too short to get caught up in the politics of competing religions and much like watergate... it all comes out in the end.  This business about heirarchies and offices wreaks too much of current politics and I wonder how people don't see the resemblance?<br>
<br>
Anyway... just my humble input<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
The Ancient Egyptions believed that when you die the god Anubis escortes your 'soul' to the place of judgement. <br>
The Grim Reaper is said to do the same, therefore the angel of death/grim reaper story is probably based on Anubis.<br>
Why he would be kneeling at your bedside is beyond me.<br>
<br>
You said you were not asleep, but had just woken up. This makes me think you may have seen a Night Terror. People see night terrors when they are not fully awake, but not asleep either. <br>
They can see the room around them, but also the creatures from their dreams, just a thought. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uruthupton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RuthUpton</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i><font size=1 color=#FF0033>Ruthless ezOp!!!</font></i></span><br>  Posts: 4027<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(9/29/02 8:59:54 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: angel of death</span><hr size=1> I have had some dreams so vivid that it is hard to believe they were just dreams. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p>Ruthless<br><br>

IN MEXICAN AND OTHER HISAPNIC COUNTRIES....DEATH IS PICTURED JUST LIKE THE GRIM REAPER BUT HIS CLOAK IS EITHER COLORED RED, BLACK, WHITE, OR GREEN.

<br>
I've just checked that out (fortunately Google lets us have pages translated).<br>
<br>
I don't think it's surprizing that LA SANTISIMA MUERTE emulates the Medieval Christian platform considering that LA SANTISIMA MUERTE was adopted with it.<br>
<br>
In other words, LA SANTISIMA MUERTE is not their own - it does not pre-date their conversion to Christianity.  It was an influence of it.<br>
<br>
It's amazing!  The study I'm conducting.  I am told by so many people that they are aware of, and not prone to, political manipulation, religious programming and commercial marketting, and yet, despite this assurance, I find many people &quot;under the influence&quot; of these methods.<br>
<br>
When I was a child, I used to love an old fable called &quot;The Emporer's New Clothes&quot;.  In this story, a deceitful tailor convinced a king that he was wearing special clothing that could only be seen by people of intelligence.  The word spread throughout the kingdom and because no one wanted to be discovered as stupid, everyone went along with it!  All but one child, who cried out in the procession:  &quot;Look!  The King has no clothes!&quot;<br>
<br>
I would like to believe what is convenient.  That we don't have to be responsible people, we can mess things up as much as we want, because a &quot;hero&quot; will come one day and put everything right for us.  But I don't buy the convenience of that thought - and it's a crime... the messes our ancestor's left for us to deal with.<br>
<br>
I have traced the story of Azrael and found what I expected.  A simple man who made a bold move to better his people.  His name and identity have been stolen to promote the ends of others, so many times over, it's sickening!  Fortunately they have kept their records!<br>
<br>
Those records explain why intermarriage was not allowed (how this story became corrupted to the level of angels mating with women... God only knows)!  It reads quite clearly:  &quot;Now,  after these things were done, the princes came to me  <br>
saying; The people of Israel,  and the priests, and Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands, doing according to their abominations,  of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.  For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their sons, so their holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of the lands:  yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass.&quot;<br>
<br>
The &quot;holy seed&quot; was contained in men!  The story I read about the fallen angels came 500 years later.  The part about angels having wings came in the 10th century ad, because one artist was inspired by a statue of the Greek Goddess Nike.<br>
<br>
Today, Nike is a sneaker and angels are seen everywhere wearing wings.  At a rate of just a penny a head per buyer, boy would that look good on a spread-sheet!<br>
<br>
Selling fairy tales is easy!  I mean just check out the herd instinct.  But it may pay to check out the whole story!  So Azrael gathered the dust for the creation of adam and therefore was made the angel of death.  Even the encyclopedias will tell you that!<br>
<br>
What they won't tell you is that the story was written by the same (12th century ad) author with two entirely different outcomes.  In version one, Azrael fails and God had to get the earth himself.  In the next version Azrael succeeds and is made the angel of death.<br>
<br>
Why two different outcomes?  Because the original version was written by a Christian heretic named Marcion in the year 97 ad.  He wanted the early christian church to turn away from the Jews and is responsible for the division in testaments (old and new).  He believed that an evil angel was responsible for the creation of mankind and that the angel was hostile to God.<br>
<br>
Plagiarism at best describes the work that followed.  The Tales from Masnavi which details the two versions of the story.  Azrael had to fail in the version that was presented to convert the Christians, because they were familiar with Marcion's verdict.  But Azrael could be useful in a story that was intended to convert a Jewish audience.<br>
<br>
It's all politics and the power of numbers.  Every group had a &quot;testimonials&quot; page to sell their concept (just like most advertisements) and no testimony was more valuable than one who had converted.  A repsectable Christian or Jew, who converted to Islam was a priceless win.  And vice-versa... three ways!<br>
<br>
As these religions compete for the global title, they will tell you anything, promise you anything... and if that doesn't work they will threaten you.  So, you have to ask yourself, while starring in the eye of the dragon... what will you do?  Admire the King's new clothes like good cattle?<br>
<br>
Story time is over... and a new world awaits.  Are you ready?<br>

If you saw a Medieval hooded executioner then this image probably best matched an inner qualm you had at the time.  <br>
<br>
An actual, literal angel of death is a bit difficult for us to imagine because, as with Santa Clause, it'd be just too damned busy to be everywhere at once.  And yet, as a convenient way to think of it, and as a subjective experience, it makes sense to us on some inner level.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't dismiss it, but I also wouldn't worry too much about it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.showMessageRange?topicID=3.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.showPrevMessage?topicID=3.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.showNextMessage?topicID=3.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.emailToFriend?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.threadControl?topicID=3.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=3.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm71">Promote Your Board<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm76">SHOWCASE FORUM<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">New Age<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm79">Technical Help<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm74">Admin/Mod Contacts<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm72">Staff Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesadministrationnoticeboard">Administrators Only<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm70">Recent Spam Posts<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm73">Admin Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm81">The Dungeon</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm76>SHOWCASE FORUM</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.co.uk">Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM RECREATION AD SCRIPT -->
