<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> My complaint about that KSing uber guild</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
I may be risking my life by telling you this, but that KSing uber guild is -- and I say this with no intended disrespect -- brazen. By way of introduction, let me just say that certain facts are clear. For instance, that KSing uber guild's acolytes are cut from the same mold as pugnacious polemics -- and that KSing uber guild knows it. If it were up to that KSing uber guild, schoolchildren would be taught reading, 'riting, and racism. That KSing uber guild is the lineal descendant of the smut peddlers who nailed Jesus to the cross. Now, I could go off on that point alone, but it just reported that the Earth is flat. Do you think that that's merely sloppy reporting on that KSing uber guild's part? I don't. I think that it's a deliberate attempt to move increasingly towards the establishment of a totalitarian Earth. I must emphasize that that KSing uber guild says it's going to make us dependent on insidious vermin for political representation, economic support, social position, and psychological approval any day now. Good old that KSing uber guild. It just loves to open its mouth and let all kinds of things come out without listening to how asinine they sound. I hate having to keep reminding everybody of this, but I try never to argue with that KSing uber guild, because it's clear it's not susceptible to reason. <br>
<br>
You might object to my claim that that KSing uber guild has been willing to sup with the devil every time it felt it could profit personally from it. But bear in mind that life isn't fair. We've all known this since the beginning of time, so why is that KSing uber guild so compelled to complain about situations over which it has no control? This is not a question that we should run away from. Rather, it is something that needs to be addressed quickly and directly, because if that KSing uber guild continues to play the blame game, crime will escalate as schools deteriorate, corruption increases, and quality of life plummets. That KSing uber guild's mentality reminds me of the stereotypical bureaucrat who cannot function unless he can &quot;find it in the manual&quot;. There, my ranting is finished.<br>

November 30th,2001 I got a voicemail from AT&amp;T Broadband that my cable internet service might be turning off in the next few days... I thought okay that is cool I suppose so long as it isn't tomorrow I just had $800 worth of software auctions on eBay end (around 11pm EST)... I am tired so I go to bed... I get up and click my Internet Explorer icon... finding page... ooooohhhhhh sheetes~ go over to the cable modem thingy... all the lights are on it should work... DNS host not found call AT&amp;T Broadband your service is gone we don't know when it will be fixed but we are working on it... yay now how am I gonna email these people... Tuesday after work (I get out at noon on Tuesdays) hey lets go and get SoL says a friend of mine I say &quot;Sure why not!&quot; I buy my copy and I know that my PC is the bare minimum to run SoL... install SoL... try to play the Tutorial cause I need an EQ fix and I saw they updated the graphics for that too while it was installing... card not found... dangit been 4 days with no EQ and I can't even play the dang tutorial... grrr... so I go online between classes and find out that my MB can support 256 MB more RAM and a 2x AGP card... I go to pricewatch between classes.. it is now wednesday and I buy a geforce 2 card and a stick of RAM and pay for 2nd day air from California... Thursday my Internet is back online YAY! I send out a mass email to all my auction winners about what happened they are all cool with it... I get home early on Friday... no UPS man... Tuesday this week I get an email from the company I ordered the stuff from your video card is out of stock and we are going to send you your RAM tomorrow... I say WHAT! damn them *grumble, grumble* (begin to think I will never get to play EQ again so I give them a call and say hey what is up I need this video card now and can you send it today and not tomorrow? They say sure and now I have a UPS tracking number too =) my new video card and RAM are within 15 miles of my house and I am not at HOME NOOOOO (I hope the UPS man will come around when I am home after 5) which really sucks cause I think I am on a business route and will probably not get my stuff until Monday at the latest and today at the earliest GAH it has been way too long I need to play EQ =*( gonna go sit at my desk and cry now cause dangit I been without EQ for 12 days now!<br>

<br>
I go read the wizard msg boards on a daily basis...and what do i see nearly every day?  A post on how wizards just arent what they need to be, why they are nerfed, or generally useless.    There are points i agree with and some i just nod my head to.  My biggest gripe, is that IF im ever looking for group(lfg), i always get asked for a F***ing TL/TP somewhere.  I didnt come to a zone for XP to port you.  Sorry.  The money makes no difference, its the time...why would i run to, say seb, just to TP you?<br>
  <br>
Also, the balance of casters vs melee's.  What is up with that?  There is definately a big difference between them.  Thats not just my gripe, its a wizard community wide gripe.  <br>
But im sure every class feels they are underbalanced.  <br>

(See that familiar?  Yeah, his name's not Gonaner or &quot;a snow bunny&quot;.  I'm a frickin' wizard, you idiot!)<br>

/rude to all the n00bs who walk around EC tunnel asking &quot;Can you spare a few plat?  I need to buy my spells&quot; while they're wearing 4-5k worth of gear.<br>
<br>
/rude to all the players who think that Bulthars in Cobalt Scar can be quad kited, then they bring them up to the plateau to ask for assistance.  &quot;Shure I'll help you.  (mems Gate)&quot;<br>
<br>
/rude to everyone who whines about the moderators on this board yet makes absolutely no effort to help out in any way with all that it takes to run this site.<br>

Gawd, I could go on all day.  I'll wait until my level of stress rises back up again.  (This thread has reduced it dramatically <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) <p>Amankhann

My last day on that message board was yesterday.  I have never in my life seen such a bunch of whining assholes.   (I hope this constitues a whine).   All they have been doing is pissing and moaning about The Grey nerf - as if one group killing 60 mobs was really balanced.   /eyeroll<br>

I will however whine about TLs/Ports - Why in the hell cant I port/tl people to the damn MOON!   I bet the wizard spires would be a little less crowded where you have to /tar nexus scion to even target his ass. <p><img src=http://www.scourgeofshadow.com/images/tib_sig.gif >
