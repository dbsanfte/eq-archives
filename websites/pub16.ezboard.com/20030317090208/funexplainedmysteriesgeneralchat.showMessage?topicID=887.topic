Reg had motor neuron disease and couldn't do anything for himself....his wife agreed to go with him and be by his side.<br>

This is very close to home for me, he lived just down the road &amp; my mum-in-law helped look after him whilst he was getting respite care in the local hospice.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of people are treated to death by sympathetic gp's every year under the blanket of 'pain-relief', loads of people have dnr (do not recussitate orders) officially &amp; unofficially applied in hospitals, rightly and wrongly in some cases. I feel it is a basic human right to be able to end suffering in this circumstance and I thought the Diane Pretty case was an apalling miscarriage of justice. I hope the police are gentle with Win &amp; just go through the motions. Their resources could be far better employed.<br>
<br>
My nan has been dying from cancer for the last few months. she's 94 &amp; has said all her goodbyes &amp; put her affairs in order, she's immobile &amp; incontinent, but in no pain. She's still got all her marbles (compus mentis) &amp; has now started refusing food. As she is in no pain whatsoever, she can't be filled full of morphine &amp; has been left by the medical services to waste away despite her wishes to have an end to it all. She is costing the health service thousands of pounds a week to keep her alive &amp; has lost all her dignity.<br>
<br>
If I make it to 94 &amp; I'm in the same way, I hope to god that the law has changed by then, for the sake of my family and society in general.<br>
<br>
edited to add, just heard that Win has decided not to return to the Uk for a while, don't blame her really.<br>

<br>
what happened to diane pretty after the hearing.....? Did she die in the end?<br>
<br>
I also hope they change the law soon and let people die with dignity and no pain.....hope they leave Win alone too....I should think she's sad enough to loose her husband this way without the police questions.<br>
<br>
One consellation is that your gran is in no pain but only a very small one. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree with the right to go with dignity.

Wavy, I know where you are coming from.  My mother and I watched her father die slowly from Parkinson's disease.  He got to the stage where his throat muscles disintegrated and everything had to be pureed to prevent him from choking.  then, the 'other end' went and he could not pass his bowels unaided.  It was a very upsetting, undignified end. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

There was a pro-life woman on the radio tonight spouting off about how the 'handicapped' were in danger of being killed willy nilly because of this sort of attitude.<br>
<br>
Think she should re-examine her use of language before coming on the radio again.<br>

<br>
And I agree, up to a point, with assisted suicide. I just think that the assistants should be specialists, not physicians. A doctoris sworn to &quot;First, do no harm.&quot; I want to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
I have read,but cannot cite a ref, that because AS is legal in then Netherlands, some doctors have taken to assisting problem patients, including those who interfere with golf games. I do not know if it is true; I don't want it to be.<br>

<br>
I'm old fashioned enough to believe in a person's spoken word being meaningful.And I don't want that person to have a thumbs up/thumbs down choice.<br>
If someone wants his life terminated, then it should be done by someone with adequate training, but NOT a physician.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that Kevorkian was NOT a practicing physician.<br>
