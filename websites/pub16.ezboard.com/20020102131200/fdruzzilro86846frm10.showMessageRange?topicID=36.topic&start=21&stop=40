it would be their priviledge, out of the goodness that has defined the positive aspects of the US govt that all men shall be innocent until till proven guilty, that all men are equal, that all men/ and women of course shall have the right to liberty, LIFE, and the pursuit of happiness&lt;&lt;&lt;<br>
<br>
As nice as this may be, try telling that to any other government on this earth. Trust me, their response would not be pleasant. Do you really believe other governments want their citizens to have freedom of religion? The right to bear arms?<br>
<br>
Also, as a general statement to the other posts on this thread:<br>
<br>
I think some people are under the mistaken belief that the US is about to undertake some sort of &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy in Afghanistan. I have a very firm belief that we will be targeting only those assets deemed critical to the Taliban and Bin Laden himself. Will there be civilian casualties as a result? Definitely. However, I guarantee you the US military's response will be infinitely more focused than, let's say, a couple of civilian airliners crashing into skyscrapers filled with people who were only trying to live their lives in peace.<br>
<br>
War sucks, and it is horrible that we are even put into a position of having to defend ourselves. However, now that we are, we should take care of the situation quickly, decisively and with the mindset of minimizing civilian casualties.<br>

<br>
From your writings, you are squarely in that group.<br>
<br>
I can name a ton of people that I know a lot about, but really don't know their exact whereabouts.  Hell, my own brother, who just left me a message, is somewhere in New York.  I could tell you pretty much his entire life story, but I couldn't direct a taxi to pick him up where he currently stands. . . <br>
<br>
I'm not being hypocritical when I see death as caused by hijacked planes being smashed into buildings full of innocents as being different from a just war in retaliation.  Perhaps I'm a bit stilted on this point, but at least the folks that may, if we get into a bombing campaign or a ground war, that get killed will have been by accident (i.e. we won't be aiming for them) and because they couldn't clear out from a stated war zone.<br>
<br>
I'm intrigued by your assertion that the wars I mentioned included an entire country.  During WWII, the vast majority of the Japanese people had no real idea how the war was going, what their leaders were allowing to be done regionally and how that was percieved on a global scale.  In short, we weren't at war with the entire country of Japan as many of the people there would likely have balked if they really knew what was up.  How was that a more just war than this would be, as you imply?  If the government of a nation acts, then the nation acts.  If the people are not behind the government, then THEY must act to counter it.  If they don't then they are behind it by default.  In this case, there's an extra layer in that the govnerment is harboring criminals that we are after, but still, the conclusion is the same.<br>
<br>
Read the papers, brother.  Hundreds have already been arrested, and hundreds more are on the lamb.  We ARE clearing out or at least trying to find terrorist cells in America.  Don't suggest that we need to complete that job before we start looking elsewhere. . . <br>
<br>
Actually, I appreciate that you recognize my humor in spite of my soap-box proselytizing.  I am funny, but please don't hold my looks against me in this conversation! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Now, for extra added amusement, please search out the exact place where you read something I wrote that justified this statement:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> P.S. When the woman that is holding a child is of no threat to you, is it ok to shoot em? That's the anology, becuase that's what you're advocating. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
But let me also respond with this.  If that woman and her child were standing in front of Adolph Hitler in 1937, and you knew then what you know now, would you risk killing them to kill Hitler?  (I know, I'm breaking a cardinal rule of debate by invoking Hitler, but it's a fair analogy in this case) <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

Many are being released because America has NOTHING to hold them on.  Also, the people they are rounding up are only people of Middle Eastern descent.  Didn't this also occur in WWII?  America began rounding up any and all people of Asian descent and placing them in concentration camps.<br>
The terrorist I'm talking about are American born and breed (i.e. the bombing of the federal building in ... damn I can't remember the state.  This is the incident that they van was fulled with explosives.).<br>
<br>
Now I'm no pacifist by any means... hell I practice Muay Thai, so fighting to me is second nature!  I'm just saying that I wouldn't agree with the bombing of Afghanistan to kill a small number of terrorist.  Does this also apply to the American terrorist as well?  What if they found a large cell of terrorist in Maine?  Do we blow the hell outta Maine?  Do we then just justify that act by calling it &quot;collateral damage&quot;?  Of course America would take a group of soldiers inside Maine and get em that way.<br>
<br>
As for the Hitler question... yes.  I'd take the shot.  But this isn't the same is it?  Blowing up 100 innocent people to kill 5 isn't acceptable to me, especially when America has been training folks to kill for years.  I just don't want the life of innocent people lost because my country got gun-ho.<br>

<br>
I think a country can be greatly strengthened when they are united behind religion.<br>
<br>
I think the right to bare arms shouldn't be a right at all.  It should be reclassified as the responsibility to bare arms.  There is a huge difference.<br>
<br>
Here is another question for you:<br>
<br>
On the 11th after the shock finally set in and you weren't terrified for your life, what question came through your mind first?  How do we make these terrorists pay? or How do we help those suffering as a result?<br>
<br>
The latter came through my mind.  After donating both blood and money to a country I don't live in, I feel that I have helped the best I can.  I have no plans to strike back at the terrorists.  An eye for an eye doesn't work for me.<br>
<br>
Those are just my 2cp, and I pray for those who suffer losses, those who have wounded pride, and those who stand in the warpath of the American Killing Machine.<br>

Did or does the US government violate privacy laws? Does it at times deal with unsavory individuals to obtain it's objectives? Sadly, the answer to both of these questions is probably yes. <br>
<br>
Are you naive enough to think your government is any different? Is wherever you live some kind of eutopia where no corruption exists? If you are honest with yourself, the answer to this would be no.<br>

Two weeks after my 14th birthday we were evacuated as soon as we got the news that Kuwait had been invaded. My father, an Air Force Captain, had to stay in Riyadh. Less than three months later we were back in Riyadh. A month after we had gotten back my mother returned to the US to take of my sick Grandmother. My father showed my brother, who was 12 at the time and I how to wear gas masks and chemical suits.<br>
We still attended school and one day my friend brought some pictures her father had taken of the aftermath of the Invasion. They are still in my head, I will never forget them. Families in their cars burned to death just because they were on the road that day. Infants were in those burned cars, kids my age burned to death.  <br>
In January of 1991 the scuds were launched. My brother and I hid in my parents bedroom that my dad had sealed up with torn up trash bags and masking tape. My father told us to put on our masks and not to open the bedroom door for anyone not even him no matter how he yelled until the bombing stopped and even then we had to be absolutely sure it was safe. The house shook with every loud bang overhead and my brother and I were crying.  After everything calmed down hours later we were allowed to go back to our rooms to go to bed, needless to say I could not sleep. My mother called a few days later and told my dad that her mom had died.<br>
A couple of weeks later,we were evacuated. My brother and I sat in the barracks, near the airfield with other dependent families, waiting for the plane to get a flat tire fixed and heard the military radio scream yellow alert. It was another scud attack. One of the men went outside with his gun. One stayed inside with his in front of the door. We were told to huddle on the ground in the barracks, and not to get up. We were told that anyone that tried to get in would be shot no questions asked. The same went for anyone trying to get out. My brother and I sat on the floor with my friend, her little brother and mother. I began to realize that if the plane wouldn't have had a flat tire we would have been flying when the scuds and patriots were in the air overhead. <br>
My mother picked us up at the airport the next evening and cried. Every day my mother watched the news, waited and cried. My brother and I knew that we might not see our dad again. <br>
After the fighting had ended and some of the troops went home, we went back to Saudi. Cars were checked for bombs before entering the walled-in compounds where people of many nationalities lived. My father checked the car for bombs when we went outside the compound to go shopping before we were allowed to leave the stores. A couple years later, A small compound called OPM-SANG was bombed. Some of my parents friends worked there. Then, Khobar Towers in Dharhan was bombed. I returned to the US in 1995 for college while my parents remained until 2000.<br>
10 years later, I feel like I am in my parents bedroom again, crying and shaking in fear. But this time, I have nowhere to run to.<br>

Nods, I agree with kill the person behind NYC-WTC. Wholeheartedly. But the point of my post was just a reminder of sorts... what it is that will start up.. if we do go in with our guns blazin.<br>
<br>
Most of us that play EQ are actually people.. sittin at a computer in a dark room with ashtray full and o'erflowin with cigarette butts, 50+ soda cans on the floor next to an o'erfull trash can, 5 or 6 plates stacked haphazardly next to the computer case, and about 100 lil tiny pieces of paper with notes, locations, passwords, and a thousand tiny scribbles of things we don't wanna forget. Most of us are real live human beings.. full of pride, prejudice, love, and sense of self worth.<br>
<br>
Finally... many of us... I'd wager about half.. have been in the military.. have seen what happens when people fight. Not just on the news. All of it.<br>
<br>
It's those people I speak of when I beg caution from our leaders before they decide to start up a war, scuffle, or even tumble in the hay, with another land or country.<br>
<br>
Am I this freaky word ya try to call me? Pacifist? I don't think so. I'm all for bombin the remains of some asshole off the face of the planet for DARING to shake up my sense of security in the United States of America. I just beg caution.<br>
<br>
Lil story, if I may? Not that ya have a choice. I am human and I am in the above described room, typin.. and you can't stop me.<br>
<br>
Anyway.. I was in that foreign country that I wrote about in my first post. The only part of that post that did NOT apply to me was the fact that I have never seen a weapon used on another person. I thank God for that, every day.<br>
<br>
When I came back to America and I touched that lovely soil that we so proudly hold as ours, I thanked God for allowin me to come home to a land where I did NOT have to worry so much about what the plane o'erhead was gonna do. I was SAFE. I was on AMERICAN SOIL. I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I WAS SAFE. I've always firmly believed that nothin can TOUCH ME as long as I was in MY UNITED STATES of AMERICA. I... WAS... SAFE, damn it.<br>
<br>
(Laugh at that, if ya want.. but I am only human. I have my own fears and scary monsters in my closet... and I'm quite sure y'all got yours, too)<br>
<br>
Then.. Torf comes home from work early, wakes me up and pulls me to the living room to watch the television. Tis about 11am... Sept 11th. I will ne'er forget it.<br>
<br>
Why? Because MY UNITED STATES of AMERICA was no longer safe from the plane flyin o'erhead. MY HOME was threatened. The soil that I knew as my haven from the evils of the world was no longer safe. The ground shook, buildings fell, and many died. MANY.<br>
<br>
Now... am I ready and willing to head back o'erseas to kill some asshole who DARES to take that away from me? Most assuredly.<br>
<br>
Do I want someone in another country to feel as I did on Sept 11th? HELL NO. Why? Because it hurts. It brings tears to the surface of a face that does NOT like to show weakness by allowin them to flow.<br>
<br>
So, when ya sit there, in ya own dark lil room... remember.. yea, we owe someone a lot of pain.. but we need to try to contain the amount of pain we bestow.. for someone else may have the same feelings that I do.<br>

If your still there, you asked for what you got. You want to know what though, the Terrorist would find it pleaseing to see a woman and child, its an easy kill. We are not Terrorists. As for the Drug war and the Crime war, lord knows we ain't perfect down here, but we try, and we have the balls to try it. As for blowing the shit outta Maine, if we found terrorists in Maine, no, I wouldn't advocate bombing them, sending in the Natl' Gaurd yes. I don't Advocate bombing Afganistan, I think its a waste of bombs. <br>
   Bush had the American people behind him on day one, and if he had wanted to we could of bombed any country he told us to on the 12th of September, and they would still be <br>
counting bodies. We didn't. They our taking there time, and trying to the best of thier ability to figure who is at fault. I don't really know what else to say, we have to agree to disagree. America was blind, they opened our eyes, they should have known with our eyes open, its alot easier to aim.<br>

So all of you can cease with the &quot;lets bomb em back to the stoneage&quot;, or &quot;no evil bombing campaigns&quot; bullshit that some of you are rambling about. <br>
<br>
Right now we are conducting an operation to get Osama Bin Laden and to exterminate his terrorist camps. This is being done by our special operations personnel (both people on the ground and air support). Both U.S. and British special operations units are on site now and have been for some time. This will last until we capture him, kill him, and determine that we have dealt his terrorist operations in Afghanistan a mortal blow. We are going after the ferret and his nest at the moment. For the first time in quite a very long time our special operations community has been un-muzzled. You may be surprised at what these people are capable of doing now that they have been allowed to do what they have always trained so hard for.<br>
<br>
As for what happens next I do not know? My guess is that the war will then be directed at nations which are known to sponsor terrorisim. These nations are Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Iran, Algeria, etc. How this will be done I dont know? Also it becomes tricky at this point. I'm not sure to what level this war will be waged? I do think that President Bush and his people are building up a coalition that will last the duration and be able to support and stomach a conventional war against the above mentioned countries. What do you say to a nation like Iran that has in the past solidly sponsored terrorists but now wants to try and get away from that past? Or do they? I fully believe and feel a conventional war against any nation which sponsors terrorism is just and right. You wage it as you would any other war, you go in and seek to destroy their military, government, and industrial sectors. You reduce their ability to wage war, or in this case their will or capability to sponsor terrorism. Thats what it takes to secure your safety, freedom, future of your nation and civilization. Its been done in the past when nations were threatened, its time to do it again.<br>
<br>
Many people here like to view these Islamic radicals as some sort of holy supermen. I think thats BS. They die like anyone else. Momar Qhadiffi was a very resolute anti-western radical. His main occupation was running Libya and supporting/waging terrorism. This was back when all the dance clubs in Europe were getting bombed and the Pan Am flight went down at Lockerbie. When Reagan bombed him he stopped. Wheres Momar now? Olive vendor? Camel jockeying across the Sahara? Sure it took a near direct hit to his house and the death of his daughter, but nontheless he shut the fuck up and promptly made a career change. Thats what it takes folks. A very mean and resolute retaliation. <br>
<br>
What the terrorists did was a clear and unquestionable act of war. With 5,000+ dead theres no question of that. You can bet your bottom dollar that there will be more attacks of this magnitude. It may be attacks at infrastructure next time, but regardless it will be of great magnitude. So you have a choice. Do you cower down, hope the next attack doesnt get you, and maybe our politicans can parlay with these devils? AKA the the Neville Chamberlin method.  Or do you engage in a military campaign to exterminate your enemies, enemies which have clearly demonstrated they will give their lives to take yours, your family, and your way of life.. I dont know about you all, but if someone on my block murdered my family I'd kill the one responsible without a second thought.<br>
<br>
I also think this has the potential to get extremely ugly. /predictions on .. I predict that after some time is put in to the Intelligence gathering effort we will see that support for Osama Bin Laden and anti-western terrorist organizations ran MUCH deeper in the islamic world than we had originally thought..../predictions off ... And we may even be suprised to find out that some of our &quot;friends&quot; actually were quite friendly with Bin Laden as well. This has the potential to become very nasty, especially if such support turns out to be widespread and deep it could be likened to a conflict between culture and civilization in a sense. The war on terrorism could easily turn in to a war against the middle east, or the arabic nations in general? It could be done, but it would definitely be a step up from what they are envisioning now. Who knows whats at the bottom of this pandoras box? Time will tell.<br>
