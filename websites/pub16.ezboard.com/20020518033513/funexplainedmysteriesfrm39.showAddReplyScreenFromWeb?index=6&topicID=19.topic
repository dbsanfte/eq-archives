I've been doing about the Scrolls &amp; the origins of Christianity.  Sorry it's very long .. I had fun doing it anyway!<br>
<br>
______________<br>
<br>
It’s my (totally biased!) opinion that, when they are <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> finally</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> fully translated &amp; published, Christianity will have lots of questions to answer .. <br>
<br>
Well, my belief is, the NT was basically simply an attempt to Romanise Judaism, to provide an alternative (Rome friendly) alternative to it, in fact.  After all, most of the NT was written by ONE person (Saul/ Paul), and  written either in Rome itself, or in large provincial cities within the Empire.<br>
<br>
That could explain why the Jewish Rebellion &amp; catastrophic Jewish-Roman war are completely ignored in the NT, despite happening slap bang in the middle of the period the NT supposedly ‘describes’, and to the very people who were @ the heart of the OT story ..<br>
<br>
Following their discovery in 1947, the religious authorities sat on the Scrolls for almost 50 years, refusing to publish them, or allow independent researchers to access them. It was only when the University of California (I think?), furious at the attitude of the religious authorities towards the Scrolls, went ahead &amp; made public its entire collection of copies of the Scrolls (which it had been given as an insurance, should anything happen to the originals) that the contents of the Scrolls eventually saw the light of day. Why? Why the apparent cover up?<br>
<br>
The Scrolls date to exactly the time that Christ supposedly lived, and exactly the same part of the world (they were found in caves near Qumran, on the shores of the Dead Sea).<br>
<br>
Much of what they say is also spookily familiar .. they mention a messiah (called the Teacher of Righteousness) who ends up being put to death by the Romans, they belive they are ‘fishers of men’ ~ meaning that they are trying to recruit new members to their community/ their cause.<br>
<br>
They also believed that they were forming a ‘new covenent’ with God (also, supposedly the whole point of the NT, and of ‘Christs’ time on earth):<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;The Damascus Document speaks firstly of a remnant of Jews who, unlike their co-religionists, remained true to the Law. A 'Teacher of Righteousness' appeared among them. Like Moses, he took them into the wilderness, to a place called 'Damascus', where they entered into a renewed 'Covenant' with God. Numerous textual references make it clear that this Covenant is the same as the one cited by the 'Community Rule' for Qumran.&quot;<br>
- Baigent and Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Another example:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;As with Christianity, members of the association envision themselves as entering a new covenant with God, truly fulfilling the old Mosaic convenant. The charter calls this new covenant variously the Covenant of Mercy, the Covenant of the Eternal Yahad, the Eternal Covenant, and the Covenant of Justice. Believers are presently living in an era when Satan (here called Belial) rules the world. The New Testament terms Satan 'the Prince of this world.' Ultimately, that fact explains why believers, who know and live by the truth, have such difficulties in this world. Believers are Children of Light, nonbelievers Children of Darkness - terminology also used in the New Testament. Among other names, the association calls itself 'The Way' (i.e., 9:18 ), a self-designation that some of the first Christians also used (Acts 9:2).&quot; <br>
     - Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, Jr., and Edward Cook, The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation (1996) p. 125 <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
The problem (for Christianity) is, these are not peace loving, ‘Christian’ (in any sense) type believers, they are zealous Jewish nationalists, committed to overthrowing their Roman oppressors. They believe their messiah will be reborn &amp; lead them to bloody victory over the Romans.<br>
<br>
Here’s a couple of quotes about this:<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  The last scroll […]  is called the War Scroll. This scroll is a manual for the messianic battle - also called the &quot;End of Days&quot; that was expected by the Qumran sect. Simply put, it says that a battle would lead the sect to victory. The forces of good and evil and in heaven and earth. The day came when the Romans invaded Judaea which signaled the &quot;End of Days&quot; but the sect had lost.<br>
<br>
A theme that is displayed in this scroll is depicting angels as warriors. The most important angels that were to fight in this war were Michael, Gabriel, Soriel and Raphael. Michael was the leader of the angels. He was dubbed the Prince of Light. The sect was dubbed the Sons of Light and the scroll stated that they would win. Their enemies were dubbed the Sons of Darkness and they were to lose<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;Both the Gospels and this scroll presuppose that during the age of the messiah, the dead will be resurrected, either by God himself or through his messianic agent. Yet nowhere in the Old Testament do we read of this belief.&quot; <br>
     - Michael Wise, Martin Abegg, Jr., and Edward Cook, The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation (1996) p. 420 <br>
<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
..and a quote about this from the Scrolls themselves:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> &quot;The Heavens and the earth will obey His Messiah, the sea and all that is in them. He will not turn aside from the commandment of the Holy Ones. Take strength in His mighty work, all you who seek the Lord. Will you not find the Lord in this, all you who wait (for Him) with hope in your hearts? Surely the Lord will seek out the pious [Hassidim], and will call the righteous by name. His Spirit will hover over the poor; by His might will He restore the faithful. He will glorify the pious on the throne of the eternal Kingdom. He will release the captives, make the blind see, raise up the downtrodden. Forever I will cleave to Him against the powerful, and I will trust in His lovingkindness and in His goodness forever. His holy Messiah will not be slow in coming. And as for the wonders that are not the work of the Lord, when He, (Messiah), comes then He will heal the sick, resurrect the dead, and to the poor announce glad tidings. [...He will lead the Holy Ones, He will shepherd them. He will do...and all of it ...]&quot;<br>
     - The Messiah of Heaven and Earth 4Q521 Frag. 2 + Frag. 4 2.1-14<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
There were lots of Jewish sects like this at the time, and lots of ‘messiahs’ (Christs) .. the result was the Jewish Rebellion, and all that followed from there (ie over 1.5 million people dead, and Jerusalem destroyed)<br>
<br>
So, is it just coincidence that so many details of what the Qumran community (Jewish nationalists) believed are so similar to the ‘Christians’ described by Paul? Paul would certainly have known about  the Qumran community.. one scroll (the Copper Scroll) gives the locations of large amounts of hidden valuables, which the community had secreted away, ahead of the coming war with the Romans ..<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;The 'Copper Scroll' lists huge amounts of gold, silver precious objects and at least twenty-four scrolls within the Temple. Directions are given to sixty-one different caches; the following are typical of listings:&quot;<br>
     - Christopher Knight &amp; Robert Lomas, The Hiram Key: Pharaohs, Freemasons and the Discovery of the Secret Scrolls of Jesus<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <br>
<br>
Some quotes from the Copper Scroll about this: <br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> &quot;In the cistern which is nineteen cubits in front of the eastern gateway, in it are vessels, and in the hollow that is in it: ten talents.<br>
&quot;In the Court of [?]..., nine cubits under the southern corner: gold and silver vessels for tithe, sprinkling basins, cups, sacrificial bowls, libation vessels, in all six hundred and nine.&quot;<br>
&quot;In the inner chamber of the twin pillars supporting the arch of the double gate, facing east, in the entrance, buried at three cubits, hidden there is a pitcher, in it, one scroll, under it forty-two talents.<br>
     - Copper Scroll 3Q15 2.7-9, 3.1-3, 6.1-4</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
..the ‘temple’ here is believed to be the Temple on Jerusalem Mount itself, indicating that these people were wealthy, successful, well connected and (therefore, logically) well known.<br>
<br>
My belief is, Paul basically ‘borrowed’ elements of Qumran tradition, and wove them (along with elements of Greco-Roman tradition too) into his writing of the NT .. the Teacher of Righteousness became ‘Christ’, the idea of the ‘new covenant’ stayed, but the purpose of it was changed, and many details such as the ‘fishers of men’ imagery he also kept.<br>
<br>
Finally, another piece of coincidence or evidence, depending on what you believe .. <br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr>  &quot;Among the terms by which the Qumran community [Yahad] referred to themselves was 'Keepers of the Covenant', which appears in the original Hebrew as 'Nozrei ha-Brit'. From this term derives the word 'Nozrim', one of the earliest Hebrew designations for the sect subsequently known as 'Christians'. The modern Arabic word for Christians, 'Nasrani', derives from the same source. So, too, does the word 'Narorean', or 'Nazarene', which, of course, was the name by which the 'early Christians' referred to themselves in both the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles.&quot;<br>
     - Baigent and Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Ummmm, really FINALLY .. **Pauls conversion on the road to ..?<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> &quot;It is clear from the [Damascus] Document's context that the place in the desert called 'Damascus' cannot be the Romanised city in Syria.. Could the site for 'Damascus' have been in fact Qumran?&quot;<br>
     - Baigent and Leigh, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception <br>
<br>
“… should we fall into the trap of taking place names literally? Rather it is more likely that 'Damascus' is a code word for Qumran....The New Testament pictures Paul receiving a vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:3-6). It is likely that the symbolic meaning of Damascus as an eschatological stopover would have led to its use here. Indeed, even in Amos 5:27 it is connected with the destruction of syncretist Israelites-those who had mixed worship of the God of Israel with pagan ways - in the End of Days.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;In addition, we should mention the suggestion that Damascus was actually at one time the name of the toparchy (administrative district) in which Qumran was situated. This suggestion assumes that Qumran, even though it is located on the western shore of the Dead Sea, was at one time part of the same administrative unit as Damascus and could, therefore, bear its name.&quot;<br>
     - Lawrence H. Schiffman, &quot;Origin and Early History of the Qumran Sect&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Curiously then, the Qumran community may have referred to the place they lived as ‘Damascus’ .. .. so could Pauls/ Sauls ‘road to Damascus conversion’ (Acts 9:3) actually be referring to him turning his back on the beliefs of the people he’d left behind in Jerusalem, including (especially) the powerful Qumran community .. or is that just another ‘coincidence’?<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> When the fragmentary details of the Qumran texts had been assembled into a coherent sequence, what emerged was something extraordinarily similar to the chronicle of Acts, Josephus and early Christian historians. <br>
<br>
The scrolls told their own story, at the centre of which was a single protagonist, the ‘Teacher of Righteousness’- an exemplar of the same virtues associated with James. Like James, the ‘Teacher’ was the acknowledged leader of a ‘sectarian’ religious community whose members were ‘zealous for the Law’. And like James, the ‘Teacher’ had to contend with two quite separate and distinct adversaries.  <br>
<br>
One of these was dubbed the ‘Liar’ an outsider who was admitted to the community, then turned renegade, quarrelled with the ‘Teacher’ and hijacked part of the community’s doctrine and membership. According to the ‘Habakkuk Commentary’, the ‘Liar’ ‘did not listen to the word received by the Teacher of the Righteousness from the mouth of God’.<br>
<br>
Instead, he appealed to ‘the unfaithful of the New Covenant in that they have not believed in the Covenant of God and have profaned His holy name’. The text states explicitly that ‘the Liar . . . flouted the Law in the midst of their whole congregation’. He ‘led many astray’ and raised ‘a congregation on deceit’. He himself is said to be ‘pregnant with [works] of deceit’. <br>
<br>
These, of course, are precisely the transgressions of which Paul is accused in Acts – transgressions which lead, at the end of Acts, to the attempt on his life. And Eisenman stresses Paul’s striking hypersensitivity to charges of prevarication and perjury. In 1 Timothy 2:7, for example, he asserts indignantly, as if defending himself, that ‘I am telling the truth and not lie’. In II Corinthians 11:31, he swears that: ‘The God and Father of the Lord Jesus . . . knows that I am not lying.’ These are but two instances; Paul’s letters reveal an almost obsessive desire to exculpate himself from implied accusations of falsity.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> That from: (Pp. 194-195, The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception by Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, Summit Books, New York, N.Y., 1991, ISBN: 0671734547)</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
So, maybe Saul was actually a part of the Qumran/ Dead Sea Scrolls community .. but left after quarrelling about doctrine (or whatever) .. and went to Rome (also to Corinth &amp; Macedonia, apparently), where he wrote most of  the NT .. incorporating many of the doctrines &amp; ideas he’d left behind @ Qumran (following his ‘conversion’) .. and coming up with a composite ‘Christ’, based loosely on the personality/ ideas of the person referred to (in the Scrolls) as the ‘Teacher of Righteousness’ (&amp; maybe also on the various other Christs/ messiahs who were around @ the time) .. in the process incorporating elements of Roman tradition, and replacing the zealous, Jewish nationalism of the Qumran community with  a revised ‘new covenant’ that was much less threatening to Rome (and less brutal than that of the disgusting ~ from a secular/ humanist p.o.v. ~ Old Testament)? <br>
