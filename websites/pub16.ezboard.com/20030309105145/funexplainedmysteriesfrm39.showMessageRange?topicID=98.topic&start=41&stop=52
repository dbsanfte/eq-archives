<br>
I knew because its a tactic geared to avoid proving your point.  You call evolution faulty simply because it contradicts your religious views.  You want to use science to prove evolution wrong, yet you dont even know what evolution is!  Let alone Science.  Evolution is science and science works by an accumulation of evidence.  If there was more evidence that evolution was wrong than there was that it was right, Science would change, ammend, or throw out, the theory.  That's the beauty of science.<br>
<br>
There may be &quot;holes&quot; in the theory of evolution but they aren't hole that contradict it.  The absence of fossils that fill all the gaps is not evidence that the theory is wrong.  You are using a 5 grader's arguement.  <br>
<br>
But dont worry, I dont expect you to accept anything that goes against your personal beliefs.  I do expect you to continue to use faulty science, faulty logic, and a religious bias in all your posts.<br>
<br>
I've seen your website and I dont see anything to contradict the paragraph above.<br>

The discussion was about Young earth.  Did you give up on that when you realized how faulty the science, that is being spoon fed to you, really is?<br>

<br>
Still no proof of that, eh?  Either that or you forgot I asked for it.  You claimed the science was faulty and I asked you how.  That's when you went into filibuster mode.<br>
<br>
There is quite a bit that contradicts evolutionary theory.<br>
<br>
You made some offhanded comments about there not being any evidence of a &quot;flood myth&quot; and tried to pin it on Christians.  Chargerfan did a nice job of explaining that this alleged myth is much more widespread than just Christianity.  The flood account is found in nearly every civilization around the world, but that would make sense because that was the size of the flood to begin with.<br>

You claim that intelligent design and the young earth theory are not founded on any science, yet when given some examples of science you are unwilling (or unable) to explain why it is faulty.<br>

<br>
You also claim that I am ignoring what the scientific community has learned and discovered because it is in support of your religion.  Obviously you didn't read the section of my webpage entitled &quot;Are Creationists reputable? (or &quot;no REAL scientist believes in creation!&quot;)&quot;<br>
<br>
Here's a quote from that section regarding a certain book:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>A good book to read is &quot;In Six Days: Why Fifty Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation&quot;, edited by John F. Ashton, PhD.  Taken straight from the preface, &quot;In this book, 50 scientists explain their reasons for this choice.  All the contributors have an earned doctorate from a state recognized university in Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, or Germany.  They include university professors and researchers, geologists, zoologists, biologists, botanists, physicists, chemists, mathematicians, medical researchers, and engineers.&quot;<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That's just one example of scientists who didn't seem to check in with you first.  They thought for themselves.<br>
<br>
Once again, I'm waiting for specifics from you.  Not general rhetoric.  No more &quot;your just ignoring real science and believing in a myth&quot; with nothing at all to support it.  Try again. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :no --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/nono.gif ALT=":no"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I atleast read yours.  A few posts ago I gave a link that explains just how faulty the young earth science is.  I did't expect you to read it, it's too hard to explain away.  But dont lie and say I've offered no evidence.  You just dont care about anything other than your fragile faith.<br>
<br>
I made NO comments about their being no evidence for the flood myth.  Infact, I was the one who brought up the point that the &quot;evidence&quot; is global!  What I also did was explain the evidence using what we know of geology, instead of ancient hocus pocus.  <br>
<br>
You obviously are so arrogant that you dont even bother to read what others post.<br>
<br>
Your &quot;answersingenesis&quot; link is good science?  I looked again, just to be sure, and those arguements are so outdated and recognizably faulty that no-one, not even those who believe in creation try to use them anymore.  I suggest you try doing a little research - you can start by reading other people's posts and even trying their links, since we have the courtesy to check out yours.<br>
<br>
There are many scientists who choose to believe in creation.  As I've ALREADY stated, science works by consensus, 50, 100 even 1000 scientists who choose to ignore the preponderence of evidence are still not enough to say evolution is wrong.  It is important to note here that these scientists who chose not to believe in evolution are important.  Science works by continually questioning the facts.  These guys may eventually gather enough proof to show that evolution is wrong.  And that is great.  But they haven't yet, infact, they are not even close.<br>
<br>
You close your post with the smug remark:<br>
<br>
&quot;Once again, I'm waiting for specifics from you....   Try again.&quot;<br>
<br>
Well Matt, If you had bothered to read posts other than your own, you would know how idiotic that statement is.<br>

<br>
Ummm, yes there flood myths from around the world, just as there are descriptions of plagues, droughts &amp; famines.. because these are events which occur throughout human history &amp; therefore are part of (global) human experience.<br>
<br>
The point is, the Biblical flood suggests a flood occurring globally, all over the planet, **at the same time**, simultaneously… <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>where is the evidence for this?</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
Accounts of flooded &amp; lost cities &amp; civilisations are fascinating I think, but to find evidence of a simultaneous GLOBAL flood, at some point in human history, you ought not to need to look in the oceans.. the evidence would exist <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>everywhere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> we cared to look, so many metres under the ground.. in other words, core samples would reveal the evidence, if it existed (they don’t, because it doesn’t).<br>
<br>
The evidence for the sudden flooding of the Black Sea, 7500 years ago, lies (in part) in core samples from the area, which show a layer of sedimentary deposit suddenly appearing at the same level (i.e. same point in time) wherever you care to look in the region… a sudden global flood would produce similar results.. you ought not to need to look in the oceans for this, if the evidence is there we should find it xx metres beneath the ground, below the centre of  London, here in freezing cold mid Wales, <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>anywhere</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> you cared to look.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, ecology tells us that an event such as a global flood would have dramatic consequences in terms of subsequent plant growth, levels of atmospheric CO2, etc etc.. we ought also to be able to find evidence of these in the geological record (in preserved tree rings etc) but we simply don’t.<br>
<br>
On a more general point, why do creationists insist on ignoring the evidence of the fossil record? The fossil record CLEARLY shows a gradual increase in complexity &amp; abundance of species over a very long period of time (over millenia).. do any of the creationists here dispute ths?<br>
<br>
Ofcourse there are unanswered questions, and figuring out solutions is really interesting &amp; fun, but it seems (to me) that creationists tend to use the unanswered questions to dismiss the whole ~ i.e., we don’t know for certain which branch of hominids led to Homo Sapiens, therefore the entire theory of evolution must be wrong.. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

This basic premis has made for some fascinating science fiction over the years, by the way.  <br>
<br>
As the Christian Bible is a palimpsest, meaning a jumble of layers of texts laid down over the course of centuries and endlessly shuffled and changed to meet differing needs at a given time, I'd say the chance any of it is literally true is minimal, apart from a few factual chunks.  Another planet's doctrine?  Unlikely.  But a fascinating possibility to speculate upon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=spib>Spib</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/10/03 7:55:04 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm39.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic&index=49>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   yay!</span><hr size=1> Great the old evolution vs creationism debate I remember it well from CT Chef!<br>
<br>
I have to join chef's side on this. Being a (idle) non-believer in any form of religion, I don't claim to have any knowledge of religious texts of any kind, so please don't start throwing quotes at me and expect me to respond with anything other than an empty post. <br>
However, I have looked closely at evidence for evolution. <br>
(sure unfair knowing one side and one side only, but hey, thats life live with it!)<br>
Anyway, I will be back when I have more time but one quick question. Why if we were created by a higher being do we share a certain percentage of our DNA structure with apes? Did this God get lazy and decide to use one of his earlier creations as a 'backbone' for us?<br>
<br>
Now in the words of Arnie. &quot;I'll be back&quot; (probably to get my opinions and jumping into the conversation 'toasted' by the lot of ya!)<br>

I should let you know that this board has moved!  At the top of the Main page there is a &quot;Follow this link to an important announcement&quot; link.<br>
<br>
If you click on it you will end up at the new board (not an ez board) where this discussion is continuing.  <br>
<br>
Good to see you. And I hope to see you at the new board.<br>
