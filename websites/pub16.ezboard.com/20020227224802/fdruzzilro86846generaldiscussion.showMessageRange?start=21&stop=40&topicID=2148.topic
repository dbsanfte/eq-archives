<br>
  Why doesn't ML take a few several deep breaths, gets over the fact that the sleeper is free, and come visit the old IGB where the other guilds are discussing things (or at least trying since ML refuses to show up).  ML reps all have access, they're just being stubborn about it. <p><a href="http://www.lmalla.com/memtest/index.asp?memid=158" target=New>Dlgoth Riknueth</a><BR>

Just what we need, more IGB laundry out in a public forum.<br>
<br>
We have several reasons for not wanting to return to the Hoss board.<br>
<br>
Let me rattle some of them off..<br>
<br>
- First, it's no secret that ML is not a big fan of HOSS in general.  The Hoss general forums are a hotbed of anti-ML sentiment.  Take a peek, you'll see what I mean.  We have no desire to go to a place that holds such rage against our guild.<br>
<br>
- Andaas, the Hoss board admin, removed all ML IGB rep accounts over a week ago, without even consulting with the other IGB members.  We do not wish to return to a board controlled by one autocratic administrator.<br>
<br>
- Andaas once stated on the IGB that any guild who released the Sleeper should be removed from the IGB.  Ironic, since they hosted the old IGB.  Yet he didn't remove himself, he removed ML.<br>
<br>
- Security and Trust.  And this is my biggest issue.  Let me tell you a little story.  Once there was an ML member who made an account on the Hoss message board.  Unfortunately, he used the same password on the Hoss board as his EZBoard account.  One day, while checking IP addresses on my board for security reasons, I noticed that member's account was being accessed by an IP address from a southern state, yet the ML member lived in New England.  This was odd, and obvious red flags went up.  Around the same time, I had been seeing a name pop up in the &quot;current users&quot; list at the bottom of our guild board, a name that belonged to a Hoss member.  I checked their IP, and lo! and behold, it was a perfect match.<br>
<br>
So somehow, this person in Hoss had acquired the ML member's board account password, and was using it to read our boards.  (/boggle)  The only link we could come up with was when we found out the ML member used the same password on the privately controlled Hoss message board (not an EZBoard) as he used on his EZBoard account.  Given that Hoss's message board software used a flat file database to hold passwords (possibly even unencrypted, although that would make little difference to a variety of hacking programs), we now have very little trust in their board security, nor of the honor of the people who administrate it.<br>
<br>
No, I won't reveal names, because the Hoss person is still a well liked member of her community.  If Andaas really desires to know, I will tell him personally.<br>
<br>
And I'm not making any judgement on that person.  I'm not saying they were a &quot;spy&quot;.  Maybe they just enjoyed reading the discussions we have on our private boards, they can be quite entertaining.  But the fact remains that a trust was broken, and the only conceivable answer was that they got the password through either a very lucky guess, or that they pulled it off the password file used on the Hoss forums.<br>
<br>
<br>
For these, and other reasons, we prefer the board to be on NEUTRAL ground, with no single admin, and not on a private server using private software.<br>

<br>
I don't think we're asking much to have the IGB on neutral ground.  I'm sure you know the reasons for it, as they've been discussed on the IGB many times, but I don't think it's necessary to air that dirty laundry, in public.<br>
<br>
Just change the pointer to the new IGB, and we can all discuss whatever it is that we feel is necessary for &quot;new&quot; IGB rules and rotations.<br>
<br>
And yes, by the confrontational &quot;goddamn's&quot;, you're showing here, it does indeed seem to me, that you would prefer FFA.  ML has been fighting it for 3 weeks, now, in the trenches.   Our position on FFA is clear.<br>
<br>
Frankly, Dlgoth, your attitude has always surprised me.   ML stepped in, in NToV on your behalf, and was ready to fight with you after the first time, had offered to help you in ST (and did in fact CoH your folks a few times to the Warders), and yet you're still able to come here and pick fights with officers and members of Mythic.<br>
<br>
Try smiling back to Mythic once in awhile, as we've tried to do for L`Malla.<br>
<br>
If you &quot;don't really care&quot; where the IGB forum is, as you've said elsewhere, why are you getting all riled up about it, suddenly.<br>
<br>
It's important to ML that we talk on &quot;neutral ground&quot; in a fair way.  It has nothing to do with Hoss releasing the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
It's not much of a concession, and we can get moving on to more important topics.<br>

Our refusal to use a board administered by one of the participating guilds (whether it be HOSS, us, L`Malla or Rutabaga Paradox) or its officer(s) has absolutely nothing to do with HOSS' actions in waking the sleeper.<br>

Since ML is unwilling to return to the board hosted on the Hoss forum, I will sum up here what I posted there:<br>
<br>
Hoss is currently discussing our next course of action within the guild.  Whether it is to return to the IGB of old or what changes we would push for were a new IGB created.   <br>

One thing I do know is that we will not be strong-armed into accepting decisions made by outside parties that we do not support.<br>

<br>
I had offered in an earlier post to set up an IGB here.  It might be favorable for these reasons.<br>
<br>
1) No participating IGB guild would be running it.  <br>
<br>
2) It's already a CSC account here, no pop-ups.<br>
<br>
3) It's one click away from peeking at the druzzil ro raid board; allowing an opportunity for cooperation between the larger raiding guilds and the mid-sized guilds.<br>
<br>
The offer still stands, but if you wish to not host it here, it's no skin off my teeth.  (I don't think my teeth have skin anyway..  at least I hope not..  Yuk!)  Just say, &quot;Thanks, but no thanks Ali&quot; <p>Alihja Zanzibar <br>

<br>
  Secondly, this DOESN'T have to be &quot;dirty laundry in the public&quot; if you'd just use the board we've been using. All ANYONE is asking right now is to use it to DISCUSS matters.  If we decide to move the IGB then so be it, but we're not at that point yet, we're just trying to discuss things.<br>
<br>
  Third, who the hell cares about whats on Hoss's general board?  I don't read it, why do you?  You care that much about what another guild has to say about you? <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 Baramos, I'm not TRYING to pick fights with ML here, but christ man, you guys arn't evening making simple discussions easy here.  I mean hell, when Rohaise and other ML members lump my guild in with vindication and the whole FFA thing in the other thread, how do you not expect me to get a little ticked off?  Not to mention the fact that you and other  ML members have sent my members tells in game claiming that I was on the IGB spouting off Pro-FFA crap that I didn't say.  When I have post things on my board to my members and explain what I said because I receive tells and emails with &quot;an ML member told me you said this whats up?&quot;  then yeah, I don't feel like smiling back.<br>

I created the board, because *someone* had to create it.  I don't &quot;own&quot; it, I don't even want admin access - I'd prefer that Quintall be the ML admin rep.<br>
<br>
And if you merely don't like the fact that I created it, please create another on the EZBoard system.<br>
<br>
It's very simple to create a new one, you can call it &quot;Druzzil Ro IGB&quot; (since &quot;Druzzil IGB&quot; is already taken).<br>
<br>
As long as it's not on a private guild board on a private server, we'll flock to it.<br>

Hoss moved our forums from UBB to VBulletin software last summer, and didn't begin hosting the IGB until after that move.  If you look into VBulletin software, you will see that all passwords are encrypted with md5 encryption in the database.<br>

As the administrator of the board, I have no way of viewing the password for any account (via hacking or otherwise).  I can, however, change the password for an account if needed (and then I would know it), but what purpose would that serve?<br>

If the security incident you mention happened from Hoss forums before the move to VBulletin, then that breach took place while our site was hosted and managed by someone else. <p>______________<br>Andaas<br><a href="http://www.hossguild.com">Hoss</a> - Druzzil Ro</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uandaas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Andaas</A> at: 2/7/02 8:59:45 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/urohaise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rohaise</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 9:01:00 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2148.topic&index=32>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New IGB Board</span><hr size=1> Dlgoth - you are mis-quoting my last IGB thread.<br>
<br>
What I said was:<br>
<br>
&quot;I have no intention of reading any of these forums again as they currently exist.&quot;<br>
<br>
I made that post on a &quot;new&quot; forum that Hoss created (Andaas later moved the post), and the forum at the time consisted of Vindication crying FFA, Sirensa/Andaas crying &quot;fence!&quot;, and Dlgoth crying &quot;fence!&quot;, and ML and every other guild asking for rotations back.  The forums as they existed were a total sham.<br>
<br>
Never did I post &quot;remove ML from the IGB&quot;.  Andaas, the Hoss admin, did that on his own.<br>
<br>
Also, Dlgoth YOU were the one who said (in a post on this same board that you copied from the IGB):<br>
<br>
&quot;Do I want FFA? I dunno really. At first I didn't, but we're not hurting by it atm.&quot;<br>
<br>
Followed by your intention to &quot;adapt&quot; without taking any action on your own to return to rotation.<br>
<br>
You committed yourself to inaction.  If you are not &quot;anti-FFA&quot;, and you are not &quot;pro-FFA&quot;, then what exactly are you?<br>

It doesn't matter if you've changed software 10 times since then and hired 5 new system admins with top secret clearance.  It doesn't change the fact that the trust was lost.<br>
<br>
It happened once; why should we believe things are any different, based on words alone?<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> If somehow we decide to go back to a rotation and FFA ends, then fine, back to rotations. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
It's called adapting. L`Malla isn't a powerhouse guild that can be anywhere anytime to do anything. We have had to find what's up when we have enough people on for a raid. To enfoce a rotation with vindi ffa, it would have required other guilds helping to guard spawns for us until our raid force was on. I don't think anyone would have wanted to do that, including us. <p>[60 Grave Lord] <a href="http://www.lmalla.com/memtest/index.asp?memid=244"> Wavern Mortifer</a> (Troll) &lt;L`Malla&gt;</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/urohaise.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rohaise</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Moderator</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 9:12:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2148.topic&index=35>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New IGB Board</span><hr size=1> Selective quoting or not, the whole post taken as a whole still says &quot;we're gonna sit on the fence and see what happens.

<br>
It was that same commitment to inaction that Hoss displayed.<br>
<br>
And here we are again, ML once again stepping up to take action while others waffle about.<br>

The server went FFA.  One guild goes FFA like Vindication, you can't sit around trying to pretend that rotations are going to work when a guild is knocking off rotated mobs.<br>
<br>
  So like I said, the current situation was FFA, so we were going to adapt and not lie down and die.  If things go back to rotations, then thats great, we'll go back to rotations.  My stance has not changed, and what I'm saying now is what I'm saying then.<br>
<br>
  I didn't agree with ML in regards to joining forces to make life miserable for Vindication (Because IMO it would have made us miserable as well), so in your eyes I was pro FFA since I wasn't Pro-ML's opinion.<br>

There's a lot more context from the entire IGB thread that is missed on this board.<br>
<br>
That was only one post in many.<br>
<br>
Dlgoth posting that here in the first place is out of context.<br>
<br>
Any subsequent derivations are therefore out of context.<br>
