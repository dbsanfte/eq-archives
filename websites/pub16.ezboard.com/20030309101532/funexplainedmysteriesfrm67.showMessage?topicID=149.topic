                      My dearest darling Edward,<br>
                         What a wonderful surprise has just greeted me! That sweet partridge,<br>
                      in that lovely little pear-tree; what an enchanting, romantic, poetic<br>
                      present! Bless you, and thank you.<br>
                                                 Your deeply loving,<br>

                      Beloved Edward,<br>
                         The two turtle-doves arrived this morning, and are cooing away in the<br>
                      pear-tree as I write. I'm so touched and grateful!<br>
                                         With undying love, as always,<br>
                                                          Emily<br>

                      My darling Edward,<br>
                         You do think of the most original presents! Who ever thought of<br>
                      sending anybody three French hens? Do they really come all the way<br>
                      from France? It's a pity we have no chicken coops, but I expect we'll find<br>
                      some. Anyway, thankyou so much; they're lovely.<br>
                                                Your devoted, Emily<br>

                      Dearest Edward,<br>
                         What a surprise! Four calling birds arrived this morning. They are very<br>
                      sweet, even if they do call rather loudly - they make telephoning almost<br>
                      impossible - but I expect they'll calm down when they get used to their<br>
                      new home. Anyway, I'm very grateful, of course I am.<br>
                                                   Love from Emily<br>

                                             Dec. 29<br>
<br>
                      Dearest Edward,<br>
                         The mailman has just delivered five most beautiful gold rings, one for<br>
                      each finger, and all fitting perfectly! A really lovely present! Lovelier, in a<br>
                      way, than birds, which do take rather a lot of looking after. The four that<br>
                      arrived yesterday are still making a terrible row, and I'm afraid none of us<br>
                      got much sleep last night. Mother says she wants to use the rings to<br>
                      "wring" their necks. Mother has such a sense of humor. This time she's<br>
                      only joking, I think, but I do know what she means. Still, I love the rings.<br>
                                                      Bless you,<br>
                                                          Emily<br>

<br>
                      Dear Edward,<br>
                         Whatever I expected to find when I opened the front door this<br>
                      morning, it certainly wasn't six socking great geese laying eggs all over<br>
                      the porch. Frankly, I rather hoped that you had stopped sending me<br>
                      birds. We have no room for them, and they've already ruined the croquet<br>
                      lawn. I know you meant well, but let's call a halt, shall we?<br>
                                                          Love,<br>
                                                          Emily<br>

<br>
                      Edward,<br>
                         I thought I said NO MORE BIRDS. This morning I woke up to find no<br>
                      more than seven swans, all trying to get into our tiny goldfish pond. I'd<br>
                      rather not think what's happened to the goldfish. The whole house seems<br>
                      to be full of birds, to say nothing of what they leave behind them, so<br>
                      please, please, stop!<br>
                                                      Your Emily<br>

<br>
                      Frankly, I prefer the birds. What am I to do with eight milkmaids? And<br>
                      their cows! Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I'm afraid I don't find it<br>
                      very amusing. <br>
                                                          Emily<br>

<br>
                      Look here, Edward,<br>
                         This has gone far enough. You say you're sending me nine ladies<br>
                      dancing. All I can say is, judging from the way they dance, they're<br>
                      certainly not ladies. The village just isn't accustomed to seeing a<br>
                      regiment of shameless viragos, with nothing on but their lipstick,<br>
                      cavorting round the green, and it's Mother and I who get the blame. If<br>
                      you value our friendship, which I do (less and less), kindly stop this<br>
                      ridiculous behavior at once!<br>
                                                          Emily<br>

                      As I write this letter, ten disgusting old men are prancing up and down<br>
                      all over what used to be the garden, before the geese and the swans and<br>
                      the cows got at it. And several of them, I have just noticed, are taking<br>
                      inexcusable liberties with the milkmaids. Meanwhile the neighbors are<br>
                      trying to have us evicted. I shall never speak to you again.<br>
                                                          Emily<br>

<br>
                      This is the last straw! You know I detest bagpipes! The place<br>
                      has now become something between a menagerie and a<br>
                      madhouse, and a man from the council has just declared it unfit<br>
                      for habitation. At least Mother has been spared this last outrage;<br>
                      they took her away yesterday afternoon in an ambulance to a<br>
                      home for the bewildered. I hope you're satisfied. <br>

                       Sir,<br>
<br>
                       Our client, Miss Emily Wilbraham, instructs me to<br>
                       inform you that with the arrival on her premises at<br>
                       7:30 this morning of the entire percussion section<br>
                       of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and several of <br>
                       their friends, she has no course left open to her<br>
                       but to seek an injunction to prevent you importuning<br>
                       her further. I am making arrangements for the return<br>

<br>
Mulder: We're too late. It's already been here.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Mulder, I hope you know what you are doing.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Look, Scully, just like the other homes:<br>
Douglas fir, truncated, mounted, transformed into some sort of<br>
shrine halls decked with boughs of holly stockings hung by the<br>
chimney, with care.<br>
<br>
Scully: You really think someone's been here?<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Someone or some THING.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Mulder, over here -- it's fruitcake.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Don't touch it! Those things can be lethal.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: It's O.K. There's a note attached: "Gonna find out who's naughty and nice."<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: It's judging them, Scully. It's making a list.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Who? What are you talking about?<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Ancient mythology tells of an obese humanoid entity who could travel at great speed in a craft powered by antlered servants. Once each year, near the winter solstice,this creature is said to descend from the heavens to reward its followers and punish its disbelievers with jagged chunks of anthracite.<br>
<br>
                Scully: But that's legend, Mulder -- a story told byparents to frighten children. Surely, you don't believe it?<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Something was here tonite, Scully. Check out the bite marks on this gingerbread man. Whatever tore through this plate of cookies was massive -- and in a hurry.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: It left crumbs everywhere. And look, Mulder, this milk glass has been completely drained.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: It gorged itself, Scully. It fed without remorse.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: But why would they leave it milk and cookies?<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Appeasement. Tonight is the Eve, and nothing can stop its wilding.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: But if this thing does exist, how did it get in? The doors and windows were locked. There's no sign of forced entry.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Unless I miss my guess, it came through the fireplace.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Wait a minute, Mulder. If you are saying some huge creature landed on the roof and came down the chimney, you're crazy. The flue is barely six inches wide. Nothing could get through there.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: But what if it could alter its shape, move in all directions.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: You mean, like a bowl full of jelly?<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Exactly. Scully, I've never told anyone this, but when I was a child my home was visited. I saw the creature. It had long white strips of fur surrounding its ruddy, misshapen head. Its bloated torso was red and white. I'll never forget the horror. I turned away, and when I looked back it had somehow<br>
taken on the facial features of my father.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Impossible.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: I know what I saw. And that night it read my mind. It read my mind. It brought me a Mr. Potato Head, Scully. IT KNEW I WANTED A MR. POTATO HEAD!<br>
<br>
                       Scully: I'm sorry, Mulder, but you're asking me to disregard the laws of physics. You want me to believe in some supernatural being who soars across the skies and brings gifts to good little girls and boys. Listen to what you are saying. Do you understand the repercussions? If this gets out, they'll close the<br>
X-files.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Scully, listen to me: It knows when you are sleeping. It knows when you're awake.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: But we have no proof.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Last year, on this exact date, S.E.T.I. radio telescopes detected bogeys in the airspace over twenty-seven states. The White House ordered a Condition Red.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: But that was a meteor shower.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Officially. Two days ago, eight prized Scandinavian reindeer vanished from the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. Nobody - not even the zookeeper - was told about it. The<br>
government doesn't want people to know about Project Kringle. They fear that if this thing is proved to exist, then the public would stop spending half its annual income in a holiday shopping frenzy. Retail<br>
markets will collapse. Scully,they cannot let the world believe this creature lives. There's too much at stake. They'll do whatever it takes to insure another silent night.<br>
<br>
                       Scully: Mulder, I --<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: Sh-h-h! Do you hear what I hear?<br>
<br>
                       Scully: On the roof. It sounds like . . . a clatter.<br>
<br>
                       Mulder: The truth is up there...or is that out there? ;) </center></b></font><br>

                          Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!<br>
                          The runners had been removed from his sleigh<br>
                          The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.<br>
                          And people had started to call for the cops<br>
                          When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.<br>
                          Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.<br>
                          His fur trimmed red suit was called "Unenlightened."<br>
                          And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,<br>
                          Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose<br>
                          And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,<br>
                          Demanding millions in over-due compensation.<br>
                          So, half of the reindeer were gone and his wife,<br>
                          Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,<br>
                          Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,<br>
                          Demanding from now on her title was Ms.<br>
                          And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion<br>
                          That making a choice could cause so much commotion.<br>
                          Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,<br>
                          Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.<br>
                          Nothing that might be construed to pollute.<br>
                          Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.<br>
                          Nothing that clamored or made lots of noise.<br>
                          Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.<br>
                          Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.<br>
                          Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.<br>
                          No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.<br>
                          Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.<br>
                          And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,<br>
                          Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.<br>
                          For they raised the hackles of those psychological<br>
                          Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.<br>
                          No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt<br>
                          Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.<br>
                          Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe<br>
                          And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.<br>
                          So Santa just stood there, disheveled, perplexed<br>
                          He just could not figure out what to do next.<br>
                          He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,<br>
                          But you've got to be careful with that word today.<br>
                          His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground<br>
                          Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.<br>
                          Something special was needed, a gift that he might<br>
                          Give to all without angering the left or the right.<br>
                          A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,<br>
                          Each group of people, every religion<br>
                          Every ethnicity, every hue,<br>
                          Everyone, everywhere...even you.<br>
                        <i><font size=3>  So here is that gift, it's price beyond worth...<br>
