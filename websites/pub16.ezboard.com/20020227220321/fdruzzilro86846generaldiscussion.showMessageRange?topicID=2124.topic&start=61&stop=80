You guys want some of the other high end mobs we want ToV so its either we rotate everything or we stick to getting the majority of the high end mobs and you guys getting the loot in Ntov.  That is just what I believe.  Im not trying to sound like I hate ML just call it what it is and none of this politically correct stuff I would want the same thing in your position.  Also to say you arnt monopolizing it why are you in NToV today? you had enough people log on early to kill in there...that was planned.  It wasnt just hey guys NtoV is spawned lets go kill some.

Simply shouting there disaprovel wouldnt have done anything. It prolly would have just egged Vindi on.<br>
<br>
Maybe jumping in and attempting to KS them might make ya feel better? Thats against VI policy.<br>
<br>
I can understand Hoss' position on this. They are the top end of the game. It would apear they don't want to step on anyone without playing favorites to anyone else. hence the fnce post stance. They have been doing the high end since before anyone else on the server. Maybe they werent the first to enter VP. but in terms of the High End as we know it today, they were the first to do it. Until Vindi came along. IMO Hoss isnt a powergameing guild. They have real lives just like the rest of us (Everyone included here).<br>
<br>
In essence what could they really do without showing favoritsm? Then THEY become the new face of ridicule. I don't think I have Ever met a rude or obnoxious Hoss player. Unless they were provoked. If I am correct, there is Not a thing Anyone could have done to help L'Malla that night. Vindication started the FFA thing, thats the important thing to remember. The choices made by Guild_X after that were based on the FFA fact.<br>
<br>
I hold no grudge or ill thoughts towards anyone during FA. First come first serve. If ya get there first and find yaself short of power when someone else shows up. Step aside and let them do there thing. It sucks, but its the FFA way. And it creates lots of stress and arguing for a simple game over a bunch of pixils. Hopefully the IGB will be rebuilt and Dro will again become the Gem of EQ servers.<br>

<br>
The only reason I believe the previous IGB was successful was that no guild in of itself was strong enough, or did not desire, to play the game at the FFA level.  Thus giving the IGB a multiple guild policing policy.  When one guild breaks from that policy, the resulting consequence is the UNITING of those guilds of the IGB to create a situation in which FFA is unfavorable.  What could any one guild do to right the perceived injustices ?  That guild COULD have maintained the IGB and united with other guilds to make the FFA undesirable to the rogue guild.<br>
<br>
The Uniting of the IGB guilds would have caused significantly less impact on the server then the current FFA has caused.<br>

We never tried to wake the sleeper.  We left another warder up the ONE time we tried the 4th.  You seem to have missed the distinction.  We also only made one attempt, not 4-5 over 2 nights (or whatever the number of times).  So Roh has no reason for a hanky, thank you very much.  We in ML have no jealousy on waking the sleeper, because we simply saw it as a selfish and stupid move and would never had done it. <p><p><p align="center">

<br>
Just because other servers have selfish jerks running the show, doesn't mean we have to accept that ours does. In addition, we have the power to do something about it. The only question is our resolve to do so.<br>
<br>
Wars over spawns way back when created tensions, problems, inter-guild wars, and mayhem. <br>
<br>
This is why rotations began in the first place. <br>
<br>
This is a Good Thing. (TM) <br>
<br>
Forming an alliance with like-minded guilds, who think it's wrong that selfish dickheads who care only about VOP and phat lewt and would trample everyone else, is in the best interests of our guilds, and the best interests of the server. <br>
<br>
There was nothing &quot;ballsy&quot; or &quot;gutsy&quot; about what Vindication did in ToV to L`Malla, after they for months reaped the benefits of IGB rotations, rebuidling their guild whose membership dwindled to around 10 people.   <br>
<br>
It was simply cowardly, selfish, and wrong. They not only accepted the implied social contracts of the IGB, they embraced them. <br>
<br>
Their attitude that &quot;VI says it's OK&quot; is just evidence of an immature leader, and mindless followers who have so much time invested in VOP, that they don't care about ethics and honor. <br>
<br>
Yes, ethics and honor do exist, even in a virtual world. <br>
<br>
The question is whether we, as a group of guilds, were willing to do something about it. <br>
<br>
The answer for Mythic Legoin was yes - we planned to fight tooth-and-nail against Vindication, and attempt to return the server back to a fair rotational system, using NToV as a lever. <br>
<br>
The idea was that there would be successes and failures, to be sure, but there is no reason for any of us to accept what Vindication did to L`Malla, and thus the server.   <br>
<br>
FFA is a poor option for the Old World. Luclin may be another story. <br>
<br>
In any case, bottom line is that ML will continue to endeavor to keep a rotational system going, and welcomes all guilds who wish to participate and abide by it. <br>
<br>
This doesn't mean a smiling, greedy, backroom handshake, where ML, Hoss, and L`Malla get together in a back room, with cigars, and say &quot;screw the rest of the server - we'll take what we want and agree to share NToV.&quot;<br>
<br>
This means all guilds.  There is no reason at all, in my mind, other than selfishness, for us not to behave like adults, smile at the other guilds on the server, and say &quot;Good luck on X, &quot; and even help them when it comes down to it.  <br>
<br>
Guilds like IG, VE, TR, NI, and all the rest deserve the same chance to learn and grow as the rest of us, and there's nothing wrong with the concept of an honorable set of rotations to keep peace on Druzzil.  In fact, DRo guilds should be proud of the example they set to the rest of the dog-eat-dog servers.<br>
<br>
We already have a structured, fair way of including every capable guild into a rotation, that is a proven, workable structure.<br>
<br>
There is a system in place.  We all know the representatives of the other guilds.  <br>
<br>
ML is calling for the same thing we did on the earlier incarnation of the IGB, and that is a return to rotations for all guilds, not a select few. ML is calling for a neutral site for the IGB, as well, not the Hoss site.  Say what you will, there is a subtle political advantage to hosting an IGB site, and I'm sure Hoss is aware of that.  We want everyone on equal footing.<br>
<br>
We don't intend to trample on the smaller guilds' right to progress (as was obviously the intent of FFA explicitly noted by Ciner) by saying 'Ok, rotation on ToV N and FFA on the rest.&quot;  In my opinion, asking for that rotation is just indicative of greed of larger guilds people not getting their &quot;chance&quot; at ToV and shows hypocrisy when the other, smaller guilds, are saying precisely the same thing about, say, CT, or Dain.  Doesn't feel good, does it.<br>
<br>
The &quot;little guys&quot; deserve their chances, too, just like the &quot;big guys&quot; got theirs.<br>
<br>
To those who think ML is just trying to &quot;get the most we can in an FFA situation&quot; I can assure you we're not.  <br>
<br>
If we agreed, even today (that means Hoss, L`Malla, ML, and the rest) to go back to IGB rotations fairly, in a NON-EXCLUSIONARY way, ML would be happy to hop in last place in the first set of NToV rotations.<br>
<br>
If the leaders of the other guilds are tired of FFA, if they want this NToV nonsense to stop, all they have to do is contact each other, and reps of ML, to get it started.<br>

&quot;WTG ML. Nice wipeout.&quot;<br>
<br>
What guild are you in because I would really like to join.  No wipeouts ever would be a real accomplishment. <br>
<br>
I have no clue what VIs stand is on NToV.  When Vindi broke the IGB 2 weeks ago, Bogell let them both in.  What IS the policy on NToV according to FFA rules?  I thot it had something to do with killing Aaryonar. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trillo>Trillo</A> at: 2/6/02 8:23:56 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubaramos1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Baramos1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 8:11:55 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=73>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RE: Comment</span><hr size=1> Tarkum -<br>

Baramos1 is the real Baramos.<br>
<br>
Bara and Moose are evil creations that came into being spontaneously when 3 Worlds Collided.<br>
<br>
You can always tell the real Baramos by holding Luclinite in front of him.  If he begins to melt, it's the real Baramos, so please put the Luclinite back in the lead container.  (Alternatively, expose him to a blonde female woodelf, and if his right leg starts thumping, it's Baramos.)<br>
<br>
One nice thing about the real Baramos, is that he's invulnerable to flames, an asset on boards such as these. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

So...just because &quot;baramos says it's ok&quot; is that evidence your guild is full of mindless borgs that cheer when they are passed over by third twinks? Your arrogance and sense of self worth is quite inflated. And your view of dkp guilds is a joke considering how you handle loot. Gratz on your dream items farmed for you.<br>

We complain about your loot and you complain about our killing of the sleeper.  Its all opinion, yet you feel you have the right to do it to us and not us to you.  Just seems a bit odd.  On a side note, I don't really care about your loot, just using it to make a point.<br>
<br>
Also I'm curious why the IGB has to be 100% what you guys feel it should be while other guilds will have to compromise to what you suggest, you are immovable and unchanging.  That would seem like you are in control.  Just curious why you guys will not budge to anything but you want, I mean we all have our opinions and are never going to agree, so compromise would be the best solution.  Like I'm all for an IGB type thing if it was stricter and limited spawns.  Stricter doesn't mean FU small guild NO CHANCE FOR YOU.  Its open to everyone.  Only thing is you will be penalized for failures and have to prove your worth to get a shot.  That's not really selfish IMO.  Calling that selfish is sort of like saying that every team in the NFL should make the playoffs and teams that don't adhere to it are selfish and we will not respect you.  I mean you have to be successful to advance to the higher end.  Just by stating it and not proving it should not entitle you to everything.<br>
<br>
Just some things on my mind.  Not intended as a flame, more as an insight.<br>
