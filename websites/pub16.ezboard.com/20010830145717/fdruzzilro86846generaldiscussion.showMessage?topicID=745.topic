Maybe we didnt handle things as best we could in this situation, but I guess it is just an example of how sometimes this game can play with emotions...<br>
<br>
It was a quiet night in Trakanon's Teeth and the Froglok Forager was dieing about once every couple of minutes. We were luring him to the lake and then, well, kill him.  We got a few rare spawns, some nice trinkets that they decided to leave us.  About an hour or so later another group shows up.  We had just killed one of the rare spawns, Klok Denris I think, and he dropped an SK only helmet. Not that great, but since we didnt have an SK I sent a to an Iksar asking if they had any SK's, and he said no. I told him we were camping the forager, and asked if they would not pull it.  I also told him anyone in their group could loot the Sebilis Key Quest items if they like.  Also, if we get any no drop items we cant use, including the Hangman's Noose, they are welcome to loot them. He said thanks a lot, they will pull the hunter, and we had a nice little conversation.  So we continue to pull the Forager for a while. One of our members had to leave for a few minutes so we had some down time.  They pulled the forager a couple times while we medded.  We asked them nicely not to, but they just came back with things like, &quot;there is no such thing as camping,&quot; &quot;Talk to the puller, I just kill things when they get here.&quot; Well, our group got back together, adn we continued to pull continuously.  They could not keep up with us, as most were around lvl 35-40. Can anyone guess what happens next? Yep, a rare pops. Its funny, cuz as we were killing the Forager, they were watching us from not far away.  Then, when it would get low on HP's, their puller would not be there.  We noticed this, and let our puller go a little early, but I guess not early enough. Just as our puller got to the spawn, they started to pull.  Our druid got attacked by the mob, so of course he engaged it. We got it back to our spot and proceeded to kill it, quite easily and looted. Of course we got all kinds of tells saying they were going to petition us, etc.<br>
<br>
My question to the forum is, does anyone believe that killing a common mob gives you the right to the rare? I understand the &quot;Play Nice Rules&quot; that Verant has instituted. They dont really recognize the concept of camping a spawn. The thing that gets me is, we offered to let them loot anything we could not use. We told them that we were killing the Forager for his rares.  Everything seemed to be great.  We asked them to kill the Hunter, all to no avail.  Is it just me? I always thought the word &quot;camped&quot; meant something to experienced EQ players. To be honest, I am not sure of the final outcome of this, as I had to log. (The RL God spoke, and I listened.) Sorry this is kind of rambling, but I wanted to make sure I get everything in. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks all. <p>Tychor Westwinds<BR>

Usually it tends to be an FFA sort of scenario like the rares at TT, or the AC camp, or whatever...first one to hit it gets it.<br>
<br>
However...<br>
<br>
<br>
What they did was very underhanded and low....watching and waiting til your forager is almost dead then going out to pull the rare (if it spawns). Thats lame.<br>
<br>
Ironically enough thats one of the reasons I havent played in over a month...the EQ playerbase IMO has been going down in quality for a while =/ not people I would like to hang out with.<br>

Tychor, this is a great example that happens more than most people think.<br>
<br>
If you go into most zones, a spawn point (not a mob) is usually considered &quot;camped&quot;. What ever spawns at that point belongs to the person/group that is camping this particular spawn point. Take for instance, L'Guk. When you camp the 3rd floor of L'Guk you usually get scribe/savant/sage/Exe/cavalier spawn points. In most cases, IMO, it would be &quot;un-kosher&quot; for a group camping the assassin room to run down and &quot;grab&quot; the savant just 'cause your group hadn't checked the spawn point yet in the past 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Switching gears:<br>
<br>
I would like to throw another scenario into the mix. <br>
<br>
How do all the people here feel about &quot;rare farmers&quot;?<br>
<br>
I'm not talking about the casual farmer that gets 2 or 3 of the same item, I'm talking big time &quot;rares farmer&quot;. There is a person in South Karana zone that has been farming this land for a very long time. I remember seeing this same person farming 20 levels ago. If I were to say this guy's name (50some druid), everyone would know who I was talking about that has been in South K for any amount of time. <br>
<br>
This is his scam...he farms the rares out of the zone and extorts money from people that need these items for quests, which in and of itself isn't terrible, but this guy doesn't stop. He is always in this zone, like I said before, I went through 20 levels with my main and this guy is still in the zone farming. And the kicker of it all, he is an admitted farmer. He'll tell you right now that he is a farmer! <br>
<br>
What do you all think? <br>

Like I said, I just wanted to know if my feelings of respecting someones spawn point were shared by others. Just to clear things up, we could never be considered farmers. Just inspect us and you will see that.  We spend maybe a few hours a week trying to get some nice loot.  I guess we will have to find somewhere else to go when the children (by action, not age) show up.<br>
<br>
As for your other example, I know what you are talking about.  I spent a lot of time (most of my 20's) in South Karana, and could not understand why someone would be there so much. I went back (don't remember why) not all that long ago, and I was amazed at seeing the same /ooc's (same hot keys) as I did nearly 30 lvls ago.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the info, and dont despair Belegir, there are plenty of good people in EQ still. Sooner or later the others will leave when people figure out that they dont want to group with them.  Take care and see ya in Norrath... <p>Tychor Westwinds<BR>

<br>
My stance is this; if its a group of players who will actually use the stuff (Iksar Regen BP-great shaman piece, Hnagmans noose, Traks tooth, etc) then fine, I mean after all thats what its there for...but when I see two or three very high level high powered players sitting in TT on their butts hitting the rares cycle I shake my head. I mean at that point they are simply spending real time in a game played for fun farming crap they wont wear or use...for what reason? To amass some virtual money in their virtual bank? To maybe equip twinks? To feel like they accomplished something?<br>
<br>
I guess I would rather being doing something more challenging or more fun with my time in EQ... If they find it fun then more power to them I guess? I think its kinda lame.<br>
<br>
<br>
I rarely farm anything either...but then loot has never been one of my major reasons for logging on...just inspect me sometime....hah.<br>

<br>
If something spawns in the same place on a timer, it's pretty much a camp.  <br>
<br>
It's just as annoying to have someone come in and invade your camp, as it is to keep checking the same camp over and over and seeing the same person there every time.  It's a matter of perspective?<br>
<br>
When I think of wandering rares, hmmm...  You could say you were killing creatures all day to get a rare to spawn, but any number of people could be doing the same thing.   You could even /shout or /ooc &quot;Anyone camping the ?  Yet, I know of many people who turn that stuff off in their chat options.  <br>
<br>
Again, it's just as annoying to find that someone else has decided to join in the hunt of your rare spawn, as it is to get to a zone and already find someone hunting it, still...  a month later...  every day, 24/7, and you start to wonder about that person...  <br>
<br>
~ do they sleep?  go to the bathroom?  eat? ~  <br>
<br>
Or, maybe you don't wonder at all, I dunno', really.<br>
<br>
There is no true way to determine, &quot;ownership&quot; of a wandering spawn or creatures in a zone.<br>
<br>
Thoughts on people who professionally farm rares?  I think of them, as school in the summertime. <br>

After a few days I was like &quot;what gives&quot;? Well I guess he had quite a niche on the Iksar regen BP market for a while...and was prolly making quite a lump of plat on farming it day in and day out....<br>
<br>
I thought it was kinda lame though. Like I said before, when I spend time on EQ I want to be doing challenging stuff...so when I log off I can actually say I had fun. I think there comes a time when the balance between getting good gear and having fun is thrown off-kilter...and its at that point that you either realize its just a game played for fun or it has become a lifetsyle for you.<br>
<br>
Its easier to see the game for what it really is once you have taken a good break from EQ.<br>

If you can't, and you are just killing them to stock up on loot, well after a while it gets a bit cheesy.  On the other hand, like Belegir said, if its something you can use, then by all means go for it.  On a side note, just for kicks, I did a /who all on that person that was mentioned earlier, and yep, you guessed it, STILL in SK. I am almost positive that if I spent that long in one zone I would be certifiably INSANE. But I suppose its whatever floats your boat. <p>Tychor Westwinds<BR>

<br>
As far as the common/rare spawn camping matter, this reminds me of something that happened while playing my lvl 18 rogue alt in Highpass.  I got into a gnoll group on the west end of the zone.  We were camping the gnolls, but certainly hoping that the rares would spawn and drop a PGT or CDS.  Sure, we were getting good experience, which was all I wanted, but loot is nice of course.  All of a sudden, a dwarf cleric shows up.  &quot;You guys camping the gnolls?&quot;, to which we answer yes.  &quot;You camping the named ones?&quot;, which I say we are, pointing out that they are part of the gnoll camp.  He says &quot;No, you are hunting here for experience, so you have to let me take the named ones for the loot&quot;...and things went sharply downhill from there.  He went on to say that a GM wouldn't lift a finger to help because there is no such thing as camping, and that it's not KSing if he gets the mob before we do.  When we repeated that we were camping the gnolls, he said &quot;I'll duel you for the camp&quot; which was ridiculous with him being a mid-30s character versus our highest level being lvl 20.  When his bully approach failed, he stooped lower and started grabbing every gnoll that popped.<br>
<br>
The worst part is that he stated outright that he was camping it to twink his alt or sell.  It's a sad thing, really.  People might complain, but I'm started to think that all under-30 zones (if not all zones) need to have Warrens-style looting rules applied.  It would be drastic, and there are a lot of nice items that wouldn't be available so easily via auction, but it would go a long way towards fixing this farming problem.  Odds are, it would fix the economy too, with items holding their value longer and making it a greater accomplishment to get a rare item.<br>

<br>
Clan B found the Tower of Frozen Shadow. Rarely has more that 10 people in it and commonly only has 2-6. We liked the Tower and spent about a month and a half there. We learned all the secrets of floors 1-6a and had a grand time of it. Some pretty nice drops (with horrid ac on them) are in the Tower. Anyone who knows the ToFS knows that tis not a normal camp check. Being polite means to ask for a Floor Check and try to avoid the floor others are on.<br>
<br>
We were stuck on 4 for quite some time, at one point. We were gettin the Prophecy Scroll and Sorcerer's Cup for our casters &amp; healers.  It was late one nite, when 4 of us finally got Amon to spawn. Excited, we sent our monk o'er to Cara to see what she had as soon as Amon was dead. Our monk practically shouted in /g-say that she had the Cup in her hand. We invised and ran like mad o'er there, our guild magi in tow. We got there and paused to take a pic of her and her cup with our magi standin next to her. Just at that moment, I came vis. I was attacked, so immediatly our monk started hammerin away at Cara.<br>
<br>
Next thing I see in /g-say is our monk shoutin that we were bein KS-d. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Never really having encountered this, I didn't know what to do, so I started nuking. I wasn't fast enough, neither was our magi. Our Cara spawn was promptly slaughtered and the cup looted. Within minutes, our KS-er UN-Friend zoned to 5th floor and disappeared. Side note: Previous to this, the magi that KSed us was in /ooc doin floor check and random bs talkin with us. I could show ya snip-its from pics takin, but as the GM says... ya can doctor those to say anything ya want. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I'll spare ya the story of talkin to a GM and havin a GM tell me to work it out with the magi that KSed us. Supposedly the Magi turned it around and accused US of KSin HIM. Because of spending a lot of time in Norrath protecting the image of Clan B, we were believed... but nothin could be done.<br>
<br>
Anyway, after such a long time in the ToFS, it was a great let down to us. This was the very first time we had gotten Cara to drop the cup for us. The mood and spirit of a great group was gone and noone really wanted to stay. We camped out for the nite with near-tears in our eyes.<br>
<br>
The next day, we logged on and again tried for the couple of pieces our guildmates needed &amp; wanted. For some unknown reason, Cara kept spawnin all o'er the place and dropped 2 cups during the day!!!!!<br>
<br>
We got our payback, tis for sure. But I still remember the sadness of the group when they realized that sometimes a lot of hard work can disappear in less than 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
I, and most of Clan B, play this game for fun and comradarie. Not for Uber loot or Uber levels. Usually, if we see somethin camped, we walk away. /shrug... I guess not everyone can be polite... or even try, Tychor. All we can do is continue to play our game our own way and patiently wait for a cute payback. Like Cara droppin 2 cups for us in 1 day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One group was there, doing the forager cycle. They were nice enough to let us loot the medaillons, and we decided to do the hunter cycle. As soon as a rare spawned (a junk one), they took it. So basically as soon as we got the medaillons we decided to leave.<br>
<br>
Maybe you can't camp random spawns. But when they are triggered (like rares in TT are), I think it is just a question of respect to leave the mobs to the group who is doing all the effort. <p><center>

Probably talking about Moel, I would imagine. That guy LIVES in SK, making a living off of tracking quillmane and charging people for the kill. Last I heard, he was charging 10k or GEBS.<br>
<br>
/sigh<br>
<br>
I'd be completely absolutely stone bored doing that. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=749.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=750.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=745.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=745.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=745.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=745.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">Nasty Post Void</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion>General Discussion</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
