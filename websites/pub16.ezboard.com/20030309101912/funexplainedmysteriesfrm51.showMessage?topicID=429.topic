<br>
The earliest whisperings of Springtide are heard now as the Goddess nurtures Her Young Son. As a time of the year associated with beginning growth, Imbolc is an initiatory period for many. Here we plant the &quot;seeds&quot; of our hopes and dreams for the coming summer months.<br>
<br>
Imbolc is one of the four greater Sabbats, celebrated on February 2nd. It is to celebrate the first stirrings of spring from the depths of winter. This is when the first buds can be seen appearing on trees, when the days are quite visibly longer than they were around Yule, and when there are the first days of semi-bearable temperatures.<br>
<br>
The word Imbolc literally means &quot;In Milk.&quot; This is because it is the time when the cows and goats generally begin lactating in Western Europe.<br>
<br>
The festival is sacred to the Goddess Brigid (pronounced &quot;Breed, &quot; often spelled &quot;Brid&quot;-the Celtic triple Goddess of Inspiration, Healing, and Metalwork. As well, she is a patroness of midwives (in much the same way as Hecate was to the Hecats in Greece) indeed, the Christianized version of Brid, &quot; St. Brigid&quot;, was said to have been Jesus' midwife (and when Brid was occasionally stomped on by the patriarchy, it was said that she was Jesus' maid when he was schooled by the Druids).<br>
<br>
Her chief symbol is Brid's Cross, which somewhat resembles a Swastika. This is not meant to have any negative connotation, however.<br>
<br>
Below can be found an Imbolc ritual for solitary use. If you have a group and wish to celebrate this holiday with more than one person, an excellent ritual can be found in Janet &amp; Stewart Farrar's &quot;Eight Sabbats For Witches.&quot; Alternately, in their book &quot;The Witches' Goddess, &quot; an excellent ritual for Brid is given. This is a fabulous rite, one which I, myself, hope to implement this Imbolc.<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>An Imbolc Ritual:</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em>WHAT YOU NEED:</em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> A white candle, a green candle, and a glass with milk in it.<br>
<br>
Firstly, it is wise to create a psychically cleansed working space. Do this by envisioning a wind, gentle at first, escalating to gale-force, sweeping though the room or the area you're in, removing all negative psychic energies. Once this has been accomplished, through the use of visualization set up barriers around the boundary of your working area, suspending regular time and space in order to create an atmosphere more conducive to spiritual workings.<br>
<br>
Note that thus far there have been no verbal affirmations of what is being done. Some find verbalizing their ritual intent to be unnecessary and distracting. If this is not true for you, however, you may wish to say something like:<br>
<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;I hereby do create sacred space, <br>
In time that is not time; a place not a place, <br>
Today is a day that is not a day, <br>
All malice and worry, now away, <br>
So all within here is right and just, <br>
This is a place of magic, love and trust.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
<br>
Once this has been done, meditate for a few moments on what has transpired, and feel the change that has taken place. Once you feel centered, proceed with a brief period of reflection on the significance of Imbolc. The Great Wheel turning yet again, and all the world and humanity turning with it, in these giant cycles beyond our control, yet not beyond our appreciation of their beauty.<br>
Now see the Goddess-a brilliant maiden with a wreath of candles adorning Her head. She is young, fresh, glowing with potential and unbridled enthusiasm.<br>
<br>
Yet, at the same time, she is not a person at all: she is the unfathomable deep of the consciousness of our world. She is Gaia, mother of all things, trembling with her own might and majesty as another springtime (the season of lust) arrives. Call to this-the very essence of the Universe-from your heart. She will be present.<br>
<br>
Light the white candle. Say something like this, or use your own words:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;Wintertime has been with us long, and has brought us much happiness. In it we have discovered the joy of the hearth and home, and the simple pleasures of simple living. Through it all, Goddess, You have slept, a beautiful, White Goddess, cold yet refreshing as You greeted us each morning. Goddess, we thank Ye.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Take the white candle and light the green candle with it. Once this has been done, extinguish the white candle. Say something like:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;But the Wheel turns on, and so You turn with it. White gives way to Green, as new life is born and flourishes. In Your love, You give us these gifts of new life, as us to them, so we may all live and love together. Goddess, we thank Ye.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Take the milk, meditating on what you have said and its significance. When you feel you have reached an elevated spiritual state, and feel you have discovered within yourself the true significance of Imbolc, say something like:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE FONT START--><span style="color:green;"><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><em><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>&quot;As the season of life begins, Mother, I ask for new life within me as well.&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></em><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--></span><!--EZCODE FONT END--><br>
<br>
Drink most of the milk, envisioning the blessings of the Goddess therein.<br>
<br>
Thank the Goddess by pouring the remainder of the milk on the ground. If you are indoors, simply go outside to do so.<br>
<br>
After you have poured a libation, ground and center. To welcome the arrival of longer, warmer, greener days, you may wish to celebrate in some way-anything from renting a movie and ordering pizza to throwing a party.<br>
<br>
The choice is yours.<br>
<br>
Blessed Be!<br>
