I have posted several of my weird experiences at Castle of Spirits page, but wanted to to find a &quot;board&quot; forum for discussion.  I have had so many strange things happen during my lifetime it would take me forever to post them all, and bore you all to tears!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :sleep --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/prplsleep.gif ALT=":sleep"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
So, I will post my most recent...<br>
<br>
My husband and I bought our house about 2 years ago from the family of the elderly couple who used to live here.  She had recently passed away and he had moved to a nursing center.  The house was empty for several months before we bought it.<br>
<br>
I realize that when you move to a new place, there is an uneasy feeling and you hear strange things, as you are not yet used to the house, but...  things seemed to start right after we moved in.  The house is older, built in 1952, so I expected some creaks and squeeks in the house.<br>
<br>
The couple who lived here before were Irish in descent and my husband and I are English/Native American and Scottish.  I have a book about Scottish clans on display in the library and the book would keep &quot;falling&quot; to the floor.  I finally removed it and replaced it with another display book and haven't had any problems since.  I am wondering if the lady who lived here before didn't like my Scots heritage??<br>
<br>
Also, my husband and I would both awaken out of a dead sleep thinking we heard our bedroom door close.  I could understand it if just one of us heard it, but BOTH?  This cannot be a mass hallucination can it?  He got up and searched the house to find nothing.  This happened on several occassions.  <br>
<br>
There are MANY more strange things, but I will save those til another time.  Thanks for letting me post! <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quote the Raven...&quot;Nevermore&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sixthsense16>sixthsense16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/24/02 3:39:49 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.paranormalandmuchmore.com/candle21.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ghost stories--for real</span><hr size=1> Maybe the book kept falling off because "someone" wanted you to look at it for some reason. <p>&quot;For those who believe no explanation is needed.

<br>
Shortly after we moved in (I had a job at the time where I worked at home alot) our doorbell rang.  I answered it to find an older gentleman there from a health care company asking to see Mrs. O'Neal the former owner of the house.  I told him they no longer lived here and in fact I believed she had passed he looked very shocked and insisted that he had spoken with her this morning at her number.  She had told him it would be fine to come by today.  I told him I was sure she had passed away.  He profusely apologized and walked away--very shaken.  I would have just chalked it up to a health care salesman feeding me a line except for the white color of his face, his shocked demeanor and the fact that Mrs. O'Neal has made her presence known to me on many occassions!   <p><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Quote the Raven...&quot;Nevermore&quot;</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=wlorac>wlorac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 121<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/21/02 1:43:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ghost stories--for real</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :look --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/coollook.gif ALT=":look"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Maybe good to check the Rest Home where her husband currently lives for the Mrs.<br>
<br>
Or ask the neighbours a little bit about the former occupants and whether she had died (without raising any eyebrows).<br>

When I was little, around 6-7 I remember waking up and seeing the shadow of an older man walk by my bed and then stop and then he would enter my Mom and Dads room.  I saw this for a couple of nights, then never saw it again.<br>
   Another time when I was grown, my ex-husbands grandmother had just passed away within the last two months.  I woke up to see people walking through my closet.  Then his grandmother came out and said what a nice family I had, my youngest son had just been born 3-4 months before that.  Then she said that she had to go and would shut the door to the closet so I would not be bothered by any other people.<br>
   The house that I am living now, I have seen the ghost, or partial ghost of a cat that we had.  I just saw the middle black body as it ran around the corner.  Also I was working in the kitchen, I heard footsteps running in from the living room.  Thinking it was my kids, I turned, but did not see anything.  About the same time, a very cold hand touched my rear and still thinking that I had missed my kids and they were heading out the back door I turned the other way...but no one was there.  It is always cold in the house and sometimes I get the feeling that I am being watched.<br>
   We went to Whaley Museum in San Diego, I recommend that if your in San Diego you go there for a visit.  I took a picture of what I thought was a picture of Lincoln and when it came back, it looks like a man with blond hair and it looks like he has a rope around his neck.<br>
   I believe in ghost, and always look forward to having more experiences.  I never know when they will happen.<br>

I have heard that poltergeists don't necessarily come from the location they are disrupting.  They can appear at anytime, and a change in location doesn't always help the person being victimized.  I'm glad your poltergeist doesn't seem malevolent, IMBUE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=imbuechick>IMBUEchick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/4/03 8:33:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=9>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.imgmag.com/images/philohooch/images/silverdragon.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Ghost stories--for real</span><hr size=1> lol if he were i wouldn't put up with him...i would try my best to do what is needed to help him, but beyond that i wouldn't deal with it lol. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=irenecmoss>IreneCMoss</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/4/03 8:41:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=277.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   First moved in the house</span><hr size=1> We never hear things being moved or doors opening.  But when we first moved in the house we have a light in our bedroom.  One of those that you touch on and off.  It has 3 settings on it.  It would go from the low setting to the high or back and forth by itself.  We have moved it and it doesn't seem to do that as much as it did before.<br>
Don't know if I could live in a house where I had a ghost that moved stuff and made a lot of noise.  Think it would freak me out.  <br>

When I was younger, 6-7 I think, I beileved in them. Me and my friends, John and Quinten(I had more boys as friends then girls) had the funniest experiences. Once John showed me his fingers which were stuck together with see through glue.<br>
&quot;It's ghost glue!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek2 --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/eek1.gif ALT=":eek2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> &quot; I screamed.<br>
Then there was the lights in my grade 2 class. There was only 2 lights shining in the light thing(not sure what to call it). It was right above me and I thought it was a ghost staring at me.<br>
Now this is the scariest. I was sleeping in my bed half awake and I thought I felt someone touch my shoulder. I don't think anyone was a wake, so I expected it was a ghost. In the morning I asked if anyone tapped me on the shoulder. They said no.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek2 --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/eek1.gif ALT=":eek2"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
