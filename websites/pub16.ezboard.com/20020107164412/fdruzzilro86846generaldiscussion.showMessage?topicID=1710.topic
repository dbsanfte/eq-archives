<br>
I'm bored this Wednesday night so I think to myself, &quot;Self, what fun places do I just love to hang out at?&quot;  Then I answer myself, &quot;Self, you really love Sebilis.  Dem frogs are so cute.&quot;<br>
<br>
So I hike up my skirt (yes, I wear a skirt.  I'm an enchanter, and I like frilly dresses), add a fresh coat of blue shoe polish to my shoes, and head off to Old Sebilis.  Yay.<br>
<br>
I zone in, and snag myself a group.  We got Cleric, Enchanter, Shadowknight, Magician, Wizard, and Warrior.  Pretty decent group, awesome DPS.<br>
<br>
So we otm, so far so good things are normal.<br>
<br>
You tell your group, 'Oh man, PLEASE tell me we aren't doing necro&quot;<br>
<br>
*sigh*  I hate necro.  Its a pointless boring pothole on the way to crypt.  If I need a 400th blue diamond I'd go there.  I don't need one, I don't want one, I just want to have a tiny bit of fun.<br>
<br>
Necro is up.  Drops CSS (yay me, I even called it (and rolled crappy on it)), a ruby, and a black sapphire.<br>
<br>
Pretty standard bug loot.  I throw both of the gems my clerics way and the warrior winds up winning the CSS.<br>
<br>
The SK begins to bitch about loot.  *sigh*  I thought we were better than this.  He claimed to be 35 in tells with me afterwards and bitched about even distribution of loot.<br>
<br>
Yah, I hate necro, and worse, I hate alpha bugs.  Its like I'm learning how to share all over again.  The sk asks if anyone has problems with alpha loot.  I say me.  He disbands me.  Whatever, I wasn't in the mood for dealing with children.<br>
<br>
Then he goes on to bitch about people who always ninja &quot;like 10 gems&quot;.  Blah, I just dumped 250pp+ on the cleric.  The only person in the group who actually NEEDS them.  (She gave me pinzarn, I'll assume she was low on pdots at the time).<br>
<br>
I hate being called a loot whore.  Loot is the last thing on my mind.  I hunt in sebilis where 95% of the drops are melee loot, and the other 5% I've gotten better stuff on a guild raid.<br>
<br>
I guess I'd rather see a lammy go to the warrior with a yak, or a fbcr to the magician wearing an advisor robe.  I need to go get Luclin so I can make myself a Vah Shir.  Then I can just run around and slaughter noob monsters again.<br>
<br>
Great loot used to be a worn great staff that sold for enough to buy almost 2 whole spells at level 4.  Now apparently its a ruby that a shadowknight just can't live without.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'll go back to West Karanas and run around in werewolf form.  *sigh*<br>
<br>
Is it just me? Is NBG really obsolete?  Is there a way that adults can play this game like adults?<br>
<br>
Its 10 am and I'm going to bed.  I'll get up at 5 am and play with the HKs.  I can't understand em most of the time so I won't be have to squabble with them over a black sapphire. <p>-Tremaile Fascinare

<br>
If I were you I would have sent all the other group members a tell asking them to disband so you could invite them, then told the SK to go hike his ass out of there or find a better alternative. I mean come on, in that situation you had him by the balls.....Enchanter &gt; SK, in a 6 man group scenario. I dont like to look at things from a petty perspective but I would have done that since he pulled such a BS move. Sounds like he needed schooled anyways.<br>

I remember being in the Disco wearing a crystalline robe, right after being teased by the uber fruitloops in my group about my gear, when a bonecaster robe dropped.  We rolled, the ranger won...that helped me realize how ubers get so rich.  The chanter and I both could have used it.  She sent me a couple tells as she was even more upset than me and took their teasing even worse.  Fortunately I have improved my attire a wee bit (not too much I will admit) and learned the secret of grouping with idiots.  Now when idiots rear their ugly head, I load gate, and leave at the first signs of trouble.  <br>
<br>
The second last time I gated I enjoyed it thoroughly. The cleric and I were getting a bit sick of this pally and her three friends that were looting everything, and not giving the cleric skwat.  Apparently the lvl 57 (or 58, not sure) enchanter needed all the gems for jewelcraft &lt;rolls his eyes&gt;.  Things got bad, I gated, but the cleric died.  I asked a friend to come over from ej and summon the cleric's corpse after which we both bid the group adieu to their fervent protests. I said something along the lines of &quot;sorry, the cleric informed me he has to take up part-time work to fund the peridots you people use and do not pay him for...no cleric, no me&quot;.  They did a couple oocs about how I was such scum, no new thing there.<br>
<br>
I got a new group of very nice and competent people within about 30 min with a terribly nice wiz I had met about a week ago (hope you managed to get 60 Kev <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  It always shocks me when that happens as you can run into 3 groups of jerks in a row, and then, suddenly, you end up getting groups with nice people.  I suppose people eventually learn who all the jerks are and stick to the nice people, leaving the jerks to group with one another.   <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

<br>
I've killed enough frogs in Seb to hit ally in cabilis 3 times over by now.  At this point, I'm used to playing with people who fight over who has to loot all this crap nobody wants.  &quot;Would you guys quit leaving bodies lying all over the place?  Another blue diamond dropped.  Anybody want it?  No?  Whatever.&quot;  And so on.  Every once in a while I get into a pickup group where the people actually want the junk and they are very serious about it.  I mean a lammy?  That's worth picking up, but not even worth fighting over am I right?<br>
<br>
Anybody that gets excited over a few star rubies and whatnot is clearly marking himself as somebody still in the up-n-coming category.  If you think of yourself oh... say... 6 months ago, you can probably remember when the prospect of a blue diamond was a big deal.  I guess you've got to consider that when dealing with people you don't know.  They might still be up-n-coming just like you were once right?  <br>
<br>
Still doesn't excuse rude behavior.  Loot or no loot, you gotta treat people with respect if you want any back.<br>
<br>
If any of those up-n-comers are reading this, please try to keep in mind that maybe somebody isn't hoarding the loot because he's greedy.  Just maybe it's because to him it's just more junk nobody wants.  Maybe he's passing it on to the cleric or even destroying it.  Before you flip out, ask politely if there's anything that interests you.  &quot;Anybody want these Kobold Paws?  I use them for faction.&quot;<br>
<br>
Since you bring it up, it had occurred to me that I don't see NBG pick-up groups much anymore.  What happened to that?  Did they just fall out of fashion at high levels or did they stop altogether?<br>
<br>
Alpha loot?  Are you serious?  I haven't heard anyone suggest alpha loot in a long long time.  Does anybody out there that's 50+ use alpha loot anymore?  I thought that one went out of fashion long ago. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uepiphanyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Epiphany EQ</A> at: 12/6/01 10:22:04 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 107<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/6/01 10:36:59 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Adults playing an Adult Game like Babies</span><hr size=1> lol LOVE that phrase Kokuten.

Personally, about 99% of the time I could care less about loot.  Yes, I am odd.  A lot of people play for loot and items. I am aware of this, and thus someone plays loot hog it annoys me as it is definitely a sign of disrespect.  Of course mistakes happen and sometimes people are really focused on something and cannot see what they are doing.  Sometimes a gentle word is all that is needed.  Other times leaving a group is all you can do.  Personally I avoid grouping oog as I have found it causes too many problems. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utiberinusmaximus.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tiberinus Maximus</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 48<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/12/01 1:36:19 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Adults playing an Adult Game like Babies</span><hr size=1> Two things:<br>
<br>
1. Disband works great (Be the leader always).<br>
2. Gate works great if you are not.<br>
<br>
Greedy people never stop showing up, and you can either agree that need before greed before you go is the way or disband them.   If you are down there and they start that crap, gate out or kick em out.<br>
<br>
I dont roll on things I cant use or dont need because I have better.  I used to but started paying a little closer attention to what it says about me.   Yeah I could sell it, yeah I could give to my rogue.  No, I'm not doing that!<br>
<br>
If you CANT use it, you shouldnt roll on it.   Only after the people in the group could benefit from it (not finacially) have claimed no desire for it should you roll for sale.   I mean really benefit from it - If you have warrior epics, you really think you need that lammy when this other guy is wearing crafted?  I think not.<br>
<br>
But I must say the one thing that pisses me off more, is the power looter who loots every item and then says let me know if you need anything.   Well hello there Mr Greedy with the Illusion Generous spell up.   Even if that spell is uselss to me someone else might need it in my guild or maybe just maybe I could sell it to a merchant.   How about you just back the @#$# off the corpses and let some of use get a spin at it now and then you greedy bastard trying to pretend to be generous.   Guess what asshole, I wrote your name down and Im gonna charge you for a port or TL and it isnt gonna be cheap (Just ask people - I dont charge and 99% of the time dont take donations either - what do I need pp for?  A horse?  HA, I can gate there faster than your little horsey can run)...in fact at the end of the group I might even charge your ass for a TL out of here - cause I started this group and have the power of Disband before I punch port.   Sucks to be down in Seb alone now doesnt it?  I hope you choke on all your phat loot.  Whore.<br>
<br>
Ok, im done.  hehehe<br>
