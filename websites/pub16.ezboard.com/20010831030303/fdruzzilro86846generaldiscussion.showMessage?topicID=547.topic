<br>
<br>
After doing some smithing for the guild, I went to out into the yard in Freeport to aid someone who needed a bind.  I was a wee bit tipsy after drinking whatever beer I had left that my warrior friend Ephany hadn't drank.   In this case, I had *cough*  &quot;forgotten&quot; to give her a whole stack of twenty.  I kept swaying, and getting interrupted.   After casting a sucessful root upon myself, I bound him.  Then another  young chap walks up to me and asks, &quot;Pardon M'lady, have you any coin to spare for a poor wretch?&quot;  <br>
<br>
Well, the money I did have left, belonged to a guild member to smith his fine plate, and it was not mine to give.  I had spent my own money on hafling pickles for the mighty warrior Ephany, and more beer (and buying those outrageously priced periodots and jasper for buffs).<br>
<br>
I relayed as much to him, and I cast a spell to make him resolute and set the favors of the gods upon him.  I expected to hear some scorning from this guy or the typical, &quot;Thx&quot; and he'd dissappear.  Nope.<br>
<br>
He just said, &quot;M'lady, I thank you for your kindness, but these buffs will do me no good.&quot;  <br>
<br>
&quot;Why not?&quot; I pointed outside to the yard.  &quot;You can surely conquer anything in the yard now, and collect the items to earn a decent living for your age&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am merely a weak beggar, and these buffs will surely be wasted, as I will not be doing any combat today.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;You won't--  What?!&quot; I frowned.<br>
<br>
By now, some people were gathering around and they started ridiculing the guy.  It was getting interesting.<br>
<br>
&quot;As I said milady, I know nothing of life but begging here at these gates where me mum left me as a baby.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh, who was your mum and dad?&quot;  I asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were great people,&quot; he began to explain, &quot;They were killed by the evil dark elf sourcerers.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ahh..  my sympathies,&quot; I said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes, he said, my parent's were sent to battle the evil witch Najena.  They were slain.  My father's army sent me to this city on the back of a wolf.  <br>
<br>
I protested, &quot;Hey! I thought your mum dropped you off here!&quot; <br>
<br>
&quot;That wolf, she was the only mum I ever knew, m'lady.  She kept me warm and safe from harm in the forest, but she can teach me nothing of living in a cold mean city such as this one&quot;<br>
<br>
Now the ridiculers stopped poking fun at him, and were gathered around listening to his story and asking him questions.<br>
<br>
I gave him four of Ephany's halfling pickles and beers.  I figured Eph wouldn't miss them, besides feeding a barbarian too any pickles and beers can be dangerous, especially in the closed quarters of certain dungeons where the dungeon's interior decorator fancies torches and burning lava.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I bid him farewell BEFORE he started to eat the pickles and drink the beer, because there is a campfire over near Boomba the pickle salesman.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
(yet another ooc note) I was really tired and had to take my leave for the night, but as the campout countdown scrolled up my screen...  I got a tell from him thanking me for the fun roleplaying, and that he was now going to go back to playing his main character on his regular server.  He gave me his main's name and the server name, and told me to say hi if I made a character on there.  Out of boredom of leveling his main, he had made the newbie just to roleplay a beggar.  What a hoot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    Have you ever seen such a thing?<br>

<br>
I have a story too, but its not about begging.  About roleplaying rather and how it can get a little carried away...<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Being a young enchanter of level 23, I had just recently gotten my Iksar Illusion spell and was eager to try it out.  So what do I do? I head to South Karanas with my good friend Xorshaik (who was at the time a level 25 iksar monk), and Honeysong's necro Slithas (a level 20 iksar necro).<br>
<br>
I slap Iksar Illusion on myself and the 3 of us go parading around South Karanas praising Cazic Thule and repeatedly bashing Tunare.  We went so far as to kill one of the druids in NK so that I could loot some Wood Elf parts, which I to this day still show to various wood elf druids before I smile at them and announce I shall kill them.<br>
<br>
After about 30 minutes of Tunare bashing, some druid finally had enough.  She wa sick of being called a soft skin and a follower of a weak goddess.  So, the followers of Cazic Thule were challeneged to a duel against the followers of Tunare.  To be held in the arena.<br>
<br>
So the 3 of us traipse off to Arena, picking up a level 40 iksar warrior along the way, and shortly after we are surprised to find ourselves facing a few druids, a paladin, and a cleric (all elven, all followers of Tunare).<br>
<br>
Round 1.  I immediately make one of them my pet and sick them on their team mates using charm.  The necro pet takes out one of them, and the monks do their monkly amounts of damage.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule 1, Tunare 0<br>
<br>
Round 2.  Charm has been disallowed.  Okay, thats not a problem.  Fear.  Wonderful pathing bug in Arena.  THe feared victim runs to the very centre of the stone platform and stands there as if rooted.<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule 2, Tunare 0<br>
<br>
Round 3.  Bit of solo action.  I think it was 25 monk vs 25 druid.  Xort lost.  He got kited. :(<br>
<br>
Cazic Thule 2, Tunare 1.<br>
<br>
This went on for a bit longer and the final score ended up being CT 4, Tunare 1.<br>
<br>
I think we all had a great time, no matter how many times Tunare got her butt whooped.  And to think, it was all started by a little roleplaying.<br>

<br>
I AWLAYS will do whatever is in my means to help an honest-to-Karana roleplaying character.  Even a beggar.  if they cna take the time to play in character and create a story, its worth a few plat.<br>
<br>
I know that this game is not essentially a roleplaying game, not in the sense I am most familiar with, but it's a close approximation.  And roleplaying can be infused, if people take the time.  Its fun to create tales inside of the framework and it adds to the texture and variety of gameplay.<br>
<br>
I'd like to have my guild become a RPG guild, but that's just not practical.  The concept of roleplaying varies betwene people and enforcing that is unfair at best, disasterous at worst.<br>
<br>
Still, there can be rewards for good roleplaying and I for one support that.  Even for beggars.  To concieve that someone would create a charatcer in EQ that DOESN'T fight is so OUTSIDE THE BOX that I just have to sit back and smile.  Perhaps there is hope for the game... <p><font=-1>Lisan Al'Sayal<br>

While Daragoth was camped in LGuk waiting on a group I made a level 1 rogue and passed myself off as a fortune teller.  For a few coins I would make up a &quot;reading&quot; based on the players class and race.  I did this for about a hour or so and make about 50pp.  I then went to the WFP gate and gave it to low level chars who were just playing and not begging.  It was fun and passed the time while waiting for a group. <p>Daragoth Dragonbane<br>

“War is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feelings which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.  A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing which is more important than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself.” – John Stuart Mill</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubelegirswiftbow.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Belegir Swiftbow</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 219<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/16/01 5:21:06 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Age Of The Professional  Beggar</span><hr size=1> Thats a funny story.

But as far as serious get-on-your-nerves beggars heres wmy short story:<br>
<br>
Just make a beggar hotkey and be done with it.<br>
<br>
it goes like this:<br>
<br>
:has RESISTED your attempt at begging<br>
<br>
<br>
You should see the reactions I get when they go to beg from me and I hit that emote. The younger more inexperienced ones especially get thrown for a loop for a minute or two. Some laugh it off and move on. But now my reaction to a beggar is a simple one button click. <br>
<br>
I love it.<br>
