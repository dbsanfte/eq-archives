All thoughts and opinions are welcome and respected even if we differ in opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Matt, I agree with you that the possibility of the existence of aliens is more likely than developing a manner in which to travel in time.<br><br>Ok, Rhoadesb ... You have set forth a hypothesis and a question. My response is this. If I were to travel back in time, I would not try at all to dazzle anyone with my current knowledge of technology or anything else that may seem out of place at the time period where I go back to.<br><br>First of all, it would be my aim to fit in as much as possible and observe all that is taking place around me at that time ... Their culture, religion, politics, architecture, math, language ... and on and on. I wouldn't want anyone to know I was from the future for fear of what they would think ... just like you said. They may fear me as insane or even a witch and kill me. It would not be my purpose to show them any of the &quot;stuff of the future&quot;. Instead, my purpose would be to observe the past without interfering. <br><br>Next, what if they did believe me and began to implement the &quot;future&quot; knowledge I shared with them? There is the possibility that the future would be altered, and possibly not in a positive fashion. That would be my fear. So, I would be really careful and keep my &quot;time travel&quot; a secret to all.<br><br>Thanks so much for this very thought provoking discussion, Rhoadesb. It's like nourishment for the brain. I love it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>~~~Dottie~~~ <p><img src=http://photoasa.com/disk1/708/19781_DottieHM.gif><br>"The love for all living creatures is the noblest attribute of man."<br>~~~Charles Darwin~~~<br>Please visit us at the <font size=3><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthoughtmessageboard">Thought Message Board</a><br>Guardian 507<br><font size=1><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/btheguardianacademy">The Guardian Academy</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/umiragezerooo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Miragezerooo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 90<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(3/22/01 5:45:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.facelink.com/miragezerooo?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60?flezbwidth=60&flezbheight=60 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rambling thoughts</span><hr size=1> It is possible that the aliens are humans (or their creations) of the future, but still you cannot dismiss the timeline problems alltogether. There are theories that you cannot alter timelines at all because there are an infinite number of them running concurrently (Larry Niven's All the Myriad Ways kind of hits on that... time travel to the past is currently undergoing some serious thought now, and I'll post something in a second that hits on that too...<br>Personally, I do not believe that this is the case however. From all accounts the greys appear to be the form of advanced dolphins (who were land mammals that returned to the sea) that have come back to the surface or something like that... this is speculation though. I don't think Earth would be the vacation spot of choice and thier presence here doesn't seem much fun to them unless they get a kick out of messing with peoples heads. They lie, in my opinion, accounting some of the more verified stories.. if they are wardens of the earth they are not doing a very good job of it, either... if anything I would think that the earth is under some kind of quarantine until we get our act together, but I hope this is not the case. I believe they are here for some kind of research, which is why they do not land on the white house lawn so to speak- just as the journalists documenting primative cultures still present on earth do not go in with an entire crew and spotlights and just casually observe with limited assets. UFOs have been with us since time immemorial and they seem to take an observational tone, or their direction is not consciously recognized (at least in our presently recorded history- not as aliens anyhow). I do believe that the bible does hold some of the clues however if you consider that aliens could be replaced with angels and consider genetics... <br>Unfortunately, I agree with government secrecy on the subject... I believe it would destroy society as we know it. And unfortunately it seems the US is the prime motivator in such secrecy... and if you tie that in to the extreme masonic roots of the US gov't incorporated in its birth and the way the economy works- eh this could get lenghty... lol<br><br>Anyhow, good post! l <p>~Miragezero ICQ 99218616</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dottie</span><br>  Posts: 2124<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(3/22/01 11:32:22 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=67.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://photoasa.com/disk1/1464/28204_MousePhoto.jpeg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rambling thoughts</span><hr size=1> Miragezerooo, I very much appreciate your response.
