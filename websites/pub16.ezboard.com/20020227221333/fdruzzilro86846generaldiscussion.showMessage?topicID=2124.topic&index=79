<br>
Also I'm curious why the IGB has to be 100% what you guys feel it should be while other guilds will have to compromise to what you suggest, you are immovable and unchanging.  That would seem like you are in control.  Just curious why you guys will not budge to anything but you want, I mean we all have our opinions and are never going to agree, so compromise would be the best solution.  Like I'm all for an IGB type thing if it was stricter and limited spawns.  Stricter doesn't mean FU small guild NO CHANCE FOR YOU.  Its open to everyone.  Only thing is you will be penalized for failures and have to prove your worth to get a shot.  That's not really selfish IMO.  Calling that selfish is sort of like saying that every team in the NFL should make the playoffs and teams that don't adhere to it are selfish and we will not respect you.  I mean you have to be successful to advance to the higher end.  Just by stating it and not proving it should not entitle you to everything.<br>

Fact is.. ToV is big enough for more than one guild to operate in without stepping on each other's toes. ML &amp; Hoss proved that today in the North Wing, and IG was in HoT killing Dozekar.<br>
<br>
We killed 3 North Wing dragons (Eashen, Lady Miranella, and Lord Kreizen) that spawned last night and camped out for the evening. ML setup to take Aaryonar this morning. Nothing wrong with that at all.. since we weren't setup for Aary. So we killed the other 8 dragons (Jorleag, Lady N, Zlexak, Cekenar, Sevelak, Lord Koi'Doken, Dagarn, Lord Vyemm) that were up at the time, but at NO TIME was there any contention for spawns. We could have pulled Lord Feshlak, but instead headed the other way and killed Lord Vyemm.<br>
<br>
There was ZERO public channel guild bashing, ZERO arguments over mobs, and basically both guilds just stayed out of each other's way. There was ZERO leapfrogging over anyone. Just 2 guilds doing their own thing.<br>

<br>
I dont like guild politics never did but all I want to say is this and this is not a flame at all but comparing waking the sleeper to our loot system is just outrageous considering our loot system only affects the guild not anyone else, where as waking the sleeper has in a sense robbed the rest of the server that hasnt set foot in ST yet from ever seeing the Warders.  As for me I dont have my key yet but I will probably get mine eventually just to see the zone and help others get primals.  Unfortunately I will never come face to face with a warder.<br>
<br>
As for the IGB I fully support it.  I see it as this, the up and coming guilds dont have what the ubers have yet and that is experience killing the mobs that we do.  I think the IGB would greatly benefit the server in that everyone capable gets a fair shot to learn their own tactics on a mob and if there is a wipeout they can try again the same day without another guild breathing down their neck waiting to kill that mob. It lets the others get their $10 a month worth out of the game.  If you were paying more to play then them sure you should have more of a right to mobs then them but you dont. <p> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20012">Lavidicus' Gear</a><br>

I gues you missed all the posts where ML made commitments NOT to awaken the Sleeper, but I'm not all that surprised.  13 posts to your name here, and no guild affiliation or toon name in a sig, I'd say that classifies you as a board troll.  <br>

Sounds like L`malla, ML, and Hoss are all Pro Rotation.<br>
Most likely other guilds are Pro this as well.<br>
<br>
I have no Idea if any talks are in the works other than this thread, so can we all just figure something out and Implement it already and stop the mud slinging?<br>
<br>
couple points that sound like most of the guilds agree too...<br>
<br>
-Neutral IGB board<br>
-All Rotation Mobs go back on rotation... or something to that effect.<br>
<br>
Also some hints at revising the IGB ... like a prerequisite?<br>
<br>
If you can't kill mob A, you shouldn't be on rotation for mob B. etc etc...  I dunno...<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway I am not an officer of L`malla, but would like to push to get things in motion, if this indeed is the desire of all the guilds posting here.  I'm sure everyone is already tried of this FFA madness.<br>

<br>
To answer the first part of your question.  The way we distribute loot in our guild effects no one outside our guild, well ok Zoulle does seem to have a major hang-up about it but thats just him and his problem not ours.   Awakening the sleeper affected the whole server.  Slight but significant difference.  Do I think Hoss is EBIL ! Heck no, I just did not agree with their awakening of the sleeper.<br>
<br>
Why does Mythic Legion, IMHO, believe in an all or nothing IGB ?  Because it makes no rational sense not to take it immediately to full rotation.  You can argue both ways and use multiple arguements for both sides.  The final outcome will be Mythic Legion wants an environment in which all guild have a fair chance, not just the top 3-4.  Is it a dictate do this or else ?  No, not in my opinion.  It is a simple statement of fact that to get ML to agree to an IGB all guilds and Rotations have to be included and not just a NTOV agreement.<br>

However, Roh still needs a hankey.  If you think we released the Sleeper so we could &quot;screw&quot; the server, then you need to go play your little politics game somewhere else.<br>
<br>
   What do you think, that everyone in Hoss has primal?  Every one of our warriors has a SoD?  Think gnome masks rotted for us because all our bards/rogues have 1 already?  Think again.  Removing the sod/mask etc from the game affects us just as much as anyone else.  So no, we didn't do it to screw the server over.  Btw Primal STILL DROPS so stop saying that the rest of the server now has been robbed of their chance to get one.  Oh no you might have to work a bit harder now.  I don't remember reading in the licensing agreement that all you had to do was get a key, and go to ST once and be guaranteed to walk away with a primal.<br>
<br>
   We released the Sleeper because of the challenge of it.  Do you have any idea how hard Ventani is/was to kill?  No dragon in Ntov can compare to him in difficulty.  Vyemm?  Nope sorry we killed him easily on our second try ever.  Think we've only lost to him twice.  Zlexak?  He's a bugger, but not even close.  Vulak?  LOL.<br>
<br>
   Killing Ventani took us two days, and countless failed attempts.  Strategies were made, discarded, revised and re-revised until we got it right.  Until we fuond the way to kill that Dragon with only 32 people.  Now that's one hell of an accomplishment.  If we left a Warder up, then we could have farmed Ventani and the challenge would be gone.  He'd die withot a fuss anymore, same as all other dragons do.  Instead we got the one kill that mattered the most, and the rush of watching Kerafym appear is beyond description.  That's why we killed him.  Never once did we do it because we wanted to make getting primal harder for everyone else.  A good chunk of the 32 people that killed him still wanted items from ST.<br>
<br>
   To say that it was a &quot;sad day for Druzzil Ro?&quot;  Please, don't be so melodramatic.  Do you REALLY think that Vindi or ML would have never, ever released the sleeper?  Or L'malla or Guild X?  Think again.<br>
<br>
   Btw, primal is overrated.  If you think you can't handle a certain mob or zone in the game just because your guild isn't decked out in primal, uhhh.. you really shouldn't be there in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utilea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tilea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 2:51:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> oops forgot some stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
   Elidroth's post said it all, in regards to yesterday in Ntov.  Both Hoss and ML wanted to kill the Dragons there.  So we both showed up, coh'd our people in and started killing stuff.  Nothing that happened was in any sort of violation of pnp or pvp or pvg or pwg or any other acronym you choose to come up with.  Unfortunatley for ML they didn't have a very easy time and we killed the majority of the Dragons.  But nobody was immature about it.  We never even saw eachother the whole time.  Just because a server is FFA doesn't mean people have to hate eachother.<br>
<br>
   Personally, I'd rather not ever have to worry about starting a ntov raid at 11am when I'm supposed to be in class instead again, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trillo>Trillo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 3:00:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> &quot;We released the Sleeper because of the challenge of it.

<br>
This doesn't make much sense to me.  Leaving another warder up doesn't make killing Ventani any easier.  It would have been the *exact* same challenge only the Sleeper would not have been released.  There was no challenge in the actual freeing of the Sleeper.  The only challenge was killing Ventani.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we left a Warder up, then we could have farmed Ventani and the challenge would be gone. He'd die withot a fuss anymore, same as all other dragons do.&quot;<br>
<br>
??  So why do you keep killing King Tormax?  Statue?  Vulak?  You make it sound like it is no longer any fun to kill these mobs because the challenge is gone.  Why do you still play if &quot;they die without a fuss&quot;?  Why didn't you farm Ventani just like you farm these other mobs? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/upaperr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paperr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/wave.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 3:00:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> Tilea,<br>

Simply put yes we do, you could have left another warder up and accomplished the same thing and there was no reason to start the script.  That was always the contention. <p><p><p align="center">
