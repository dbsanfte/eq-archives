I guess I'll start with the first and the one that could mean nothing: <br>
---Dream 1 -I was driving in an ambulance with female demons in the back screaming and howling. Then I looked at myself, not like in a mirror but in the 3rd person and a have no memory of what I looked like. This is the second time I had it in my whole life.<br>
---Dream 2 -I was laying down in my bed when for some reason I got up and went into my hallway. There I saw my mother and our new dog standing there like they were waiting for me. (Well just my mom the dog was walking around.) I started talking to my mother about something when the dog bit my ankle. Then I was transported back to my bed back to my original position in my bed. I was confused knowing what just happend I went back to check things out in the hall, figure out if I was dreaming or not. My mom was standing there just like before with the dog. Then I started asking her what happened, did she see anything. She didn't say a word. Then the dog bit me again and I was back in my bed same position. Seeing a pattern I called my mom, when she came in my mind zoomed in on her right hand. It was a dark green with large bumps all over it, there were only four fingers the middle one was swollen like the ring and middle finger were stuck together. The left half of her body was dark green with the large bumps. She was walking toward me with arms extended saying something like &quot;Join us&quot; or &quot;Help us&quot;, something to do with &quot;us&quot;.<br>
---Dream 3 -Again I was lying in my bed only this time I felt more awake. My room was lit up very brightly. I wasn't scared I felt alive. So I yelled out something in excitment but all I could do was wisper but it wasn't volentary more like it was forced upon me. Right then I got really freaked out and tried to move but I was moving in slow motion and I felt a pressure againist my entire body like the gravity was increased alittle. I started to kick alot. I felt hands on my ankles trying to restrian me. At this time my vision was limited like my eyes were closed on prepose. Then I just woke up.<br>
I know these dreams may seem unreal but they happened. Give me your insight on them please.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udavidrichmond.showPublicProfile?language=EN>David Richmond</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 32<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/19/02 6:42:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dreams or Something more??</span><hr size=1> I've heard ofcases and may have experienced one, where otherworldly encounters are masked in dreams.

However you asked for some feedback so ...<br>
<br>
What you're describing, particularly in Dream 2 and Dream 3 is a fairly clear description of 'hypnagogic' experience.  This occurs in the boundary between consciousness and dreamstate, and commonly results in &quot;waking up only to find you're still asleep&quot; and feelings of being paralyzed and unable to move or act (because of the neurochemical that usually keeps us from trotting around while asleep, it literally paralizes us).  This &quot;no man's land&quot; is common in dreams of this type, and we each experience it everytime we fall asleep or wake up, but usually, we are not even partly conscious as you relate here.<br>
<br>
However, further, there seems to be some kind of more extreme stressor that is affecting the situation.  Have you recently changed your living arrangements, for example, left home, left an apartment, etc ... something that has vastly changed your routine to which you'd become accustomed?  How's your relationship with your Mom?  Any particular conflict there that is fresh or unresolved?  (Not to be too personal, but, again, you did ask. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ) <p>

My relationship with my mother is fine but there are times when I get angry at her. There aren't any stresses I have but I think I might be paranoid or watched. When I'm in my Computer Room and I'm by myself I feel like someone's watching me or looking over my shoulder or breathing on me or I'd feel the lightest touch. Once I even heard someone calling my name repeatedly until I yelled out &quot;stop&quot;. I thought it was one of my sisters trying to mess with my head, They denied it and I believe them because they'd admit to their tricks. I'd feel the same things in my bed. So could these push these dreams. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukingofthehobos.showPublicProfile?language=EN>King of the Hobos</A> at: 4/24/02 8:56:42 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubabybluebunny49.showPublicProfile?language=EN>BabyBlueBunny49</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/27/02 6:44:32 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dreams or Something more??</span><hr size=1> <font color="#cc66ff">Wow, those dreams you described sounds really scary!

Keel and Jacques Vallee and other investigators into fringe topics concluded, it's not so much what happened that matters, it's the meaning it might have for you.  If it means nothing to you, then it doesn't matter and will fade from memory.  If it means something minor, you might relate it as an odd story now and then but not worry much about it otherwise.<br>
<br>
However, if it means something important, it can change you or your life. So the question to ask is:  What did it mean to you?  And what are you going to do, if anything, about it? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uaphroditedream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>AphroditeDream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(5/2/02 12:29:38 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=8>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.nimnix.com/images/blooddragon_tiny.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dreams or Something more??</span><hr size=1> also ask yourself what the symbols in your dream mean to you...the dog..your mom...the demons..the ambulance...<br>
<br>
your subconcious communictes to you with symbols, you have to decipher(sp) what they mean to you....although tho that this may be true in alot of dreams...some just seem to remain un explainable...like i will have a dream that I can shapeshift..breath underwater..I cant be killed, or I can fly just about thinking about it....I am thinking the flying part means That I will be able to Astral Plane..I have been trying it for years, and I think my dreams are tryin to show me, that its not as hard as im makin it out to be. <p><p align="center"><font color="#993399"><b>Proud Memeber of The SVAA, is a

I have loads of other snippets, so if I find any I'll post them up. Most of my dreams contain far more complex things and are just plain bizarre and seem have no meaning but, when I actually took the time to remember a recent and extremely bizarre dream (which I don't even know how to describe with words) and try to work out it's meaning I managed to actually decipher it's meaning even though it seemed like utter nonsense. In fact it was about a school matter and it was that dream, that helped me decide a difficult decision. So no matter how weird a dream has a meaning, you just go to take the time to find it out <p><center><font color="cccc00">“Long ago when the cards were first created by sealing powerful monster spirits within them there were two Dragons who refused to become servants to future humans’ pleasure for their pride was too great.  Those Dragons were the first of their kind: the Blue Eyes White Dragon and the Red Eyes Black Dragon.  They revolted and fused with each other so that no one would dare take away their freedom.  The new “super” monster that they formed was the Golden Eyes Silver Dragon.  For many millennia the Dragon remained free but, its efforts failed for it was sealed away into a card but only with the most powerful of magic.  This card was forbidden and was never to be touched ever…  But a prophecy states that the card will one day be discovered by a worthy human.  Only one who possesses the qualities that are able to tame the beast’s extremely aggressive and wild spirit and be able to harness the beast’s unparalleled destructive power may attain this ultimate card…"

What &quot;more&quot; are you trying so desperately to hint at?  Give it a break, you're only mystifying something that is common as dirt. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uwlorac.showPublicProfile?language=EN>wlorac</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 15<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/27/02 12:49:01 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=100.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dreams or Something more??</span><hr size=1> Hi,<br>
<br>
I was told by a buddhist friend that you can easily change your dream in mid-stream, expecially if it is a recurring nightmare, by just doing what you normally would not do.<br>
<br>
Instead she asked that I say to myself &quot;I am dreaming&quot; while I am in the middle of a dream.  And then change the dream into something that I find highly enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
