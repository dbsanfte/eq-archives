<br>
Well so far I've accomplished a lot in my opinion. I got 60 back in April. I got my Epic before that. I've killed most mobs in this game and had a blast doing it. I've gotten almost all of my Nature Walkers Armor. The breasplate is the only thing that has elluded me, but as of last night I got the Frak Talisman from Zlandicar so I will be able to finish the Shroud of the Dar Brood BP Quest (with a lot of Cov Factioning har har but I'm determined to do it.)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What are you still waiting to accomplish?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

I did take a break from EQ Twice. First time was back in Dec of 99 when I was playing my Ranger on Bristlebane. I bought a new game and played that non-stop. Well I came back in June of 2000 and started Spense on Druzzil Ro. I then played until April and then took a little break again to not totally burn myself out. I've been back for the past 3 months or so now and having a great time playing EQ Again <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Not really, I wanted to go Grandmaster with epic, coldain ring etc. Essentally to the point where I could have compete in BotB.<br>
<br>
What sorts of things did you accomplish before you left? (Epic? Tov? Finding your newbie guild master?)<br>
<br>
I meet lots of nice people, explored, made many great deals.<br>
<br>
How many hours per week on average did you spend playing?<br>
<br>
20-30ish<br>
<br>
Were you a part of a large guild? A small guild? Guildless?<br>
<br>
I was guildless for the last 30% of my playing time.<br>
<br>
What was the greatest part of the game? What gave you warm fuzzies?<br>
<br>
Helping other people, making a great deal in Ecommons. Meeting people from all over the world.<br>
<br>
What was the worst part of the game or the thing you hated most?<br>
<br>
Inconsiderate players, camp stealers, corpse recovery, losing exp.<br>

I made friends in EQ but none of my RL friends played.<br>

I just didn't have time. Essentally it came to the point where it would take more work to improve my avatar then it would myself. And there was always that voice in the back of my head warning me that this would all be meaningless a decade from now.<br>
<br>
Did you do anything as a last hurrah? Hand over your epic to the banker? Go PvP? Get yourself banned? Care to send a screenshot?<br>
<br>
No, though I wish I had given up my stuff to friends. I always humored the idea of going back but I can't really now. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 362<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(11/3/01 8:14:02 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~derek/201.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: !</span><hr size=1> Here you go Alihja =) I'm happy to oblige.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Did you feel that you accomplished all that you wanted to accomplish within the game? Did you leave anything undone?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I'm quite content with what I experienced and accomplished in EQ before I left. I would have liked to hit 60th level, and completed my Velious Skyshrine quest armor, or at the least have gotten a Tolans BP and Greaves. No biggie though, EQ was good to me. I still sleep well at night ;-)<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What sorts of things did you accomplish before you left? (Epic? Tov? Finding your newbie guild master?)</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I completed my ranger epic quest, I completed the helm of the tracker quest, I completed the first goal I ever made which was to get a full suit of planar armor (Thorny Vine), I have been in every zone except VP, PoM, and ST (only one I regret not seeing is Sleepers Tomb). I participated in a lot of high end raids against gods, dragons, named gaints, TOV raids, etc etc during my time in EQ. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       How many hours per week on average did you spend playing?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
During my heyday probably about 40 hours a week. For the last 8 months of EQ probably 15 hours or 20 hours a week tops. My interest was slowly tappering off.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Were you a part of a large guild? A small guild? Guildless?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
During my time on Solusek Ro I started and led my own guild from 6/99 thru 8/00. When I transferred over to Druzzil Ro I joined Valiant Hearts, which later merged in to Mythic Legion, after about ~5 months in ML I left the guild and later went to Valiant Elite. After spending around 8 months in VE I left for Imperial Guards. Thats a total of four guilds on Druzzil Ro, one of which I would classify as a large guild, two are medium sized guilds, and one I would consider small at the time. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What was the greatest part of the game? What gave you warm fuzzies?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> <br>
Starting and leading my own guild was probably the best experience I ever had. I made a lot of very good friends, so good that later that year we had a RL get-together in Cincinnati. Had about 30 people show up, all people who I became friends with from playing a silly online game;-) ...I also enjoyed completing quests. I enjoyed big guild raids/hunts that had a good background to them. I really enjoyed getting in to the game, quests, raids with a good background to them, norrath history, etc etc. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       What was the worst part of the game or the thing you hated most?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
I think overall EQ is simply too hard of a game that demands on the average too much of a players time to really accomplish something or acquire some cool item. Camping and all the ridiculous time sinks in EQ are no good as well. I didnt care for the real arrogant players or guilds that felt that their commitment to EQ was a legitimate excuse to be a bully or to look down on others as second class citizens. I started playing EQ since day 1, maybe I'm being niave but it seemed  the playerbase used to be better, more mature, and more friendly than they are now? Thats how I felt for the last several months playing EQ. I am very critical of Everquests class system. In the least it is very unbalanced, at most its a total POS that penalizes certain players for the last 10 levels of the game. EQ has a class balance issue from levels 50th to 60th, that has more to do with poor game design than anything else. All of the classes are relatively fun good classes, but their place in the game (or lack thereof) is what I am talking about. I would liked to have seen a more robust trade skills system in EQ. EQ doesnt give the players a lot of choice in things they can do to advance themselves or interact with the game. The trade skill system is sub-par for the most part, a lot of the quest rewards are sub-par for their given level needed to complete it, store bought items are crap, etc etc. I understand they didnt want to create a game like UO where a tailor can get to level 50 w/o ever having lifted a sword, but IMO as time has demonstrated, Verant went too far with this fear. Now that the game is very mature I think they can loosen up a bit and really broaden EQ and make it better without fear of making it too easy or allowing players to sidestep key challenges of the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Did you play with friends or family members?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Yes. One of my RL friends got me started on EQ when it came out. Within a month about 6 of my RL friends were all playing EQ on Sol Ro. We started a guild together along with some others we met in-game. It was a total blast. The only family member I have playing EQ is my 23 year old nephew who plays on Sol Ro. He just recently started a few months back and is really enjoying the game.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       When all is said and done, why did you decide to leave EQ? Spouse burn the computer? Lack of time? Doing time?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Well at first it was because I found the &quot;next new MMORPG&quot;, DAOC. However I really dont play that now either, so I must say my main reason for quitting was because of time. Between work and pursuing a masters in education I dont have a lot of extra time left over. I simply grew tired of spending that time sitting in front of a computer &quot;gaming&quot;. It was time to get back to working out, hanging out with my friends, gaining back my social life, etc etc. I'm 31 and single, I'm not going to do any dating being parked in front of my computer every night =P. It was just time to get back to things in life that I had put on hold because I was so engrossed with EQ.<br>
<br>
Overall I miss EQ. I still surf some EQ sites when I'm online. A couple times I have entertained the idea of coming back to EQ with a new character...but for now I did what was right for me, and what I actually wanted to do. Maybe sometime down the road I will play again? Who knows? But for now I'm having fun enjoying parts of life that I really lost touch with over the last 2+ years. <br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>       Did you do anything as a last hurrah? Hand over your epic to the banker? Go PvP? Get yourself banned? Care to send a screenshot?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Nope. Nothing. Speaking for myself, I just faded away.<br>

<br>
So far, the only personal goal which I really wanted to achieve was to finish the Qeynos Badge of Honor quest, second on Druzzil Ro after Banegrivm...and I was there to help him get his.  I was present when a small army of us killed Azibelle Spavin on the first day of the Karana plague, I killed the first Swarm Mother on Druzzil, and got to be part of a month-long GM quest when Velious opened.  Not a huge roleplaying fanatic myself, but it was fun and nice to be able to look back and say that I got to do some fun things.  Other than that, actually owning dragon loot has been a high point, going to Hate and getting to see some &quot;boss&quot; mobs, and having a stranger come up to me and say &quot;Dude, that was badass!&quot; as I solo'd named wurms in Burning Woods.  Yeah, my accomplishments so far have been pretty mundane, but keeping my guild going and staying in touch with a lot of friends in EQ has more than made up for it.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are you still waiting to accomplish? <br>
<br>
I don't care about getting my epic, but I'd like to get the &quot;halfway prize&quot;, the Elaborate Scimitar.  I haven't been to Fear yet, but it'll come eventually.  I play my SK more and more now, so I look forward to meleeing some of the tougher mobs that I've already seen from afar while playing casters.<br>
<br>
<br>
What do you feel will be your next goal after that?<br>
<br>
Probably do some quests, or go to zones I haven't seen.<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you a part of a large or small guild? No guild?<br>
<br>
Smaller guild, the Justice Knights.<br>
<br>
<br>
What still gives you warm fuzzies or happiness in this game?<br>
<br>
Just talking to friends, some who I've known since hunting my first yard trash in Qeynos as a newbie.  Talking to an old friend in EQ is more enjoyable than dinging or getting loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
How many hours per week do you spend playing EQ?<br>
<br>
Anywhere from 10 to 40.<br>
<br>
<br>
Do you play with friends or family members?<br>
<br>
My girlfriend and I are guildmates on the Firiona Vie server, and I know many of the Rutabagas personally.  These are the people that got me hooked on this game.<br>
<br>
<br>
What has you logging back into EQ? I want to know how you feel about the game.<br>
<br>
Before EQ, I played Tribes because I could play the type of game I enjoyed AND talk to my friends.  Before that, I spent a lot of time on IRC, and on BBSs prior to that, but would have to decide between playing games (single player) or chatting.  Now I can do both.  I've always been into fantasy roleplaying since reading the Lone Wolf gamebooks in grade school, and then getting into RPGs with friends in high school.  EQ isn't perfect, but it holds my interest.  <br>
<br>
<br>
If you knew that today would be your last day of playing EQ... what would you do in the game that you've always held yourself back from doing in the past?<br>
<br>
1.) Get together a posse and kill Lieutenant Dagarok...because payback is a b***h.<br>
<br>
2.) Raid downtown Paineel, just because it seems like a nice place to visit.<br>
<br>
3.) Level up my SK, then waltz into Surefall Glade and let them know what I think about their stinking bears.<br>

   <br>
   I don't really know where to start heh.  I helped form and ended up leading a rather successful (at least in my eyes) guild on the server for over 2 years now (3 years next april!).  I've watched my character and my guild grow beyond anything I had ever imagined.  I never expected to do things like Kill Trakanon, visit Veeshan's Peak, and things like, and now doing these things are rather trivial to me and my guild.  Fun still, but not quite the same challenge they used to be. <br>
<br>
   Some of the things I've wanted to do since velious we've accomplished, such as killing Dain (both versions), Vindicator, Statue, Velketor, Kland, Zland, Lend, Sontalak, etc.  <br>
<br>
  On a personal note, My goals of reaching level 60, obtaining my epic, full Kael armor, things like that..I've already done more than I ever expected when starting out in this game, and I hope to continue suprising myself <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Do you play with friends or family members?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
  Not so much as I used to, as many of them have moved on, but during the first year and a half of EQ, I played with quite a few IRL friends.  L`Malla was originally formed between about 6 or 7 IRL friends, and someone that we met online during EQ Beta.   I also had a few IRL friends in other guilds over the years as well..<br>
<br>
  I truely consider all my guildmembers my friends/family members though, and in the past have met up with some of them IRL, which is always fun!<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What has you logging back into EQ? I want to know how you feel about the game.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Did you feel that you accomplished all that you wanted to accomplish within the game? Did you leave anything undone?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Well i havent quit yet.  But i have accomplished all that i really wanted to, except for 2 things:  getting 60, and taking over kaladim.  that's a long story but see my first character ever was a dwarf and i wandered around and found the king in kaladim and was like &quot;someday im gonna overthrow this place&quot; and it hasnt happened yet...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
What sorts of things did you accomplish before you left? (Epic? Tov? Finding your newbie guild master?)<br>
</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
yeah i got my testament of vanear, wasnt *that* hard....dunno why alihja put it in there.  um well what have i accomplished...i dunno really.  it's just a game, i accomplished wasting more than 150 days of my life.  hmm....i met alot of people, made alot of friends...tried to be nice for the most part...hmm.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> How many hours per week on average did you spend playing?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
when i first started timik i'd say about 20 hours a week.  i was addicted.  but now...i dont even play at all....<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Were you a part of a large guild? A small guild? Guildless?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
i was part of the best damn guild in the game, Dragonspine Order.  and if i do quit, im really gonna miss those guys.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What was the greatest part of the game? What gave you warm fuzzies?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
helping out my friends when i knew i'd get killed.  sacrificing myself for others benifit.  i have never really cared if i died, as long as i had fun doing it.  Way back in the day, when i wasnt even known as timik, but as Anakha the barbarian warrior, a guy named Rease who was but a tiny newb, and green to me, decided to take a trip into black burrow.  he died and lost his corpse.  i being the heroic lvl 7 warrior that i was, decided to take it upon myself to lead a suicide mission into the evil lair to find his corpse.  sadly his corpse rotted before i could find it, but damnit, i had fun doing it, and i know he did too.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> What was the worst part of the game or the thing you hated most?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
people being jerks for the sake of being jerks.  simple as that.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Did you play with friends or family members?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
no RL friends or family played the game.  but i've made some great friends through playing EQ.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> When all is said and done, why did you decide to leave EQ? Spouse burn the computer? Lack of time? Doing time? </b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
i dunno really.  i havent left yet.  the reason im thinking of leaving is because i just dont play.  i've got school and then when im not at school or doing stuff with friends, i spend a couple hours playing DAoC, 'cause you dont need to be in a group to get great exp, everybody can solo.  i like to solo.  dont have to waste time trying to find a group.  oh well.<br>

<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> <br>
If you knew that today would be your last day of playing EQ... what would you do in the game that you've always held yourself back from doing in the past?</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
haha, that's easy.  i'd have a drunken party for me and anyone who wanted to come.  the ale's on me folks.  maybe i'd kill myself all the way back down to level 5, that would be fun.  lots of things.<br>
