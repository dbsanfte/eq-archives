It is just as hard to find someone who has not died multiple times on a single raid; sure, it may have been a while since they did, but I'm certain that every one of us over 46 has been &quot;pwned&quot; in the plane of fear, even if it was back when anyone could go in. You can't tell me that this was done because of an adventurous spirit; no, we wanted to see what kinds of goodies we could pull out of there. Certainly, if the place is that dangerous, there must be something worth having.<br><br>Now, let's dispense with the BS and play this game the way it was intended to be played. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uquttepie.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Qutte Pie</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 289<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 5:21:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2141.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.synmicro.com/prod/itempics/parentaladvisory.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why do we play this game?</span><hr size=1> I play this game like I take any hobbie on<br><br>its a fun past time.. <br><br>once i quit the account no ones gonna know that &quot;devious&quot; was there... theres no stone with my name on it or no zone that will echo my name.. <br><br>I was there conqured and defeated what I wanted...and just like any hobbie, when i'm done.. its shelfed. hehe<br><br>I am however not &quot;uber loot orianteded&quot; I got planer gear from VE which I am thankful for.. they gave me one peice of my wizard epic, which i'm thankful for...but I get a AoN and i'll be happy for the rest of my EQ day's.<br><br>I know that my friends , and family that play, we all play to talk to each other(when we are on), we cheer each other on and saport what they want to do, if one of us was to quit.

At any rate, they might still get bored and start killing stuff while hanging out, and they will still eventually level. Hanging out with friends does not automatically cause you to never level. It isn't hard to do those two things at once.<br><br>And if everyone plays for loot, why are there some people that prefer the low level game and continually make a new alt when one character gets too high? (yes I have seen people do this) Banded armor &gt; Planar armor?<br><br>My guild does not have sufficient high levels to provide planar or other similar raids for me to go on, so I sometimes hang out with someone else's guild. I never expect to get anything, I have gone to places where nothing for my class even drops.<br><br>If you play for loot, sure have fun. But don't think that just because you do, that everyone else does as well. I would probably quit the game if I didn't have people I enjoyed playing it with, nice loot is just a bonus I may or may not get. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/hottopic.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse & Amway Rep.</span><br>  Posts: 707<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 5:38:59 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2141.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www3.sympatico.ca/housecalls/nextlevel.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why do we play this game?</span><hr size=1> I play because I like to read message boards and see how many trolls post threads like this with no other posts to their credit.  <br><!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> (Though yours was different by waiting 2 weeks after creation to start the troll).</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br><br>Very amusing hobby of mine.    <p><center><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#008000"><span style="font-weight: 700; background-color: #FFFF00">&nbsp; For tapes or transcripts:  1-800-99-OPRAH&nbsp;</span></font></center><table border="1"><tr><td width="37%"><font face="Verdana"><img border="0" src="http://www3.sympatico.ca/housecalls/alone_in_hate.jpg" width="325" height="63"></font></td><td width="63%" bgcolor="#000000"><span style="letter-spacing: 3pt"><A href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6443"><font size="4" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Mistress Lannella</font></A></span><font face="Verdana" size="4"><font color="#FFFFFF"><BR></font><A href="http://www.thesafehouse.org"><font color="#FFFFFF">Safehouse</font></A><font color="#FFFFFF"> Ring Warden,</font> <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion"><font color="#FFFFFF">Druzzil Ro</font></a><font color="#FFFFFF"><BR>Miragul's 50th Highwayman . .&nbsp; <a href="http://Come.To/TheHighway"><font color="#FFFFFF">Come to the Highway</font></a></font></font><font size="4" color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana"></font></font></td></tr></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uepiphanyeq.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Epiphany EQ</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 5:42:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2141.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.phank.com/avitars/epiphanysmall.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why do we play this game?</span><hr size=1> We play for loot?

I met some great people, made some RL friends, had some fun, but it seemed what I was seeking always eluded my grasp. In the end I got frustrated, was playing out of habit, and honestly wasn't having fun. I had severed ties with some good RL friends, forgot what it meant to go out to the bars/clubs/concerts, forgot what it was like to run, play sports, mountain bike, climb, rappel, hike, go camping, fish, target shoot (HK .45...love it!), drink some beers, smoke cigars, etc etc and MOST IMPORTANTLY GET LAID!<br><br>Life was rough, and all I had was my EQ addiction =(<br><br><br>My second go at EQ is MUCH much less intense, more centered on playing to have fun and if im not having fun I dont play. I had good gear with Belegir before I relinquished him so I am not very motivated to get the &quot;ph4t l00t&quot; now, because I know what it feels like to have epics, good armor, etc etc. I also have fully resumed things I used to do in RL; the stuff I mentioned above. Thus I dont have as much time or want to spend as much time playing EQ anymore.<br><br>I'm fully convinced that if you play EQ for gear you will always be chasing the white elephant. Never fully happy. You will quit frustrated, or simply get bored.  I also think after looking back on it all that having an active and fun real life IS NOT compatible with putting in the level of committment it takes to get to the higher end of EQ. Some of you who are playing the high end game may not have been that active before EQ, and this is a more normal RL routine for you. Great. But I can atest that if you go to grad school full time, work 20 hours per week, and work out 5 days a week you DO NOT have time for EQ. You will be a very casual player at best, and you just may want to spend some of your free time NOT sitting in front of the computer chasing and killing pixels.<br><br>So play the game for fun, dont kill your real life for it....and realize that if you make the committment neccesary for games like EQ you will have to pay the piper at some point. My advice is do what you have to, but if you are playing for loot you will never win. Play for friends, enjoy &quot;today&quot; when you are playing, because at some point it will all go away.<br><br><br>I havent been on in about 3 weeks, and honestly I havent missed it at all.<br><br><br><br><br> <p><b>Elrenn Longstrider</b><br>Ranger of Surefall Glade<br><br><i>Tolan's last student</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A> at: 2/6/02 7:21:59 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=simplee>Simplee</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 7:25:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2141.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: why do we play this game?</span><hr size=1> Nope, changed my mind about my post.

Here is the true story about how I ended up playing EQ.  You may laugh, you may cry, you may hit me with a large trout, but it goes something like this...<br><br>One day, I pay a visit to a few RL friends.  Two are in a Tribes clan with me, and one is playing some game called EverQuest.  I give it only a passing glance, as we have a Tribes match.  (I had a nifty little saying, something about &quot;You can keep that railgun round in your skull to remember me by&quot; or something like that, but...that's another story.)  A few days or weeks later, my girlfriend starts ranting about some game that I just have to get, this same stinking EverQuest deal.  So during a break in our next Tribes ubermatch (!), I take a second look at EQ.  Looks kinda nifty...especially those elf girls.  Then I get a call from the girlfriend, telling me &quot;I've picked out a new computer for you to play EverQuest on, and they're holding it for you at the store.&quot;<br><br>WTF?!!!<br><br>Well, as luck would have it, those RL friends are three members of Rutabaga Paradox.  My girlfriend ran a high-level guild for over a year, played to 59, decided to move to a different server.  Plus, she's a guide and loves it.  I've made lots of friends on Druzzil Ro, many of them being my guildmates.  My collection of loot is incredibly modest...my most prized belongings are my Ruined Tier'Dal Great Staff and the GEBs I got as a gift (thanks Squshifooty!)...but the one thing that keeps me in this blasted game is the RL friends who still play and the in-game friends that I've made over the past year and a half.  I have friends in nearly every guild on the server, the kind of friends that I can have a meaningful conversation with.<br><br>I sincerely miss many who have left Druzzil Ro or EQ entirely, and I've considered leaving more than once, but there are gnomish pirates and wood elf vixens who I would miss too much.  Seeing my good friend Ellixia leave the game a few months ago made me realize that friends in EQ are no different than any other friends in life, whether your conversations are over lunch or over the Internet, if you really get to know them.  <br><br>Loot be damned.
