This negative is called ethereal self, spiritual self, true self, etc there are many names for it.<br><br>Like the picture that Bluetack posted, (I have seen it before many times, for some reason I keep getting this posted to me..lol, but I have huge faith)what you saw on your computer, was different to what you saw when you closed your eyes.....<br><br>This is so in 'life'..what others see of us in life, and what we project of oursleves in life, is not what we project in death.  This is because that which we all can see, and touch ( like furniture, humans, animals, houses, etc, ) produces a negative picture of that which ALL of us can't see or touch (like dreams, visions, pictures of the mind, spirits etc), which also empowers the difference of 'this world' and the 'spiritual world' if you like.  Interestingly enough, in 'this world', a mans wealth is based on his assets, ie.money, posessions etc, but, in the 'spiritual world' or 'negative' world a man's wealth is based on his spiritual enlightenment and development while living on earth.  <br><br>Many are blindfolded into thinking that they must posess this, or have money, a nice house etc, but really, some of your life should be devoted to developing yourslef spiritually,as, when you die( or should I say your body dies), your spiritual self will be placed on the apprpriate higher plane.......unless you have not developed any or very little of it, wherby you will just have to come back = reincarnation.<br><br>Think about it, suffering, as emotionally disturbing as it may be, produces a positive effect by showing you thast there is always a new and different angle to look at things in your life, or anything for that matter - and it should also help you learn something <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    The main factor of life is about 'suffering as individuals' although life can be enjoyable too becuase you have to exprience each given emotion.  (So what about OBE's then Sarah?  -- oh yes sorry!..lol )<br><br>OBE's are the projection of your spiritual self, and can either be drug induced,(mentioned only becuase they can - however I do not recommend the use of drugs) - or you can learn them (a very long process, if anyone tells you they did it within the first couple of tries, they are not being honest), or they can be against your will (meaning that they just happen as in my case)... My first OBE frightened the life out of me!  It really shook me up and scared me, and the first place I was taken to during it was a library.  I did not know what astral projection was at this time, I had never heard of it. I couldn't sleep properley for weeks, and I had a few more OBE's - but then something hit me one day -I realised I had been shown a library because that is where I would find the information of what was happening to me, so I started on my exciting and frightening journey of exploring the world of the occult..<br><br>In the occult world there are many esoteric (secret,private, hidden) factors and practices which go on to this day.  As an onlooker, I learnt all I could, and realised this formed a part of my 'spiritual learning' on earth - I will reveal more I suppose as time goes by <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br><br>If you expreience an OBE then there is a possiblility that it will come to show you something, raise your own perspective on self awareness, or take you on another life path, or impress on your mind to think about things more deeply, there is always a reason for the experience, and I have been to good and what only can be considered as <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   places in my projections, but like life, the good has to be taken with the bad.<br><br>Try to be calm about it, and most of all, don't let it 'control' your life.  OBE's are powerful expriences that can impress the subconsious self into becoming totally focused on this type of thing that normal life obligations go out the window.  If any of you want to learn more about the occult, or related things, do it with an open mind, and please be careful.....I know from experience that there are a few <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   people out there that will try to influence you if they suspect your new to the workings of the unexplained.

I've had flying dreams, underwater breathing dreams, and dreams so vivid I could swear they were real life experiences.  It's only when I wake up that I am disappointed to find I was 'dreaming'.
