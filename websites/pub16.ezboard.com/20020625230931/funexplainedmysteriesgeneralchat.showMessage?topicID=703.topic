1. INTRODUCTION <br>
Worldwide controversy has been generated recently from several court decisions in the United States which have restricted popular magazines from printing articles which describe how to make an atomic bomb. The reason usually given by the courts is that national security would be compromised if such information were generally available. But, since it is commonly known that all of the information is publicly available in most major metropolitan libraries, obviously the court's officially stated position is covering up a more important factor; namely, that such atomic devices would prove too difficult for the average citizen to construct. The United States courts cannot afford to insult the vast majorities by insinuating that they do not have the intelligence of a cabbage, and thus the &quot;official&quot; press releases claim national security as a blanket restriction. <br>
<br>
The rumors that have unfortunately occurred as a result of widespread misinformation can (and must) be cleared up now, for the construction project this month is the construction of a thermonuclear device, which will hopefully clear up any misconceptions you might have about such a project. We will see how easy it is to make a device of your very own in ten easy steps, to have and hold as you see fit, without annoying interference from the government or the courts. <br>
<br>
The project will cost between $5,000 and $30,000, depending on how fancy you want the final product to be. Since last week's column, &quot;Let's Make a Time Machine&quot;, was received so well in the new step-by-step format, this month's column will follow the same format. <br>
<br>
2. CONSTRUCTION METHOD <br>
<br>
1. First, obtain about 50 pounds (110 kg) of weapons grade Plutonium at your local supplier (see NOTE 1). A nuclear power plant is not recommended, as large quantities of missing Plutonium tends to make plant engineers unhappy. We suggest that you contact your local terrorist organization, or perhaps the Junior Achievement in your neighborhood. <br>
2. Please remember that Plutonium, especially pure, refined Plutonium, is somewhat dangerous. Wash your hands with soap and warm water after handling the material, and don't allow your children or pets to play in it or eat it. Any left over Plutonium dust is excellent as an insect repellant. You may wish to keep the substance in a lead box if you can find one in your local junk yard, but an old coffee can will do nicely. <br>
3. Fashion together a metal enclosure to house the device. Most common varieties of sheet metal can be bent to disguise this enclosure as, for example, a briefcase, a lunch pail, or a Buick. Do not use tinfoil. <br>
4. Arrange the Plutonium into two hemispherical shapes, separated by about 4 cm. Use rubber cement to hold the Plutonium dust together. <br>
5. Now get about 100 pounds (220 kg) of trinitrotoluene (TNT). Gelignite is much better, but messier to work with. Your helpful hardware man will be happy to provide you with this item. <br>
6. Pack the TNT around the hemisphere arrangement constructed in step 4. If you cannot find Gelignite, feel free to use TNT packed in with Playdo or any modeling clay. Colored clay is acceptable, but there is no need to get fancy at this point. <br>
7. Enclose the structure from step 6 into the enclosure made in step 3. Use a strong adhesive such as &quot;Crazy Glue&quot; to bind the hemisphere arrangement against the enclosure to prevent accidental detonation which might result from vibration or mishandling. <br>
8. To detonate the device, obtain a radio controlled (RC) servo mechanism, as found in RC model airplanes and cars. With a modicum of effort, a remote plunger can be made that will strike a detonator cap to effect a small explosion. These detonator caps can be found in the electrical supply section of your local supermarket. We recommend the &quot;Blast-O-Matic&quot; brand because they are no deposit-no return. <br>
9. Now hide the completed device from the neighbors and children. The garage is not recommended because of high humidity and the extreme range of temperatures experienced there. Nuclear devices have been known to spontaneously detonate in these unstable conditions. The hall closet or under the kitchen sink will be perfectly suitable. <br>
10. Now you are the proud owner of a working thermonuclear device! It is a great ice-breaker at parties, and in a pinch, can be used for national defense. <br>
<br>
3. THEORY OF OPERATION <br>
The device basically works when the detonated TNT compresses the Plutonium into a critical mass. The critical mass then produces a nuclear chain reaction similar to the domino chain reaction (discussed in this column, &quot;Dominos on the March&quot;, March, 1967). The chain reaction then promptly produces a big thermonuclear reaction. And there you have it, a 10 megaton explosion! <br>
<br>
4. NEXT MONTH'S COLUMN <br>
In next month's column, we will learn how to clone your neighbor's wife in six easy steps. This project promises to be an exciting weekend full of fun and profit. Common kitchen utensils will be all you need. See you next month! <br>
<br>
NOTES <br>
1. Plutonium (PU), atomic number 94, is a radioactive metallic element formed by the decay of Neptunium and is similar in chemical structure to Uranium, Saturnium, Jupiternium, and Marsium. <br>

Ashcroft: Captured Man Planned 'Dirty' Bomb Attack<br>
<br>
By TED BRIDIS<br>
.c The Associated Press <br>
<br>
WASHINGTON (June 10) -- The government arrested a man with an alleged al-Qaida connection and suspected of plotting to build and detonate a radioactive ''dirty'' bomb in an attack in the United States, possibly against Washington, Attorney General John Ashcroft said Monday.<br>
<br>
Ashcroft said that Abdullah Al Mujahir, also known as Jose Padilla, was in the custody of the U.S. military and was being treated as an enemy combatant. This suggests plans for the first military tribunal of an alleged terrorist since the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon were struck Sept. 11 by hijacked commercial airliners.<br>
<br>
The attorney general, who was in Moscow, made the announcement through a television hookup.<br>
<br>
Ashcroft said that Mujahir was arrested May 8 as he flew from Pakistan into Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.<br>
<br>
''We have disrupted an unfolding terrorist plot to attack the United States by exploding a radioactive dirty bomb,'' he said, adding that the government's suspicions about Mujahir's plans came from ''multiple, independent, corroborating sources.''<br>
<br>
A senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity said Mujahir was trained by al-Qaida in Afghanistan and Pakistan to wire explosives and to research radioactive dispersal devices. He was not believed to have had a bomb at the time of his apprehension.<br>
<br>
''We don't believe it went beyond the planning stages,'' the official said.<br>
<br>
Mujahir was taken Monday morning to a high-security U.S. Navy brig in Charleston, S.C., said Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Rivers Johnson, who said Mujahir was transferred from Justice Department custody in New York City.<br>
<br>
Military officials have not decided whether to charge Mujahir or what charges to file, the military spokesman said.<br>
<br>
Mujahir had a lawyer in New York but his access to a lawyer probably will be severely restricted now that he is in military custody, Johnson said. He said the alleged al-Qaida operative was being held separately from other prisoners at the brig.<br>
<br>
Ashcroft said Mujahir had served prison time in the United States in the early 1990s, then traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan during 2001 and met with al-Qaida officials. Ashcroft said Mujahir ''trained with the enemy, including studying how to wire explosive devices and researching radiological dispersion devices.''<br>
<br>
Ashcroft said al-Qaida apparently believed that Mujahir would be permitted to travel freely within the United States because of his U.S. citizenship and because he carried a U.S. passport.<br>
<br>
The probable target of Mujahir's plans to detonate the bomb was Washington, according to a U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br>
<br>
Another government official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, said the intelligence that led to Mujahir's arrest came from captured al Qaida leader Abu Zubaydah during recent interrogations.<br>
<br>
This official said Mujahir is a former Chicago street gang member who converted to Islam after serving time in the United States, and met with an al-Qaida leader in 2001, before returning to the United States.<br>
<br>
Said Ashcroft: ''We have acted with legal authority both under the laws of war and clear Supreme Court precedent, which establishes that the military may detain a United States citizen who has joined the enemy and has entered our country to carry out hostile acts.''<br>
<br>
Mujahir discussed several terrorist plans with Abu Zubaydah, the bin Laden lieutenant now in U.S. custody, according to a U.S. official.<br>
<br>
Mujahir first met with Abu Zubaydah in Afghanistan in 2001, and traveled to Pakistan at Abu Zubaydah's request, the official said, adding that he was one of a group that traveled with Abu Zubaydah to several locations in Pakistan.<br>
<br>
Mujahir and another unidentified associate researched dirty bombs in Lahore, Pakistan, the official said.<br>
<br>
''The radiological device plan articulated by (Mujahir) Padilla and his associate was in the planning stages, and no specific time was set to occur,'' the official said.<br>
<br>
At Abu Zubaydah's behest, he also traveled to Karachi, Pakistan, to meet with several senior al-Qaida operatives, to discuss the plan, the official said. Mujahir also was interested in plans to bomb hotel rooms and gas stations in the United States, the official said.<br>
<br>
It was unclear whether any of these meetings took place after Sept. 11.<br>
<br>
President Bush, based on recommendations from Ashcroft and White House councel Al Gonzales, designated the suspect as a combatant in papers signed late Sunday. That designation allowed the Department of Defense to take custody of Mujahir from the Department of Justice.<br>
<br>
''Based on the facts in this case and the importance of protecting sources who helped us get him, the determination was made that DOD is best for his detention,'' an official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. This official said the administration does not know how close the suspect was to obtaining a so-called ''dirty bomb.''<br>

<br>
The possibility of a genuine fission bomb being smuggled into or created within the US should not be overlooked. The above article was only black humour and totally unworkable even should you obtain Plutonium. However, fission technology is over 50 years old. Russian soldiers, nuclear physicists and engineers are wathing their families starve. Terrorist organisations are well financed. Reactors capable of producing weapons grade enriched Uranium are almost common. Uranium is not a rare element in nature. Nuclear terrorism is the most fearful modern threat facing us. The cold war may be over but hate will always exist.  <p>
