The giants you can blame on faction I suppose, but there is no reason that there arent people in chardok starting zone groups to get the nice loot.  Has anyone ever wanted to hunt in either of these zones?? Looking at the massive population of Sebilis and Karnor, why wouldnt people want to go to a place like Chardok?  Why arent there more generic groups in Kael for getting faction for an entire group or perhaps the nice loot?  Just a bit of a rant, but It would be nice to see some interest provoked in these two zones.   I think we can all agree that choices are good, especially choices to get away from KC <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Chardok.  Good hunting unused??</span><hr size=1> I've seen pseudo pick-up groups in Kael, but most of the higher level game is based on good giant faction, so you aren't going to see folks IN Kael killing a lot of giants since by the time you are strong enough to do that, you want to be in their good graces.<br>
<br>
Chardok, well, that's another story.<br>
<br>
This is one of the oddest and buggiest zones I've hunted.  Anyone who's ever been in there has seen the magical flashing MOB at the zonein/zoneout.  Anyone who's been deeper has seen pathing that makes MOBs run 2.5 miles to get back to beating on a warrior who backed up 2 steps and has seen Agro issues that have trains piling on from seemingly nowhere.<br>
<br>
Pulling anything beyond the castle is a nightmare, especially un-SoWed, and a good zone-out group will need to do that to keep experience flowing between respawns.  If you are crazy enough to pull the tunnel you'll pick up extras almost every pull and if you go further back in the castle you'll cross a bridge lined with MOBs who like to stun you off.  Enchanters and/or FD pullers are simply a must.<br>
<br>
Add to that the fact that the loot, with the exception of the shield, sucks rocks until you get really deep in.<br>
<br>
So, the only folks you're likely to find in Chardok are (grudgingly) doing the royals for epic quests or working the zoneout until they are forced to do one too many CRs.  Then they go to Seb or HS <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Kael- Hmmm....I guess what you are saying Filo is since all the top end zones like Dragon Necropolis, Sleepers Tomb, and Temple of Veeshan are dragon inhabited you are forced in to siding with the giants? Also I know their quests reward the best items. Can you still be on good terms with the giants and also be on good terms with the dwarves simply from spening time killing dragons only? Or will you be on good terms with the Kromzek but still KOS to the Kromrif without killing dwarves?<br>

<br>
You need Giant faction to do the best quests in the game (take a look at the armor quests from the 3 factions, you'll notice that there is a clear progression of Dwarf -&gt; Dragon -&gt; Giant in the quality of the items obtained.<br>
<br>
Plus, Kael is the most central city in Velious so it's a convenient place to be bound and to bank.<br>
<br>
You could probably lead a life that lets you into any two of these faction areas, but you'll too poorly factioned to do quests in any of them.<br>

Chardok.  Good hunting unused??</span><hr size=1> Ill have to disagree with all of you there... <br>
<br>
First off, Giants arent the best people to have faction with.  If you kill giants, then your quest opprotunities with the Coldain as well as the Dragons open up.... otherwise you have just giant faction, and even then those opprotunities are based on your class and what armor you want.  The Rowlys Breastplate of Nature, for instance, is MUCH better than the giant version of that peice... and one of the items needed to aquire it are located on very killable mobs in Kael.  Of course, there are giant versions that are better, but Im speaking in a druid frame of mind.  Just the many options I would have if I were to gain the trust of the Dragons and the coldain make me want to kill giants.  Besides that, on a roleplay veiwpoint its only respectable to kill the evil dragons...<br>
<br>
As for Chardok, Ive hunted there about 4 times (not counting the countless times Ive went in there LFG).  Only once did I get the magical floating mob... and my other hunting experiences there were fantastic.  And if you complain about bugs and training, then why would hunt in a zone like KC??  People complain about the loot in Chardok (cause the exp is freaking amazing) but its my opinion that they have 1 or two bad days with little loot and give up there. ( In my time there ive seen: 2 silver swiftblades, a Sarnak Battle Shield, a Golem Tear ring, Jagged Chokadai Spine, etc)  What if everyone who didnt get any loot in a marathon of KC killing just up and left the zone?  All Im saying is that compared to our other choices, Chardok is a really nice zone to hunt in.  And the reasons Ive seen so far for its underusage dont seem like problems at all comparitively....  Interesting topic though.<br>

In order to get all 3 giant factions up, for instance, I had to hunt Skyshrine and Icewell Keep (coldain)<br>
<br>
I agree that killing dwarves bothered me from both an RP and an accessibility perspective, but eventually you just have to make a choice.<br>
<br>
When it comes right down to it, of the 3 characters in my oversized and gaudy sig image, each is on a different faction <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for Chardok, I agree that the experience can be pretty good, but it's really more geared to higher levels (i.e. a group of 50-52 won't kill fast enough to get good exp here).  The loot and pathing still stink <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
And, at this point, I'd never suggest that anyone hunt in KC.  When Kunark first came out it was a good place, but now it's filled with utterly incompetent newbies, bad pullers and otherwise useless and annoying sorts. . .  I don't even like going in for evacs to SF and EJ since I get trained out half the time I try even that.<br>
<br>
In any case, wherever you hunt it's the folks you bring with you that determine your success.  A good crew in any experience giving dungeon will work wonders. <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

Well let me post a question then about the three chief races in Velious. Which ones are the &quot;bad guys&quot;? Are the giants actually evil, or are the dragons evil, or could the lovable little coldain be the evil ones?<br>
<br>
I guess how I view it now (and correct me if I am wrong), is that the coldain are basically the good guys(underdogs), the giants are a bunch of warlike savages wanting to eradicate the other 2 chief races in Velious, and the dragons are more neutral but have found themselves being hunted by the giants and henceforth have allied with the dwarves against a common enemy.<br>
<br>
Also as a tunare-worshipping ranger the fact that the storm giants are knowingly trying to invade an ancient forest and slay or drive out Tunare's creatures doesnt that mean from a RP'ing sense that a wood elf ranger would not side with the giants, and probably find them as the evil ones?<br>
<br>
I know Verant doesnt give two shits about RP'ing in EQ but I still do a little bit, and I dont like to do real cheesy stuff just for the nookie ya know?<br>

To do Kael armor quests you need Tormax faction.  Tormax faction is dang hard to get if you don't opt to killing dwarfs.<br>

If you try to go dragon faction that will keep you out of Sleepers tomb and most of WW.<br>
<br>
I don't believe any of the races are evil.  Giants are warriors.  Drawfs are miners/tinkers.  Dragons are intellectuals.  That is the classic role play angle on these races.<br>
<br>
Giants are not savages and they call the others the same names :P<br>
<br>
Also, when has VI stayed pure on any role playing?  I still am disappointed because as a troll I couldn't get Freeport faction.

Skyshrine is a bit easier, and then Thurgadin is fairly easy considering no one starts KoS there in the first place.<br>
<br>
Thurgadin armor is, however, alot easier to get and probably the people that aren't members of pretty large guilds or have a lack of high level friends would find it better to side with the Coldain as opposed to the giants because the armor quests are so much easier. While the Kael armor is better, the chances of seeing it are pretty low to someone that isn't friends with a bunch of really high levels.<br>
<br>
You can, however, kill the giants that drop the armor for Thurgadin quests with 2 50-55ish groups pretty easily. And eventually, killing giants will raise your faction up with Skyshrine (unless you do choose to kill them too), which, if you ever do get really high level, gives you armor that's not too far behind Kael stuff. <p><hr><a href=mailto:Vikki_Silver@yahoo.com>Vikkie T`Valorous</a><br>54th Cavalier of Mithaniel Marr<br>Avatar of Valor<br>Druzzil Ro<hr></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=707.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=704.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=688.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=688.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=688.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=688.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">Nasty Post Void</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion>General Discussion</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3.5<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
