<br>
During the period now known as “the Holy Inquisition”, thousands of women were put to death (usually by burning, or under torture) for ‘witchcraft’.<br>
<br>
Although this was NOT a purely Catholic practice – many women also died during this period in ‘protestant’ England &amp; Wales - the systematic persecution of women during this period was primarily instigated &amp; perpetuated by the ‘Office of  The Holy Inquisition”, a  pillar of the Catholic Church, orchestrated through the office of the  “Grand Inquisitor” – the head of the Inquisition.<br>
<br>
Does the Inquisition still exist? <br>
<br>
Well, actually, yes it does.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   The body responsible for this persecution still exists today, although it is now known as the “Congregation for the Doctrines of the Faith” [CDF]: however, it is still the same institution – it hasn’t gone away.<br>
<br>
Bizarrely, the institution was still known as “The Holy Inquisition” until the latter half of the 20th Century (until 1962, to be precise), when it’s name was changed and the office of “Grand Inquisitor” became the office of “Prefect” of the Congregation.<br>
<br>
This office is currently held by Cardinal Ratzinger, who made the headlines a couple of years ago by publicly stating that the Church should remain open to the possibility of extra- terrestrial life. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 0] --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/alien.gif ALT="0]"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Is the Church also open to the possibility that women can play an equal role in society?  Does it still hold to the biblical injunction that “Thou shalt not permit a sorceress to live” [Exodus 22:18] ?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
What do you think – were the witch trials simply the product of mass-hyteria and the sexist/ misogynistic attitudes of the time. wipped up by paranoid, reactionary religious institutions … how far has society/  religious institutions etc really moved on??  Do the same attitudes still exist, but maybe reflect themselves in different ways today…<br>
<br>
I’d be interested to know what people think!<br>

I've read about that as well.<br>
<br>
The witch burners were pious, pompous and pontificating. They really got off on the power, too. Well, I have a LOT of other thoughts about this, but am nodding here at the PC. LOL. So will come back after some sleep and write more.<br>

<br>
Hundreds of years ago, Europe &amp; America were much greener/ wilder places than (sadly) they are today … vast acres of forests still remained, even here in the UK.<br>
<br>
The Church feared this … all this wilderness represented something untamed &amp; (seemingly) untameable , something threatening and beyond control.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Clerics (I’m talking here about mainstream, Roman, Dominican clerics) tended to live slightly removed from their ‘flocks’, and from the realities of everyday life.  Christian clerics who tried to live more humbly &amp; in-touch with people (such as the Franciscans or other ‘roaming’ clerics)  ended up suffering persecution. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In this climate, any person who appeared to have any knowledge/ understanding of the rythms of ‘nature’ – who could read the seasons, understand animal husbandry, have knowledge of cures/ remedies etc – would automatically fall under suspicion.<br>
<br>
Basically, nature was regarded (by the Roman Church) as essentially malevolent, even evil.<br>
<br>
A fascinating illustration of this: has anyone heard of the pagan deity known as ‘Pan’??<br>
<br>
Pan represented nature &amp; (more subtly) sexuality: he was half-goat, half-human, had horns and hoves etc, (sound familiar?).  He was not a malevolent deity, and had no pagan associations with ‘evil’, in any sense.<br>
<br>
However (the theory goes) the Christian Church, fearful of nature (and, arguably, also of sexuality) took the characteristics of Pan and used them to charcterise and depict Satan: they – quite literally – demonised him! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A couple of interesting links about Pan:<br>

<br>
Anyway … (erm, where was I??!) …basically, I think the seeds were sown  by the Church and then, like you both said SK/ Dottie .. I guess superstition, mass-hysteria (and, yep…also greed) did the rest.  Plus the prevailing social attitudes of the time – esp. towards women. <br>
<br>
Anyone else got any opinions about this???  (Or interesting links etc)<br>

&quot;Meet Pan. The early Christians modeled Lucifer's image after him.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paulbst .... excellent websites! <br>
<br>
I certainly understand when you say, &quot;In this climate, any person who appeared to have any knowledge/ understanding of the rythms of ‘nature’ – who could read the seasons, understand animal husbandry, have knowledge of cures/ remedies etc – would automatically fall under suspicion.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, they would in deed. Ergo ... witches and warlocks. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So sad and tragic. These people were way ahead of their time in a way. Past cultures were far more advanced in these areas and it was most acceptable.<br>
<br>
How awful to have lived in such an age, place and culture of that kind of ignorance, fear and superstition. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for your thoughts ... all makes perfect sense.<br>

<br>
My *personal* opinion is that - far from being some sort of 'mis-reading' of Christianity - the Inquisition and the witch trials, the persecution of women, 'heretics' etc, were actually ... not sure how to phrase this ... simply another aspect (or manifestation-) of  Judaism &amp; Christianity...<br>
<br>
The Old Testament [OT] - for example - contains a litany of examples of God causing untold suffering, either directly or by 'command' (I’ll attach some examples of this @ the end of this reply).<br>

#Has anyone heard of the Jewish Rebellion, in AD65?<br>
<br>
This rebellion triggered the Jewish-Roman War, which resulted in the deaths of up to 1.5 million people, the destruction of Jerusalem [in AD70 ], and the end of the ‘line of David’ – which God had promised would last for all time.<br>
<br>
These horrible events occurred precisely because the Jews believed what they were told in (what we now call) the Old Testament… that they were Gods chosen people, that they (and only they) would go to heaven, that they were living in the ‘Last Days’, that God would soon (bloodily) intervene &amp; restore the Jewish people to their rightful place of pre-eminence, by obliterating their enemies.<br>
<br>
When the rebellion started, the Jews lashed out not only against the Romans, but any gentiles (non Jews) that they could find, and sacked city after city.. slaughtering many thousands of people.  These actions were based on ‘scripture’  [check out the list below for examples <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ].<br>

SOME EXAMPLES FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT:    <br>
<br>
Gen. 7 - God kills almost all living things on the Earth, through the famous Flood. The reason given is that every man except Noah was wicked (Gen. 6:12). Apparently this is good enough reason to kill not only a huge amount of people (including, obviously, many babies and children who could not possibly have done anything wrong) but also nearly all the animals living on land.<br>
<br>
Gen. 19 - God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their inhabitants (which must have included many innocent infants and children). <br>
<br>
Ex. 12 - God kills all the first-born in Egypt. <br>
<br>
Ex. 21:20-21 - God makes it allowable to beat a slave to death unless he dies quickly.<br>
<br>
Num. 15:32-36 - God orders a man stoned to death for gathering sticks for a fire on the Sabbath.<br>
<br>
Num. 16:27-35 - God kills men, women and small children by making the ground split under them. He also kills 250 men by fire.<br>
<br>
Num. 16:49 - A plague from God kills 14,700 people.<br>
<br>
Num. 21:3,6 - God gives the Israelites power to utterly destroy the Canaanites. A few verses later (v.6) he sends fiery serpents that killed many Israelites.<br>
<br>
Num. 21:35 - Another act of genocide, this time it was the people of Og that were exterminated.<br>
<br>
Num. 25:9 - God sends another plague, this time killing 24,000.<br>
<br>
Num. 31:9,17,18 - The Israelites take women and children captive. Later God says, &quot;kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known a man intimately. But keep alive for yourself all the young girls who have not known a man intimately.&quot; <br>
<br>
Deut. 7:2 - God orders the Israelites to utterly destroy without mercy any people he gives them for defeat.<br>
<br>
Deut. 20:16 - The Israelites are commanded &quot;not to leave anything that breathes alive&quot; in the cities God gives them as an &quot;inheritance&quot;.<br>
<br>
Jos. 1:1-9,18 - Joshua is given God's blessing and permission for the violence and slaughters in the following chapters.<br>
Jos. 6:21-27; 7:19-26; 8:22-25; 10:10-40 - With God's blessing and permission, the Israelites kills and &quot;utterly destroys&quot; an enormous amount of people, including women, children and old people.<br>
<br>
Judges 20:23,28 - God tells Israel to slaughter the entire tribe of Benjamin.<br>
<br>
1. Sam. 6:19 - God murders 50,070 men for having looked into the Ark.<br>
<br>
1. Sam. 15:3,7-8 - On God's command, and with his help, Saul &quot;utterly destroys&quot; the Amalekites.<br>
<br>
2. Sam - This entire book lists numerous assaults made by David on a lot of other people living in the region, slaughtering hundreds of thousands of them. This is all done with God's blessing.<br>

Well, the OT also states, &quot;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth&quot; whereas the NT states to &quot;turn the other cheek&quot; and to &quot;forgive seventy times 7&quot; (in other words ... always be forgiving).

<br>
Yes, most tragic. Again ... we are talking Old Testament here. Also we are talking &quot;humans&quot; and war. Religious wars have occurred all throughout time and look at Ireland even today. Yep, people. Not necessarily the &quot;will of God&quot;. It is my opinion that the Supreme One wants every one of every religion, faith, belief system ... to get along and love one another. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Quote: &quot;the Old Testament (which was written by &amp; for the Hebrews/ Jews) takes up the first three-quarters of the Bible.. are we supposed to believe that everything in it was meant 'metaphorically'? That the Jews were simply being incredibly DUMB in not realizing this??&quot;<br>
<br>
Nope ... not dumb ... just VERY strict and showing no mercy nor forgiveness.<br>
Remember, to them a sin was a sin no matter what. People caught working on the Sabbath suffered the same punishment as a murderer ... that punishment was death. Things changed with the New Testament ... changed a LOT! <br>
<br>
Quote: &quot;The atrocities and bloodshed of the Jewish-Roman War arose precisely because the Jews believed what they read in the Bible… and carried it out: they believed that they *were* doing 'the will of God'... &quot;<br>
<br>
Yep, so tragic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As you said, that was their &quot;belief&quot; ... not necessarily what God really had in mind so to speak. So tragic.<br>
<br>
Okay ... Genesis 7 and 9 in my opinion are parables like we were talking about before. The author telling the story to get a message across in a manner that people at that time could grasp. &quot;The Wrath Of God&quot; stuff. So sad.<br>
<br>
At any rate (and referring to all the other quotes), the Old Testament is the Book of &quot;Law and Punishment&quot;. Lots of wars and stuff. Again. the &quot;Wrath of God&quot; so to speak. So sad. <br>
<br>
That is why Jesus was such a welcome concept to so many. He was the first to teach and practice &quot;Mercy and Forgiveness&quot; .... something that was wanted so badly by so many. Before Jesus, it was believed once you commit a sin ... it stays with you and you will not be forgiven by God or your fellow man for that sin. Jesus changed that mind set and people were so open to this ... Like I said, the people wanted this &quot;forgiveness&quot; and &quot;mercy&quot; so much. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Hey, Paul ... great talking with you! Lets talk some more. This is so interesting to be able to discuss religion and to disagree with each other without jumping down each other's throats in a heated argument (which happens so often ... sad.)<br>

Hi rhoadesb ... I guess what you were saying was that there is a distinction between Christian*ity* (in its organised, institutional form)  and Christ*ians*.. I do understand what you're saying there:  it's unfair to paint all Christians - many of whom do have v. sincere beliefs and live by them - with the same brush, and try to make them all 'accountable' for the various injustices &amp; inhumanities perpetrated by Christian <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>   institutions</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->.  Yes.. I absolutely agree with that. (I guess I must admit, as a humanist, that this is an easy 'trap' to fall into).<br>

<br>
I guess you could say that the sort of ‘sub-question’ of this topic is ‘why did the witch trials happen?’, and the, erm.. sub-sub-question here is ‘what part did Christianity play in this?’<br>
<br>
I would say – a major part, but I suppose it depends what you mean by Christianity … a very simple question (to anyone who feels like addressing it): is - is the Bible ‘Christianity’? (Or conversely, ‘is Christianity the Bible’)? Does one equal the other?<br>
<br>
The ferocious behaviour of the Jews during the Rebellion (AD65-73), the massacre of so many entire city populations … WAS Biblical … it was based on scripture.   Go back to the loooooong list above if you wish to check this out. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The persecution of witches during the Inquisition also carried a certain amount of Biblical authority:  derived for instance from the ‘sorceress’ quote from Exodus.<br>
<br>
The thing I don’t understand is this:  if there is a supreme creator being, how do we know what Her [just to be pedantically awkward &amp; PC!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    ] ‘Will’ actually is?  If the Bible represents Gods will, then the Jews were acting in accordance with Her Will, as they ethnically cleansed all those cities during the Roman War<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    :  arguably, so were the Inquisitors who were so determined to identify ‘sorceresses’ so that they should not be ‘permitted to live’ any longer.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    <br>
<br>
Newtown (where I live) is quite old-fashioned in some ways:  it has even more churches (about 25-30, for a pop. of 10,000 people)  than pubs [public houses: bars]<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     !!  I’m not being ageist/ sexist here, but I quite often get elderly women coming up to me in the street, trying to tell me the ‘Good News’ &amp; share the ‘Word of God’ with me:  they’re not used to chatting to a fanatical humanist/ atheist who has also actually READ the Bible – ask Christians about what the Bible actually SAYS, and they tend (in my experience) to become confused, muddled and evasive, and resort to ‘the Lord works in mysterious ways’ type statements.<br>
<br>
Either the Bible is ‘the Word of God’ or it isn’t:: if it is then inhumanity &amp; atrocity ARE an integral part of the tapestry of Christianity, and the Jewish nationalists,  Christian crusaders, zealous Inquisitors etc WERE doing Gods willl ..  if the Bible does not represent ‘Gods will’ then what does?  How can we possibly know what ‘Gods will’ actually is? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :\ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":\"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
## I’ve read loads about the origins of the Bible… it’s amazing how many gospels/ scriptures existed (even, exist) which were not included in ‘The Bible’:  when the Council of Nicea met in AD325, they chose 4 gospels (the now-familiar versions of Mathew, Mark, Luke &amp; John) out of <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    forty</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> presented to them, and out of an estimated total of over <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>    300 [three hundred!]</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> gospels known to exist @ the time.  How do we know that [if God exists] that His/ Her word was not actually contained in some of these, now largely forgotten gospels?   Some still exist – such as the Gospel of St Barnabas, the most famous I think.<br>
<br>
The Dead Sea Scrolls also contain zillions (well, okay, quite a few!) versions of Biblical texts, many of which are different and all of which are much older, compared to the versions that appear in ‘The Bible’.<br>
<br>
Anyway, blah-blah, yada-yada<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    … I’m going on again with my usual secular zeal, so I’ll shut up.  Please don’t get me wrong … I’m not ‘dissing’ peoples sincerely held beliefs – I’ve no idea (of course) whether God exists, or indeed whether Allah, Jahweh, Jehovah, Amon Ra, Isis <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->    [my favourite ‘non-existent’ deity!], Osiris,  Bhudda, Zeus, Lillith,  Pandora,  Marduk   etc..etc exist or existed.   And yes, of course faith can be a v. important &amp; positive thing for many people.<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
I simply distrust Christianity (Judaism, Islam etc) as ‘isms’ – as ORGANISED belief systems… basically, I don’t feel they have any basis I’m afraid.<br>
<br>
##Anyway [I'm repeating the end of my 1st posting here!] what do other people think – were the witch trials simply the product of mass-hyteria and the sexist/ misogynistic attitudes of the time. wipped up by paranoid, reactionary religious institutions … how far has society/ have religious institutions etc really moved on?? Do the same attitudes still exist, but maybe reflect themselves in different ways today…<br>
<br>
I’d be interested to know what other people think too!...<br>

Also, heres a quote (from the artmagick.com site) which accompanied their scan of this painting...<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>    &quot;A magic circle was cast to purify and create a perimeter of space wherein evil magic could not enter. Goddesses and good spirits were invited into the circle, which sometimes had powerful, protective stones placed at North, South, East, and West points. Each point was associated with the Four Elements. North was the most powerful direction.

&quot;a very simple question (to anyone who feels like addressing it): is - is the Bible ‘Christianity’? (Or conversely, ‘is Christianity the Bible’)? Does one equal the other?&quot;<br>
<br>
If you are referring to only the Old Testament, no, it does not equal Christianity. Jews go by the Old Testment. Those who abide by the New Testament as well as the Old Testament are Christian. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You ask:<br>
&quot;The thing I don’t understand is this: if there is a supreme creator being, how do we know what Her [just to be pedantically awkward &amp; PC!!  ] ‘Will’ actually is?&quot;<br>
<br>
For Christians and Jews at least, &quot;Her&quot; (I don't feel there is a gender either, but Her is closer than Him <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) ..... will is written in those Scriptures of the Bible and Torah. <br>
<br>
You say:<br>
&quot;If the Bible represents Gods will, then the Jews were acting in accordance with Her Will, as they ethnically cleansed all those cities during the Roman War : arguably, so were the Inquisitors who were so determined to identify ‘sorceresses’ so that they should not be ‘permitted to live’ any longer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Remember there is human factor involved. Humans (presumed by divine intervention) wrote the scriptures and humans fought the wars. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You state:<br>
&quot;ask Christians about what the Bible actually SAYS, and they tend (in my experience) to become confused, muddled and evasive, and resort to ‘the Lord works in mysterious ways’ type statements.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yes, there are many Christians who do not know the Bible the way they could. It is easy to see how you would reach that conclusion. However, there are also many Christians that can quote you chapter and verse for about any situation you may encounter. It's an individual thing once again. <br>
<br>
You say:<br>
&quot;Either the Bible is ‘the Word of God’ or it isn’t:: if it is then inhumanity &amp; atrocity ARE an integral part of the tapestry of Christianity, and the Jewish nationalists, Christian crusaders, zealous Inquisitors etc WERE doing Gods willl .. if the Bible does not represent ‘Gods will’ then what does? How can we possibly know what ‘Gods will’ actually is?&quot;<br>
<br>
It is all in how one chooses to interpret the scriptures. Some take them literally. Some realize that &quot;Fear the Lord&quot; means &quot;Hold the Lord in Reverence&quot;. Some realize that &quot;Suffer the little children ...&quot; actually means to &quot;Encourage the little children&quot;. So much is lost in the translation of the scripture and the interpretation of what is said. Again, you have human factor involved.<br>
<br>
You ask:<br>
&quot;How do we know that [if God exists] that His/ Her word was not actually contained in some of these, now largely forgotten gospels? Some still exist – such as the Gospel of St Barnabas, the most famous I think.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paul, we don't know ... unless we have access to those scriptures not in the Bible and can interpret the linguistics properly. Again ... still ... would we know? I wish I could answer you. <br>
<br>
You say:<br>
&quot;The Dead Sea Scrolls also contain zillions (well, okay, quite a few!) versions of Biblical texts, many of which are different and all of which are much older, compared to the versions that appear in ‘The Bible’.&quot;<br>
<br>
That is true. And the Rosetta Stone was the key to their interpretation. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You say:<br>
&quot;I simply distrust Christianity (Judaism, Islam etc) as ‘isms’ – as ORGANISED belief systems… basically, I don’t feel they have any basis I’m afraid.&quot;<br>
<br>
Paul, you may just be correct.<br>
<br>
You ask:<br>
&quot;were the witch trials simply the product of mass-hyteria and the sexist/ misogynistic attitudes of the time. wipped up by paranoid, reactionary religious institutions … how far has society/ have religious institutions etc really moved on?? Do the same attitudes still exist, but maybe reflect themselves in different ways today…&quot;<br>
<br>
First of all, it could have been a combination of all of the above. Do the same attitudes still exist today? I'm afraid for some ... they do. Sad. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In your next post, you ask:<br>
&quot;Anyone heard of 'The Magic Circle' by John Waterhouse? It's a painting of a sorceress drawing a circle in the ground, around a cauldron&quot;<br>
<br>
No, I've not heard of it. It is a lovely painting. Thank you for the link. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
You quoted:<br>
&quot;A magic circle was cast to purify and create a perimeter of space wherein evil magic could not enter. Goddesses and good spirits were invited into the circle, which sometimes had powerful, protective stones placed at North, South, East, and West points. Each point was associated with the Four Elements. North was the most powerful direction. It represented the element of Earth, the celestial bodies revolving around the North Star, and encompassed all secrets, darkness, and the unknown. South was the element of Fire and therefore associated with the sun. This point signified the meeting of East and West - intuition, insight, reason, and logic - and the channeling of the powers of intellect, clairvoyance, and nature. East was the direction for the element of Air, symbolizing clarity, spiritual awareness, and mysticism. West represented imagination and inspiration, as well as emotions and reason. The circle itself was a mark of infinity and eternity. <br>
<br>
A witch would cast a magic circle by turning clockwise, beginning at East, following the revolution of the sun. The magic circle was drawn with either a a magic wand or an anthame (a black-handled ceremonial dagger). A charm or spell was recited as the witch cast the circle, asking the presence of friendly or helpful spirits to attend.&quot; <br>

 reply…<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      <br>
<br>
Hmmm, well I guess (like I’ve said before) it all comes down to a matter of perspective.. if you come from the starting point of believing in a ‘supreme’ creator being, then it’s likely you’ll view questions about ‘theology’ from a different perspective to a secular/ humanist like me…. for me, 2+2 still do not equal 4 (104 would be nearer!)… but maybe that’s always likely to be so.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I love the way you deal with these questions so openly &amp; in such a genuine way, not being 'black-&amp;-white' and recognising ambiguities &amp; un-certainities where they exist etc... chatting to you is really fun/ interesting <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   .  <br>
<br>
I don’t like the, erm… ‘absolutism’ that you often find in many belief systems/ faiths etc: to me ‘blind faith’ is really, really <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     SCAREY</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     (&amp; dangerous)… <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->     <br>
<br>
This is gonna sound very bizarre (considering my fanatical atheism I mean!), but  I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of the ‘forgotten’ scriptures – the hundreds of gospels &amp; ‘scriptures’ that were NOT included in ‘The’ Bible, even the dozens &amp; dozens of different VERSIONS of ‘Biblical’ scripture that were also rejected…. <br>
<br>
Who wrote them? WHY did they write them? What did they actually SAY?  Why did ‘the Church’ reject them so completely?  Did anyone believe in them &amp; try to live by them (I know, from what little I’ve read, that often the answer is Yes – people did, inspite of the Church).  Ultimately, is there anything (significant) that distinguishes these forgotten ‘scriptures’ from the writings that were included in ‘The Bible’??<br>
<br>
Obviously, the answers to these questions – especially the LAST one – do come down to perspective – as an atheist/ humanist I’ll have a different perspective to Christians…. (nope, I don’t believe there was any ‘divine intervention’ in the process of compiling the Bible.. the 4 ‘gospels’ were chosen at the Council of Nicea, in 325AD.. this Council also established the Roman Chuch &amp; ~ by majority vote (!!) ~ ‘settled’ the issue of ‘Christs’ divinity… accept these gospels as part of your theology &amp; you are implicitly accepting the secular &amp; SPIRITUAL authority of the Roman Catholic Church … <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     how come protestants, mormons, jehovahs witnesses, Calvinists, Baptists,  presbyterians… etc, etc… never realise this????</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->) <br>
<br>
Sorry Dottie, I seem to have turned this  into my own personal theology study – with you as my personal tutor!  I didn’t mean to do that … (although it’s great having you as my own personal theology tutor!!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->      ) … there’s loads more questions/ observations I could make, but they would take us <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     waaaaaaay</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> off topic I think!<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks Dottie for taking the time to chat about this… <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>     friendly (((hug)))</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> &amp; *BIG* respect ...it's really fun talking to you!<br>

Always wonderful tossing around ideas with you, Paul. You appear to be as open and frank as I try my best to be. I don't have all the answers ... in fact ... I don't have ANY answers. I just have my own perspective as well as &quot;what I've been taught yada yada yada&quot;.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad to see that you realize I am open and trying to be as helpful while being true to myself.<br>
I welcome all such discussions with you because you are not (and I am not) like those described in the first quoted sentence of this post. Those people abound ... and it is scary! <br>

I might just stay, this place is pretty interesting.<br>
<br>
I'm one of those annoying conservative Christian peoples that most boards I go to seem to dislike, but, when people argue faith, biblical and historical knowledge with me, they usually wind up respecting me, even when if they dissagree, because I am one of those Christians who actually reads and knows their Bible.  <br>
<br>
Crap, crap, crap...um...several months ago, on a popular anime board I go to, a person asked me a rather mean-spirited litany of questions about Christianity, well, it was addressed to Christians in general, but I was the only one who stood up to answer them...crap, crap, crap...it's been so long ago on that ezboard that I cannot find those questions anymore or the answers that I gave, and no, I could not answer all of the questions, I admit, but many of them I quoted chapter and verse on ^_^.  I wish I still had that, would love to post it here...too lazy right now to really argue with you, as it is past 11pm and I'm at my college's computer lab and need to go home pretty soon.  Crudmuffins! If I still had my question litany and my answers, I'm sure Paul would have really enjoyed it.  <br>
<br>
I believe more in the mercy of the New Testament than the judgement of the Old Testament, and it is clear in the New Testament that Christians are to be gentle and to convert with words and good deeds, to show the world the love of God, and to NOT persecute other religions (I.E. that "thou shall not suffer a sorceress to live" command in Exodus...that applied to ancient Isreal as a nation, not to God's people in modern times). <br>
<br>
I do believe that Jesus Christ is the only way to Heaven and to a right relationship to God, but if you choose not to believe, I'm not going to kill you for it.  If you choose to go to Hell, it's your own fault as far as I'm concerned ^_^;  Though I don't WANT anyone to go to Hell...  <br>
<br>
As far as the old testament genocides...eh...I question God on that all the time, and clergy.  The clearest explaination that I have heard is that the peoples that the Isrealites were commanded to kill were very, very EVIL.  Now, I don't just mean that they had a diffrent religion, worshipping idols and stuff, I mean, these people were really, really evil.  They sacrificed children, sexually abused each other and their children, burned their children alive in ovens and stuff to sacrifice them to their gods...did horrible atrocities...kind of like the nazis of their time, people whose system had to be gotten rid of, and it was the only way to do it.  As far as the command to kill the women and children of these peoples and to spare no one...well, I wonder "why didn't God command the Isrealites to take the kids in and raise them as Jews?"...the reality is, it wouldn't have worked...how would you feel living under a people who killed your great granfather?  Well, rebellion would surge up...  It's all beside the point because the Isrealites DIDN'T carry out God's commands to the letter and left a large portion of the pagan peoples in the land, and those people had war after war with the Isrealites thorugh their history and also got them into paganism and away from God...into sacrificing their children and stuff as well...  A good explaination of those bloody Old Testament commands is that God was actually trying to minimize human suffering by just getting rid of these peoples, becaue he knew that humans are humans and not everyone is going to follow him and probably more people were killed cruelly thoughout history as a result of the Isrealites not following the genocide commands than if they had actually followed them.  Also, keep in mind, God is a whole lot more concerned with human souls than with human bodies.  I.E. Eternity is the big thing, not life here...  <br>
<br>
Now, in the Church Age/Christian Age/Age of Grace, it's all about mercy.  You choose God, or not, it's up to you, and your eternity is your decision.  Christians are commanded to love now, not to judge.  And I am one who tries to do that, though I'm not perfect.<br>
<br>
Then again, I question God on this too, A LOT.  I am firm in my faith, and I question it a lot.  I think that faith that is not questioned is not worth anything.  <br>
<br>
Do not paint all Christians with the same broad brush.  To say that we are all a certain way, that we all are Crusaders and Inquistors is like saying that all Muslims want to bomb buildings shouting death to America, not all do.  <br>
<br>
<br>
A lot of killing has been done in the names of Allah, God, and even Jesus, but so also a lot of killing has been done for the sake of Atheism.  (Communist Russia and China, anyone?)  <br>
<br>
<br>
I believe that Ghandi once said something along the lines of The Best thing about Christianity is Christ, the Worst thing about Christianity is Christians.  It's true...humans are flawed.  <br>
<br>
Well, I hope you have had fun reading my little posting.  I suppose I shall shut up now and go check out the alien/ufo forum.  <br>

Another point to remember was that The Church took possession of all property owned by the accused. The same with the Salem Witch Trials, which is why most of the &quot;witches&quot; were single/widowed or land-owning females.<br>
