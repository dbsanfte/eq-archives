It was not someone I knew well, but well enough to know them as a 'regular' around the server and, to me, worth the risk.  I'm happy to help those I'm familiar with, and know that most of us here are reputable enough.<br>

For people I don't know, I won't hesitate to ask them to log on the main with the moneybags first.  So it costs them an extra minute to do an extra /camp, big deal. <p><A

I was playing in Skyshrine when I get a tell out of the blue from a level 1 asking who my guildleader was. I told him then got a reply back saying sorry wrong tell. That in itself was kind of funny since he had to type out my name to send out a tell. It turns out he was in EC with a guildie of mine who was selling some things he wanted. He sent her a tell saying &quot;Guess who?&quot;. So then she guesses a bit. He then says no its &quot;Sue&quot;(guildleader's name) , and then went on to ask her if she could give him her items and he would pay her back with his main. What was really funny was the person he was talking to was actually an alt of my guildleader (the person he was pretending to be). She told him so and he went on to say he meant he was a friend of her's etc etc. Eventually a report was sent in on this person and a guide had her log on her main to prove who she was. Apparently this person had been doing this a while and they were able to catch him as he stayed online during the whole report session. I didn't include real guildies name since I know sometimes people hide out on alts. If she wants to add to this she can, I know she lurks. *points ya you Sue LOL* Just be careful on these little tricks people play...sorry to hear about kindhearted people taken in by these parasites.  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukeerinskedaddle.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Keerin Skedaddle</A> at: 12/19/01 10:33:16 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 516<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/19/01 10:48:28 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~derek/201.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hmmm</span><hr size=1> Somebody needs to drive to their house and beat the shit out of them.

Gimgrol has been asking several officers of our guild wanting to get in. Fortunately, he happened to ask 2 of my alts, and I happen to know Grimgrol's background quite well.<br>
<br>
Gimgrol has been kicked out of 3 guilds that I know of, as well as swindling someone out of their Wurmslayer 3 or 4 months ago.<br>
<br>
He met someone who he begged to leg him try the wurmslayer. To keep the story short, he never returned it, and denied ever receiving it.<br>
<br>
He has been trying to get into our guild, any way he can. Fortunately each time he had to go through me, second, we have closed membership.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to add my warning that all guilds should screen all your new potential candidates well.<br>

Is the human race REALLY that dense?  How hard is it to tell a new/unfamiliar person to log on the char you know before you do a swap?  I hear people saying the same thing over and over:<br>
<br>
But, but *whine* this person knew soooo much about me *sniffle*.<br>
<br>
Hmmm.........let's see......I know that from the time I've spent in EC, I see LOTS of people giving out information about their chars in /say.  DON'T DO THIS!  Talk in tells if you have to, or group up........just don't use /say!!!!  For example:<br>
<br>
Player 1 says 'Hey there Player 2, how's it going?'<br>
Player 2 says ' hey player 1, doing good and you?'<br>
Player 1 says 'Not too bad.......been trying to get into &lt;insert guild here&gt;'<br>
Player 2 says 'Well, good luck with that.  Gotta run, see ya later'<br>
<br>
--A few hours later--<br>
Scammer 1 tells you 'Hey there Player 1, this is Player 2'<br>
Player 1 tells Scammer 1 'Hey player 2, how goes it?'<br>
Scammer 1 'Not much.....any luck getting into &lt;insert previous guild name here&gt;?'<br>
Player 1 tells Scammer 1 'No, not yet.'<br>
Scammer 1 tells you 'Hey, mind if I try out your Wurmslayer real fast?  Soandso is selling one for 22pp and I'm not sure I want to buy without trying it out first'<br>
Player 1 tells Scammer 1 'Sure, np'<br>
<br>
--BZZZZZZZZZZTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-- WRONG ANSWER!!!<br>
<br>
Trade takes place, and Scammer 1 logs with YOUR stuff!!!   Player 1 should've said something like:<br>
<br>
Player 1 tells Scammer 1 'Well, with all the scamming problems going on, mind if I have you log on Player 2 before I do the trade?  Safer that way......'<br>
Scammer 1 tells Player 1 'Uggh......it takes me 382 minutes to camp and sign back in though! /cry'<br>
Player 1 tells Scammer 1 'Well, sorry......I can't risk my UBAH Wurmslayer. /apologize'<br>
<br>
SIMPLE AS THAT!  Take notes, write it on your monitor, stamp it on your forehead, tell your little brother to remind you whenever someone does this to you, NOT TO MAKE THE TRADE!!!......then kick his ass when he DOESN'T remind you......do SOMETHING!  But enough of the whining and griping already........if everyone follows these SIMPLE guidelines, there won't be any need for the &quot;WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMER 1!!!!&quot; posts.......thus endeth the sermon...... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ~ <p>Coronado Steel'Heart<BR>

About a min later I hear him shouting for someone that I knew was there earlier but had gated out about 5 min before cinte arrived.  I tell him this and he then tells me that this person was going to pass on an item that was expensive to an alt of his.<br>

I told him that I would do it if he wanted to trust me as well I took anon off so that he could see my guild tag and make a conclusion about me.<br>

Well he did and logged in alt.  Cinte I hope that your Ogre is enjoying his FBSS.<br>

You tell scammer 'Hey, I know you are trying really hard to rip me off...but next time, when you try to scam someone, please try to be a bit smarter. Good luck =)'<br>
<br>
No response from him after that...but in shout about 5 minutes later, someone says that he stole a wurmslayer from them =( <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 161<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/22/01 3:50:52 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: HOhohoho</span><hr size=1> ROTFLMAO 15 years?!?!?

     I was passing through EC when someone sent me a tell asking me if they could &quot;Try Out&quot; my Lammy, and that they would give it right back.  <br>
<br>
     Use common sense out there guys.  <br>

Next time I hear about someone handing over their Lammy to a complete stranger, I should send them a tell asking if I could &quot;try out your account?  I'll give it right back.&quot;  &lt;change password&gt;  Herd thinned. <p><A

<br>
3 people, <br>
 you<br>
your money<br>
<br>
Person 1 is selling goodie Item_X. you send tell. person one tells you that person friend_02 has your goodie at spot_OO. You walk to friend_02. sneakyinvisFriend 3 is in tells with person_02. Person 2 asks you to give him the money. Person_02 tells sneakyperson_03 to run by. BOOM you hit trade there goes your money, ALOT of work but I&quot;m SURE you can and there will be crap like this.<br>
<br>
and FYI, I do NOT do trades if I am asked by a stranger, I ask for 5K money in return if they want me to trade (keeps them from asking why). who knows if your tradeing something someone just scammed off someone, or they just stole. this game creeps me out at times <p>Quttie Pie

Infact, the world DOES revolve around me.
