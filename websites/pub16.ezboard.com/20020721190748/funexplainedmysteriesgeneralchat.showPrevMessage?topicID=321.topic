<br>
4:47 a.m.: Wake up. Discover that you cannot move your head. Try to call for help, and realize that you also cannot speak, as something is obstructing your mouth. Realize that you also cannot breathe. Begin to panic.<br>
<br>
4:49 a.m.: Push sleeping cat off face. Roll over and go back to sleep.<br>
<br>
5:01 a.m.: Wake up.<br>
<br>
5:05 a.m.: Try to remember what you were dreaming about. Remember something about Woody and Soon Yi. Roll over and go back to sleep.<br>
<br>
5:07 a.m.: Wake up. Start worrying about how Mia is doing. Think about how everyone was so quick to decide she was a nut case, and how the press portrayed her as shrill and vindictive. Think that maybe you would have been a little shrill and vindictive, too, if your 60-something significant other were screwing your 20-something daughter. Think that maybe your vindictiveness would have involved firearms. <br>
<br>
5:17 a.m.: Realize that you've just spent ten minutes worrying about something you read about several years ago in a tabloid at the supermarket. Pull covers over head and go back to sleep. <br>
<br>
5:25 a.m.: Wonder if Mia will ever trust men again.<br>
<br>
5:35 a.m.: Decide that no, Mia will probably never trust men again. <br>
<br>
4:45-5:45 a.m.: Ignore sounds of impending cat war. Pretend nothing is chewing on your toes, and try not to think about what made that crashing sound in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
5:46 a.m.: Go see what made that crashing sound in the kitchen.<br>
<br>
5:52 a.m.: Clean up glass while coffee brews. Ignore pitiful cries of cats who cannot believe you would put your needs before theirs.<br>
<br>
5:53 a.m.: Feed the damn cats.<br>
<br>
5:55 a.m.: Turn on computer.<br>
<br>
5:56-7:30 a.m: Play solitaire. Lose $14,539.<br>
<br>
7:31 a.m.: Realize that if you're going to work out this morning, you'd better do it now.<br>
<br>
7:36 a.m.: Just one more game of solitaire. <br>
<br>
7:48 a.m.: Change into sweats. Sit on exercise bike. Think about exercising. <br>
<br>
7:49 a.m.: Begin exercising.<br>
<br>
7:50 a.m.: Realize you need something to read. Go get newspaper. <br>
<br>
7:53 a.m.: Begin exercising. <br>
<br>
7:58 a.m.: Look at clock. Realize you don't have time to exercise.<br>
<br>
8:02 a.m.: Decide to have just one more cup of coffee before you get in the shower. Think how nice it would be to have the coffee on the patio. Do so. <br>
<br>
8:07 a.m.: Notice that the plants on the patio need a little water. <br>
<br>
8:11-8:29 a.m.: Kill aphids. Weed plants. Commune with nature. That sort of thing.<br>
<br>
8:30 a.m.: Realize that you really, really have to get in the shower, because you're supposed to be at work now. <br>
<br>
8:31 a.m.: Realize that you haven't had breakfast. Breakfast is very important. Have breakfast. <br>
<br>
8:32 a.m.: Realize that you need something to read. Go get paper from vicinity of exercise bike. <br>
<br>
8:33-9:02 a.m.: Read paper. Drink two more cups of coffee. Wonder what the world is coming to. <br>
<br>
9:03-9:33 a.m.: Write letter to editor about item in paper.<br>
<br>
9:34 a.m.: Wake up significant other. Tell him about the thing in the paper. Hit him with paper if he isn't sufficiently outraged. Inform him that you've written a letter to the editor, and that he has to sign it too. Hand him a pen. <br>
<br>
9:37 a.m.: Leave room in a huff when he rolls over and goes back to sleep without signing the letter. <br>
<br>
9:38 a.m.: Just one more cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
9:39 a.m.: ....while you play just one more game of solitaire.<br>
<br>
9:57 a.m.: Realize that you haven't checked your e-mail. Do so. Write to your mom, even though you talked to her yesterday and she only lives 25 minutes away.<br>
<br>
10:14 a.m.: Look at clock. Panic. Remember you have a meeting at 11:15. <br>
<br>
10:15 a.m.: Jump in shower. Brush teeth while washing hair to save time. Contemplate shaving your legs, but realize you don't have time. Use combination shampoo/conditioner to save time, even though you know it means you'll have a bad hair day. <br>
<br>
10:18 a.m.: Wonder if Soon Yi is a scheming little tramp, or just a very confused young woman.<br>
<br>
10:25 a.m.: Discover you can't wear the dress you planned to wear because you didn't shave your legs. Realize you never did laundry last night. Fish something out of laundry basket. Realize it belongs to significant other; wear it anyway. <br>
<br>
10:35 a.m.: Commence bad hair day.<br>
<br>
10:45 a.m.: Think about calling in sick. Realize how pathetic that would be.<br>
<br>
10:48 a.m.: Give up on hair. Wear hat.<br>
<br>
10:52 a.m.: Realize hat does not match clothing. Tear all clothing out of dresser. Think how silly you'd look in this lime green lycra dress. Wonder where it came from.<br>
<br>
10:58 a.m.: Open significant other's dresser. Realize he obviously had time to do laundry. Pick something that matches hat. Realize it's his hat, too. <br>
<br>
11:00 a.m.: Check e-mail again, to see if Mom has responded. <br>
<br>
11:07 a.m: Out the door.<br>
<br>
11:17 a.m.: Arrive at work. Find out meeting has been cancelled. <br>
<br>
11:25 a.m.: Call significant other. See if he wants to talk about the outrageous thing in the paper yet. Consider asking him what he thinks about Mia and Woody. Think better of it. <br>
<br>
11:30 a.m.: Go say hello to boss. When he asks where you were this morning, reply as you always do: &quot;Oh, gee, I overslept.&quot;  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 2857<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/24/01 2:31:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=446.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A Day In The Life Of A Morning Person</span><hr size=1> Oh, Good Grief! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That made me tired just reading it.
