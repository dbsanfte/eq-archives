After a recent chain of events, I have decided, mainly for my own sake, to attempt to reveal to the Druzzil Ro community the story of 2 characters and the people behind them.<br>
<br>
It all started when I, Bofer A.K.A Dumplinger, began attending school with Vivar in the fall of 1999.  Shortly after meeting Vivar, I discovered that we had a common interest, Everquest.  At this time, Vivar was a high level player on Druzzil, and I was playing a few low 40's characters on Xegony.  As our friendship grew into the spring of 2001, Vivar began to sort of 'burnout' on EQ.  He gave me his druid's PW to play for fun and to sort of keep the character alive while he took a break.  He made the mistake of not deguilding his character from his guild at that time, SoN.  As I was a fairly new person to high level EQ, I sort of tarnished his reputation, although I quickly learned how to play a druid and how to be an effective high level player.  At this time, Vivar was played by at least 3 different people, none of which owned their own 50+ character.  <br>
<br>
Soon, at the start of the summer of 2000, I stopped playing Vivar and went back to my own charas on Xegony.  By the end of the summer, I played a low 50s chara, and 2 mid 40s charas.  This is when I got a call from Vivar, who after returning to EQ had burnt out again and offered me his account to level it and such.  At this time, Vivar was currently guildless.  In fairly short order, I leveled him from 53 to 56.  In the winter of 2000, I decided to make my own chara on Druzzil.  Dumplinger, a halfling warrior, was born.  Using the help of Vivar, I leveled him up to 50ish fairly quickly.  Vivar had began playing EQ full time again, and he had access to my account, as I had access to his.  As Dumplinger began to climb up in levels with Vivar's help, Vivar became more and more interested in playing my account.  I considered him a close friend, and let this go on.  Eventually, Vivar and Dumplinger began to become one person in EQ, not two different people.  This concept, that I supported up until recently, that we were the same person, continued for quite some time.  Unfortunately for me, Vivar had a reputation attached to his name that came with the fact he was played by, at one time, up to six different people.  Of these people, only myself and the owner of Vivar had a workable knowledge of the higher level aspects of EQ.  <br>
<br>
Things continued smoothly for myself and Vivar for a long time.  Although we had struggles finding guilds because of Vivar's tarnished reputation as a player with not much skill and sort of an &quot;asshole&quot; (based primarly on some issues with kiting over other players, heh), things between us worked out pretty well.  Eventually, we landed ourselves into ML, and things worked out great for about a month.  We were both having a blast being part of a high level guild, killing things we hadn't even seen before.  All of this happened under the impression that myself and Vivar were the same individual in real life.  At this time, Dumplinger recieved a name change by a random GM stopping in our server, and I selected my new name to be Bofer  (Bofer Baggins has quite the ring to it, doesn't it?).  The following day, myself, Vivar, and a close friend of mine parted ways with ML because of some conflicts with the leadership.  Regardless of what I have said about ML since that time, I always felt like I had a home there and was having a blast.  <br>
<br>
Although boredom ensued, as Bofer was level 60 with a full bar of exp, and my guild options were exhausted, I was still having fun in EQ.  One night when I logged on, I found my account password to be changed.  It had fallen into the hands of a group of 3 people I will call &quot;Entity A&quot; for the sake of brevity and so they can remain anonymous.  These 3 people all had their own relatively high level characters on Druzzil, and used their access to Vivar to gain my password, and the password of a friend's account that had a highly twinked level 20 bard.  They changed Vivar's PW without the owner of Vivar's consent, and deleted Bofer and my Friend's bard, Clouded.  I was able to get my account restored promptly in full, although Clouded was not so lucky, he didn't get in contact with Verant until after their new policy on hacked accounts.  He lost 5 pieces of Singing Steel, a fungi tunic, black ice leggings, and a host of other high level bard gear.  It was at this time I decided I had to change the way I  played EQ or I would soon lose Bofer, the character I worked so hard to achieve level 60 with.  Vivar and myself came to the conclusion that from that point on, it was best that we kept our characters to ourselves, and parted ways.<br>
<br>
I am sharing this with the Druzzil Ro community for a number of reasons.<br>
<br>
1)  I wish to clear up any confusions about who plays and owns Vivar and Bofer's accounts<br>
2)  I wish to disolve the conception that Vivar and myself were the same individual in real life<br>
3)  I want to move on from this phase of my EQ existence.<br>
<br>
To clear up any misconceptions, the following are NOT reasons I made this post<br>
1)  To try to clear my reputation and start a new (although this would be nice, it's not a realistic expectation)<br>
2)  To harbor any resentment towards any of my friends, I took a risk and got burned <br>
3)  To try to tarnish the reputation of Vivar (he wasn't involved in anyway in the stealing of the accounts)<br>
4)  Make exuses for my actions in EQ<br>
<br>
I fully understand that I am in the position I am in right now because of my choices and decisions, and that my account is MY responsibility, no matter who was controlling my characters at the time.  I am not trying to shift any blame or make any exuses for ANY of the actions I am associated with.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for listening,<br>

I'm glad to know this stuff, however, you best be carefull b/c of the new policies. I hope that you changed your password's (both Vivar and Bofer), and are truly separate.<br>

But yes I hope you have truly safeguarded your account and cut all strings with anyone who might have access. This time around VI would just burn you if you had a problem.<br>

Hey, hey, hey!  <br>
I can't decide which is most ironic/moronic.  Was it the fact he uses words like, &quot;f00s&quot; and calls people &quot;dumb arses&quot; in the same sentence, or the fact that someone signed their name and guild affiliation  to that paragraph?  <br>
