I've read through the posts on prices on Ports/Translocates and they're valid discussions. Rez's average, it seems, 100pp. People provide various funds for Clarity/Heal/Breeze/SoW/Bind/etc. It does seem that the economy tends to advantage the casting crowd (just an observation). My guideline for donations on a bind is based on how far away I'm bound before and how much time being bound closer will save me, usually ranging 3-10pp.<br>
<br>
I'd like to hear from all folks.<br>
<br>
I've dragged a few corpses from some sticky spots and only once received a donation of 10pp in CC (I've never asked because I've wanted to see the result). I've done so while sneak/hiding along with some minimal risk (mobs <!--EZCODE UNDERLINE START--><u>do</u><!--EZCODE UNDERLINE END--> have a chance to see through), and it's *very* slow (for the record). <br>
<br>
I've got colleagues who receive tells from other zones asking them to come pick suchandsuch a lock, or to drag from suchandsuch a deathtrap.  I currently get tells asking me to fetch corpses from the bottom of Befallen (no risk, but inconvenient).<br>
<br>
What do people normally pay for these *other* tasks? If a rez is worth 100pp, what's it worth to be able to get that corpse to you for the rez? .. and from behind that locked door?<br>
<br>
What other classes get asked to do things under this umbrella? How much do you tip the bard for pointing you in your corpse's direction?<br>
<br>
Please note that this is not a b*tch session. I'd just like to hear more on this subject. <p><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/players/view_profile.asp?Id=74102"><b><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lannella

Lock pick? Rake the fool for whatever you can get, GOUGE him. <br>

But do it with a smile, there's nothing more annoying to a rogue then the guy who will never group with you (we don't need a rogue, blah blah) begging for your skills.<br>

So be shure to charge him till it hurts, then smile and remind his that if you were in his group he'd be getting through that door with no problems.<br>

<br>
I was making a point in favor of rogues, one that needed to be strong and &quot;in the face&quot; of all of those who don't like or want rogues in thier groups. THEY are the ones who are short sighted and have poor atitudes. They say &quot;rogues suck&quot;, &quot;Rogues cant tank&quot;, and other things that show they have not taken the time to understand the value of other classes then thier own.  And sometimes the HARD lesson is the only one such people will learn.<br>

Unfortunately, there are plenty, and they are always verbal about it.  There are plenty of times where I just need to shout once for a pickup group (bad schedule=no steady group), but there are many times where I've shouted for more than half an hour just to hear the odd catcall while others get picked up.  I'm pretty good at not letting it get to me, but there are days...it's never so bad as to make me want to turn my back on my preferred occupation, though.<br>
<br>
Moreso, I've tried to believe that Verant wouldn't be so foolish as to leave all the useful skills/spells in the hands of the casters (including corpse summoning as well as the first examples) so I try to keep an eye out for them, and even try to take advantage of them.  Problem is, I see so few by comparison that it's hard not to call it 'out of balance'.<br>
<br>
I'll always look for a bard first when I've needed to locate a corpse, knowing that the necro will have other chances later.  I've maxed up Bind Wounds and never ask for heals (though when a healer sees you taking the initiative of bandaging I often get one anyway).  I am guilty of asking for the rare sow on a corpse run, but never when I've died by my own foolishness (penance).<br>
<br>
How's about listing some of the melee/hybrid skills that we can look to utilize in order to share the love?<br>

* Lock Picks<br>
* Potions<br>

Each time, the coffin in question was either provided, or they ported me back to Neriak and gave me the pp to purchase them.  One thing that most people don't understand is that the summon corpse spell uses quite a bit of mana for me at lvl 48 approx 2 full bulbs (with 202int and mana items) so the spell is quite costly for me..also costs me 700 mana to cast the spell and no, mana regen isn't quick for me without breeze or clarity....<br>
<br>
The one most recent was for someone in the Wakening Lands..had never been there before and they provided me an escort through Kael as well as the coffins.  A donation wasn't asked for as I was in the Great Divide anyhow, but was given.  The person I summoned was a chanter and was kind enough to give me clarity for my troubles as well...They had lost their level and I spent most of my night with them until they had gotten their level back..as a result of my kindness, once again I had gotten an unexpected reward..<br>
<br>
I still remember the day I first got my summon corpse spell and was asked by a high lvl druid to do a corpse recovery in lower guk.  As a result, I was rewarded with a high lvl necro spell and they made sure I was escorted down to the dungeon as I had never been in there before..<br>
<br>
I've had other occasions where people demand that I drop what I am doing to either summon their corpse or to recover it for them since I'm a necro and I have invis and IVU.  It's the ones that demand that I tend to ignore.  If my friend's cleric is nearby, often I give a free rez to the people whose corpse I summoned or retrieved.<br>
<br>
As for Rogues..personally, I love them...and I'm sure as I get higher lvl my appreciation for their skills will increase.  The few times I've needed help with a body recovery I've donated quite well....and I have to admit, it's nice to have assistance on corpse recoveries :-)  especially in bad zones...<br>
<br>
End point..be kind to whomever you ask and donate..I'd rather see an attempt at a donation than nothing at all..even a simple &quot;thank you&quot; works for those that can't afford it...Those that ask nicely, even if I'm on the other side of the world, sure I'll help if I'm able..just don't make demands or threats...I'm actually looking forward to that upgraded corpse summon spell and those stackable coffins..at least then I can keep one or two on me conveniently.<br>
<br>
So yes, there are a lot of demanding people on the server..but then again..there are some that are very kind and generous....I donate well for ports, translocations and even rez'es when needed..If I am in a group and my groupmates die, I'm one of the first looking for a cleric to rez...I'll help if I can if asked nicely...be rude in how you ask, and I'll ignore you.<br>

Dangerous CR? I see it as a new challenge, and if its really in a dangerous spot, I hotkey a gate potion.<br>

<br>
REPUTATION &gt; any class, level, equipment, ability, etc.<br>
<br>
Do unto others as you would have done to you? Isn't that how the quote goes? I get as much enjoyment out of CR'ing a failed EL attempt, as I do at acquiring a new item, or winning a tough fight. To be able to help people, and get their thanks, to do things that no one else can (CR from EL for example) - without costly coffins - makes me enjoy the game even more.<br>
<br>
Morathu, Clavo, Lannella - you are digging your own graves. People remember when you charged them for a CR, and they tell their friends about it. And word spreads.<br>
<br>
People also remember when you CR for free, when you see a equipped body, check to see if they are online, and offer to drag them to the zone. They remember if you tell the group at the zone in Sebelis that you will follow them down there to open the door for them, so they can do the crypt.<br>

I was provoking discussion parallel to the existing discussion on charging for ports.  I just saw it interesting that we (general) discuss prices going to casters for spells (other than component costs) but I'd, personally, never seen a discussion on how to deal with the more mundane, less arcane tasks that people perform for us.<br>
<br>
I would add that, given that the *majority* of porters(etc) *do* charge for their time, I would not be adverse to <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> considering</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> accepting a donation.  I don't usually take the spell/rune drops and I have to roll on or buy my own class armour.  I know that there are a lot of socially-conscious, mature individuals that frequent these boards.  No question about that.  However, folks like me have to pay those that aren't so conscious (in cash, not breeze/clarity/heals/buffs) for what we get.  I'm by no means greedy.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, my reputation is crystal.  I'm opinionated sometimes, sure, but when we're toe to toe (or toe to back) with the opponent I don't falter.  If I've ever used pickpockets in a group, I've asked first for training permission, and /split all proceeds.  I've died doing CRs for others and had to pay for my own rez/revive after.  I try not to play too many favourites, and try not to harbour any grudges.<br>
<br>
While I don't see it as my &quot;job&quot; to drag up some stranger's corpse, I'll do it if they ask me.  If I'm on my way up from the dungeon and see a corpse, I *always* check if that player is online to offer a drag.<br>
<br>
Thing is, when it comes to pickup groups, people don't know these things.  They've had a few groups with twinks bragging about something-or-other or who did pick the mob clean, and it leaves a bad taste in their mouth.  Everybody's had different experiences, some good and some bad, and some remember them more.  <br>
<br>
All I can try to do is show them how a professional rogue can operate.<br>

Aside from when I could first port and &quot;advertised&quot; that I was porting to various rings for 10-20pp, I don't specify an amount.  I usually expect that people will have the decency to fork over a fair amount of cash in line with the risk or out-of-the-way nature of the destination.  If someone asks for a CS port, and then asks if 10pp is enough, my canned response is &quot;only if you provide rez or corpse retrieval if I die in the process&quot;...which generally translates to &quot;no&quot; for most of the people who ask.<br>
<br>
I've paid for many rezzes over the levels, and if I can't get my corpse, I'd happily pay for a necro or rogue to get it for me.  I play a low-level (20) rogue, and in those few levels, I've been asked to pull corpses out of fun places like Befallen, various bandit/dervish/orc camps, the Sarnak fortress in Ill Omen, and so on.  I didn't expect a donation, which is good since none is ever offered.  At low levels, I don't EXPECT people to pay for things like that, really.  But if someone is going to pay for a rez/summon/port, it seems to me that a rogue should get just as much consideration when they perform their services.  <br>

For example, I died recently in Sol A.  Was stupid and let too many gobs get on me.  hehe.  <br>
<br>
Well, my corpse got a bit bugged.  Others could see it at the zone line but I couldn't.  So, I petitioned, but no GM's on and no response after an hour.  So, I started looking around for Necromancers to summon it.  I sent a couple tells, which I know some consider rude and I try to avoid at all costs but I do my utmost to be extremely polite in the tell.  My second tell found me a necromancer that had some time.  I ported him to Lava, went  with him to get a coffin and escorted him to Sol A.  He summoned my corpse, which kind of worked.  <br>
<br>
It was there, I could do a /corpse and move it around, but we couldn't see it.  But, he had a great idea of doing a locate corpse which let him target it, I then /assisted him which let me target it, then I did a /loot and got my stuff.<br>
<br>
For his troubles and the cost of the coffin, I gave him 500pp.  Was it worth it to me, very much so.  He went out of his way to help me.<br>
<br>
If I'm ever in a situation where a rogue can help me get my corpse while I can't, you can bet I'll donate.  It'll probably be on the order of 100+pp as at a minimum as I would be paying 200+ for a necromancer to summon it if they weren't there.<br>
<br>
As a druid, I receive donations for ports.  Haven't accepted money for SOW's and other buffs since I was like 18 and didn't have enough money to buy my spells.  So, I am all too happy to give back some of that money to others.<br>

<br>
This is not to say -however- that Rogue skills do deserve to be rewardable.  I simply forgoe it as an extension of my characterization of my rogue.<br>
<br>
The one thing that DOES disturb my in the inequity of perception that surrounds Rogues and their skills and how that compares to Druids, specifically.<br>
<br>
Druids expect and are largely granted to ability to charge -often exhorbitant- prices for ports.  While I admit that druids MUST pay for their spells, this does not fully reconcile the charges that some ask.  Or, let me rephrase this:<br>
<br>
Publically, it is 'acceptable' for a druid to ask for money in exchange for services.  Everyone expects and accepts this activity.  But if a rogue asks for services rendered, such as CR or door opening, the jaws drop in astonishment.  Why are rogues different?  Why are our skills devalued to the point of being 'free'?<br>
<br>
yes, druids pay for their spells, but Rogues pay for their skills, both in time and blood.  Porting to EC or LS or some such place is rarely a dangerous act.  yes, it cost Druid X the money to buy the spell and time to perfect their skills as casting it, but a druid rarely dies porting to NK.  The same cannot be aid for the rogue who does a CR into LGuk.<br>
<br>
Now, let me clarify what I'm saying for the Johnny Blazes out there: I believe druids deserve recompense for services rendered, but i also feel that same standard holds true for any class that renders a specific service be they rogue, Necro, Wizards.  Hell, if you 'hire' a 50 Warrior to go destroy CB so you can get your corpse in the tower, he deserevs some cash too.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hear a lot of arguments from my guild's rogues that people say rogue skills are not worth the money.  My response to that is that when you are in your 50s and you're standing at the door that lies between you and about 3 bubs of lost experience, tell me how valuable my ability to open that door is. <p><small><i>Venerato Quod Equitas</i>,
