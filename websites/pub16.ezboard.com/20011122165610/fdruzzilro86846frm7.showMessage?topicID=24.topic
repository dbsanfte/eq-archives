<br>
Forest Visions...<br>
<br>
<br>
Never an enthusiast of teleport travel, Cirrean closed her eyes and gritted her teeth to fight back a wave of nausea as her feet touched down between the curving stone spires which rose into the misty shroud above Toxxulia Forest.  Mithimien, the wizard who had handled her travel from the distant desert, had scarcely materialized before he whisked himself away to destinations unknown.  While she had no love for many of her own race, anyone entrusted by Dorn must be capable of getting the job done.  The Tier'Dal, despite their hatred for most other races, had an uncanny ability to sniff out traitors.  The young woman, still lightheaded from her mystical means of transport, was not sure if that made her loyal to the right cause, or a traitor.  <br>
<br>
Despite being hungry and tired, Cirrean decided to enjoy the privacy of the forest while the opportunity presented itself.  Unbuckling her sparse backpack, swordbelt and shimmering ringmail, she slipped into the emerald waters of a sluggish river, clothed only in shadows. Embedding her sword's long blade into the mossy soil along the shore, she bathed in the warm current, rinsing dust and and sweat from her black ringlets, and the stains of battle from her skin.  The bandage on her arm was filthy, so she was forced to unwrap it.  The wound stung for a moment, but the water soothed the raw flesh.  Thankfully it was not bleeding further, as there were known to be predatory fish in these waters.  Feeling refreshed, enough so to make her way to Paineel, Cirrean swam back to shore.<br>
<br>
As she was about to set foot on dry ground, a twig snapped on the opposite bank.  Sliding her blade silently from the damp earth, Cirrean let herself sink back under the rippling water, pausing a moment before casting her infravision spell.  She opened her eyes a few inches below the surface, and could make out the faint image of a man peering out across the water.  He appeared to be holding a staff of some sort, and a glimmer of magical energies surrounded him for a moment, before he stepped out across the water on a thin layer of air. Sure enough, he was heading cautiously for where her armor and gear lay, a few yards from shore under an ancient willow.  Her air nearly expired, Cirrean moved back towards shore. Cursing the notion of a confrontation without so much as a scrap of clothing, she exhaled the last of her breath in the words of a shadow-step spell.  The next instant, she felt the cool grass beneath her bare feet, and found herself staring her unwanted guest square in the eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;What luck of the gods might this be,&quot; the leatherclad man said with a laugh, &quot;that they give me both a fine catch of loot, and a damsel in distress...and undress?&quot;  Decency be damned, Cirrean thought to herself, and held her sword in front of her.  The man twisted a ring on his finger, and floated out of range of her.  He cast his staff, a fishing rod as it were, to the ground, and drew a wicked dagger of the finest steel.  Again his hand went to the ring, as he circled her from his aerial vantage point. <br>
<br>
His leering gaze only served to enrage the shadowknight further, and she lashed out wildly. The fisherman - or thief more likely - shifted to the right, and Cirrean leapt foward with her free hand outstretched.  With a savage jerk, she grabbed her assailant's ring finger, snapping it back and tearing off the ring as he crumpled to the ground in sudden pain.  Looking down at the glowing crimson stone, she slid it on her own finger, and found herself floating above him.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are no spellbinder at all, only a common thief who stole a flight-ring, you coward!&quot;  Cirrean's lips pulled back in a laugh, as the man knelt, nursing his badly broken finger.  Rivulets of water ran down her back and legs, droplets splashing at the man's feet to return his gaze to her eyes.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't need spells to end your pathetic life, girl!  You give me no choice but to stain this river with your blood.&quot;  His words were filled with venom, and she noticed a sickly green liquid run the length of his blade.  &quot;Not even the beasts of the woods will touch your flesh once I am through with you, although I'm sure the exiled heretics would pay a good sum for a fresh paladin corpse!&quot;  His attack was swift, and his well timed stabs seemed to be a blur around the blocking strokes of her sword.  The levitation effect of the ring gave Cirrean an advantage of distance and leverage, but her motions were uneasy.  Once, his knife made contact with her hand, but only with the flat of the blade.  <br>
<br>
At the same time she realized the close call, the thief's glance turned to the bare flesh of her wounded arm.  His teeth clenched in a wicked grin, he lunged forward.  Cirrean's sword swung low, severing his left leg cleanly below the knee, but he was already at the height of his jump, tainted dagger extended.  With a wet thud, they toppled to the ground, and Cirrean's sword went sliding across the slick grass.  Despite the severity of his wound, the assassin fought on, his left hand squeezing her wounded bicep painfully, and the poisoned dagger clenched in his right hand, waving frantically over her.  She writhed on the ground, her free hand grasping for his wrist with no success as he nearly grazed her throat with the blade.  Desperation set in, calling to mind a last resort.  In a single cry, Cirrean called forth her necromantic powers in the form of a &quot;harm touch&quot;, and in an acrid odor of burnt flesh, the thief died.  <br>
<br>
His dagger, still held high, wavered at an impossible angle.  Locked in the man's death-grip, Cirrean could only watch in the horror of slow motion as a single fleck of the vile poison dripped from the glinting steel point, like paint to a canvas, into her open wound.  The pain was dull, but immediate.  Her hand spasmed suddenly, her whole arm contorting as if at the same time frozen and in flames.  Whatever substance had invaded her body, it brought only blackness to Cirrean's vision as she slumped to the forest floor.  There, along the river bank, her life began to fade without a drop of her blood being shed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Hallowed Black Halls...<br>
<br>
<br>
Mandaril Dark Knife shifted uneasily upon his granite throne, the purple and scarlet cushions doing little to insulate him from the cold stone.  Guildmaster of the Fell Blade though he was, he found himself kept waiting over what seemed to be a trivial matter.  Some foolish girl had been attacked while bathing in a forest stream or some such drivel, and a courier had found her, naked and unconcious, shortly before sunset.  The stupid wench was apparently poisoned and near death, exciting news for hushed gossip in the city library, but nothing of interest to a highborn courtier of Cazic-Thule.<br>
<br>
As the dark lordling brooded in his audience hall, Derena Leflor hurried into the chamber, gowns gathered as quickly knelt before addressing him.  Mandaril always enjoyed Derena's visits, as she was always very sure to show proper respect, and often bore gifts for her master.  However, he noted, she rarely was in such a hurry.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'lord Mandaril, I have received word from the tabernacle.  The woman found in Toxxulia was one of our order!&quot;  Derena, normally soft-spoken and eloquent, was short of breath as she relayed her message.  &quot;She was felled by a would-be assassin, although she appears to have killed him before succumbing to his poison.  His body was burned beyond recognition, and he did not wear any insignia.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Very strange indeed,&quot; Mandaril said just above a whisper, &quot;considering that Erudin does not acknowledge a thieves' guild of any kind.  Perhaps a simple pickpocket who found himself discovered while going through a lady's silks?&quot;  The knight chuckled at the thought, but did find the notion of such an attack somewhat suspicious.  &quot;Any trace of the poison which could be identified, either on his person or from the clerics' examinations?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Some sort of corrosive solvent,&quot; Derena recited, reading from a scrawled note.  &quot;It appears that the rogue never actually pierced her, but rather grazed an existing wound sufficiently for the poison to enter her bloodstream unhindered.  Apparently, the amount was slight enough that it was not lethal.  If it pleases you, lord, she has been brought to a spare bedchamber here...if you wished to, ahhhh...question her.&quot;  Mandaril smiled as the flighty courtesan stuttered and flushed under his gaze.  Platemail rasping against stone, he stood and nodded towards the door.  Joined by an initiate, he made his way through the guildhall's dimly lit dormitory to the private chambers.<br>
<br>
Inside, attended by an apprentice cleric, lay a young Erudite woman.  Although her face was rather pale after the effects of the poison, her eyes blazed with a barely contained fury.  She rose on one elbow, struggling to stand, before Mandaril shook his head and stopped her. From beneath a tangle of fever-drenched tresses, she glared at him.  Despite his stature and station, the dark paladin lord found himself momentarily ill at ease, until a smile crossed his lips.<br>
<br>
&quot;My young dear, what were you thinking, to be parading around in such a...natural state...in the darkest corner of Toxxulia?  Surely, a knight of the Fell Blade has better brains in her head than to do such a thing.&quot;  Yes, this one would provide some sport, he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;With all due respect, SIR, I am more than capable of caring for myself.  I am not accustomed to being spied upon while I bathe, nor robbed while at such a disadvantage.  Needless to say, that worm got what he deserved.  May Cazic himself feast on the bastard's soul for a thousand years!&quot;  The maiden was clearly not in the mood to provide any amusement, and her pleasant features were darkened with a fierce scowl.<br>
<br>
&quot;Very well then,&quot; Mandaril boomed, &quot;who are you and what was your business so near the wizard spires?  That has been a busy place of late, and not all of those passing through are friendly to our kind.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am Cirrean Shadakine, Knight of the Fell Blade.  I was brought to the spires by a wizard named Mithimien, also an Erudite, allied with the Indigo Brotherhood of Neriak.  I was informed by a Tier'Dal agent, that all children of Paineel have been recalled at once.  Is this in fact the case, or am I wasting my time here?!&quot;  The girl was still livid, so Mandaril thought it best to answer her and send her on her way.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah yes, you must have spoken with Dorn B'Dynn.  It is as you have been told.  A tribe of kobolds have taken control of a previously undiscovered quarter of Old Paineel, and challenge our claim to this entire region.  They have some degree of shamanic magic, and far greater numbers than previous sightings in the forest had suggested.  As if their appearance so near our walls was not sufficient annoyance, it seems that some imbecile treasure-seeker got word of this, and made it to the Erudin docks before we our agents could interecept him. Of course the High Council in Erudin sent a regiment of their sentinels to investigate, and needless to say, we had a fight on our hands.  Now, mercenary vessels are sailing from Qeynos in large number.  I have deployed patrols of our warriors along the coastline near Kerra Ridge to watch for smaller vessels sailing around the cape, but we fought to a stalemate at the wizard spires.  The druids across the river have been smuggling people in as well, but we simply are spread too thin to stop the influx of foreigners.  Thus, we need each and every resident of Paineel to help stem this flow.&quot;  Mandaril sighed as he turned for the door.  One more shadowknight would hardly be enough to aid in the defense of Paineel if it were to come under siege.<br>
<br>
&quot;Report to the outer gate at once, they will be needing reinforcements.&quot;<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Walking out of the secluded Paineel vault, Cirrean went over a mental checklist as she secured her blackened helm.  A quick visit to Darkglow Palace confirmed all that she had been told, that the Overlord Virate Manaar had issued a decree, summoning the journeymen of Paineel's guilds back from all corners of Norrath.  She had stowed the items acquired over the course of her journeys in the bank, and had dusted off some equipment which had not seen use in many months.  With nothing but the most basic provisions to weigh her down, the shadowknight made her way to the secret stone-hewn passage which would lead her out to the training yard near Toxxulia Forest.  She emerged near the wind-whipped abyss known simply as &quot;the Hole&quot;, supposedly the physical entrance to the Plane of Underfoot.  Across the vast opening, inexplicably protruding from a rocky slope, was a towering observatory.  And down the path at her feet, past the gardens and pools, was the entrance to the kobold Warrens.  <br>
<br>
In summers past, this path saw little traffic, for the populace of Paineel kept to themselves, unless sent abroad on some secret mission.  Now, the foreign signs of marching feet and discarded trash marked the passage of newcomers.  Stepping out through the Garden Gate, Cirrean frowned.  While the skeleton guards stood by as they had for countless years, silently watching, the beautiful gardens of Paineel were in disarray.  Tents and burnt-out campfires had replaced saplings and hedges, and unwelcome guests of every race trampled the once-thriving lawn.  A cough behind her turned Cirrean's attention to an aged necromancer leaning against the gate.<br>
<br>
&quot;It is a pity,&quot; sighed the man, whom Cirrean recognized as Noclin Saah, &quot;that the quiet of our home must be interrupted by these...uncultured savages.&quot;  He trembled as another hollow cough escaped him.  &quot;Alas, daughter of Paineel, there is nothing to be done, if we wish to keep our city secret.  Your master, Lord Mandaril, has placed Azzar Habbib in charge of the gate's defense, but rarely does he set foot outside of his observation room.&quot;  A gesture from the old man directed Cirrean's eyes to a window above the gate, where a mail-clad officer stood, fidgeting with an ill-fitting turban as he watched over the gathered strangers.  &quot;Azzar has proven himself in battle many times over, but his current role hinders him from enforcing any real order.  If we were to deploy our dark legions to prevent further desecration of our little realm, it would be impossible to keep the city's true location hidden.  Many of these outlanders believe Paineel to be buried at the bottom of the Hole, not a living, breathing city.  It is best to keep it that way.&quot;  A fit of coughing ended Noclin's speech, but Cirrean understood the situation all too well.  Any show of force by the Fell Blade could only result in the secret entrances to the city being found, and the guardians of Paineel would not be enough to stop a combined force of Erudin Sentinels and mercenaries from the many lands of Norrath.  No, a confrontation would have to wait.<br>
<br>
Her ears guided by the din of battle, Cirrean made her way quickly through the gardens.  Beyond a rough-hewn entrance in the natural stone barrier, was a small meditation chamber and a scrying pool, and another passage leading to a mountain shrine.  The shrine was carved into the earth, with an elegant staircase descending to a crystal blue spring at the very bottom.  In her youth, she had practiced swimming in the placid water, but in recent times a fissue had opened into the Hole.  And now, blasted into the rock wall of the entry chamber, was a dim tunnel.  Fresh corpses, of Erudites and humans and many other races, lay entangled with those of kobolds.  The wounded sat propped up against the granite walls, while clerics healed those who they could, and eased the suffering of the dying.  Through an opening at the far end of the passage, she could see the glint of torchlight on armor, and hear the sounds of battle.  Casting doubts aside, Cirrean stepped out of the passage and into the Warrens.<br>
<br>
<br>
Prisoners of War...<br>
<br>
Gryk'rrt was not pleased with the taste of the rations he had been given by the Foodmaster on this particular evening.  It was something looted from a fallen dwarf, something called a &quot;muffin&quot; according to one of his packmates.  No, the initiate shaman did not care for this stale, crumbling excuse for food.  Still, being of the lowest ranks of his order, he was at least entitled to this much, so it was best not to complain.  Literate enough to read some of the more basic spell scrolls, he held a position just high enough to be given the essentials, rather than having to fight over scraps in the pit.  He had even been presented with a bo staff and wicker cloak by his pack elder, better than those other uneducated runts.  And luckily he didn't have to compete for food with some of the less fortunate members of the pack, who seemed to have contracted a bad case of rabies.  Probably made the mistake of ingesting the bone marrow of a wayward skeleton from beyond the Above-Place.<br>
<br>
Howls echoed through the remains of the ruined dining hall, as two runts came scurrying through.  A rather plump human-looking male, clad in bearskins and rawhide, ran after them, wheezing as he swung a flail wildly about his head.  The man-creature, although very round, was also very tall, and came through the doorway hunched over.  Eager to practice his fighting skills, Gryk'rrt cracked the creature over the back of the neck with his staff, and jumped back onto a table.  With some difficulty, he formed Common-Speech words, and waved his staff in the air (for the benefit of the runts, of course), a blue light sparkling before him.  The wild-eyed man-thing tried rising to its feet, but could only yawn before falling heavily to the ground.  The scavenging runts, seeing the threat subdued, turned back to tear through the fallen creature's pockets and pouches.<br>
<br>
The next sound to reach the shaman's ears was the barking of orders.  The Huntmaster, a gargantuan kobold called Furgil, bounded into the room, flanked by a pair of sentinels.  Every kobold in the room, from the youngest runt to the oldest shaman, turned to face the Huntmaster.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grrr...dark ones come from new city,&quot; Furgil snarled, &quot;and have rabies!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Every ear in the place perked up, and fur stood on end.  Surely, the master meant the loathe sickness-magic that the people of Above-Place used.  Or perhaps the skeletons that they brought with them, whose bones crunched so pleasantly but contained bitter marrow that made the eyes red and the tongue swell.  No matter, this would be a chance for Gryk'rrt to prove his newfound mastery of magic.  Perhaps the High Shaman would be there?<br>
<br>
With a choking grip, one of the sentinels grabbed Gryk'rrt and another lesser shaman by the back of the neck and dragged them both out the door, kicking at the two whelps who were still picking through their recent prizes.  Around corners and under crumbling archways they raced, some twenty or thirty kobolds.  Finally, they reached a wood-framed entry, near the tunnel to Above-Place.  Erected here was a crude wall of bamboo stakes, lashed together with all manner of tree roots and discarded leather scraps.  A trench spanned the width of the passage, several feet deep and seething with large rats.  Kobold guards, clad in armor of wicker and bamboo, shifted nervously on their hind legs as a pair of Packmasters cracked their vicious whips with nervous laughter.  The Huntmaster pounded a fist against his cold iron breastplate, before drawing a bronze katana and taking his place on a fallen granite pillar.  Torches were extinguished, and the entire pack, once chattering and barking loudly, fell silent.<br>
