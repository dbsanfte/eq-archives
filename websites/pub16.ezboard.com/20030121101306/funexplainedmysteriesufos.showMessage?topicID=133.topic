A spokesman of Vatican proclaimed today in front of the international press that there must be other humanlike creatures living on ohter planets. Even the Holy Father would shares that opinion!<br>
<br>
My question is: WHY this suprisingly change in the minds of the leaders of the Catholic Church in Rome? And WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN NOW?<br>
<br>
I am convinced something very spectacular has happend. Not only that the Vatican has one of the world's best Secret Services. The Vatican is also constantly informed about the newest informations of the world's most active Secret Services. So will they prepare us for an unbelieveble  annoncment, that will follow the next days or weeks?<br>
<br>
What is your opinion about this news in the press?<br>

However, aliens in our image sounds just a touch egocentric to me. <br>
I DO believe that, supposing our own species survives and evolves over thousands of years into an eventual life-form far higher in physical and mental adaptation to the prevailing norm, that were we catch a fore-glimse of these advanced beings we would see absolutely nothing of ourselves in them. I also suspect that, like the anti-Darwinians of the 19th century, they would seek every means of distancing themselves from the gruesome truth of their genesis.<br>
Is there the remotest possibility the archetypal smallish, slant-eyed 'aliens' are an evolved form of ourselves from our own not-too-distant future. It would be one way of convincingly explaining the seeming reluctance of these interlopers to involve themselves in our affairs, or even interact with us in any more than a superficial way . . . and of explaining a morphology surprisingly similar to our own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 3496<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/9/02 6:41:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=133.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Pope, aliens, etc.</span><hr size=1> Hmmmm ...

&quot;Vatican Astronomer - 'It's Madness To Believe Man Is Alone'<br>
From Scott Corrales <br>
lornis1@juno.com <br>

<br>
El Mundo (newspaper-Spain) Monday, January 7,2002 <br>
  <br>
&quot;It's Madness to Believe that Man is Alone&quot; Vatican Astronomier Admits Possibility of Extraterrestrial Life. <br>
  <br>
(EFE) - Jesuit George Coyne, director of the Vatican Observatory, is convinced of the existence of extraterrestrial life and states that it is &quot;madness&quot; to think than humans are alone in the universe. <br>
  <br>
Father Coyne and his scientific team reached this conclusion after studying the heavens from the astrophysical research center located at the Papal summer residence at Castelgandolfo near Rome. <br>
  <br>
&quot;The universe is so vast that it would be madness to think that we're an exception,&quot; said Coyne in an interview with the Milan newspaper &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, underlining that &quot;each day new data is amassed&quot; which leads to the possibility of life forms different from those found on Earth. &quot;The more we study the stars, the more aware we become of our own ignorance,&quot; he adds. <br>
  <br>
The Jesuit prist, responsible since 1978 for an observatory with more than a century of history behind it and reporting directly to the Holy See, states that &quot;Science does not undermine faith; rather, it stimulates it.&quot; <br>
  <br>
He admits not having any proof of extraterrestrial life. <br>
  <br>
However, he admits that while there is no scientific evidence today that proves the existence of life beyond Earth, Coyne is aware that this eventuality opens a disquieting series of mysteries for believers, and represents &quot;a great challenge&quot;, but that it should not be considered to be a &quot;dramatic&quot; event. <br>
  <br>
In this regard, the astronomer points out that certain sectors of the Church consider it negative to debate or study matters which could make Catholic doctrine &quot;tremble somewhat.&quot; However, he insists that there is not necessarily any conflict between the Biblical orgin of the Cosmos and the current ones being championed by science, such as the Big Bang. ___ <br>

I just don't see how it could ever square with Catholic doctrine.  <br>
<br>
For example... would the Church take the view that Jesus came to Earth to save only human beings, or all the creatures on all planets?  If the latter was the case.. why would he choose to come here?<br>
<br>
Seems to me like the whole structure of this religion (and most religions)  would come tumbling down.<br>

now these aliens dont want to cause world wide panic(which they would do if they just appeared)<br>
<br>
<br>
now in times of great stress people turn to there church (or faith) for comfort .So if one of the biggest faiths starts to tell people that aliens 'most likely' exist people will start to accept the idea<br>
<br>
i will be watching very carefully here to see if any other of the 'big faiths' start making similar noises<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned earlier 'The Vatican'  is well informed  they definately know more about whats going off than we do . <br>
