Thinking hard on it I have come to some conclusions about where I want to go in Norrath and how I want to get there. Yet there are some things I’d like input on. Let me preface saying one of the joys of EQ for me is that I can help people in ways I cannot in real life. <br>
<br>
1) Money for Ports:<br>
<br>
My push for 29 then 34 were pushes for the ports. I wanted to be able to port my guild mates around. Making money on ports was not my motivation. I have taken money for ports and on rare occasion auctioned these services for plat. My initial thought was that I shouldn’t have charged for a port, yet with further thought and consideration I have nothing to be ashamed of. I am wearing the same gear I had at 19 with the exception of upgrading one of my rings from +6 to +7. What did I do with the money? What I always do. I gave it away to a lower level having a rough time in the form of a newbie quest or whatnot. I took someone’s convenience money and used it to make someone else’s day.<br>
<br>
Should I take money for ports when I come back to EQ? <br>
<br>
2) Sow me plz:<br>
<br>
My attitude here is questionable. I will usually oblige someone I can see. I do get bent out of shape when I see “I need a sow at the crossroads” in ooc or shout. The implication that everyone in the zone is supposed to drop what they are doing to buff him (her) seems the height of arrogance. It is not even asking, it’s a statement. As a result I usually have some smart-ass remark for them. I just can’t stand such blatant arrogance, intended or not. <br>
<br>
What would be a better way of handling this sort of situation?<br>
<br>
3) Leveling:<br>
<br>
Hurry up and level to X!!! I cannot tell you how often I have heard this. And to a degree I understand my guild mates wanting me to move forward, but how important is it REALLY? I have just as much fun at 36 as I did at 19. And I would prefer my levels come as a result of my adventures rather then quading goblins for hours on end. But most people are in this “I want phat l00t” drive and are leveling as fast as they possibly can so they can get it. <br>
<br>
Who’s missing the boat here? Is the high level game that much better?<br>
<br>
I appreciate your thoughtful responses in advance. Thank you for replying.<br>

I have no problem paying a few plat for them, but I will say that the ratio of free ports to paid ports is about equal. I do have limits though. I will not pay more than 25pp to port anywhere unless it is a DIRE emergency. Now that I've said that, I can't think of anything that important in the game. <br>
<br>
SOWing people. I have my own problems with that, being a Shaman and all. I will not SOW anyone who I cannot see. Nor will I travel the zone to find you when you send me a tell asking for it. If you would like a SOW from me please ask politely, while standing in front of me. I will rarely offer my 49 buffs for cash donations, but usually I like my donations in the form of bat wings and fish scales.<br>
<br>
Leveling is a tough one. I have many RL friends who are far lower level than I am. I do want them to catch up to me so we can go do things together. I've been to Fear only one time (thanks for the ride IG) and I'd LOVE to go again. I'd like it even more if my friends would get off their EC trading and camping for item X and gain some damned levels so we can go together. Other than that I am perfectly happy to let levels happen as they happen. I am enjoying dipping my Troll toesies in the pool of the high level game. I'm getting into the &quot;raid&quot; thing now. <br>
<br>
I will say being the only Shaman on a dragon raid SUCKS. You spend all your time buffing. My first Nagafen raid I didn't even get to see him alive. However, I did enjoy being the only Shaman on a Kael raid. Now there was some fun. &quot;You will not evade me, Kraaga!&quot; was the giant battle-cry. Summoned 9 times and didn't die once, thanks in part to a high AC, but mostly to the tanking abilities of the warrior-gods that were with us. I think that, as I get into it, the high level game will be quite alot of fun. I can see it getting old though, but I think for me it will be a long while before that happens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uxorshaik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Xorshaik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/25/01 2:41:38 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Some fields are missing</span><hr size=1> Bleh, we needed more shamen on Vox Saturday, hehe..

<br>
I usually tell them I can't port unless they have a corpse somewhere that I can get to easilly.  (Yes, I do get asked for ports sometimes)  Seriously now, if I could port, I might accept donations which are up to the giver, not the receiver.<br>
<br>
Sow Plz:<br>
Well, that's an easy one..   I agree with you.  I usually trade a big fat cleric buff for a sow.  If I am asking someone to run to the wizard spires in NK to sow my group (our fave spot because younger characters are there with their new sow spells and could likely use the cash)  They are rewarded with plat, Cleric Buffs, sometimes clarity, sometimes all of the above.  In other words, I make sure they are well taken care of.  <br>
<br>
Level!:<br>
I get crap for this.  &quot;Go hunt these mobs for 8 hours and you'll get this level!&quot;  Others want to see me at such-and-such level.  I am a procrastinator and I never did enjoy people telling me what to do, and since I have this rebellion, I think I'll stay level 50 for about 6 more months.  That, or I'll pick up again when I stop procrastinating... Someday... Maybe. <p>Alihja Zanzibar <br>

I don't know how I ever lived without it!  If I provide a service that uses my playing time, I have no moral or ethical doubts about porting for plat items.  That's not to say I won't do it for free, but I sure won't turn down some plat either.  And if someone asks for a port to Velious or an evac in Kunark, they should be willing to kick in a bit more.  <br>
<br>
I generally will SoW/buff people who ask nicely, if I'm not in the middle of something.  That does not include &quot;s0w me plz&quot;, because...<br>
<br>
1) It is not in the form of a question.<br>
<br>
2) &quot;plz&quot; is not a recognized word in my native English tongue.<br>
<br>
3) Even if it was a word, or was spelled properly, refer to #1...&quot;plz&quot; as part of an order is not a display of good manners or politeness.<br>
<br>
As for the pursuit of levels, I prefer to see Norrath at a more relaxed pace when possible.  I spent a month in lvl 51, and while I took longer than I cared for, I got to go to some neat places, attend my first dragon and planes raids, and get to know my guildmates and fellow Druzzil Ro residents better.  Play at a comfortable pace.<br>
