I don't give what the hell they think, but it is common courtesy of the inviter AND the raid leader to make sure the guest is treated fairly, almost as if it was one of their members.  Lack of communication is not excuse to be an ignorant jackass.  This includes neglecting a guest to the point that they cannot belong in groups, have no reply to tells, etc. <p>Soneldar Blackrose<br>

As for you gelroniex,<br>
<br>
I'm sorry you felt you were not treated well a few days ago, it wasn't my intention.  You were in my group I believe and I didn't reinvite you after I had to /q to clear aggro because hey i forgot or something like that.  At that time I was <br>
a. trying to get my guild organized to ToV<br>
b. pulling<br>
c. trying to keep my guild from training ourselves<br>
d. trying to get groups for the mass that filtered in late<br>
e. had about 5 non guilded not hearing our guildchat<br>
<br>
Do I have a responsibilty to see that every guest is included, especially the 5 we had there that night?  Maybe, It is all subjective to what you mean by included, to some you need to talk to them every so often ... to others it is just the satisfaction of being included at that raid.  But in no way am I a babysitter.  If you need a group send me a tell and i'll find one for you, don't go pouting off in a corner and not say a word, my logs didn't indicate not 1 tell from you after i reformed the group without you.  Do i need to ask every single guest, &quot;so how have you been treated?&quot;  &quot;Is it ok to pull are you ready for inc?&quot;  <br>
<br>
I'm sorry you are used to be treated like a princess and require more attention than I probably gave you.  And another thing, what did you expect by posting here?  You want the whole server to feel sorry for you because you were ignored?  Every person knows by posting here they will get flamed.  Sure this is a public board and people can speak what they think but you have to expect to get put under the fire.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubrethriverwind.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Breth Riverwind</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/26/02 2:05:50 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Guests</span><hr size=1> All I have to say is this.<br>
<br>
I have been a guest on quite a few IG raids and I enjoyed my self quite a bit.  It is not really that hard to find someone to group with if groups get reformed for whatever reason.  Sure it does not always happen right away.<br>
<br>
Besides things have went like this for me.  Tag along, keep quite, watch and learn a lot that I did not know before.<br>

In fact I have not been with IG in a while and hope to join them again more in the future.<br>

It's been run and admined by people from all types of guilds (including uberguilds) for the past two years.  <br>
<br>
Those who think people hate them because they are uber, should maybe take a wide eyed look around them...  <br>
<br>
Maybe it's got nothing to do with uberness.  Yah, sure.  Perhaps the 1700 people who visit here are all psychotic freaks, who are jealous.  Or, maybe the board is just plainly, anti-dickhead.  Even those who claim to be anti-dickhead are sometimes the dickheads (myself included)..  <br>
<br>
Perhaps people who fequent this board have read assinine posts and they think that the assinine posters are .. uhm.. assinine.  It's possible that some assinine posters may belong to uber-guids.  It's possible that some don't.  Could it be, that some readers have acquired this knowledge and are applying it to the way that they treat those people?  Hmmm...  it certainly is a possibility.  <br>

And that point is: Your Mileage May Vary.  Period. (PS: Good to see you around again Breth!)<br>
<br>
Gel - however you were treated, you should have taken it up with an officer or the person who invited you.  Not run straight to the DR boards to make it a public discussion.  Like anyone else here, I can only speculate on what happened.  But I think Gimmy summed it up well.<br>
<br>
Everyone - quit speculating you jerkuses. Quit whining.  Everyone's so quick to jump on the bandwagon. &quot;Ah hah! This confirms it!  Because one person claims they were unfairly treated as a guest and someone from Honed recently left to join a different guild, this confirms my suspicion that GuildX is in fact selling blackmarket goats to Bolivia!&quot; Big thing to remember: *you* *were* *not* *there*.  Nor is this the X-Files, Mulder.  There's no big consiracy to intentionally piss people off. Therefore, please shuddup about it already.<br>
<br>
As for folks from my guild making fun of the person who originated this post.  I think thats probably a fairly common reaction when someone blindsides you with accusations in a public forum instead of coming to you first and talking about it.   Misunderstandings happen - especially when our only means of communication is a small window at the bottom of the screen.<br>
<br>
Misunderstandings not unlike this:<br>
<br>
BEDEVERE: How do you know she is a witch? <br>
<br>
VILLAGER #2: She looks like one. <br>
<br>
BEDEVERE: Bring her forward. <br>
<br>
WITCH: I'm not a witch. I'm not a witch. <br>
<br>
BEDEVERE: But you are dressed as one. <br>
<br>
WITCH: They dressed me up like this. <br>
<br>
CROWD: No, we didn't -- no. <br>

WITCH: And this isn't my nose, it's a false one. <br>
<br>
BEDEVERE: Well? <br>
<br>
VILLAGER #1: Well, we did do the nose. <br>
<br>
BEDEVERE: The nose? <br>
<br>
VILLAGER #1: And the hat -- but she is a witch! <br>
<br>
CROWD: Burn her! Witch! Witch! Burn her!<br>

Agree<br>
<br>
&quot;If you weren't involved or don't have any interest in the situation, your thoughts and opinions on the matter don't amount to anything. &quot;<br>
<br>
Don't agree. Poster made it public. That makes it fair sport for all. Everyone has a right to post whatever they want. Everyone has a right not to read it. And just as your opinion has been voiced, others have too.<br>
<br>
There are actually some good things to get from this thread. 1) treat your guests with respect, and 2) treat your inviters like they are busy. We got that from many posters, not just those involved.<br>

To everyone, not just Kumkackle. I'm so sick of the whole uber thing.  Can't call yourself uber.  No, you can't do that - get plenty O' fun poked at you if you do that.  You can only be *accused* of being uber and then all the bad conotations that go with that.  Isn't that kind of interesting?<br>
<br>
Furthermore, what in the f*ck turned us all into such a whiny bunch of bitches?  First we whine endlessly about the IGB.  Then we whine endlessly about &quot;uber&quot; guilds, the raid reservations, then Honed, then Vindication, then the Legends server, then back to the IGB and Hoss and ML, and some guest got an unfair shake with IG on a raid... and Jesus H. Christ - enough already!  I assure you that &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; would suit all of your whiny ass needs better than EQ.  Whiny?  I'm whiny too.  Whining about you all whining at this point *thumbs his nose*<br>

But I also know that negativity breeds more negativity, and that by retorting his remarks with negative responses only helps to add to a downard spiral.  I just think that people should be a little more mature about how they react to things (yes the thread starter in a way too.).  <br>
<br>
I think that he started the thread because he was personally hurt from the actions of IG, and he wanted to voice his opion of their reputation, which is fine, maybe not proper but his right all the same.  Now it is also their right (and any others) for IG to reply with a negative reply to this thread, however... I believe that as a guild they degrade their reputation more (I dont know much about IG but this lowered my opinon of them off the bat) by responding to him as they did instead of upholding a better guild image by being mature and respectful in their defense.  <br>
<br>
People are people, I wish more would realize this and learn to respect others, at least be respectful in your postings.  In IG's case be the better man then the one posting not become the lesser man. <p><img src="http://www.spaztastic.com/sig.jpg">

<br>
1) Be a thoughtful and gracious host<br>
2) Be a thoughtful and gracious guest<br>
<br>
to the nice IG people posting angry replies here:  Just a suggestion..  take it or leave it.  Maybe try to stop being defensive for just a second.  Listen to yourself and this person.. so that you can learn from this.  Someone is telling you how your guild made them feel as a guest on your raid.  Why they chose to do this publicly, I don't know...  but why not learn from what they are trying to tell you instead of belittling them and trying to invalidate their feelings?  <br>
<br>
To the original poster:  Don't know who you are...  but by publicaly complaining about a guild who invited you on their raid...  Err...  ah,  You probably don't have to worry about them ignoring you on one of their raids anymore..  In FACT, I'd be surprised if they invited you in the future.  You appear to be intelligent, and you probably already understood that...  and while you typed that original post, you probably didn't give a rip if they ever reinvited you again or not.  (one can only imagine) Ah well, even though a lot of people got their underoos in a knot...  Thanks for posting!<br>
<br>
Boy and girls, (and/or boys who play girls)...  I think something can be learned from this thread, and I don't give a ratt's patootie what guild you're in or what level you are.  This thread teaches us a thing or two about raid ettiquette and respecting the feelings of your hosts and guests.<br>

<br>
She had an incident with a guild she used to respect where she felt ignored.  Instead of discussing it in tells or even on the guilds boards she decides to post it on a server wide message board.  A good demonstration of a poor decision.<br>
<br>
I would hope that what was learned here is that if you have an issue with someone (or a group of someones) that it's best to discuss it with them instead of running around telling everyone how awful they are... which works equally well for RL as in game.  Of course, posting it on a public msg boards is much more entertaining and trolls need to eat.<br>
