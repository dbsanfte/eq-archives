  Silbus, if you see anyone charging those sort of prices in the region of the state you live in, please contact the Attorney Generals office.  It is a clear violation of Texas' Deceptive Trade Practices Law to raise prices under the current circumstances.  The AG's office has already issued statements saying they will prosecute anyone doing this. <br>

<br>
Two people went onboard in wheelchairs.......one person was pushing each one, making a total of 4 people going on board without passing through any kind of safety device........this pattern was present on all 4 flights as &quot;Two wheelchair confined passengers&quot; was apparently found on copies of the manifests obtained by the FAA.<br>
<br>
Here's the catch..........the wheelchairs and the people pushing the chairs were allowed to go AROUND the metal detectors......<br>
<br>
10 of them were actually caught on camera as they passed down the halls after the metal detectors were passed.........all 10 matched possible descriptions of &quot;Arab nationality&quot;.<br>
<br>
Just coincidence?  What do you think?  I'm also wondering why if there were only 4 terrorists armed with ONLY boxcutters as the media is reporting, why weren't they overpowered?  I'm sure 67+ people onboard a plane are more than capable of taking down 4 men armed with only boxcutters........yes, people are going to get cut, yes, people might die in the attempt....but I know that if I were in a situation like that, I wouldn't die without at least trying to do something.  Of the 10+ phone calls made and reported from the flights, nobody mentioned any other weapons besides boxcutters/knives........if guns were on the terrorists, I'm sure they would've had them out, and ready to fire, not tucked away........if that's what ends up being a fact in this terrorist act, I already have a letter written to the Senator involving a few possible ideas:<br>
<br>
1.  Place armed military/law enforcement personnel on EVERY flight coming to/leaving/or travelling across the U.S.......no name or info on the passenger manifest to give away possible armed passengers on the aircraft.  Equip that person/persons with a transmitter device that he/she/they can press in the event of a hostage situation, that will alert the FAA immediately at the time of crisis, granting them enough time to organize an attempt to intercept the aircraft before the terrorists even know that they've been compromised.  Airlines make enough money as it is transferring plane loads of people, what harm will it do to allow 5-6 free passengers on board that are highly trained to defuse terrorist situations that will undoubtedly save lives in the event of an emergency?<br>
<br>
2.  Enable the use of military force if necessary........I know a lot of you will disagree with this, but I agree with it totally, after seeing what happened today.......suppose the previous two were already in effect.  It may seem cruel, and cold hearted to some of you, I don't know, but say the personnel I mentioned above were onboard.  They press the transmitter, and it flags the FAA, then if possible, take care of the terrorist situation, and get the plane to safety.  If the situation cannot be taken care of, then maybe the only means available is to notify the terrorists by way of U.S. fighter pilots that will shoot the aircraft down if the landing/flying conditions are not met.  Had these been in effect, one of two possibilities could've ocurred:<br>
<br>
1.  The team onboard was able to overpower all terrorists, no lives lost, plane lands safely.<br>
<br>
2.  The team onboard is not able to overpower all terrorists, planes are shot down, casualty rate is 266, as opposed to the 10,000 we could possibly be facing.  <br>
<br>
Before today, I would've NEVER suggested these options......but today, these terrorists brought a new form of attack on U.S soil that will undoubtedly be used again by someone else, and you can bet the next time will be more deadly, the new terrorists having learned from these terrorists' mistakes (i.e, not killing the pilot in the failed crash attempt).  They will make no mistakes about that.......all crewmembers WILL be killed, leaving no chance for failure, unless the U.S. military is the cause for their failure.<br>
<br>
I also believe that passengers should be DEMANDED to sign a clause, stating that they agree that if the aircraft should be hijacked, then they are agreeing to the use of military force outside of the aircraft........no lawsuits by family members, nothing.  They agreed to the danger of flying, along with the chance at being hijacked.<br>
<br>
Do the numbers in your head, do the research on how many hijacked flights ended in a fairly decent way......then do the research on how many hijacked flights ended tragically.  Unfortunately, I'm sure you'll find that more end tragically, due to the fact that we don't negotiate with terrorists.<br>
<br>
I'll get off my soap box now, since I have to be at the blood bank in 3 hours.  I am totally in favor for everything I've listed.  If I were on a plane that was hijacked, I know I'd realize that I was probably dead anyway........I just had a little bit of work left to do in my short time on Earth.  And I'd be damned if some vision crazy, psycho, religious, money grubbing asshole is going to take the life I've worked so hard at making the best of, without me fighting the son of a bitch till my dying breath.......<br>
<br>
With that said, I'll close this with my sincere condolences to everyone affected by this horrible tragedy.  My heart is with you all......to the innocent women, men, and children on board the planes and in the Towers/Pentagon, may God bless you always, and hold you close to Him in the Kingdom of Heaven.<br>

<br>
I too thought why 50+ people could not over power 4-5 men... The only thing i could come up with, which probably occured, was one or more people were probably held hostage aboard the plane and the terrorists probably told the rest of the people on board that if they didnt co-operate, then the people would be hurt... If i were aboard the plane, i wouldnt think that a plane would be crashed on purpose and used as a weapon, and im sure that the terrorists did not give any leads to that either... =\ <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udinthar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dinthar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 111<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/12/01 7:53:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: New info</span><hr size=1> oh, btw... im sure it wasnt the terrorists intention to crash the plane in pennsylvania... it was suposed to hit DC =\ in that case... im sure it was the passengers on board that had done something. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ufinnsonorcbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Finnson Orcbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/12/01 10:01:56 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Don't take the bait!</span><hr size=1> I make a plea to you all in this dreadful time:<br>

Anyone with an ounce of decency deplores the acts of savage barbarity displayed yesterday NOT solely against America but against the free world and humanity as a whole. Be assured - the vast majority of humanity sympathises and mourns the position of those caught up in this whole affair.<br>

It's possible that the passengers on the other planes had no idea they were headed toward a building.  Terroists may have told them they were returning to the airport. <p>Kragstomper Steinblade<BR>
