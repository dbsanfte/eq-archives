<br>
Also, the following was taken from a post on CNN.com:<br>
<br>
&quot;1) What happened to make the plane crash in Pennsylvania? Did it get shot down? Isn't it a little too ironic that this specific crash had little coverage? <br>
<br>
2) Lady Liberty watched the whole day unfold. But, everyone around the world show notice that she is still carrying the torch proclaiming what America is all about. <br>
<br>
3) A, B, and C are the first three letters of the alphabet. Airplane crashes, Biological weapons, and Chemical weapons are three major threats to the USA. I hope they don't hurt us in that order. <br>
<br>
4) The bidding and selling activity on eBay items with the search words &quot;World Trade Center&quot; jumped tremendously within hours of the first reports of the tragedy. Nearly all the items listed were removed by eBay within 30 minutes to an hour. <br>
<br>
5) I would not be very surprised to wake up tomorrow and learn that Bin Laden has been assassinated. <br>
<br>
6) Do the insurance policies of the companies located in the World Trade Center cover attacks such as this? Is this considered an Act of War? I would not want to have equity in any insurance company tied into the WTC. <br>
<br>
7) Is the worst behind us? Or is the worst yet to come? What could be next? In Chicago today, I felt VERY vulnerable being so close to the Sears Tower. During my entire commute while transfixed by the radio, I kept one eye on the landmark proclaiming the nation's best skyline. <br>
<br>
8. Is there any irony in today's date 9-11? Is there any irony in that one of the flight numbers was #11?&quot;<br>
<br>

something where there is nothing.<br>
<br>
Nostrodamus (bah, suddenly I cannot spell) was a complete<br>
moron maniac.  Nothing he has EVER SAID has come true.<br>
Except for the fact that you can manipulate whatever<br>
he said to fit the event you want. (look up people like<br>
James Randi who debunk all his claptrap..;-)<br>
<br>
But whenever something catastrophic occurs, someone (not<br>
you in this case, I have seen these stupid passage 3 other<br>
places) dregs up some random passage from his rantings and<br>
pretends that it is somehow connected.<br>
<br>
1) the plane in Pennyslvania was crashed, either because it<br>
was to late to hit the target or because of an internal<br>
struggle (I prefer the second theory personally).  It was<br>
LIKELY (*who knows*) heading to camp David.<br>
<br>
2) True<br>
<br>
3) And C D E could be Collapses, Dog attacks and Earthquakes<br>
(who knows?).  If we have Biological Weapons tomorrow I will<br>
eat my words, but why create panic for tomorrow because<br>
A B C is nice to say.<br>
<br>
4) No shock there.  Kinda sad.<br>
<br>
5) Not tomorrow.  Not until we have something that is PROOF.<br>
Of course, now we can take him out and point to the information that we got after the USS Cole was bombed.  So<br>
even if we don't know he is guilty for this, we know he is (more or less) for that.<br>
<br>
6) Insurance on such a large building is covered by a group<br>
of insurers who share coverages.  Basically each one has a<br>
certain percentage of the risk and makes a certain percentage<br>
of the profit.  This isn't your standard property/Casualty insurer like your State Farm or Allastate or Farmers, but are<br>
companies that do this kind of large scale coverage.  yes, I work in the insurance industry (heck, for one of those three listed companies..;-)<br>
<br>
7) Who knows.  But it won't be an airplane.  If I were a homicidal and stupid terrorist who decided to commit suicide and probably SINGLE HANDEDLY bring about the END of the terrorist/extremist Islamic movement (yeah, that will probably be the long term result of this), I would do car bombs tomorrow, or perhaps gas. (yes, this actually came from my brother in law who lives in DC and works 2 blocks away from the White House.  When they were sent home they were concerned about 'what next' and didn't particularly LIKE being in the Metro after the Sarin Gas attack in Japan several years back).<br>

Once we're clear on that point we can begin the discussion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In general though,<br>
<br>
Many people are dissatisfied with 'organized religion' that is why there are so many different organizations. Everyone thinks that they can do it better. Are they even stopping to ask if they should try? Hmmm...<br>
No one seems to be able to agree on the same interpretations for biblical passages and many times they try to come up with their own interpretations and push that as the 'truth'. Sometimes one passage of scripture is given emphasis over another and given an importance it most likely should not have. For example:<br>
<br>
'The glory of a woman is her hair...'<br>
<br>
This statement, in my mind, has been taken waaaay too seriously by certain religious groups and the women are not allowed to cut their hair. If I did that my whole head would be nothing but a tangled mess of split ends.<br>
<br>
While religion can be confusing at times I think that the core beliefs that are taught are good for people to learn and adhere to. Such as...<br>
<br>
The Golden Rule - Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. (Yes...this comes from the bible)<br>
<br>
I would much rather live in a nation of people belonging to organized religions that are trying to do what's right by god and mankind than live in a place where there are no churches and belief in God is prohibited or simply non-existant. Russia comes to mind.<br>
<br>
At least here in America you have the choice to follow a certain organized religion or not as your own beliefs dictate.<br>
<br>
To answer your question...<br>
<br>
I think people that are part of organized religions find comfort and support from their fellow members during the many trials that this life visits upon everyone and this is the main reason they choose to join one religion or another. It's not fun to cry alone. You can also share the many joys of faith and happy times in your life with those around you. In short...it's nice to be part of a group of people with like-minded faith and beliefs.<br>

<br>
Pilots are taught to follow the instructions given to them by the hijackers, as this is seen as the best method for maintaining life. It is likely that the terrorists instructed them to fly towards NYC, but at some point took over controls of the aircraft when it was deemed to be on a manageable flight path. Having said this at least 1 of the terrorists was in fact a qualified pilot, so it is possible, but unlikely that they flew them all the way.<br>
<br>
It was reported that the hijackers repeatedly told the crew that if they did not make any silly moves no one would get hurt. The hope of survival and the realisation that the hijackers were capable of killing was likely to cause fear and thus stop anyone from challenging them.<br>
<br>
It seems that the plane that went down before Camp D was a failed attempt, and it would be interesting to find out what happened (if we ever will). All i know is that if it was due to the pilot, he deserves to be branded a hero, for the saving of so many lives.<br>
<br>
The world has certainly changed now, and i expect a international unified effort to find those responsible and work to stop this sort of thing happening in the future. <br>

<br>
<br>
I dont think this terrible incident is a broad indictment of religions. To think so, would be ......intellectually shallow IMO.<br>
Saying that this incident is why religion is bad is like saying that black man that killed a taxi cab driver and drove off is why black people are bad. Nah, we know the folley of such way of thinking.<br>

My intent wasn't to quote Nostradamus and take his words for truth, it was simply to try and get some opinions from those of you here, as you've all proven to be inteligent and articulate. So... before you jump all over me for misquoting, or making a big deal out of nothing, that wasn't my intent.<br>
<br>
That being said, my purpose at the moment is try to make sense of things. As I said, the original questions 1-8, weren't mine, they were posted by someone on the CNN.com forums, but I thought they had a lot of merit and was curious to see how you guys would answer them. As it is, I'm still a little confused on a few points, most of which were brought up here. For example: if they were only armed with knives and boxcutters, wouldn't people try and overpower them? How many terrorists were on board? 1? 2? 20? I wish we had more information, but the details of what went on are sketchy at best. I can't even begin to fathom what must have been going through people's minds as the plane was being hijacked, and how those people must have felt being faced with the possiblity of death.<br>
<br>
Do I think it's over? Yes. For now, anyway. Although I think when retaliation occurs we're bound to see some sort of retaliation on their part as well. I think that if we go in guns blazing demanding justice, they're not exactly going to sit there and take it. I'm also convinced they have a backup plan for when the Americans strike back. For example, assume the leader of this terrorist movement is in Afghanistan at the moment. I have a feeling he's got people in other parts of the world as well, just waiting for the word to unleash more of what they've been trained to do. Just more food for thought, I guess. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :/ --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/ohwell.gif ALT=":/"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><center><TABLE BORDER="3" BORDERCOLOR="7B68EE" CELLSPACING="1" CELLPADDING="1"><TR><TD ALIGN = "center"><IMG SRC="http://amorae.homestead.com/files/sharyn3.jpg"></td><TD ALIGN = "center"><b><font size=3 FACE="Castellar"> Sharyn</font><br><FONT COLOR="7B68EE">Bewitching</FONT> Wood Elven Ranger<p><font size=3 FACE="Castellar">Bellara</font><br><FONT COLOR="7B68EE">Stunning</font> Barbarian Shamaness</TD></TR></table></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uaanamdaru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>aanamdaru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 6<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/12/01 11:23:14 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Food for thought (related to today's incidents)</span><hr size=1> Nostradamus (1503-1566) it seems that some of us (myself included) were fooled by this message too, he died  90ish years before this prediction was supposdly made.<br>

They killed flight attendants to lure pilots out of the cockpit, then took over the flights. . . probably after killing the pilots.  <br>
<br>
The terrorists flew the planes off course and into their targets, not the original pilots.  The passengers appear to have been hearded into the backs of the planes and held there by two of the three while the third flew the plane.  I can only imagine that they had no idea what was going on or they would have overpowered the terrorists and at least prevented the planes from hitting buildings.<br>
<br>
The plane that went down in Western PA was likely taken down by a few of the passengers overtaking the terrorists.  We'll probably find out a lot more once the black box from this aircraft is recovered and analyzed.  The other three may never be recovered. . .<br>
<br>
I only hope that the United States and the world react to this swiftly and terribly.  I can't imagine a punnishment too severe, a torture to inhumane for the perpetrators and the governments that harbored them. <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

Most are Palestinian in origin though not all Palestinians are terrorists.  Why do I feel it is based on religion you ask?  Well let me ask you a question Belegir do you know anything about the Islamic faith?  The reason why India and Pakistan, Afghanistan and Russia, Greece and Trukey, Isreal and Palenstine are mired in conflict is because of something so simple as a difference of religion.  Look to Bosnia as an example, yet another conflict over religion.  Moslem terrorists fight because of what they call a &quot;Holy war&quot; remember that.<br>
     As to how i feel about religion, well let me start with the common principle that all western religions are based upon, the Old Testament.  The old testament was originaly written in ancient hebrew with NO punctuation (ie commas or periods), basically it was a long series of words.  When it was converted to hebrew sentence structures were added in (ie commas, periods, and paragraphs) which completely alters the meaning.  Even the sheer fact that it is believed that the bible was written by God through man has an inherent flaw in it.  Let me ask you this if God wrote the bible, why are there so many different religions based on the word of God? Why do we have christianty or jeudism (sp?) or catholocism or moslem?  After all they are all based on the Old Testament from the bible.  <br>
     Another thing to remember is that the stories in the bible are a collection of stories told by man throughout the history of time.  The story of the virgin mary was also told as far back as the Egyptian civilization.  <br>
     Lets also take a look at how much damage has been done in the name of religion.  Romans persecuted christians during the start of that religion, Spain had its Inquisition, Enlgand and France its holy crusades, Moslem nations have their holy wars.  All this in the name of a benevolent God, or just an excuse to be able to kill people who hold a different value.<br>

Characterizing religion as a purely negative influence ignores all the tremendous contributions that religion has made to civilization.  Case in point: Islam ushered in a period of tremendous learning and commerce when it spread from a small sect to a major religion.  To focus only on the negative effects of religion is either dishonest or ignorant. <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>
