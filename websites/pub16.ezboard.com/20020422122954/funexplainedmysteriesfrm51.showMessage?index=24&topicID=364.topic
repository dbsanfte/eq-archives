Well, I guess I have a kinda obsessive personality, which has its up sides too.. if I get interested in or espec. *believe* in  something, then I want to know as much as poss about it, plus it is genuinely interesting finding out about the background to Christianity (&amp; other religions).. in other words, if the Bible isn’t ‘divinely inspired’ (which obviously I believe it wasn’t) then who wrote it and why, where did it come from? I like finding out about stuff like that (the Qumran Scrolls, the ‘forgotten’ Gospels that got junked by the Romans when the New Testament was formalised, etc).. it’s interesting.<br>

<br>
Nope, ofcourse  I’m  not saying YOU are evil.. I’m saying that (to me) the God decribed in the Bible *is* evil (or malign, whatever).. ultimately, I can’t *know* whether the Christian God or any other deity exists, my opposition to Christianity also lies in the fact that I don’t feel the God of the OT to be worthy of any respect, let alone worship, if He exists.. so I guess I’m very Deeply opposed to Christianity in that sense, beyond simply ‘non belief’.<br>

<br>
Sounds a good idea!  It’s interesting posting topics about issues like these on boards not about religion etc .. I posted a topic about Satanism on the off topic section of a message board about a Vietnam War film.. which was really interesting &amp; got a really discussion going with lots of twists &amp; turns (though I kinda think people missed the point of what I was saying, which was about *labels*)<br>

<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> I've been thinking about some themage in this post apocalyptic epic fantasy comic that I'm drawing, &quot;Paper Eagles&quot;... I would like a scene somewhere in the comic where a Feanari warrior has my main character at swordpoint and is talking about his goddess demanding that he kill him, to which my main character replies something along the lines of &quot;Is your goddess really that afraid of me?

Hmmm, have you ever read any Anne Rice? One of the thngs I love about her writing is the way she weaves religious themes into so much of it, her background is as a catholic &amp; I guess that works its way into a lot of her work..<br>
<br>
In Queen of the Damned (the book, NOT the dreadful sounding travesty of a film) she describes the origins of the vampires, and goes way back to Egypt 1000s of years ago.. the Queen herself (Akasha) is obsessed with finding some sort of (redemptive?) religious ‘truth’.. she desperately needs to find a sorcer(ess) who’s for real, spirits that won’t turn out to be just shadows, she NEEDS faith.. in the end, she gets totally disillusioned, but fate (or a powerful spirit) intervenes.. she’s stabbed to ‘death’ along with her husband, but @ that point this spirit collects itself around her, assuming the physical form &amp; sensations it’s always craved by mingling with her blood, and the Dark Gift is born.<br>
<br>
Anyway, Akasha doesn’t require any of the empty ‘Gods’ or ‘Goddesses’ of her past, that have all let her down so badly.. she can become a ‘Goddess’ herself, ie. BE what she never could find..<br>
<br>
Well, it’s really well written &amp; Anne Rice novels are full of stuff like that (the main characters, many of them anyway, struggle with making sense of life, death, heaven &amp; hell etc etc.. actually, Anne Rices characters ~ the vampires~ say more about being human than any I’ve read anywhere.. like when Lestat ‘body switches’ &amp; becomes mortal for a period, but he’s lost sight completely of all the silly, messy practicalities of being human, like the fact that clothes aren’t just an adornment, you NEED them in the mddle of a harsh winter to avoid dying of pneumonia, you NEED to eat to live, you need to do lots of repetitive, tiresome, dumb things just to get by 24/7.. so he struggles hopelessly being ‘mortal’ again, and almost dies)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I’ve gone off on a BIGGG tangent now, and it’s late so I gotta go.<br>
<br>
See ya!!<br>

I saw the movie "Interview with the Vampire", but that's about it.  I've heard lots of bad things about the QotD movie...ugh...I find it amazing how Hollywood can take wonderful books and totally screw up the movies based upon them.  I have found two outstanding exceptions:  the current "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" movie, which keeps surprisingly true to the first book of my favorite book series ^_^ (They gave Arwen a bigger role and left out the parts about Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs,  but, otherwise, watching that movie was like reliving the time I read the book!), and "The Last Unicorn", which is an animted movie, and I was familiar with the movie before I ever read the book, but I read the book, and the movie was quite accurate to the book...then again, Peter S. Beagle, the author of the book did write the film's screenplay himself... Whenever I see a movie based on a book, I take it with a grain of salt, knowing that in all probability that the book is much, much better.  <br>
<br>
Weaving religious themage into writing is a good think in my humble opinion.  Though "The Lord of the Rings" are definitely secular fantasies, I find a lot of Christian themage in them, and I've read C.S. Lewis "Chronicles of Narnia" (save for the 5th and 7th books...argh..must get my paws on those, read them in high school and the library didn't have those two books of the series >_< !  )  <br>
<br>
And, I like to let my faith color my own writing.  I'm not preachy in my work (like the Left Behind authors are in theirs!), I just kind of use the symbolism and themage.  I think it makes books MUCH more interesting than leaving matters of faith and the human psyche out completely.  <br>
<br>
As for the original topic...um, the Inquisition was bad...but lots of diffrent faith groups have done atrocities in the name of their ideologies....it's not a faith thing, it's a human thing.  I don't see religion as the root of all human suffering and evil, I just think that large groups of humans like to use religion as a justification for doing bad things.  I mean, I don't see Muslims as a whole as evil people, though the terrorists who attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon were using their particular brand of Islam as a justification for their actions.  Yes, Christians and professed "Christians" have done lots of bad things in the name of God, but, lots of Mulisms have done bad things in the name of Allah, lots of Romans did bad things in the names of their gods, the Aztecs did bad things in the name of Quetzecoltyl  (Is the spelling right?  Aztec war-god)...<br>
<br>
yeah, and anywhere where too many people think alike and individual freedom is repressed...um...stand up to it....for I think getting too collective kinda breeds stuff like Inquisitions.  <br>
