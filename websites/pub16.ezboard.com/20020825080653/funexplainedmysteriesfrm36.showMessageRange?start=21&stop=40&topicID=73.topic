Anyone who seriously thinks we went to the moon either needs to read the book 'Dark Moon' or go take an Advil. Or both.<br>
<br>
In that book, it explains the Van Allen belts and why we cant pass them. It shows the pictures with shadows that face in opposite directions; a physical impossiblity. It shows that we DID NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY to make it there. In truth, the Soviets were many times closer to making it to the moon then the Americans.<br>
<br>
Solar wind? As for that, thats something NASA cooked up to explain the flag moving. There is no evidence that supports the existance of Solar wind.<br>
<br>
All the Soviet missions went well under the Van Allen radiation belts. The only missions that supposedly didn't were the Apollos.<br>

First of all, the Van Allen Belt is only about 25,000 miles deep and the Apollo spacecraft travelled at about 25,000 miles per hour... that means it only took about an hour for the astronauts to pass through it. Secondly, the thin aluminum skin of the spacecraft was actually enough protection because the radiation would bounce off it.<br>
<br>
Covered in Dark Moon. All false. The Van Allen belts are very dasngerous. Here's a seed of NASA floating around in people's brains.<br>
<br>
-Satellites in geosyncronous orbit (like TV broadcast satellites) are inside the Van Allen Belt for their entire lifetime. Electronics can be damaged by radiation just like our bodies, but these satellites function for years without showing any effect from the radiation.<br>
<br>
Also covered in the before mentioned book. The Van Allen belts are around Earth, but far enough away so that the craft which orbited Earth would not be harmed.<br>
<br>
-You have to ask yourselves why Fox or people like Bart Sibrel tell you these lies about the moon hoax. What motivates them? Money does. Fox needs to sell advertising, which is a lot easier to do when you produce contraversial programs. Sibrel has a movie to sell and expenses to recover. They are biased sources and can not be trusted.<br>
<br>
I agree with you there, but whats the best way to make money? Show them something amazing, and then PROVE IT beyond all doubt. Makes people go wild.<br>
<br>
-If you believe the landings were faked, maybe you can answer the following questions:<br>
<br>
I will.<br>
<br>
1) Who was NASA trying to fool? Russia? Russia (and just about every country on Earth) could track the Apollo spacecraft all the way to the moon using radar and by tracking Apollo's radio transmissions. Even amateur HAM radio operators could track Apollo using relatively cheap equipment. There is no way to trick Russia into believing Apollo went to the moon if it really didn't.<br>
<br>
They bounced the transmissions off the moon. We've been doing this for years.<br>
<br>
2) Where did the Apollo spacecraft go if not to the moon? People saw the rockets launch, so we know they at least went into Earth orbit. Any object as big as Apollo can be seen from the ground with just the naked eye. That means the Russians could have seen the Apollo pass overhead if it stayed in Earth orbit.<br>
<br>
One of the few questions we're unsure of. There are a few possiblilites:<br>
<br>
a.Apollo's mission was to find signs of extraterrestrial life on the Moon, which NASA already suspected. They did, and so used the 'backup' films to cover it up to the public, who they deemed not ready.<br>
<br>
b.NASA launched a rocket, empty. They knew the rocket would burn up in the Van Allen belts, and so they wouldnt worry about it. This is what I believe to be true.<br>
<br>
3) The astronauts returned over 840lbs. of moon rock to Earth. Moon rocks are unique and can not be found on Earth and can not be faked. The rocks from the moon are billions of years old and yet they have never been exposed to oxygen or water. They have been exposed to direct radiation from the sun as well as micrometeor impacts. So I ask, how did NASA fake the moon rocks?<br>
<br>
Is this fact, or something NASA told you? I dont believe you've SEEN the moon rocks, you just assume what NASA says is true. Actually, NASA refused to let the rocks be analyzed.<br>
<br>
4) Over 400,000 people worked on the Apollo program. How can that many people keep such a huge secret?<br>
<br>
The key word- they DIDN'T. Dark Moon calls these people 'Whistle-Blowers', who attempted to show to us the truth of the matter while not revealing what they did to NASA. Whistle-Blowers such as these allowed the shadow descrepancies to pass in the photos and other problems.<br>
<br>
5) Every second of every mission to the moon can be accounted for. There are audio and video recordings, photographs, and transcripts of everything the astronauts ever said or did during their missions. How could NASA fake all of that?<br>
<br>
..o.o; This is the easiest to answer. Its just like a movie. They had a script written out, and they recorded it there. It's really the photos that have the most problems. Ever seen the picture of the 'C' rock from Apollo 16? A rock with the letter 'C' written clearly on it, and the same 'C' on the ground. Perfect for the propmaster of the set. Plus, this C was airbrushed out in later pictures...why do that if it wasn't authentic?<br>
<br>
6) Why would NASA fake the moon landings in the first place? What would they gain from it? The consequences of a failed hoax would be far too serious to justify it. If a hoax was discovered the reputation of the US government would go down the toilet and America would become a joke for the rest of time. So why would they risk that just to trick Russia into believing they went to the moon?<br>
<br>
Easy-power. The Americans became the first ones to make it to the moon, which put the notion into everyone's heads that America had superior technology, when in fact it didn't. It was also during the Cold War, where America and the Soviets were locked in bitter conflict for superiority.<br>
<br>
In the 1960s, it WAS the common feeling to believe what you saw on TV. Now, this has faded more, as we are aware of the things people can do to film. NASA knew this, and exploted this belief.<br>

<br>
And the book is wrong. What are David Percy's credentials? What makes HIM more of an expert than someone from NASA? What does he know about radiation?<br>
<br>
How far up does an object (ie. a satellite) need to be in order to be in a geosyncronous orbit (an orbit that allows the satellite to remain over one part of the Earth)? The answer is roughly 22,000 miles... which is inside the Van Allen Belt.<br>
<br>
Scientists have been studying the Van Allen radiation for decades. Satellites would not function if the radiation was as powerful as you believe.<br>
<br>
But you expect me to believe the words of a so-called &quot;expert&quot; like David Percy who has NEVER performed ANY experiments to backup his claims about the Van Allen Belt. How does Percy know the radiation is deadly? Has he sent a probe into the VAB to study it? No? Then why should I believe him instead of NASA?<br>
<br>
Just like every other conspiro-nut I have talked to, you ignored my most important question, so I'll ask you again: How can NASA control EVERY person on Earth who has the ability to expose the hoax FOR THE REST OF TIME? They CAN'T. It is impossible. That means the hoax was doomed to fail from the start. So why fake the moon landings just to end up destroying the reputation of the United States?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It shows the pictures with shadows that face in opposite directions; a physical impossiblity.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Then how did these shadows happen? Multiple light sources?<br>
<br>
Guess what? Multiple light sources create MULTIPLE SHADOWS. Show me one picture that has TWO or more shadows cast from every object.<br>
<br>
Shadows don't have to run parallel. They CAN intersect and you can see it for yourself right here on Earth. Just open your eyes.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Solar wind? As for that, thats something NASA cooked up to explain the flag moving. There is no evidence that supports the existance of Solar wind.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

I guess you've never seen video from the SOHO satellite, or heard of solar flares, or the Northern Lights?<br>
<br>
And I guess you have never heard of solar sail spacecrafts which will use the solar wind for propulsion in the future.<br>
<br>
Ok smart guy... if there is no solar wind then where does the radiation in the VAB come from? If there was no solar wind there would be no VAB, and that would mean it was safe to go to the moon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Also covered in the before mentioned book. The Van Allen belts are around Earth, but far enough away so that the craft which orbited Earth would not be harmed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
According to Bart Sibrel the VAB is between 1000 and 25000 from Earth, and believe it or not NASA actually agrees with those numbers. Geosyncronous orbit is in the middle of that. If &quot;Dark Moon&quot; says otherwise they are wrong.<br>
<br>
These facts are not hard to prove. Every communications or television company knows where geosyncronous orbit is, and they know whether the VAB affects their satellites. They will tell you the same thing I did. Does NASA control every television satellite company on Earth?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> They bounced the transmissions off the moon. We've been doing this for years.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
That creates delays and degradation in the signal. The Russians would have detected that.<br>
<br>
It takes roughly 1.5 seconds for radio signals to travel from Earth to the moon and another 1.5 seconds for the return (for total round trip of about 3 seconds). Doing what you claim would double the delay. Again, the speed of radio (the speed of light) is something that has been understood for a long time, NASA can't fake it.<br>
<br>
And I seriously doubt bouncing signals off the moon is accurate enough to simulate multiple radio sources coming from precisely where NASA claimed the spacecrafts would be at any given second. When the lander separated from the Command Module there were two radio sources, and each moved in different directions and at different speeds.<br>
<br>
Have you ever heard of the dopler effect? A radio signal from an object moving away from the receiver is different than one moving towards the receiver. The dopler effect could be detected in the Apollo signals. You wouldn't get the same dopler effect by bouncing signals off the moon.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Is this fact, or something NASA told you? I dont believe you've SEEN the moon rocks, you just assume what NASA says is true. Actually, NASA refused to let the rocks be analyzed.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Independent scientists from all over the world have studied the moon rocks. Russia brought back lunar samples using probes and compared them to rocks that NASA gave them. <br>
<br>
And before you claim NASA used probes to return 840lbs. of rocks don't bother. It would have been impossible to do so. The most the Russians managed to bring back using probes was a few pounds at best.<br>
<br>

<br>
The &quot;C&quot; is nothing but a small hair that was on one of the pictures when it was scanned into the computer. The &quot;C&quot; does not show up on the original photograph or on the negative. A close examination of the &quot;C&quot; shows a shadow behind the hair, just like you would expect to see if it was an object on top of the picture.<br>
<br>
You seem to believe the pictures you see on the internet are the originals. They aren't. They have been scanned, copied, distorted by file compression, cropped, colour corrected, and various other things. It's not far fetched to believe one photograph had a speck of dust or hair fall onto it before it was scanned.<br>
<br>

That's a load of bull. So the US has superior technology. Big deal. Is that worth the risk of a failed hoax? Do you REALLY believe the United States would risk destroying their reputation just to have bragging rights over Russia?<br>

It would have been less embarrassing to admit going to the moon isn't possible.<br>

<br>
Let's see... who should I believe? A guy with no scientific background who has never done a single experiment, or NASA who employs thousands of scientists with tons of supporting evidence backing them up? <p><BR>

<br>
Ok, let's say they had to fake the first mission but all the following missions were real. That means it is possible to go to the moon, which means there is nothing stopping Russia or China from going to the moon in the future.<br>
<br>
So if China goes to the moon they might decide to check out the supposed Apollo 11 landing site... but if it was faked there would be nothing there. Don't you think China would make it well known to the world that Apollo 11 never really happened?<br>
<br>
That's what hoax believers fail to consider. They only think about the past and the people who were involved in the conspiracy way back when. But a hoax like that would have to be maintained for the rest of time. That means anyone in the future who might be able to discover the truth has to be prevented from doing so.<br>
<br>
America has enemies... they can't stop China from going to the moon if that's what they decide to do (and they have said that is one of their goals).<br>
<br>
So my point is that NASA would not fake any of the moon landings because the hoax would be 100% guaranteed to fail eventually, and the consequences would be too serious. Like I said before, it would be less embarrassing to admit going to the moon is impossible if that's the case. <p><BR>

There are explanations for both.<br>
<br>
In one example it shows two astronauts and one rock in the foreground. The two clips looked identical, but according to Fox they were filmed at different locations at different times. But like FraterLiber said it is simply a filing error. Someone at NASA mislabelled one of the film reels. Did you notice that the narrator in the Fox show talked over what the astronauts were saying? That's because in both clips the astronauts were talking about the same location.<br>
<br>
Another example of identical backgrounds is really just an optical illusion. I'm sure you're aware that if you walk a short distance nearby objects will appear to get bigger but far away objects (like mountains) will not appear to change at all.<br>
<br>
This optical illusion is called &quot;parallax&quot; and you can see it yourself right here on Earth. The only difference on Earth is that distant mountains will be hazy because of the air between you and the mountains.<br>
<br>
That is what happened in some of the NASA videos and photographs. One picture shows the lunar lander with mountains in the background, then the astronaut moves a few feet towards the lander and takes another photo... the lander will look bigger (or it might even be out of view of the camera) but the mountains will look the same. <p><BR>

<br>
150 millirem (one millirem is one-one thousandth of a rem, the standard U.S. measurement for radiation) is the average annual dosage of radiation at sea level in the U.S.<br>
<br>
Short term radiation doses of 75 to 200 rem cause radiation sickness in 5%-50% of exposed individuals, with the percentage approaching 50 as the dosage approaches 200 rem. At 300 rem, radiation sickness affects anyone exposed and fatalities begin to occur. Fatalities reach 50% at 450 rem and 80% at 600 rem. Almost nobody survives a dose of 1000 rem or higher. Keep in mind this is for short term doses on the order of exposure to the flash of a nuclear detonation or to the release products of a nuclear reactor.<br>
<br>
The Apollo spacecraft only spent half an hour each way in VAB, for a total of one hour. Due to the shielding provided by the spacecraft, the one-way dosage was 4 rem to each astronaut; 8 rem round trip. While this is enough to increase the chances of developing cancer over the next 30 years (by about .1448%) it was nowhere near the amount to cause death or even radiation sickness. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.showMessageRange?topicID=73.topic&start=1&stop=20>1</a> <b>2</b>  </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.showPrevMessage?topicID=73.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.showNextMessage?topicID=73.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=73.topic&index=40><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/images/addreply.jpeg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.emailToFriend?topicID=73.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.threadControl?topicID=73.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=73.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm71">Promote Your Board<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm76">SHOWCASE FORUM<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">New Age<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm79">Technical Help<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm74">Admin/Mod Contacts<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm78">Ruth's Personal Ezboard Ring<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm36>Outer Space</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.co.uk">Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br> <IMG SRC="http://service.bfast.com/bfast/serve?bfmid=31103363&siteid=36236524&bfpage=qb3" BORDER="0" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" NOSAVE >
