<br>
I do not like him because he seems both lazy and is more than happy to insinuate you are lying to him.  <br>
<br>
I lost 2k in JC items to lag.  These items I had transferred to my gf to chant them so I could craft them.  She had them at least a couple days and then we lost them to lag when she was giving the bars back to me.  He said the items had not been in my inventory, and was I sure I had them.  I said I had them for over a week.  After asking me a few more times if I was sure he said it was possible the increased staggering of backups with time would not reveal them in his records.  However my gf had them for 2 days at least and we managed to get him the day after the lag loss.  Thus the backup WOULD be full and accessible, however he could not be bothered to check HER inventory and just ignored us.<br>

I see a person's name changed about twice a week now, as opposed to only ever seeing name changes 4 times in EverQuest in the past 2 years I've played.<br>
<br>
They even got me, for Herbert Dalovebug.  Two reasons, 1) &quot;Da&quot; is just not allowed. 2) I'd be the Disney Car.<br>
<br>
I think it was a couple of nights ago they nabbed a 45+ chanter named Soysauce on account of &quot;that 'item' wouldn't be available in the day and age that EverQuest takes place&quot;.  Last I checked, the year was 3000+.  Maybe I should wait until the year 8000 before I make my new character, Ketchup.  Will we have Ketchup in Norrath by then?<br>
<br>
Frankly, unless a name is obscene, fully detracting from the overall 'essence' of EverQuest, or otherwise disturbing, I see no reason the GMs should spend time harassing their client base if they're above level 40, or so.  Or if there was some way to gauge /played time and base it upon that, maybe that would be something.  After 40+ days on Herb, it hit me hard when they took my name away.  I'm not saying I'm entitled to keeping my name more than anyone else who is lev25 and only had 2 days played time.  I'm just saying that after 40+ days of played time in 8 months of EQ on Druzzil, I grew very attached to it.  And it stung when they took it away.<br>
<br>
Maybe Bogell's choosing to rule with an iron fist.  He doesn't bother to cover it up with a velvet glove, either.  Maybe all the little things he's doing that tick us off actually earn him brownie points with his boss.  He's gotta hold onto his job some way, I suppose.  So when I think about it, I can't blame him either.<br>
<br>
I just wish exceptions could be made, and I was one of them <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I enjoy who I am in-game, and when I look at screenshots of myself shamelessly posing in F9 with friends, I do feel a lil sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach upon seeing no last name.  <br>
<br>
My only gripe is that he's addressing an issue that previous GMs let slide, and I happened to get caught in it.  It would have just been easier to have my name taken away from me 6 months ago as opposed to NOW.<br>
<br>
Maybe someday he'll run past the druid/ranger with the name &quot;Try Cunnilingus&quot; spelled backward.  Maybe someday he'll bump into (first name left blank intentionally) ______ Zarathustra, and say &quot;Heeey. Thats the equivalent of Christ, in another religion! Why the hell would someone name themselves &quot;Bob Christ&quot; in game?!?!&quot;.<br>
<br>
I didn't actually know Herbie Dalovebug was the Disney Car.  Hehe.  It was before my time, though I remember watching Herbie Goes Bananas.  Why are they called lovebugs, anyhow? I still don't get it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I just always played my name out to go in sync with the phrase &quot;bitten by a love bug&quot; and played a happy, goofy troll.<br>
<br>
I think Bogell's doin' his job. <br>
At the same time- I don't think he's focusing on good customer service, but just blindly adhering to the rules in the book.  I can't blame him...but at the same time..I am. <br>
<br>
I'll quit babbling now. Boy, I wish I didn't have that coffee this late at night.  Time to go watch the cartoon network.<br>
<br>
~PS~<br>
Kaludram: Aye, aye, I've known a couple of GMs to go against naming policies themselves.  Mith Marr has one active right now I believe, Theiron (sp?) the Ninja Dwarf.  I have his name written somewhere, with the correct spelling.  If only I didn't have all these darn eq tidbits of info laying around, getting in my way <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

One even sent me the tell asking if i was the former druzzil Gm Mellifluer da hungry. If i am correct. His name violated policy as well. Mellifleur (t) God of the Lich , AD&amp;D. <br>
Anyway, now i am stuck as Mell's name with my irl ad&amp;d characters last name. D`Omeneti. Just doesnt seem to fit.<br>
