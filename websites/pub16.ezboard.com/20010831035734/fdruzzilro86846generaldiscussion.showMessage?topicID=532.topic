(humor)</span><hr size=1> (The following is the condensed version of something that happened to me at the West Freeport gate two nights ago.  Anyone who knows me that I'm not not a twink, not a prick, and actually am a fairly nice guy...who does not like beggars or whiners.  Enjoy.)<br>
<br>
Two nights back, a guildmate of mine was running his low level alts from the WC druid ring to Freeport, and needed a bind for them.  I was in the area, so I agreed to meet him at the front gate.  Now, being a fellow with a fair amount of seasons under my belt, I have some decent equipment.  A bloodstained tunic and the nice blue glint of some imbued Northman armor, along with a wicked looking mace, does attract some glances from the local youths.  If someone inspects me without asking, I turn at them and /cough, hoping they take the hint and vacate my personal space.  My friend arrives with his first character, a high elf paladin with one of those nice Coldain round shields and some respectable gear.  I bind him, and we chat for awhile, more or less ignoring the usual traffic around us.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden, some newbie (we'll call him &quot;Kennith&quot;) runs up and starts yelling at ME for not helping him.  Apparently young Kennith was slain by a large rat of all things, and it's MY fault because I was too busy talking to a guildmate, thus I ignored his cries for help and he died.  Note that he did not use the /yell command (I usually notice that), nor did he run to the guards.  He apparently ran to me and died a few paces away.  He proceeds to start ranting in /ooc that *I* let him die, because he is a newbie and does not have a nice little guild tag next to his name.  &quot;Inver won't help me because I'm not uber and in a guild, I'm just a piece of newbie &lt;expletive&gt; to him!&quot;  I naturally take offense to this.  He sits right next to me at the gate, spewing his little speech of how it's hard to kill anything with his newbie sword, even a rat or snake, and then goes off about twinks.  I tell him in no uncertain terms that I'm not twinked, that I started with my days as a young shaman in Halas with a wooden club like all the others, and that dying is frequent in those first few levels.  He continues his rant unabated, often drifting into /ooc to scream at me (and all the other uncaring souls in the zone).  Someone is giving away arrows to newbies who can use them, and he yells at them for not giving away something useful like money or what have you.<br>
<br>
At this point, it starts to get very amusing, and I admit I started being a bit of a jerk.  My friend logs his bard (who I also bind) and we then start talking (&quot;out loud&quot;) about whiners and beggars.  All along, I am healing and buffing people for corpse runs and such, even as young Kennith is proclaiming my hatred for the newbies of Norrath.   I summon a pet wolf, sit down to med, and observe.  One high point is when some other young fellows asks Kennith for some spare coin...and sets him off on another sermon.  While this is going on, out of boredom, I send my wolf to kill a nearby fire beetle, purely for something to do.  Just as furry little Jaber is about to strike, Kennith stops talking and flies past me, dashing towards the beetle.  My pet had killed it with one hit, so it was already dead.  (Keep in mind here that Kennith could not kill a rat on his own, which is lower than a fire beetle -- he couldn't have done it.)  &quot;You KS'd me!  Inver is a kill stealer!  I'm going to petition!&quot;  And petition he did.  Additionally, he starts sending tells to a higher level guildmate of mine (who he apparently thought was our guild leader) that &quot;Inver is picking on me, do something about it&quot;, funny since the poor recipient is neither guild leader or an officer nor in any mood for this crap...and I was in fact the &quot;ranking officer&quot; on at the time.   Up to this point, I had not &quot;picked on&quot; Kennith at all, merely reprimanded him for his bad attitude, as I would any other whiner or beggar.  But he was out for blood, and I needed a laugh, so...<br>
<br>
With my bard friend next to me, I get rid of my pet and start charming bats and snakes.  Of course the guards won't kill a pet, nor can a player kill it...so I start running around saying &quot;Help!  There's a snake after me!  I can't kill it or Kennith might petition!&quot;.  Of course the charmed snake is chasing after me (with SoW), and my friend chasing it saying &quot;I can't kill it!  Someone help!&quot;.  Eventually the charm wears off, so I run to the guards, who kill it.  I then thank the guards, /kneel a few times, and then proclaim to my guildmate the horror of my near-death snake attack.  Needless to say, while Kennith is not amused, everyone else at the gate most certainly is.  He says &quot;I get picked on in RL, I don't need it here.&quot;  Oh please.  So I again make quite clear that his problem is his attitude, not the people around him.  Charm some more yard trash, run around, have some fun, he's still sulking at the gate.  This all went on for over an hour, in which he could have easily made 3-4 levels.  Nobody would group with the whiner, nor would anyone buff him after his insults to all of the &quot;heartless people&quot; in the zone.<br>
<br>
Eventually the little game got boring, so I went about my business.   I never saw Kennith again, but he made my day a little brighter.  Somewhere, there is a village with no idiot, until the day when Kennith goes home.  Was I out of line?  No, I was minding my own business when he came after me.  Did I go too far by reprimanding him for his bad attitude?  When he is spamming the whole zone with his tale of woe, I feel obligated to point out alternative means of coping with his problems.  Was the &quot;rabid snake attack&quot; mean?  I think not, rather it was a morale booster for everyone else!  I just wanted to share this experience for those of you who have never seen such a thing.<br>
<br>
P.S.  I almost wish someone would come forward and admit to playing Kennith, because the performance WAS magnificent.  I was laughing to the point of tears, and don't know who to thank.<br>

I have had more than my fair share of rude beggars and quite frankly I don't want to waste my time on people who can't even be polite.  I don't know what the point of playing is if you aren't even going to bother with doing things yourself.  Ive had stuff given to me and have in turn given out many thing myself.  However, I have NEVER begged and would never give a handout to anyone who did!<br>
