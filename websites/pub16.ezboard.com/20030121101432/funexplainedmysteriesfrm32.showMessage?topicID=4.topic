He writes in a style that enables me to &quot;fall into the pages&quot; and actually be there, to the point of being in almost complete ignorance of my surroundings, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Best Novel......The Stand, far and away the best because it is in fact very frightening when you consider that the main part of the story, (ie the plague) is so ready to happen anyway. (Did anyone ever watch The Survivors in the late 70's I think it was?)<br>
<br>
Best Serial Story.....The Dark Tower books..... Ohhhhh roll on number 5 !!!!<br>
<br>
Best Book to Film ....... Has to tie between The Green Mile and The Stand I think.<br>
<br>
On a more serious note, I actually believe that it is in fact a very good job that he does write, he has a lot of wierd stuff in his head, the best place for it is on paper.<br>

I wouldn't want to be his number one fan that's for sure. I wonder<br>
how is wife puts up with him. He has an excellent mind though. I thought the second book<br>
in the Dark Tower series was great. What an imagination that guy has! I like Detta and Odetta<br>
of course...otherwise known as Susanna? The idea of walking through doors into different times<br>
is fascinating isn't it? Did you ever read Secret Garden/Secret Window? You have to wonder what<br>
is going on in that guys mind sometimes.. Your right it's better off on paper. Geralds Game was<br>
awful!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Rose Madder was a great book too. King can really make some great statements that<br>
seem to get lost to the reader/viewer sometimes. It seems that way anyways. Most people view<br>
him as a horror story writer but he does do some indepth stuff on the physchology of people and the thing that happen to them in life...people just don't see that part I guess. Pet Semetary was one of them. What an indepth look into the effects of death. Creepy Guy!! I thought that rita hayworth and the Shawshank redemption was a good movie too. His other books seem to hard to present correctly in the movie media....the message is lost or something. The Dead zone was a great movie too and so was Carrie. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Do you like Cook? He writes some great medical mysteries that are really out there too. Koonz is a little to far out for me. <br>
<br>
 I don't know if King can match Hitch@#%$ for suspense but he's certainly right up there with him. <br>
I wish he'd get going on the next book in the tower series myself. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

No, he doesnt know how the story goes either, at least that is what he says, he never knows until he is actually writing it, and the story develops around him.  the next DT book is due to be started upon in Jan 2001, there is a working title for it which I have completely forgotten, but I will look up for you.<br>
<br>
SK is far and away my favourite author, none come near, although I will read Tom Clancy, and Thomas Harris, Sean Hutson, and very occasionally Dean Koontz.<br>
<br>
Have you read The Dark Half by SK?? That is quite scary when you look at the context of the story, ie, based upon a popular writer who creates a pseudonym to see if his books will sell on merit rather than just on the name alone, then the pseudonym takes on its own persona and comes to life as &quot;the dark half&quot; of the author, and has to be killed off.  It is what SK did himself with Richard Bachman, his pseudonym.  I do admire SK greatly, but dont envy him for what he carries around in his head !<br>

Yes I did read the dark half. I saw the movie too. Did you? The movie really couldn't show<br>
Kings intentions it seems....I don't even think anyone could understand it if they hadn't read<br>
the book first...it looked pretty ridiculous! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Bachman books were great wern't they? I think <br>
my favorite is the one about the kids in the classroom that take it over? I can't think of the<br>
name right now. That was a good short story...I think they'd be afraid to turn that into a movie<br>
considering the affect it might have. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I think they were some of his greatest stories. The <br>
long walk was awful!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  But good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
King must have some real insight and empathy for the human condition. I don't think it would be<br>
possible to write the way that  he does if he didn't feel the things he writes about. His book IT is<br>
a great story about childhood fears and the results of them. Like Hitch....he takes everyday things<br>
that people fear and turns them into a really great story. All about life but with a weird twist.<br>
His writing is crude of course, I guess that's his way of getting his point across. I don't know. <br>
Whatever he's doing it works. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
A whole year!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I thought you may have read some of cooks books. (that's funny!) You mentioned The Stand in your<br>
first post and usually Cook is writing about that kind of thing. Government control and germ warfare or<br>
genetic engineering which is against the medical profession but they do it anyways. He has some interesting books. I have never heard of the authors you mentioned but then I haven't been reading in a few years. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I hope the next book is better than the Wizard and the Glass. Is that the name of the last book<br>
in the dark tower series? It wasn't as good as the first three do you think? The one with the<br>
train was great. I love those riddles. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Yes, Wizard and Glass was the last one, and I too loved the riddles on Blaine, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Is the short story you are referring to called &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;? If so then yes, I must agree, that is quite scary, but The Long Walk, (which I had forgotten to mention actually), is absolutley supreme for atmosphere setting don't you think?  I'd love to see how they translated that to film!<br>
<br>
I think some of the later books like The Stand and The Green Mile translate better into film as they are so much longer.  When the films are shortened, they lose so much of the story!  The worst two on film have got to be Tommyknockers and Running Man.  Although Running Man in itself is ok as a film, it bears very little resemblance to the book at all.<br>
<br>
I have to confess to not having seen The Dark Half as a film, (I don't think I have anyway <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ), and I havent read any Cook that I am aware of,  as with you, the net has somewhat impinged upon my reading time, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I sometimes read something of Kings and think &quot;yes, I can see where that came from...&quot; childhood fears, adult fears, daily life, all gets the King treatment, and becomes a book.<br>
<br>
Speak soon, and take care <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Blaine the Pain. I loved those riddles. It was a great idea wasn't it? I spent too much<br>
time trying to solve the riddles! I wonder if King new people were going to try to figure<br>
out the riddles or just keep reading and let him give them the answer in the book. A plot<br>
within the plot to drive the reader a little more Krazy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
No it wasn't apt pupil. That was something else wasn't it? Geez! That was sick. Good movie<br>
though! This is the one about the kid that holds the teacher and the classroom hostage. I hope I have the right book here? I'm beginning to wonder. There were two bachman books and I don't remember which<br>
book it came from. The kid is going to kill off the teacher and the students one at at time because none<br>
of them will tell the truth about their lifes. Its really an awful story. Its probably one of the saddest<br>
short stories I've ever read. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its the kids I guess and how much they have to hide about themselves<br>
and their lifes. Sad book. I don't think they could put that awful long walk on the screen do you?!<br>
Oh boy when I think of that. I have wondered what kind of movie that would make. Can you picture<br>
it? aahhh!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I still flinch when I think of what went on in the book. What a great story. The psychology <br>
behind that too? It's great. You become friends and then it gets harder and harder to finish the long<br>
walk. I must admit that King has a great mind! I don't think it will ever be recognized for the writing<br>
it really is although I did read (one time when I could stay off the computer long enough <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) that he<br>
was being nominated for a prestigious writers award. I'll have to look that up on the net and see if he<br>
ever recieved it or not. <br>
<br>
I didn't even like the book Tommyknockers. I don't know what it was about that book. It just went on<br>
and on (something like this post) and it was a strange way to talk about aliens. The langoliers was better. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I liked the langoliers ever though the vehicle they used to show the &quot;nothingness&quot; looked totally ridiculous<br>
in the movie. Some books are just meant to be read. Running man wasn't bad but it certainly wasn't like<br>
the book. I agree there!<br>
<br>
The stand. King uses a lot of religious sybolism in that book. I will always feel sorry for Nadine. Is that<br>
her name? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I don't think she wanted anything to do with the dark half. I never understood that<br>
part. I guess it was her destiny? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sad that. I can hear that garbage man can man screaming &quot;mY life<br>
for you!!&quot; A book that's about choices and how choices end up choosing us in the end? A great book.<br>
I think the one that finally got him some recognition, wasn't it? <br>
<br>
Take care Astral. I have get off this computer and do something! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Maybe I'll go read blaine the pain<br>
again? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I loved when he had a series beginning with him at the typewriter consisting of many short stories put to film and him narrating the bringing of the program.<br>
<br>
One movie that was awful was &quot;Cujo&quot;. I mean that St. Bernard with a rabid, foaming mouth, barking (supposedly viciously) at his owners and his tail was wagging the whole time. LOL!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That is the only movie right off hand that did not do King justice.  That St. Bernard dog was a peach and did not frighten me at all.  Had it been another breed, perhaps I would have been terrified.<br>
<br>
I must say &quot;Dead Zone&quot; (book and movie) is one of my all time favorites.<br>

<br>
True, Cujo was wagging his tail in the movie, but there were some parts in the novel where he was going that, as well, especially when he was trying to get Donna in the car. Donna noticed the tail wagging and was repulsed by it. It made Cujo seem even more evil, because it gave a sense that he was ENJOYING the killings. Now, of course, I don't know if the movie wagging was a mistake or not.<br>
<br>
My favorite writer is..Rod Serling! Even if he did write for televison and movies, he's still a great writer. Watch The Twilight Zone! His adaptations of short stories, and many of his own stories are superb. Creepy, chilling, yet they teach you a lesson of sorts.<br>
<br>
Stephen King also is right up there with me, too, as I have read King since I was 9.<br>

It just appears in the movie that his &quot;barking&quot; is the kind of bark a dog makes when he greets his master, wants to go outside or is playing fetch .... so the tail wagging looked so playful also. I will HAVE to read the book.<br>
<br>
How could we have left out Rod Serling! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Undoubtedly one of the very best suspense/horror writers ever. Thank you so very much for bringing his name to the board. I still watch the older &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; whenever it's on. Love every episode and remember most!<br>
<br>
Hey, Anake, do you have a favorite?  Several come to mind for me.<br>

My favorite TZ episode (as featured on my sig.) is It's a Good Life. It's just creepy how the little boy, Anthony, can make people disapear or kill them with his mind and how he practically holds a small village in chains because of his wishes. The short story by Jerome Bixby is fantastic (although Anthony is three in the story and he only has one line). My second favorite is Living Doll with the guy who played Kojak. <br>

I went from getting the creeps here to laughing! I thought cujo was creepy!<br>
I guess it's because I lived out in no where land for awhile and I could see how something like that could happen...as for the rest of the movie? It was to long and drawn out! And I never noticed the dogs tail wagging!! haha Oh brother. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> . Christin was another movie that was out there. I  mean that car that ran around killing everyone?? ahhhh! The idea behind it was good but as far<br>
as making it into a movie? I dont' know. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I will have to notice cujo's tail if I ever watch <br>

<br>
Anake that sounds like a creepy program. I love the twilight zone, I don't remember that one, I'll have to watch for that. Do you remember the one where the people wanted to give up smoking? <br>
<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Oh boy! That was good! It was awful but it was good. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It may have been from the series the outer limits. They do have some good shows although a lot of them are so old they look<br>
ridiculous, Tales from the crypt is good everyonce in awhile too. I'm not ever going to look at cujo the same again after these posts!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Take care okay. <br>
<br>
Ps. I heard on the news the other day that the person who seriously injured Stephen King last year was found killed.

WOW! It was inspired by an original episode where the man was played by a very young William Shatner. In the movie, the man is played by John Litgow. He saved the plane by grabing a gun from a near by passenger (a policeman or something), shot out the plane window causing a terrible vaacum effect ... but he got the Gremlin. Then, upon landing, the crew found that the wing had actually been chewed up. The man TRIED to warn them! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

The only thing I can think of that sounds like that is the Stephen King short story &quot;Quitters, Inc,&quot; which was also featured in his movie &quot;Cat's Eye&quot; with James Woods and Drew Barrymore. In it, James Woods plays this guy trying to quit smoking and they give him three tries. The first time he breaks down he is put into this room and shown a cat who's in this confindment and is electrocuted through the floor and they warn him that that is what will happen to his wife. The second time, they bring his wife in and do it to her. The third time they cut the finger off of his wife (or they do something to his mentally retarded daughter, played by Barrymore). You'll have to read it. It's in King's book Night Shift.<br>
