That was a bad one, but we were really unprepared for that type of loot at the time.<br>
<br>
In JS we maintain a class list rotation that seems to be working pretty well so far. We will /random, but only in cases where there are more than one eligible person prsent. Participation is heavily factored in. You must be present to loot and if you are not the item will move down to the next person on the list. If no one who is present can or will use the item then we'll save it and offer it to those who were not present. Nodrop items eing an obvious exception.<br>
<br>
It will get harder when we get to do the REALLY big stuff. Most of our guild is in the 30's range, with a few 40's-low 50's mixed in.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ufaenyar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faenyar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/15/01 1:03:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ourplace.dhs.org/~gfoster/pics/Faenyar-Fishing.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The CoF incident</span><hr size=1> In the paragons, we use a mixture of /random, NBG and awards.  In small group situations, the group handles it however they want (and quite often they end up bringing something back and giving it to a guildie who needs if nobody in the group needs it more).<br>
<br>
On raids, the raid leader reserves the right to award a few items to people who performed exceptionally (saved the entire raid, etc) and this does happen occasionally.  The raid leader also reserves the right to reserve one item from the raid for the hassle of running the raid, and this happens once in a blue moon and is well stated up front (i.e. &quot;I just want everyone to know that if such and such drops, I'm claiming it and if anyone has a problem with that we need to talk about it before we start&quot;).  Often, our raids will be centered around getting specific items for specific people (for example, one of our warriors has crap gear and needs upgrades... we do specific raids to get him better gear and if it drops everyone knows it goes to him).  Finally, if it's just loot we picked up along the way we /random it among anyone who's eligible to use it and who was there (including guests) as long as it makes sense that they have it (for example, our monks don't roll on granite spaulders even though they are listed as a class that can use them).  Once you win something you are out of it until everyone else (within class boundaries of course) wins.<br>
<br>
Most of the time it works out very well for our guild because we are very tight knit and we all know what each other needs and wants.  We're actually not a very loot-hungry guild, we enjoy the experiences much more than anything else.  We have managed to pick up some sorta cool stuff along the way and so far have had zero problems.  For example, we spent about 6 months raping and pillaging the hole to practice for a yael raid, and I led MANY raids there as training runs.  As a consequence, most of our casters have at least one piece of loam gear, we have loam gear rotting in the bank, and I think ALL of our tanks now have granite spaulders and we're working on getting them for our clerics next.  Also, when we finally did drop yael (our very first god level encounter) and he coughed up a loam encrusted robe, it went directly to me, and everyone knew for 6 months that when we finally coughed one up it was mine.  I think everyone else was just as happy for me to get it as I was, there are better robes out there but it's a badge of honor for me and for everyone else as well.<br>
We have knocked down Tserinna a few times too, hoping to score a robe off her... and I've made it clear up front that I will NOT roll for it, it should go to some other caster.  I already have a nice robe.  We have a few other casters in the guild who also have nice robes and they have made the same statement.  Most of the people in our guild are the same way, once they get something nice they want everyone else to also get something before they feel comfortable getting into the rotation again.  We *do* have a few people who are greedy loot mongers who always have their hands out, but we all know who they are and we keep a tight lid on 'em.<br>
<br>
We're planning on moving into the Kael arena within a few weeks and will be raiding there a lot to get some of the velious armor drops for people.  We have 2 people in our guild who are designated as the first epic drops (we're focusing hard on getting them their epics first so everyone else's epic raids will go easier).  These are for a cleric and enchanter... and the designated cleric and enchanter aren't eligible for any raid loot drops at all unless NOBODY else can use it (including people who aren't even present).  They are getting their epics first, so they forego all the rest of the loot until they are done.<br>
<br>
I don't think our loot system (which is a hodge podge of stuff) would work well with guilds that aren't as tight knit as we are.  However, I think a point system would positively suck for us because we don't really care how many raids you show up for, that's not what we're about.  We *are* turning into a raiding guild and we're training hard for it, but again, it's not how many times you showed your face that matters to us.<br>
