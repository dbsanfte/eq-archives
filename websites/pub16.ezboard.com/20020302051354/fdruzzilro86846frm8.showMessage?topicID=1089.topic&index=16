Discuss</span><hr size=1> We're approaching this question from totally different angles, Maric.<br>
<br>
You refuse to acknowledge that there's even a question as to which reservations the DRo board should cover--if people post it, that's valid, the system can be expanded to cover literally ANYTHING people want to reserve, and so it's simply a matter of who respects the system (and therefore must commit to respecting any reservation anyone posts) and who doesn't (and therefore deserves to have none of their reservations respected.)<br>
<br>
If you start from the assumption that any posted reservation is valid, then your position makes sense.<br>
<br>
But why do that?<br>
<br>
The whole question in this thread is SHOULD CoM be reservable?  You make a convincing case that IF the answer is yes, everyone should honor the reservation.  What if the answer is no?<br>
<br>
I think the answer should definitely be &quot;No.&quot;  I think everyone should carefully honor any valid reservation, and we should very very carefully limit the things that can be reserved.<br>
<br>
The alternative is to hold DRo board guilds to an unreasonably high standard, one they won't even WANT to live up to because it stands in direct conflict with years of EQ tradition, and they'll eventually just bail on it. <p>----------------------------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89094>Jumpp Jivenwail</a>, 60 Rogue<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97652>Aanadien Jones</a>, 60 Enchanter<BR>

What people considered reservable a year ago is now considered unreservable because those same people can annihilate it.  They do not care about those under them that are at the point they were at a year ago.  Those people are irrelevant.  That is the feeling I am beginning to get.  That feeling makes it less and less enticing to reserve or honour reservations.  <br>
<br>
Just because you can kill a MOB with 1 or 2 of your friends does not mean everyone can.  Everyone should have the opportunities you did when you levelled up through various zones.  I am seeing a lack of interest by many people to allow this to happen.  <br>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Kaludram, you are missing the point a bit.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with being inconsiderate, or selfish.<br>
<br>
Let's just say a group of IG decides that we want to kill reavers cause someone, I dunno who, needs their epic.  We get to CoM.  No one is there.  So we go and kill some reavers.  Whee.  If someone is there and says 'we are killing the reavers' I cannot see us caring one way or the other, and we will head to Sebilis or something to kill the King or Emperor or whatnot.  But what we won't do, just because it doesn't occur to us, really, is to check a reservation for CoM.  And if someone shows up 10 minutes after we clear them, well, just wait a little bit, won't be long.<br>
<br>
This is different from, well, Hate or Fear.  We do look for reservations there, or see if someone is there, because it is a lot bigger deal to everyone than CoM.  8 hours makes a huge difference.  Needing a raid sized force makes a big difference.<br>
<br>
In the thread on the other board you listed IG as scum balls (or something of the sort) apparently merely for showing UP in Kedge.  Once they found out that someone, anyone, was killing Phinny, they left (I wasn't there).  You try to make the point that they left merely because they knew ML was there.  You don't seem to ponder the thought that they didn't look here for a Kedge raid reservation, because why reserve Kedge?  (again, from our perspective).  But they didn't muscle in, they didn't steal Phinny, they didn't, from what you say, berate you or belittle you.  They found someone killing Phinny and left.  Case closed.  Any attempt to make it something sinister really doesn't fly.  All checking for reservations would have done is save themselves the trip, in reality.<br>
<br>
This would be different if you were there, setting up to crush the joint, killing front spawns, etc, and guild X decides to swim past you and bag Phinny, even after you tell them that you are there.  First Come, First Serve is what you were doing.  You were there, you were getting ready to kill.  Free For All is rushing past people who are obviously about to do..whatever...and taking it out from under them.  Even Vindication, in their NToV grabbing (best term I can think of for it), didn't stoop to that level.<br>
<br>
I think you will find that THAT is a relative rarity on the server.  Which is a good thing. <br>
<br>
I also think that more good things happen between guilds, even Uber guild to Uber guild..and Uber guild to NON-Uber guild, than bad.  Way more.  But most of those are small niceties that just never make press.<br>
<br>
But screaming and yelling does.<br>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Gryfalia - I understand your point (as I also understand many of the other well-made points here as well).  You bring up the root of my issue though - time.  It IS a big deal to me if someone has just whacked all of the Reavers due to the fact that I have a pretty limited window in which I can play EQ.  Waiting for the respawn (by the way - has anyone confirmed whether this is a 1 hour or a 2 hour spawn?) just makes that window of opportunity all the smaller for me and others like me.  Again - it takes time to gather the people to do something like this - and then making them wait on top of it - you start to lose folks after a while, some have to log, etc.<br>
<br>
With all of that being said - I must also consider that this might be just the way EQ works (and I am not trying to be sarcastic or nasty in any way here) - those with more time will be able to get more done and those with less time will just have to make due.  I can't very well ask another EQ player to forgo something that he/she wants to do just because my time on EQ is limited.<br>
<br>
Hmmm - now I've confused myself (which really isn't that difficult in the first place... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  On the one hand, I feel that a place like CoM SHOULD be able to be reserved / intentioned due to the fact that it has a fairly rare mob drop required for one of the Epic quests AND that it, for many people, requires a small raid sized group to get it done.  On the other hand, if the timer on the Reavers is indeed only an hour, perhaps that would be short enough to still gather the raid force, but to simply have them take their time getting to the castle (kill more stuff on the way).  This would probably work ok, but if the respawn is two hours, this would get a lot closer to being unworkable.<br>
<br>
In the end, I am still for being able to reserve CoM due to the reasons I mentioned above.  I understand that this does not mean that CoM is MINE MINE ALL MINE for the day - I think that placing an arrival time and a specific mob target helps with this.  I also understand that by placing a reservation on the board that the time slot is not guarunteed due to the fact that there are many people who do not look at this board.  What I AM hoping for is that the large number of people / guilds who DO read this board will respect that time slot and shoot for something else (the same as they are hopefully doing for Hate, Kael, etc.).  Kind of like pushing the time slot odds in the &quot;right&quot; direction.<br>
<br>
It appears to me that CoM (as well as Kedge and some others) have been on the reservation schedule for some time now (although I have not been browsing this board for a very long time, so I may be wrong).  It also appears to me that there is not a big explosion of guilds / people wanting to reserve previously unreserved things.  My guess is that there will remain a fairly static list of areas to be reserved with minor updates and changes as time goes by - it shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.  I don't think that leaving spots like Kedge and CoM on the list will open the flood gates to reserving everything in EQ.<br>
<br>
Whether we consider something reserved or simply a statement of intent, I would like to think that, given enough lead time on the posting, the people / guilds who participate on this board would be curtious enough to respect that posting.<br>

<br>
All I want is a list.  A list not only high lvl guilds agree on, but the mid level ones.  <br>
<br>
I now see at least 3 mid-level guilds disagree with people in high level guilds saying CoM reavers cannot be reserved.  Does this not seem a bit odd?  Were CoM Reavers ever reservable? If so then they should continue to be so, as any MOB should be.  If people had the opportunity to reserve them before then other people, at the point now that the original people were at a year ago, should have the same opportunities.  Of course this is my opinion only, but I would truly LOVE a damn list so I do not waste my time in the future. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

<br>
That's not the point.<br>
<br>
It's a damn shame when a bunch of level-45s plan a CoM raid for weeks and then show up to find four level-56 guys working the reavers.<br>
<br>
But the reservation system can't fix that even if we want it to.<br>
<br>
There's no tradition of reserving CoM.  And the fact that it's so easy for a small handful of mid-50s to kill the reavers makes it impractical to apply a guild-level reservation system.<br>
<br>
As nice as it'd be for the poor lowbies, it's just unreasonable to expect every little xp crew to be aware of your reservations and to stay the hell out of your way.  Guilds can pull this off because they can designate a &quot;reservations guy&quot; to monitor the board, post their reservations, and keep informed about others.<br>
<br>
This is generally beyond the ability of small ad hoc xp crews, and a system that makes such an unreasonable demand of people will be laughed into oblivion in practice.<br>
<br>
Short version: I'm not saying it wouldn't be NICE for the reservation system to work for lowbies in CoM.  I'm saying it's IMPRACTICAL and as nice as it'd be, it won't work, and trying it will damage the system's credibility. <p>----------------------------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89094>Jumpp Jivenwail</a>, 60 Rogue<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97652>Aanadien Jones</a>, 60 Enchanter<BR>

<br>
Raids in general don't start on time and reservations could lose people spawns on something with a relatively quick respawn. <br>
<br>
Personally i have been to CoM for many druids in the guild, and each time it has been a swing by raid. We checked in, cleared the reavers and then ported out without waiting for another respawn. Therefore i think it should still be possible to organise a mini raid for a lower level group of explorers. You might have to wait for one spawn, but if the leader gets in there and asks for the next spawn, by the time the rest of the people come i am sure it will be uncamped and spawned.<br>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> I think that lowby guilds should definately be encouraged to plan raids.  I heard of a guild raiding Kurn's Tower one time.  I think that is cool, and as a high level player, I think it is important to avoid getting in their way whenever possible.<br>
<br>
But I don't think it is usually necessary for them to actually reserve these raids.  It's been a while since I was in that position, but I don't remember there being very many under 50 guilds that organized raids.  There are a few, and it does look like I'm seeing more start to show up - which is awesome.  But the point is, are there enough under 50 raids going on that they will get in each others' way if they don't reserve raid zones?<br>
<br>
On the flip side, the reaver situation is startlingly similar to the argument I've heard from some players that are &quot;higher level&quot; than myself.  Imagine you reserve Kedge Keep here on this board only to have a spur-of-the-moment group pop in to hit Phinny.  &quot;Phinny isn't reservable,&quot; they say.  &quot;Phinny can be done with one group.  You don't have to reserve him.&quot;<br>
<br>
My point is we shouldn't let how many people it takes to do something guide whether or not something is reservable.  We should try to stick to respawn time and how much investment there is required to get set up for the attempt. <p><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=82331>Epiphany</a> 60 Enchanter<BR>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Don't ignore the issue of practicality.<br>
<br>
The reach of the board is limited.  Only a tiny minority of players read it.  Because of this, the board has very little ability to shape DRo tradition, and mostly has to deal with existing tradition as largely immutable facts on the ground.<br>
<br>
This board trying to regulate camps like CoM reavers would be like a traffic cop standing on the divider in the middle of the 405 freeway directing traffic.  He's not just going to accomplish nothing--he's going to give people the idea that traffic cops are irrelevant even in situations where they can do some good.<br>
<br>
Best not to even try it. <p>----------------------------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89094>Jumpp Jivenwail</a>, 60 Rogue<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97652>Aanadien Jones</a>, 60 Enchanter<BR>
