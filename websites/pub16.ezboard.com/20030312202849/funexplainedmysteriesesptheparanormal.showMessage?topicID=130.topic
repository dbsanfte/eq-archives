<br>
I've since decided that I'm not convinced that it's not possible, because I know exactly zip about reincarnation, so maybe someone else does.<br>
<br>
Here it is, Five months after I had my oldest daughter, my best friend since the age of six passed away. <br>
 When she was about three, it started to occur to me that Sammy was a little like Shelley. <br>
 Now, at the age of seven and a half, the resemblance is overwhelming, not only in personality, but even in appearance. <br>
 Shelley was very petite (102 pounds, 9 months pregnant), I am overweight. <br>
 Shelley had brown eyes, and waist length, golden blonde hair, I have dark brown hair, and blue eyes.<br>
Shelley was very delicate, and soft spoken, I'm about as delicate as a dumptruck, with a voice like a fog horn.<br>
Sammy, is very petite (at almost 8, she wears a size 6), with long, golden blonde hair, and green eyes, and she is very shy and soft-spoken.<br>
<br>
Six month after the birth of my younger daughter, my husband's Mother, passed away of carbon monoxide poisoning in her home.  <br>
She had a very youthful and vibrant spirit, and a flamboyant, and crazy sense of humor, she loved singing, and dancing, and would often make up little ditties, and sing them to the kids. <br>
 Emmy's nickname is Hurricane Emily, She is the happiest soul I have ever met, and loves to dance and sing, often making up little rhymes and songs.<br>
<br>
So, here's the question, can someone be reincarnated as someone who has already been born?<br>
<br>
Feel free to tell me I'm nuts, if that seems the likely answer. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
I have to say intresting topic but i have to also say no it is not possible, as the body needs a soul before birth.  It would be like being born a zombie. This is only my opin ion of course as i was brought up to belive everything has a spirit without it we do not exist.  I can see what you mean by the resembelences but could it be that your freind is guiding your daughter more than she has been reincarnated.  After all if he was so close to you in life he would still be in death.<br>
Im sorry for your losses tho that couldnt have been an easy time for you, your spirit is a stromng one to cope with it all.<br>
<br>

<br>
That's more or less what I thought, and my daughters were anything but zombies at birth, <br>
<br>
Samantha had a really unusual delivery, in that the doctor and nurse had left the room, telling me that it would be several hours yet, and they went for something to eat, five minutes later, Samantha came into the world with one push (far from the usual for me, before or since), into the arms of her Dad. <br>
<br>
Sammy was giving me real smiles (not gas, after 4 kids, you can tell the difference), by the time she was two days old, and wanted no one but me until the time she was two.<br>
<br>
Emily got her nickname &quot;Hurricane Emily&quot;, while we were still in the hospital, and all who met her, agreed that it was most appropriate.  Emily also clung mostly to me for a long time, she would go to her Dad occasionally, but no one else.<br>
<br>
Since their personalities have developed, I am often struck by their likenesses to the people I associate them with, and feel the prescences of those who have passed most strongly when I am with one of the girls, alone.<br>
<br>
I was just wondering about the possibility that (and reincarnation probably not the word that I should have chosen), that the girls might in some way have absorbed a small part of their essence, because both deaths were within six months of both births.<br>
<br>
Just to add to this a little, when a baby is born in my family, everyone tries to decide who they get their looks from, with the boys, everybody had distinct ideas.  the girls looks are more enigmatic,<br>
<br>
When Emily was born, my husband's Mother said &quot;she doesn't look like anyone on our side.&quot;, my family felt the same.<br>
Emily now looks distinctly like my husband's Mother.<br>
<br>
All are free to tell me I'm nuts, <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

When my brother was 18, he was learning about Buddishism from a 'master'..and he was told then he was not the original boy in my mother's womb....he was told that when my mum had the fall...the 'spirit' of the baby left and my brother replaced it instead...<br>

What i ment by i didnt think it possible in your case(didnt mean to sound like i was being funny sorry if i did) was that because your childr3en were already born and your friends died after i think it impossible that it would be them to be recincarnated in your children.  As the body needs a soul as soon as it is concieved.<br>
I agree there are so many wierd and wonderful things out there i cant even touch on them.<br>

There is such a thing as a &quot;Walk In&quot;. A soul that takes over anothers physical body after the original soul has experienced the lessons it came here for. For this to occur the original soul in the original body dies or has lets say a death experience and clinically too. The other soul enters when the body is brought back. The original soul moves on to the light.<br>
