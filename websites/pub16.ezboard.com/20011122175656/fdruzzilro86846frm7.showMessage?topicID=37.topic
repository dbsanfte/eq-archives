This hurts.<br>
I have been standing in this spot for twenty minutes waiting for Guard Mizraen to move.<br>
It’s my fault, really.  I entered the building as an Elf, and came out as a Human, but for the love of…well, never mind that…he has never paid that much attention.<br>
Maybe I’m just being paranoid.  It’s just that ever since Alitor and his Obsidian Circle of Annoyance caught wind of my religious fall out, I can’t be too careful.<br>
I’m having an Elven wine with Keldren day before last, innocently discussing my internal struggle with my Goddess…get this: I run all the way from Thurgadin to the Wakening Lands – RUN, I tell you, as if Elves should have to take on this task, and you know, I have to go through Kael Drakkel, where I’m somehow not respected. (I know, whatever.)  Anyway, running, running, running, can’t stop to get my bearings, can’t find my map that that wanderer in Oasis sold me, giants here, giants there, and here I’m thinking, I don’t remember them being so big, or ugly, and then I’m thinking, would any of the jewelry I make FIT these guys?  So I’m trying to mentally measure their fingers, to see if maybe I’d have a bracelet that would go ‘round, when I get that tingle when I’m invisible that soon I’m going to be not, so as you can imagine, I hiked up my robe and made a Bixie line away from them as fast as I can.<br>
Safety, whew, but I’m out of breath.  I cannot wait until I can buy some animal upon which I can ride around so that I do not have to destroy another pair of boots from wear.<br>
I stop here, chat briefly with a faun, stretch out and feel the cool grass against my cheek.<br>
This is nice.<br>
After a moment of this, I get up and brush off my robe, thinking it best to continue on with my journey, remembering  stories about a Dragon who wanders near here.<br>
Finally I’m to the grove I seek.  I climb the tower and see the tree I’ve heard about.  I, of course, tremble.  This tree is the gateway into the Plane in which my Goddess resides.<br>
Gently I approach its roots, hardly daring to look at it.  After a moment, I reach my hand to it and feel a pulse vibrating within it yet somehow all around me, one with which the world echoes.<br>
This is my goal.<br>
Years of solitude and contemplation have led me to this spot, at this moment.  I needed Her reassurance that I was on the right path, for an Enchanter who walks with Tunare must be vigilant when infiltrating his Dark brothers.<br>
I closed my eyes and opened my mind to its cadence, willing it to carry me in its current and to transport me to Her.<br>
I swear I felt my blood turn to sap, my flesh to bark as I merged with the Tree.<br>
And then nothing.<br>
Well, I shouldn’t say ‘nothing’.  I got a leaf.  That’s right: a leaf.  Embossed, looks like one of those bohemian gift cards you get in Qeynos.   I was still shocked from not being moved, physically, I mean.  I assume it came floating down from amongst its branches, focussed, but with no real commitment to accuracy.  I mean, that’s how I’d have done it.<br>
Anyway, this leaf lands on this knob in the trunk, and I looked at it, and it said something, that in retrospect, was really pretty, and almost looked like the little veiny things in the leaf that are supposed to be there, but it said:<br>
<br>
Dear Applicant:<br>
<br>
Thank you for enquiring about admittance to the Plane of Growth.  We have reviewed your history and have determined that your current qualifications do not meet our needs at this time.  <br>
We appreciate your worship.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>

It was at this point in my day that I sputtered.  I couldn’t believe it.  My Goddess had REJECTED me.  Obviously, She had overlooked the two weeks I went without rations or water and monitored Lesser Faydark for signs or Her return.  And that’s with no shower, which is unheard of in Elven culture.<br>
And what about attending services every morning while my other Enchanter friends went to play?<br>
Did none of my sacrifices matter?<br>
I began to mumble the words that would transport me past the giants, over the tundra, across the water, through the desert, and into the bar where I was meeting Keldren.  I was going to bring him this oversized tunic on which I was going to embroider, ‘My guildmate went to the Plane of Growth, and all I got was this lousy tunic,’ but now I had nothing.<br>
Except for that damned leaf.<br>
So anyway, I’m having wine with him and I’m explaining how things went, and I don’t know if I was exaggerating or what, but this human, Alitor, turns to me and spits!<br>
I’m thinking he’s drunk, but then he starts screaming at me about Tunare being the All-Mother, and so I try to explain to him that yes, I knew what he was talking about, and yes, I had all of the secret handshakes memorised, and yes, I put out forest fires, but he’s yelling and carrying on, and I’m trying to explain, if only he’d listen, and he’s calling me names, and making guesses about my genealogy and I can’t seem to get a word in when he up and declares his obligation to Tunare to make me see the error of my ways and swears his guild against mine in war!<br>
I’m stunned at this point, originally because of my rejection, but now because this zealot is ranting, and not in a good way, and I’m wondering how my guildmates will take this, when he storms out and announces to practically all of Norrath that Obsidian Circle of Power would be versus Peep Cartouche.<br>
Now, I’m thinking that maybe I should just go home to Felwithe, take a healthy swig of the night-time sniffling, sneezing, coughing, aching, stuffy head, fever, so you can camp medicine, and sleep this one off.<br>
I head to the bar to settle my tab, and I catch a glimpse of Alitor waiting outside the door.  This has to be some crude human ambush.<br>
A few raw words and intricate gestures later, and I shrink a few inches and my hair darkens.  I am now human.<br>
I swagger through the doorway, whistling a New Kids in Freeport song, that boy band who plays at the Theatre of the Tranquil, and Alitor didn’t recognise me.<br>
This is when Guard Mizraen took an interest in me, and started following me past Groflah’s Forge. <br>
I turn a corner quickly and began chanting again, the words different this time, and immediately I become a lamp.<br>
He stops short, not five feet away.  Maybe I should have run, but I’ve had enough of that for awhile, and this technique has worked before.<br>
He’s not looking directly at me, but neither is he moving.  I don’t know if he thinks that I’ve gone into a shop and is waiting for me to emerge.  I wish that I had gone into that building that has the passage to the underground, but I don’t remember quite where that is.<br>
So like I said, it’s been twenty minutes.  I hope he moves soon.<br>
