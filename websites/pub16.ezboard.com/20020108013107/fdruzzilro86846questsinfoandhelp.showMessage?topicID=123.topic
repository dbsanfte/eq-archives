<br>
I once again have a question concerning faction and zones. Now that me and my fellow guildies reached a level where we can hunt a lot of the new zones we never been before, we need some help. We all don't want to ruin our dragon factions (Ring of Scale AND Claws of Veeshan). We currently hunt in the Dreadlands, but the zone gets boring soon. One of our options is Kaesora or Burning Wood, or maybe City of Mist and the Emerald Jungle. Is any of these zones doable with a good group, mid 30s to mid 40s? We had no problem at all in the Dreadlands... but we want to try something new. <br>
<br>
Oh, and I heard rumors of a bank in some dragon zone on Kunark, but could not find any reference to it. Is anyone here maybe on the dragon factions and can help me and my friends out?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks so much,<br>
<br>

<br>
First, there is a bank in the dragon city of Skyshrine, but you'll need a map of the zone (and at least dubious CoV faction) to find it.  The zone is accessed from Wakening Lands, which is accessed from Kael Drakkel, the giant city.  The banker in Skyshrine (Pyrox) is not a dragon, but a golem I'm afraid.  The zone is full of drakes, wyverns and wurms, but only one true dragon - King Yelinak himself.  <br>
<br>
Please note that Yelinak is on his own faction, NOT CoV, so you can be ally to the rest of Skyshrine, but KoS to Yelinak  himself &amp; his immediate guards - knowing this can avoid some humorous, but fatal, results.  To raise CoV faction, kill Kromzek  or Storm Giants (the giants with the rounded helmets and short beards)  At your level, Yelinak faction can only be raised through Skyshrine quests.<br>
<br>
There's a zillion places to hunt at your levels:<br>
City of Mist is good  - be careful about sitting against walls, particularly internal walls, as you can easily precipitate nasty trains.<br>
Emerald Jungle and Trakanon's teeth both have some nice little undead camps as well as some iksar (forsaken faction) camps.  The rares cycle in TT is quite good, but may be a bit hard - give it a try, and you can start getting your Sebilis keys, which you will want soon.  Doom will probably squash you like bugs, so watch out.<br>
Sol B kobolds will be good hunting for you too, very good EXP through the mid 40s, and nice loot if you can get the rares camp  (After mid 40s, bats &amp; bugs are still solid EXP, loot is limited)<br>
LGuk has some good camps for you<br>
Burning woods giants can offer you pretty solid EXP, as can the Sarnaks outside Chardok - avoid the wurms as they are Ring of Scale.<br>
Eastern Wastes, Kael Drakkel, Crystal Caverns, and Tower of Frozen Shadow in Velious are all decent possibilities for you too.<br>
<br>
All these zones have both single &amp; multi-group potential, so, go out &amp; have some fun!  <br>

It's unfortunate that so many great hunting zones are on VS faction and for some unbelievable reason they put the outpost (the ONLY bank for many people in Kunark) on VS faction.  Having said that, Kaesora is a great dungeon, and I managed to stay non-KOS while I hunted there.<br>
<br>
Not every mob in Kaesora has a VS faction hit.  The spiders do, and a few of the undead do as well.  What my group learned to do was just bypass the spiders and head directly down to the library area.  There's some good loot down there, and the xp was amazing.  There were also very few faction hits down there.  I also learned which mobs gave VS hits and just stayed out of those fights when I could.<br>
<br>
There is only one way I know of to increase your VS faction, and that is doing the war braids quest.  Collect every bezerker whip you can get while you are in OT and turn them in 4 at a time to the skeleton captian.  He'll give a nice chunk of xp as well as a +VS faction.  By doing this, you can correct any small faction damage you take in Kaesora.  Keep in mind that this will only work if you are already dubious.  If you let your faction drop to KOS, there is no turning back.<br>
<br>
Finally, let me say that after all that work I did to keep my VS faction, it didn't matter after all.  In the end, I just gave up and went KOS.  Karnor's Castle is a staple at levels 45-50, and the xp in Charasis was just too good to pass up.  I find I don't ever go to the outpost anymore, and I don't miss it.  I just grab a port to the mainland or somewhere in Velious if I need to bank or get supplies.<br>
<br>
Ask around and I suspect you'll find that is what most people will tell you.  At least once you hit level 45 or so, there's just no reason to go to the outpost anymore.  There are safe places you can bind there even if you are KOS.  If you need a spell from there, you can send in a mule or get a friend to pick it up.  So I suggest you really research it before you decide to blow off your VS faction, but in the end, I suspect you will decide to. <br>

<br>
I read some zone guides about the dragon zones on Kunark (I really love love love dragons) and found MinionsOFScale faction, for the wurms etc (so the lesser dragons, so to speak). I have yet to find a way to raise faction with them, as I heard everyone starts KoS to them. Do you know of any way? Is there a minor MoS hit when you raise RoS faction <br>
maybe? Or is this not true at all?<br>
<br>
Oh, and is it true that Lady Vox and Nagafen are not on any dragon faction but have their own? <p><b><i><font color="silver">Callissa Gatecaller<BR>

So is Trakanon for that matter. These factions cannot be raised, AFAIK<br>
<br>
I believe that every creature that is on Minions of Scale will also give you a Ring of Scale hit (i.e. you'll get two faction messages if you kill them) - minions is for the Skyfire and BW creatures, who are permanently KoS to everyone.  Beat them up, and the ring dragons will be mad at you.  There is no way I know of to raise Minions of scale faction, so stay out of skyfire, and avoid the wurms in BW if RoS faction is important to you.<br>
<br>
All full dragons in Kunark are on RoS faction, except Trakanon<br>
All the creatures in Skyshrine, plus Wuoshi &amp; Rolandal in Wakening Lands, and all Dragons (&amp; dragonkin- drakes, wurms, etc.) in Western Wastes except Esorpa of the Ring are on CoV.  One guess what faction Esorpa is on.<br>
All West wing dragons in ToV are on CoV, all East wing (HoT) are factionless -KoS to everyone, North wing dragons are Guardians of Veeshan - I believe GoV faction is raisable by doing the west wing quests - we aren't quite there yet.<br>
I don't know the faction implications for DN and ST dragons.<br>
<br>
Of course, Allakhazam's has lots more detail on this.<br>
<br>
Have fun! <p>Nephtu <BR>
