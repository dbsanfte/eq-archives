At approximately 7 A.M. on June 9, the witness was traveling east on Route 30 between<br>Jeannette and Greensburg, Pennsylvania in Westmoreland County when the observation reportedly occurred. The lady had left her<br>   home early that morning and was enroute to her job. She had slowed down to look at a car that was for sale and was looking<br>towards the right side. Seconds later her attention was drawn to a large dark manlike creature, which was standing on a back road<br>                                    which was surrounded by woods.<br><br>   While the observation only lasted about 15-20 seconds, the witness saw the creature cross the road, and enter into a nearby<br> wooded area. The woman estimated that the creature stood about 6-7 feet tall, and weighed approximately 300-400 pounds. The<br>  witness states that she slammed on her brakes as soon as she saw the creature, but it could no longer be seen. The lady was so<br>  upset after the observation, that she pulled off the road. She later continued onto work but didn't tell anyone about what she had<br> seen. She said that she was disturbed all day as a result of her experience, but waited until she got home to tell her daughter about<br> what she had observed. The witness and her daughter discussed the possibility of reporting the encounter, but they didn't want to<br>                          call the police. The witness located Eric through his web site.<br><br> Eric contacted me soon after he received the sighting report. On June 13, Eric and I met the witness and conducted an interview<br>  with her. We also accompanied the woman to the scene of the sighting so that we could get a better understanding of what had<br>  occurred. Eric had also invited another Bigfoot witness whom he is familiar with to accompany us. During the interview more<br>                                information about the incident came forward.<br><br>The woman indicated that she was driving slowly along Route 30 at approximately 20-25 miles per hour. When the witness noticed<br> the creature, it was approximately 300 feet away. It was standing sideways in a &quot;hunched position&quot; on the back road, looking west<br> towards the woods ahead. As the witness watched, the creature turned it's head and looked towards the highway, then took two<br>   or three long strides and stepped into the thick woods where it was lost from sight. The woman stated that the creature was<br> manlike and covered with long black hair. While no facial features could be determined, the head seemed somewhat oval in shape,<br> and there was very little neck apparent. There was hair hanging down from the chin, and the hair appeared thinner on the arms.<br>      The arms hung down at the sides of the creature, and they appeared long, and extended down to almost the knees.<br><br>  The chest area appeared larger than the area around the abdomen. The physical detail which stood out to the witness, was that<br>   the legs appeared extremely long in comparison to the rest of the body. The legs were thin and covered with hair. After the<br> interview, we went to the location of the sighting. Eric's friend made a good subject for the witness to compare with, in regard to<br>  the size of the creature. This gentleman is about 6'2&quot; tall, and weighs about 325 pounds. Eric and the witness and I, stayed near<br>  the top of the hill towards the highway, while this man went down the road to stand at the approximate spot where the creature<br> reportedly stood. The witness was amazed when she realized that this man looked small in comparison to the creature. She now<br>   estimates that the creature would have been around 8 feet tall. The witness says that she is reluctant to tell others about her<br>                  sighting. This lady never believed in such accounts until she had her own encounter.<br><br>                                          Additional Notes:<br><br>  Eric and some of his associates looked over the area in the vicinity of where the creature was seen for any signs of tracks or<br>  other physical evidence. It is my understanding that nothing conclusive was found. During the 1970's and 1980's, I investigated<br>              numerous Bigfoot sightings within a few miles of where this observation reportedly took place.<br><br>                                            Stan Gordon<br><br><br><br><br>just thought u might be intrested <p>Regards Holodoc (Adrian)</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uruthupton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RuthUpton</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0 HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>ezOP</span><br>   <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/6/00 6:27:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.spiritonline.com/gallery/unicorn5.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bigfoot</span><hr size=1> Nice one, GMT... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Ruth <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uruthupton.showPublicProfile?language=EN>RuthUpton</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/image/posticons/pi_yingyang.gif height=20 width=20 BORDER=0> at: 6/15/01 7:50:03 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/urhoadesb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>rhoadesb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/16/01 4:28:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   bigfoot</span><hr size=1>    Most interesting!<br><br>   While this is not why I came to this thread, it would be silly not to reply to this.<br><br>   Currently, I live about 75-100 miles from this location, and at one time lived VERY close to it. I have lived in Pennsylvania all of my 50 years.<br><br>   I have never heard of a person who had seen such as this within the state, at least not directly, or in conversation.<br><br>   Most of my family were woodsmen, some exceedingly expert as to the flora/fauna of southwestern Pennsylvania. None ever mentioned anything of this nature.<br><br>   There are two family stories that may or may not be relevant to this that I will share here. One I am personally involved in, the other was told to me by my grandfather ...<br><br>   About 1965 my grandfather stated to me that he had seen mountain lion tracks at a dumpsite near our home. At that time, the wildlife authorities were stating that the creatures no longer inhabited Pennsylvania.<br><br>   A week or so after this, a friend and I were in the woods. To make it short, we both heard the growl of a cougar!<br><br>   Nothing further is relevant until circa 1990. At this time the authorities stated that indeed moutain lions ARE within the state. The point being that for AT LEAST 25 years, in a highly populated state, these large cats roamed unknown to officialdom.<br><br>   The second story was relayed to me by my grandfather:<br><br>   About 1915-1925, he and some friends were coon (raccon) hunting in somerset county I believe. In any event, he told me that the dogs, (3-4 of then) were aheard of the men by about a mile. The men heard a tremendous uproar by the dogs, and hurried to the location. Upon arriving, all the dogs were dead and TORN APART! They never found out what did this.<br><br>   A bear or large cat might kill them, but would not likely rip them apart. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/btrfly6.gif height=35 width=35 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 2841<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/20/01 9:34:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=3>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bigfoot</span><hr size=1> GMT, great article! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br><br>Rhoadesb, that is terrifying! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br><br>~~~Dottie~~~<br><br><br>   <p><img src=http://photoasa.com/disk2/2737/49775_dottiehm.gif><br>"The love for all living creatures is the noblest attribute of man."<br>~~~Charles Darwin~~~<br>Please visit us at the <font size=3><a href="http://pub12.ezboard.com/bthoughtmessageboard">Thought Message Board</a><br><font size=1><a href="http://pub15.ezboard.com/btheguardianacademy">The Guardian Academy</a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulokiithefool.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lokii the fool</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://home.iprimus.com.au/oxx/flat.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/11/01 11:37:27 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://home.iprimus.com.au/oxx/spin.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bigfoot</span><hr size=1> Hi I live in Australia and actually have a first hand account of what you guy's refer to as a bigfoot. Over here the creature is referred to as a "Yowie". <br><br>When I was about 20 (19 years ago) a group of friends of mine and myself decided to go camping in the Blackbutt Ranges (50 miles nw of Brisbane). We all rode trail bikes as that was the only way to get there. Being that it was deep in a National Park. For some reason, at the moment I can't remember why, we stopped on the dirt track we were riding on to cool down our bikes. It was then that I heard the most unusual noise I have ever heard in my life to date. (I am well travelled and am what  most Americans would call a "Woodsman") I am quite unashamed to admit that this scared the heck out of me and the rest of the group I was with. We continued on and set up our camp and we heard this noise all night. A couple of months later someone spotted a "Yowie" in the area where we were which prompted a pretty serious media coverage. The town council of the areas erected a statue of a "Yowie" in the nearby town. Say what you will but I have no doubt that such creatures exist. <p><html><head><title></title></head><body link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#FFFFFF" alink="#FFFFFF"><b><center><TABLE STYLE="filter:glow(color=#0080FF, strength=2)"><TR><TD><font face="Calligrapher" size="4" color="#CC0000">BetteR InFaMouS</font></TABLE></center></b><p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://home.iprimus.com.au/oxx/lokiiofasgard.gif" width="144" height="130"></a></p><b><center><TABLE STYLE="filter:glow(color=#0080FF, strength=3)" bordercolorlight="#FFFFFF" bordercolordark="#FFFFFF"><TR><TD>    <p align="center"><font face="Calligrapher" size="4" color="#CC0000">ThaN UnKnOwN</font><font face="verdana" size="3"><br></font><a href="http://asgard-online.cjb.net"><font face="Calligrapher" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Asgard    - Realm of Gods -</font></a></table></body></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/btrfly6.gif height=35 width=35 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 2960<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/12/01 5:01:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=3.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: bigfoot</span><hr size=1> Lokii, how terrifying! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Oh, I do believe you. Hey, here is a snippet from a website and the website link about the possible existance of Bigfoot:<br><br>:Snippet::<br><br>Is it possible that a reclusive man-like creature inhabits the remote areas of our planet? Why not ? Isn't it arrogant of us to assume we know of all the species on this huge planet ? Scientists will tell you that we don't. Only a few years ago, an unknown animal now named the Okapi was discovered. What about creatures we know of , but are thought to be extinct ? The coelacanth was thought to be extinct for 70 million years until they were discovered alive and well in 1938. So is it really that hard to believe that a hair covered, man-like creature could exist on the verge of discovery ? In many remote areas of the world there have been sightings of just such a creature. Known by many names such as Sasquatch, Yeti, Almas and many more. Is this an unknown primate, the &quot;missing link&quot; or some other yet unknown species ? There is evidence to support the existence of just such a creature in the Northwestern United States as well as other remote areas. <br><br>There are still numerous sightings every year. The descriptions of the creatures are very similar from sighting to sighting. There are discrepancies in some of the details but the mind does play tricks on us when frightened. Exaggeration and hoaxes do account for some of the discrepancies in the descriptions as well. The height is the most varied detail. Witnesses have reported the creatures to be from 5'6&quot; to 8' +. This is easily explained if you take into account the possible age difference of the particular creature. Did they see and adult or juvenile ? There would be a noticeable size difference depending on the age. <br><br>:: End Snippet::<br><br>****Please see this website for links to &quot;The Foot Prints, Bigfoot Sightings, Bigfoot and Food, Theories on Bigfoot's Identity, Bigfoot's Names, Are they dangerous?&quot; ....

I believe the publicity you speak of came from a pack of boy scouts and their leaders, who were also camping when they had an encounter. I no doubt, believe that a creature such as a Yowie exists in the land down under.  Too many credible reports there over the years to ignore. The similarities between the Yowie and Bigfoot are very striking, even the vocal recordings seem to match.
