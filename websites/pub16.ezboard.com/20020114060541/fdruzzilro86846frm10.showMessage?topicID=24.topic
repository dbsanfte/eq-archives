Every once in a while I turn to CNN and watch their nonstop coverage of the event and see exactly what NEW is going on...<br>
<br>
And its scaring me.<br>
<br>
Images of Protestants in Northern Ireland attacking Catholic School children as they head to work come to mind.<br>
<br>
The United States has been wronged, but I'm finding myself looking at the two wrongs don't make a right policy.  The US is capable of exacting retribution, and it is not something I wish to deny anyone.  As a country you were hurt badly by this and the cries for revenge from both political leaders and political followers are growing louder every day.<br>
<br>
Tonight my prayers will go out not only to the victims of these events, but to the political leaders as well.  Tempers are flaring and I hope the United States of America (possibly more united now than before) will show compassion along with firmness as those responsible are held accountable.<br>
<br>
Maybe I need to be moderated already, but these are just the thoughts of a Canadian bystander who grows more scared every day.<br>

Similar to the compassion that the terrorists showed while slamming planeloads of innocent men, women and children into buildings full of the same?<br>

I'm sorry, but I don't see the need.  America has been all too compliant and all to submissive.  We've had our embassies bombed, our barracks bombed, our ships bombed and now we've had these bastards dare to attack us on our own soil.<br>
<br>
That's it.  It's enough.  We're through being the nice guys.  Maybe we'll show some compassion after the war and rebuild them like we did Germany, Japan, France and a host of other countries.  For now, however, they must be made to understand that we will not take this bullshit anymore.  They seem to only undertand violence, therefore that's what we must deliver.<br>

Do everything you can to avoid a fight, it won't solve the problem.  Discussion and logic will.<br>

When the Goverments of the countries that habor them will no longer do so out of fear. We will use the Taliban as an example... they harbor a known terrorist... they protect him... not the Afgany (how the hell do you spell that?) people, the Taliban. So, we when they refuse to turn him over, we make is clear via Physcwar that we ARE NOT after the people, but the Taliban, and that once they are gone, the people will be free to carry on anyway they want. Then we remove all trace's of them from the surface of the planet. Sure some of them will back the Taliban, thats their choice, a very bad choice, but thiers to make. Then we look to Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and say &quot;Look over here at this country, they are Terrorist free and now, our Armed forces are ready to move on to the next country, anyone want to raise there hand?&quot;  Terroism will become very unwanted in every country around the world. <br>

<br>
I don't particularly like the idea that there is a chance that innocents will be killed, but then again, I don't see it as us killing them.  The Taliban is harboring a murderer and, should we have to go apprehend him by force, they are responsible for the results of that force.  Sure, that logic can be taken about anywhere you want it to go, but I still rest firm in my belief that the ends will justify the means, in this case at least.<br>
<br>
At the end of WWII the USA used the first Atomic bombs on Japan.  We killed tens of thousands of &quot;innocent&quot; women and children with those bombs, but we foreshortened the war by months or even years, thus saving countless more lives in the battle theater as well as in the territories that Japan violently occupied (and I'd urge everyone to research Japan's atrocities from WWII - most folks haven't a clue, and would be appalled if they knew).  I, for one, am fully prepared for my country to make the same decision again.  In the end, Afghanistan freed of the Taliban will be a far better place for everybody.<br>

This is war. When you go to war you fight to win, nothing short of it. And you win when your enemies are dead, beaten, and broken. I dont think we are going to attack civilians directly that is not our style. But undoubtedly there will probably be some civilian casualties at some point, thats the sad fact of war =/... But during WWII for example, reducing German industry and cities to rubble was a key factor/strategy in ending the war, we knew there would be German civilian dead because of it but that was the dirty cost it takes to win a war, and the price the Germans ultimately upfront offered to pay when they decided to start a war. <br>
<br>
As for Japan, they got what they deserved. They werent going to surrender no matter how long you starved their country. The military regime was in control and they would have seen their country starved and dying of famine before they would have surrendered to us....casualty estimates from a japanese mainland  invasion was estimated at nearly a million. So between 1 million U.S. and Allied casaulties and possible famine on the Japanese mainland using those 2 bombs made a helluva lot of sense. Also Filo mentions something a lot of people don't know about; thew bataan deathmarch, the rape of Nanking, and the building of the Burma-Thai railroad. You want to talk atrocities start researching those three subjects, not to mention the treatment of captured U.S. and allied servicemen. It was a horrible situation all-around, but we did what had to be done when facing such evil as the Nazis and Imperial Japan during WWII.<br>

<br>
Lets face it, geo-political concerns, strategic location, natural resources, leadership in the international community, and foreign policy all play a part in this, and the part Canada plays is basically nil, because (aside from natural resources) they offer nothing in the political arena as regards to military procedures to be view as a player, and bask in the haven of peace afforded by being the neighbor of the country that paid for it...US.<br>
<br>
Peaceful democracies like those enjoyed by Canada and the USA, were paid for. Aggressors that wish to fook with our peaceful existance must be eliminated like they have in the past. Did you really believe that picking what summer concert to attend is a right? Is this as hard as your life choices have become? If so, ask yourself, &quot;Why is that?????&quot;<br>
<br>
It is a priveledge. A priviledge bought and paid for in the blood of our brave predecessors to establish and maintain our societies in a world that can easily slip back to days of religious or governmental barbarity.<br>

Don't confuse yourself.  There is no reason to think that the USA would or should pursue a purely judicial approach to this incident.<br>
<br>
Sure, we want to bring the perpetrators to justice, but we also want and need to ensure that these folks will not act this way again.<br>
<br>
All these folks understand is fear and violence, we must therefore speak their language in communicating our dissent.  Probably over and over again.<br>
<br>
We needn't and shouldn't deliberately target Afghani citizens, or any other &quot;innocents,&quot; but we must do whatever we can to ensure that Bin Ladin and other terrorists are wiped from the face of this earth.  Violently.  If others get in our way, voluntarily or otherwise, then it's their loss. . . and part of the lesson.<br>
<br>
You might be able to twist your thinking to associate our actions with pure terrorism, but at least those we end up killing will know that it's coming and will know why.  And at least we won't be targetting civilians outright.<br>

The moment you start to decide *how* someone should die (or *if*, for that matter) you have already been clouded by revenge and start to forget justice.  I'm not saying its without reason, but I will say it's wrong.<br>
<br>
The media and the Washington spin doctors are rampant with jingoist speech right now, brewing up the hysteria that will attempt to justify the bloodletting to come.<br>

Tell that to Ghandi and his followers, Conrad Groebel (sp?) and the Mennonites (who were persecuted unjustly for many generations) and, Jesus and his Christians.<br>
<br>
It takes much more strength and integrity to resist violence than to be a part of it.<br>
<br>
If the United Nations corporately (*not* the US) can track down the terrorists and bring them to trial, I will readily applaud their success.  If civilians &quot;get in the way&quot;, I'll start enquiring where the Afghani Relief Funds are to be sent. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uearthpig95.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Earthpig95</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_thatch.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 52<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/18/01 2:00:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/Sir_Vikin/dda4.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Desert</span><hr size=1> Are you related to Jane Fonda?<br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The problem with giving people freedom is the fact that they feel that it is something they are entitled to though no effort of their own.  Freedom brings out the Best and the worst in people. Cowards hide behind the Guise of being “Pacifists” and use it as an excuse to avoid protecting the Country that provides it. They  use others, who are willing to step up to the plate and protect their land, even if it means their life, to stand up for them. Then they complain about the way that the protection is carried out. If you don’t want to help do something for your own home then those of us who have the sack to do it really don’t give a damn how you feel about it.  You named 3 people that got what they wanted (kinda…) by no violence… I can name a thousand that got there way though force of arms, and didn’t have to starve them selves or be killed for the sins of man kind.  Feel free to donate all the money you would like to the Taliban, or other anti American organizations, it will just make their final, crushing, defeat even that much more satisfying… and we get to come home and find some traitors…<br>

<br>
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, these people have so little respect for the lives of the people they kill, and such a burning hatred for the people whose lives they wish to reduce to fear, that the only answer now IS force.<br>
<br>
We've been pacifistic to them before.  We've been firm with them before.  We've even been directly violent while attempting to minimize civilian casualties.<br>
<br>
And now they killed almost 6000 people on our own soil.  6000 people who did nothing to them.  6000 people who weren't even all Americans.<br>
<br>
Did you see that number yet Mr Pacifist?<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6000<br>
<br>
SIX THOUSAND</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
<br>
and all in the name of what?  God?  Since when did God need to use man to kill people for going against His teachings, in any religion?  Since when did he do some form of retribution without acknowledging it as His work?  So no, God had nothing to dowith this.<br>
<br>
What else then?  Revenge?  For WHAT?!?  That was <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> 6000</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> people who had nothing to do with what goes on in the Middle East.  Maybe a few did by virtue of doing BUSINESS there and bringing money INTO the Middle East, why be vengeful on people HELPING your country?<br>
<br>
You can blow pacifism right out your ass when it comes to terrorists, cause they'll sure as hell do it for you if you don't. <p>Quintall Dys'Raydin<BR>
