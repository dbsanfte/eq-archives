Below is a partial transcript of the 700 Club television program <br>
from Thursday, September 13, 2001. Also attached is a statement <br>
from People For the American Way President Ralph G. Neas. <br>
<br>
Partial transcript of comments from the Thursday, September 13, <br>
2001 edition of the &quot;700 Club&quot;: <br>
<br>
JERRY FALWELL: And I agree totally with you that the Lord has <br>
protected us so wonderfully these 225 years. And since 1812, this <br>
is the first time that we've been attacked on our soil and by far <br>
the worst results. And I fear, as Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary <br>
of Defense, said yesterday, that this is only the beginning. And <br>
with biological warfare available to these monsters -- the <br>
Husseins, the Bin Ladens, the Arafats - what we saw on Tuesday, as <br>
terrible as it is, could be miniscule if, in fact -- if, in fact -- <br>
God continues to lift the curtain and allow the enemies of America <br>
to give us probably what we deserve. <br>
<br>
PAT ROBERTSON: Jerry, that's my feeling. I think we've just <br>
seen the antechamber to terror. We haven't even begun to see what <br>
they can do to the major population. <br>
<br>
JERRY FALWELL: The ACLU's got to take a lot of blame for this. <br>
<br>
PAT ROBERTSON: Well, yes. <br>
<br>
JERRY FALWELL: And, I know that I'll hear from them for this. <br>
But, throwing God out successfully with the help of the federal <br>
court system, throwing God out of the public square, out of the <br>
schools. The abortionists have got to bear some burden for this <br>
because God will not be mocked. And when we destroy 40 million <br>
little innocent babies, we make God mad. I really believe that the <br>
pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and <br>
the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative <br>
lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way -- all of them who <br>
have tried to secularize America -- I point the finger in their <br>
face and say &quot;you helped this happen.&quot; <br>
<br>
PAT ROBERTSON: Well, I totally concur, and the problem is we <br>
have adopted that agenda at the highest levels of our government. <br>
And so we're responsible as a free society for what the top people <br>
do. And, the top people, of course, is the court system. <br>
<br>
JERRY FALWELL: Pat, did you notice yesterday the ACLU, and all <br>
the Christ-haters, People For the American Way, NOW, etc. were <br>
totally disregarded by the Democrats and the Republicans in both <br>
houses of Congress as they went out on the steps and called out on <br>
to God in prayer and sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; and said &quot;let the <br>
ACLU be hanged&quot;? In other words, when the nation is on its knees, <br>
the only normal and natural and spiritual thing to do is what we <br>
ought to be doing all the time -- calling upon God. <br>
<br>
PAT ROBERTSON: Amen<br>
<br>
This is the land of the free and the home of the brave not the finger pointers! <br>

I was struck not only by the obvious finger-pointing, but also the underlying arrogant thinking that America has been afforded special protection from God, because it is &quot;better&quot; than all the other &quot;unbelieving&quot; countries.  <br>
<br>
I am a Christian, but it's pretty obvious to me why a lot of people are turned off by Christianity.  <br>

Is Pat Roberston or Jerry Falwell what Christianity (or religion to a lesser extent) is all about? Of course not, its much greater than them. At the end of the day these guys are just people, like you and me. And whatever they do have to say is not always some grand representation of those who are religious in this country. I am a christian, I try and go to mass regularly, but I am not some blind follower to whatever Jerry Falwell or Pat Roberston has to say for example. So please, if you are going to make broad or sterotyped assumptions you may want to put a lot more work in to it . If you are going to say that religion is bad in lieu of whats happened, then why arent the billion muslims in India all charging across the ocean to kill &quot;the great satan&quot;, burning U.S effigies in Delhi, or how come mosques in the US arent filled with weapons and munitions? Why not? Because sterotyping on that broad of a spectrum will always make you look foolish. Theres nothing wrong with religion, if anything some things are wrong with an extremely tiny minority of people who are religious.<br>

I would put Pat and Jerry in the same grouping as those who carried out this attack in the name of God. <br>
<br>
I am not cristian even though I was raised that way.  As I gre up I made choices in what felt right to me.  I think the more that make a personal choice of their religions the stronger the faith becomes.  My mother never questioned her faith and I feel that the choices you and I make should be very personal.<br>
<br>
The larger the organization the easier for corruption, greed, and streo-typing to occur.  That is not just religion but that has shown true there as well.  <br>
<br>
I am sorry that anyone who says they follow the teachings of a man like Jesus could ever blame anyone but those who took these actions.  They act as if we were better off in 1800's burning witches at the stake.  God did not protect us our unity and strength did.  We place such high value on personal freedoms that we protected them like a mother over her children.  God, what ever form he takes in your heart and mind watches on and I have to think God just shakes his head in disbelief when things like this happen.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if more people actually followed what they claim to this would be a better place.<br>
<br>
Try to hold your faith close in these times.  Many people let go.  Remeber though some of us follow beliefs that allow us revenge for harming us and our families and people! =)<br>

The propaganda and dogma of groups like the Taliban would have you believe that Allah (God) will reward them for mass murder and suicide, and there are those here in the USA that will say that if God were really powerful, or existed in the first place, that he would not have let this happen.<br>
<br>
The fact is that none of these people have sat down with God and discussed this with him.  Whatever higher power any of the involved parties may believe in, they still acted as human beings with their own agenda.  Nobody asked God if they should blow up a bunch of innocent people -- if they think that is what a creator would want for his people, they are indeed sick.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is that whatever humanity does, nation against nation or person against person, it is because it is the path they chose...not something God told them to do.  It is free will, which can be a wonderful and sometimes terrible thing.  Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell may be good people on the inside, or maybe not, but on the outside they are no different from the many other self-proclaimed &quot;authorities&quot; on whatever item is up for discussion on a given day.  <br>

I myself am not a follower of a certain orginized religion. But it seems that the way cristianity works is to believe that god loves us all am I correct?<br>
<br>
Take this into consideration. God makes man, but from there on, does god make everyone else? Did god make me, or did my parents? I think, although I'm not cristian, God has done his job. God has started this, and now he gets to watch, maybe like a movie?<br>
<br>
What about the people we should point our fingers at according to these two men. If I have I have a friend whom is gay, was he not a creation of God according to these two men? Was he not created from the same divine power as I? How we can point our fingers at anyone who is differant, according to a book that not everyone believes in, really isn't valid.<br>
<br>
This brings up a whole new point, this is how this all got started am I correct? &quot;Hmmm, he doesn't practice my religion, we should eliminate him.&quot; or &quot;He doesnt have the same skin color as me, lets kill him.&quot;. This is how this all got started, pointing your fingers at someone who isn't the same. To find someone to blame so nobody points the finger at you is what it seems these two men are cowering behind.<br>
<br>
I'm only 14, my points may be uninformed. But even so, these are the things that destroy people, the almighty differance that we should eliminate.  <p>Bitikan Blayznight ~ Master Flamer

I feel that christians own america, almost all the moments of silence and prayers are christians, and the president is christian and talks about it so much. One of my friends said this whole chrisitan attudite to everything makes him sick and he is saving up his money to leave america. Karl Marxs once said that religion is a tool of the goverment, which in some asspects seems to be quite true, you see how the taliban uses it to high effect, and now Bush is using Chrisitanity to high effect. <br>
<br>
Man is shifty and faulty, but man has written all relgious text and books, and the &quot;god&quot; that came down to earth was a man , and was slain like a man, (sorry for the harshness in my words, but you guys already hate me so .. ::shrug:: ). Jesus was a very political man, and knew his enemys quite good, he played on there every weakness. i honor jesus (not a religous form but as a mastermind), it's weird though that alot of chrisitans want to blow up the middle east <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  i think there forgeting, that jesus was a &quot;sand nigger&quot;. On the part of homosexuals, if jesus christ was god, and god created all, then jesus christ created the homosexual, do you think jesus could have been homosexual? He did walk around with 12 men and die in a diaper..... <br>
<br>
 There is one simple fact that hold against all religions reagon(sp), religons come from one spot in a area usally regarding one race of people, and then has to spread from there, and the &quot;new&quot; ( how can you discover whats already there by defintion you become aware ) world had no likeness of relgions from the European and any other religons? where these people created by god? or did he forget about them? where did they come from?  <br>

Pickelarm - This is the first time ever I have ever been personally 'angry' at somthing written about or in conjunction with Everquest. I have many foul opinions on your writings, opinons and haughty conduct. When you experence life in the real world, you may well be in for a very rough time. As much as you would love to believe the opposite, you are a very shallow person with equally shallow views on many subjects. Keep this in mind next time you broadcast those views like the truthbringer you seem to wish you are. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kurifu>kurifu</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/16/01 10:36:33 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religion and the warped people that represent it!</span><hr size=1> Divvine - It is wrong to phrase that as &quot;what religion has become&quot; Religions that have set these standards have not changed in the longest of times... well by that I mean in anyway that woudl effect the spirits and underlying factors of their beliefs.<br>
<br>
It is the people who represent the religions that have changes and brought about these acts and solely them. Religions are so vague that they are interpreted, in many cases out of context into fundamentalism (wow, I used that word 2 times in 6 minutes).<br>
<br>
Just thought I would point this out... especially since I am religous, like many others, and would never kill another person. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udivvine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Divvine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 31<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/17/01 3:12:56 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religion and the warped people that represent it!</span><hr size=1> Quote: <br>

I agree in ways but religion is changed and has changed, from burning witches to thinking the earth was flat - rapture to no rapture.  Religion is a belief in a higher beign that is tought or learned from another man (woman) your religious views are usally drawn from your parents. The people that beleive these nutz are going to teach this hatred to there children. I almost wish we where not born as blocks of clay to be molded but a spirit with a free will from the start.  It is sad that it took me 28 years to figure out who I am and why people like this are still able to breed. <br>
<br>
I hope I step on no ones toes but I was given a quote when I searched out on my own and it is as follows <br>
<br>
&quot;A cult is a religion that does not have political power&quot;<br>
<br>
The united states is the land of the free so an opionion like this is waranted and I feel is true! In Rome it was the ceaser that brought Christianity out of cult status to the Empires religion. I thank you all for responding this has been very interesting and I am glad we are all different people here! May your paths be bright and all of this hatred goes behind us and now that our country is unified because of what happened may it be unified long after the &quot;faceless Coward&quot; is brought to justice!<br>

<br>
I <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> was</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> a Christian.  I spent 7 years as a missionary.  I was guilty of proselytizing and pigeon-holing many people.  I came to realize that the religion I was trying to 'share' was not my own.  So I stopped.  I, effectively, wiped that slate clean and began a slow process of what my spirituality is to me.  I have no room in my life for any religion, and don't even focus on the spiritual though I will admit to a belief in it.<br>
<br>
One phrase I'd heard, and will still hold to, is this:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE CENTER START--><center> <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Don't blame God for the wrongdoings of Man.</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--></center><!--EZCODE CENTER END--><br>
<br>
True followers of the Bible and true followers of Islam will agree on one thing - there is no room for violence.  Those who preach the hatred and intolerance are the extremists of either/both camps.  *They* do not represent their religions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uindecisiveson.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Indecisive SoN</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/18/01 2:49:05 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Religion and the warped people that represent it!</span><hr size=1> Picklearm must get his ass kicked... a lot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.showMessageRange?topicID=14.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.showMessage?topicID=25.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.showMessage?topicID=19.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.emailToFriend?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.threadControl?topicID=14.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=14.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm10">IRL<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm11">The Admin Vault<option value="druzzilro86846frm12">Raid Archive<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">The Void<option value="druzzilro86846frm13">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm10>IRL</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
