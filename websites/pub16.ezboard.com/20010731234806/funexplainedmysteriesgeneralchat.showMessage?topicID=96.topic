THE RETURN OF POE-excerpt <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“You cannot know me . NEVER will we meet in space and time . STILL , I am a conduit . MY words , YOUR interface with quantum space .”<br>
Steven K. Mitchell<br>
8/28/1999<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
“Time is not a line . It is a state of being . Like burning . Or orgasm . And it is the all-consuming and finite nature of TIME which constitutes LIFE …” <br>
Edgar Allan Poe<br>
9/16/2397<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Paralogue<br>
<br>
<br>
“I have reached these lands but newly , from an ultimate , dim thule , from a wild , weird clime , that lieth sublime , OUT OF SPACE , OUT OF TIME …”<br>
<br>
<br>
Contentment … and peace … a surcease of the beastly burning called LIVING . <br>
<br>
The years since his corporeal demise had been kind to Poe . He existed now only in quantum space ,  no longer stalked and obsessed by the grinning specter of Death . Here was numbing detachment from all things …where anything , EVERYTHING conceivable could be observed from infinite perspectives ,  time gone now and with it the pleasure/horror of finite existence .<br>
<br>
Most of the others from his generation were truly DEAD . Unrecognizable . Unaware . CONSUMED . Their specific life energies dissipated throughout the cosmos , they existed NOWHERE . HE should be dead too yet , HE still <br>
lived . So much of HIM existed as quantum energy he spun his own existence <br>
in the bizarre , gossamer reality of quantum space , a truly INFINITE place where unending possibilities exist , shift and permutate and to which THERE IS NO END !<br>
<br>
<br>
Poe  actually FELT an uncomfortable jolt/ripple of energy invade the blissful , swirling blue . He became shockingly aware of a PRESENCE  from the OTHER side , where TIME is the hunter . Suddenly , she was there ! Huge even at a distance . Growing to a colossus as space narrowed . Righteousness , gorgeousity , cat-green eyes , strawberry-blonde hair, perfect ivory teeth , firm , ripe body with alabaster skin , tan and freckle-dusted like sweet , maple sprinkles on a honey glazed pastry . Her solidity contrasted mightily with the with the ethereal , aqua-hued realm surrounding her . TIME dripped from her like molten lead in zero gravity and everywhere it flew it wrought convulsions of LIFE where things had merely EXISTED before . Poe stared intently and as she moved inexorably toward him he began to expand , his pure energy form effortlessly making the transition . Then , face to face , they looked into each others eyes and lightly touched . Poe screamed as the scene was sundered of its dream-like quality . The girl too wailed and her eyes opened wide , terrified with the realization that this was real ! Immediately, she retreated to the familiarity of the known physical universe , thereby becoming the conduit through which Poe’s life-force would re-enter the fire of time . For his part , the mad genius felt himself being sucked out ! Out of the peaceful limbo he had so readily , eagerly embraced . Then , in the blink of an eye he was solid again , feeling again , ALIVE ! He looked incredulously into the bright , frightened eyes of she who had re-incarnated him and , with the succinctity of genius , voiced two one word questions …”How ? Why ?”<br>
<br>
Then it began .<br>
<br>
<br>
 1<br>
<br>
<br>
A BLACK PEARL SURFACES<br>
<br>
<br>
On second thought , it had actually begun over 400 years previous , in the early 1990’s , when a quantum physicist named Penrose and a anesthesiologist named Hameroff engaged in a most interesting exchange of information . This dialogue led to the deduction that “microtubule webs” in our brains held the physical location of human consciousness . The logic behind this assumption was rooted in the realm of quantum physics . It had long been theorized that known  physical law is meaningless in the sub-atomic world . Microtubule webs , comprised of protein filaments a tenth of a millionth of an inch across with electrons inside , are significantly smaller than neural webs and are , in fact , sub-atomic . While he had no way of knowing why , Penrose did establish that these electrons vibrate in seemingly random sequence at seemingly random times . With this in mind , he theorized that , being sub-atomic , they could also EXIST IN SIMULTANEOUS STATES IN THE SAME SPACE ! Thereby allowing INFINITE STATES OF BEING WITHIN THE BRAIN ! The enormity of this concept , coupled with the patterned vibrations ,  led the physicist to believe the microtubules DID have a purpose . But what ?  Hameroff , after reading this avant-garde theorem , correlated it to ground-breaking research of his own …<br>
<br>
In the late 1970’s , certain anesthetics  were developed which rendered a patient unconscious  while allowing retainment of involuntary muscle reflex . In his research ,  Hameroff discovered  that the ONLY discernible physical reaction these drugs engendered was THE LOCKING  IN PLACE OF THE MICROTUBULE  ELECTRONS WITHIN THE BRAIN ! Thus  it came to pass that Hameroff and Penrose communicated and surmised CONCIOUSNESS IS INTEGRALLY LINKED TO  QUANTUM SPACE ! And they were right ! For it IS there , in the swirling  maelstrom of unending possibilities , that creative thought originates .  Thus is true consciousness separated from the mere rapidity of computer cross-referencing . ONLY in quantum space DO THINGS UNBORN EXIST !<br>
<br>
Naturally , it was only a matter of time before this knowledge sunk , disturbing the depths of mankind’s collective soul like a stone , causing evil to surface like some great white shark in the person of one August A. Augenthaler , Admiral , U.S. Navy . “The Bull” , as he was referred to by friend and foe alike , was a free thinker in his own perverse way. A lifelong military man , his imagination and capacity for carnage were both considerable and documented . August had chanced upon the “root of consciousness” theorem<br>
browsing rare , back issues of  the long defunct Omni magazine while comfortably stuffed into an oversized chair at the exclusive and secretive Warhawks Officers Club . With 100 year old scotch on side table and 200 uni-credit cigar in hand , he sifted  through the article until only truth remained . And that grain of truth , like irritating sand in the oyster , would engender the secretion of sick thoughts in “The Bulls” brilliant mind . Thoughts that would congeal into a black , hellish pearl , control and death it’s sole expression . For it was then that the Admiral conceptualized H.E.A.D. (hearing , equilibrium , aeration device) ; an  organo-techno brain , with a network of  giant microtubules communicating to a central web via audio , video analytical sensors . The advantages of this living compu-sensor would lie in it’s capacity to  make “creative” , “intelligent” decisions concerning the strategic deployment of weapons and manpower WITHOUT human guidance or programming . Further , since microtubules interact instantaneously through vibrationary energy , the organics could keep pace with the computronics.<br>
<br>
Never one to hesitate , “The Bull” focused , like the over-zealous laser he was , and quickly tracked down the top geneticists and computer hacks capable of the creationary deed . He then tried to finance the project through the usual , above-board channels . When funding was not forthcoming , the Admiral petitioned the usual below-board options . And when they failed him (due to the enormity of the endeavor and  it’s unusual premise) , Augenthaler took matters into his own capable hands . “Actually ,” August deduced “It’s better this way .” For , once he established a large , steady supply of drug money through maritime drug smuggling aboard Navy ships , “H.E.A.D.” would be his own private tool , beyond the stifling restraints imposed by less visionary souls . <br>
<br>
Almost inevitably over the next few years the Admiral masterminded the cash flow , built and staffed a secret base , purchased the state of the art equipment and relentlessly propelled the project forward with the power of his excessive-obsessive personality . Off he went , recklessly rocketing into his visions of a new age of control and death . Where it would all lead however , not even the mad Admirals hyper-fecund mind could imagine .<br>
<br>
And that’s where Summer Rain came in .<br>
<br>
<br>
2<br>
<br>
<br>
OUT OF THE BLUE<br>
<br>
<br>
Summer Rain was a beyond beautiful girl . Amazing as she looked however , it was her brilliantly creative mind which set her truly apart . A partial resume shows why … high school graduate at 9 , youngest women to receive a degree from MIT at twelve . She was already the senior microbiologist at “The Hive” , a classified government think tank , and had just turned 18 when Augenthaler’s operatives made arrangements for her to devote all her energies to creating a giant microtubule . Amazingly , she had done it , dubbing her new creation the “macrotubule” .<br>
<br>
One day shortly afterwards , she stood magnificent in her bedroom … freckled, dimpled , delectable , naked … sensually toweling beads of shower water from her glowing skin and absently pondering the second of the two macrotubules she had grown as it pulsed , a kaleidoscope of beautiful blue hues mesmerizing her from the organo-grow-tank (o.g.t.) which was it’s home . After throwing the baby-blue towel into a wicker hamper , she reclined trancedly upon her many-pillowed , lace-canopied bed with it’s matching white and dark blue swirled pillowcases and comforter . Muted candlelight and the electro-aqua flickering of the macrotubule shone on the robin’s egg shaded walls and lent a strangely hypnotic illumination to the scene . Leisurely , Summer scanned the room , her bright ,  jade eyes occasionally lingering … on ceramic dolls , displayed in a glass showcase , on the burnished sheen of her antique , cherry hutch , on the matching cherry bookcase where she vaguely registered the collected works of her favorite author , the legendary Edgar Allen Poe . Soon she was again staring , mesmerized and unfocused , into the thick , clear casing which held the macrotubule , where the wild weird clime of quantum space flickered endless possibilities simultaneously . The giant electron within was EVERYTHING at once and , since even Summer’s brilliant mind was constrained by the limited range of intellect and sensory capacities , she was unable to decode the phenomena . Instead she saw only the the ever-shimmering, ever-shifting, ever-morphing sapphire flux . <br>
The gorgeous girls formidable mind , influenced and acted upon by the unfathomable multiplied , drifted detachedly deeper into the source of all consciousness . As a creative genius , she was a genetically powerful interface with quantum space . Poe still crept , like a black cat , through the innermost corridors of her brain . Into her minds eye burst an image of remarkable clarity . It was Edgar Allen , at work on the Raven , quilled pen in hand , superb verbal acuity at the height of it’s power , then …<br>
<br>
The image vanished , sudden as a popped  soap bubble .<br>
<br>
 Numbly , Summer was probing quantum space .  Deep into bottomless oceans of her mind she submerged , returning to places where she had gleaned incredible breakthroughs and beyond . For now her own extraordinary quantum awareness was being powerfully , dramatically enhanced by the giant , artificially engineered macrotubule glimmering nearby . Dreamily adrift in unreal reality , the beauty erroneously assumed she was asleep . In fact , she was hurtling effortlessly into all which ever was or ever will be (infinite perspectives , dimensions , possibilities) . It seemed so natural to be multi-reality mobile and racing    to a rendezvous with another great source of quantum energy , Poe . Into and through a phantasmagoric landscape she “flew” … swept along as swirling colors , shapes , smells , sensations , ideas , thing imaginable and unimaginable splashed and burst from every perspective , conceivable and inconceivable … disintegration the ONLY constant against a deep-blue background which served as canvass for the ultimate art , EVERYTHING .<br>
<br>
Her body retained it’s general shape and sensibilities , albeit gossamer and wispy and sheathed in an aqua-energy aura . She could “feel” things with this personal power field , but the information was so fresh and unique it could not yet be completely  decoded by her consciousness . Summer could “see” Edgar Allen now , very small , as though at great distance . He too was wraithlike in this realm , yet there was no mistaking him . The high forehead ,  bottomless dark eyes , thin-lipped mouth , narrow chin ; all impossibly melded into a look both arrogant and vulnerable . His personal power aura was a dazzlingly bright emerald green , which turned the adjacent blue landscape purple where they met . In close now , she remained detached , even as her own power-field began a liquid-like mixing with Poe’s . Finally , she panicked , suddenly realizing this was no dream or fantasy ! This was real ! “My god!” she thought , “I must get back ! I don’t belong here !” Instinctively, frantically , she retreated from quantum space , leaving via the macrotubule , closing the microtubules in her mind to possibilities behind her …<br>
<br>
Almost instantly she was back in her room , and so was Poe .<br>

“NEXGEN” WRITING STYLE DEBUTS IN “RETURN OF POE”<br>
<br>
Oakland, Ca.- Virtual Publishing Group announces the impending Halloween Day release of “The Return of Poe”, an avant-garde, science-fiction/horror novel which debuts author Steven K. Mitchell’s “NEXGEN” <br>
writing style. The NEXGEN SYSTEM is a series of protocol clusters designed to “compress” written communication by accelerating and augmenting the flow of information to the brain. “The Return of Poe” is Mitchell’s first attempt to sustain this “compression” theorem in a novella-length story. <br>
<br>
“I have created the NEXGEN SYSTEM to allow the written word to keep  pace with the ever-accelerating, post-electronic world. By crushing communication into a succinct diamond, we are able to both speed-disseminate and elevate the flow of information to the brain. One pillar of my NEXGEN theorem is the freeing of the English language from sequencing constraints inherent in the conceptual protocol of nouns, verbs, etc. via five interlocking, symbiotic criteria that maintain clarity without said constraints. The other is the use of similar-sounding spurts of words to explode maximal, multiple, applicable images/sensations/revelations into the brain in chunks of rhyme. In “The Return of Poe” I utilize these techniques to compete with the myriad entertainment possibilities already extant, as well as those sure to proliferate in the future. I believe writing must evolve beyond traditional grammar, or suffer the consequences in the digital world, i.e. fewer and fewer writers and readers.”<br>
<br>
“The Return of Poe” is slated to debut at V.P.G. affiliate www.eBooks2Go.com on Halloween Day 2000 and showcases not only Mr. Mitchell’s theorem but a unique story-line involving the genetic anomaly re-incarnation of both Poe and Adolph Hitler in the year 2397, as well as a veritable cornucopia of futuring terms that remain contextually comprehensible and lend a true “visionary” feel to the entire project.              <br>

INFINITY OF EVIL<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Underwater <br>
<br>
Sharks <br>
swimming sudden death <br>
<br>
Whales <br>
benign behemoths dissapearing <br>
<br>
Mantas <br>
wide wings descending <br>
<br>
DEEPER... <br>
<br>
Where myriad sea-creatures coldly fight <br>
in a savage world FOREVER night <br>
<br>
And where HE strangely sits, unheeding <br>
with eternal heart still bleeding <br>
<br>
HIS troubled mind is dreaming <br>
pondering, planning, SCREAMING <br>
<br>
For evil days, soon to come <br>
when blood and tears will run <br>
<br>
and the mortals dwelling above <br>
who stain the ground as scum <br>
<br>
will satiate the growing anger <br>
in HIM who hates FOREVER <br>
<br>
Other times HE can remember <br>
When with Gabriel HE was a member <br>
<br>
of the shining, winged brigade <br>
Serving GOD, who all things made <br>
<br>
Knowing GOD MUST be obeyed <br>
Yet, HE was not afraid <br>
<br>
So magnificent was his being <br>
drunk with power, he was reeling <br>
<br>
from his deepest soul revealing <br>
foul dreams of glory stealing <br>
<br>
GOD read HIM as an open book <br>
and all dimensions infinite shook <br>
<br>
For the wrath of GOD is terrible to behold <br>
Righteous vengeance the bringer of pain and woe <br>
<br>
GOD'S hand entered HIS immortal soul <br>
then twisted proud spirit from angel to mole <br>
<br>
creating a mockery of the BETRAYER'S goal <br>
by leaving HIM king of a forsaken hole <br>
<br>
To rule an infinity of perverted dreams <br>
forever in filth and disease <br>
<br>
Placed far from the gleaming gates <br>
in an endless trap, with no escape <br>
<br>
Worlds of thinking creatures in HIS reach <br>
who willingly into unholy flames leap <br>
<br>
For ALL in this life-cycle are flawed <br>
Dregs in the handwork of GOD <br>
<br>
HE is now their master <br>
and HE contemplates disaster <br>
<br>
for the beings of one small, sodden planet <br>
named Earth by those who span it <br>
<br>
Insignifigant animals with vicous hearts <br>
evil and confusion the sum of their parts <br>
<br>
Vainly thinking they possess real power <br>
Crudely destroying beasts and flowers <br>
<br>
All good in this realm eventually sours <br>
Moments of peace can be measured in hours <br>
<br>
Yet, NOW comes the time of true insanity <br>
when HE mercilessly destroys humanity <br>
<br>
Pronouncing a death sentence <br>
forever repeated as human's achieve sentience... <br>
<br>
HE rises now <br>
from the bottom of the sea <br>
<br>
anticipating destruction <br>
with perverse glee <br>
<br>
For what is to be <br>
ALWAYS will be <br>
<br>
and from this reality <br>
HE will NEVER be free <br>
<br>
So begins the task at hand <br>
The murder of each women, child and man <br>
<br>
Mercy plays no part in the scheme <br>
for SATAN is the stuff of nightmares <br>
<br>
not dreams... <br>
<br>
<br>
