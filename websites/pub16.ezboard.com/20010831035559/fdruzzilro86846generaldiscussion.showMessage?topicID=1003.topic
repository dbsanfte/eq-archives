<br>
My account was not transferred, it was donated. Donated to someone who I feel would continue my efforts to make the EverQuest community a better place.<br>
<br>
Do not allow abuse and misuse of account transferral to render you unable to see that there are still good people trying to do good things, and are often in the shadow of the actions of those with questionable intent.<br>
<br>
I am not asking you to condone my choice. I am asking you to allow me the right to express and explain my choice to the people that it will affect.<br>
<br>
More likely than not, you've met or come across someone in your time who was not the original owner of their account, or maybe came into their account by unusual means. If you had formed any type of relationship with this person, I doubt you would say &quot;I do not condone your actions&quot; and cut off all relations with them.<br>
<br>
Is what I've done wrong? In the respect of the EULA, yes. However, that agreement was written on the basis that people would try to buy, sell, pirate, and other such things to accounts, and is a means of deterring them from doing so. I am a mature individual making a mature decision, and though the EULA may say what I am doing is wrong, it is a positive choice I've made for the good of the community.<br>
<br>
What I ask of you, the moderation and administration of this message board, is to allow me to freely express and explain the choice that I have made. If you would read the thread entitled &quot;Xantess,&quot; you will see that I have a great many friends in this game. I feel that it is my right, and duty, to inform them of why my character will be online, and it will not be I who is playing it.<br>
<br>
Several months ago, my account was hacked. I lost everything that I owned, was restored, but without a single piece of equipment. I fought tooth and nail, day and night, to earn every single item that I've ever had since. The character I've built is of great power, both in ability, and reputation. By events in real life, I am not and will not be able to continue to play that character. I have found someone who I firmly believe will play the character as I would desire it to be played - why am I not allowed to express that?<br>
<br>
I am entitled by the constitution of the United States of America, the country in which this message board is owned and operated, to the right of expressing myself. I respectfully request of you to allow me to do so.<br>
<br>
If you wish to disagree with my decision, I welcome you to do so, and will do my best to give you a mature and intelligent debate. If you fear action being taken against you by Sony, Verant, etc., you are protected by my invocation of constitutional right.<br>
<br>
My purpose here is not to cause problems, but to prevent them from happening. If you would like me to refrain from posting my thoughts, so be it, I shall do so. However, I cannot and will not respect unexplained deletion of my posts.<br>
<br>

I am attempting to make an informative statement to those that it would concern, because I have no alternative method of contacting that many people.<br>
<br>
I am not the enemy here. I am not trying to open the doors for your message board to become a second Ebay. I am trying to inform the Druzzil Ro community of a change that will affect the lives of any who have ever known me. Any who have ever grouped with me, dueled me, participated in one of my newbie events, so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
If any GM even were to read my post, that person would likely and logically read it due to an association with myself or my character. In the event of such, I truly doubt that he/she would take action.<br>
<br>
Again, I respectfully request of you to allow me to explain the status of my account to this community, through usage of your message board. This message board has been, for a long time, a gathering place of Druzzil's most familiar faces, faces I've known for quite a while. Allow me to express my decision, and the reasoning behind such, to them.<br>
<br>
If you doubt the quantity and level of relationships I have formed, I challenge you to make a post entitled &quot;post here if you have ever known and/or respected Xantess.&quot; I guarantee you'll have one of the longest threads this message board has ever seen.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>
