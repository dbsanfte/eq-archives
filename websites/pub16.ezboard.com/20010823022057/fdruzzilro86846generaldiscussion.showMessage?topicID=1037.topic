Except for rare incidinces, when I enter zones like Velketor and Sebilis I do not get a group unless there are no warrior's or other tanks LFG.  This is because us paladins are nerfed!  Our AC isnt as good as warriors, neither is our hitpoints, and our damage output is a joke! Of course, i do understand that our ac and hp shouldnt be as good as warriors, but we can't heal enough to be of much use to a group with heal, all we have going for us is stun, and sometimes our buffs when there is no cleric in the group.  (Ressurection at lvl 59 is good, and so is lay hands, but these have little effect in getting us into a group)<br>
And dont even get me started on our disciplines!<br>
Am I so wrong? Are paladins really useful and helpful in groups, am I just exaggerating?  Please show your input, I'd be more than happy to see it.<br>
<br>
All I'm saying is give us paladins something that would make a group want to have us, like crits on undead all the time instead of just with a disc (and this would mean more undead dungeons) or a paladin snare or something useful.<br>

That's mainly because I've shown them that I know how to play my paladin well.  I do run into groups that have the misconception that paladins cannot tank in exp groups.  As a paladin, I can:<br>
Stop runners with stun until a root or snare can be placed.<br>
If no snarers are in the group, I can stop fleeing mobs.  Stuns and root make for no runners getting very far.<br>
We have 3 stuns at high lvl that can be chain cast.<br>
Stun to interrupt casting, add bash and you get 4 options, usually 2 or 3 can be used before a spell gets off.<br>
Be the main tank in an exp group.  You'll never be in fear of dying unless your healer is OOM, and then you have LoH as a backup, and Divine Aura.<br>
My damage output with Fiery Defender is pretty high for exp groups.<br>
Taunt anyone who has aggro, except for maybe an overzealous caster who's been chain nuking.<br>
<br>
The key to a paladin is playing it to it's full ability.  Simply hitting auto attack and whacking away at the mob is not playing to full ability.  Use those stuns.  In an intentional taunt fest with another tank, the only one I can't taunt off of at will is a Shadowknight.<br>
<br>
You just need to be able to prove that you are capable of playing your class well, and people will recognize it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=urgas>Urgas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/9/01 1:04:46 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poor sad, nerfed Paladins</span><hr size=1> Well i am the least to say the paladin class is balanced, but in  a normal exp group pallys just own.<br>
We can fill teh role as main tank easy, we can fill the slot as backup healer we can really do alot.<br>
The only time i feel not very usefull is highend raids, thats were the paladin is lacking anything that really adds to a raid beside mayeb divine strength.<br>

So Feirurr show these people how much you can do and how good you are.<br>

The other night, it was just myself and a pally.  Little more downtime, but not much and decent xp.   While you may not have the HP of a warrior, every heal you can get off is the equivalent to starting out with that many hp more, so it balances out pretty well, *plus* you can offset other differences with spells.<br>
<br>
I don't call it &quot;ownage&quot;, but I've got no problem with *anybody* opposite me (beit SK, Pal, War, Rng) that can take the hits and keep it taunted.  I am almost always in a pickup group and don't remember the last time I turned someone down for &quot;not being the right class&quot;.  A good group can compensate. <p><table>

<br>
its hard to show a group what you can do when you have jerks that say thinks like &quot;paladins just suck they dont do any damage... id take any other class over a paladin&quot; ...  and this comeing from a rog.....  <br>
<br>
the groups ive been in have told me that they would use a paladin as evenly as a warrior in a group (exp ) .... but thats after 5 hours of LFG ... and being passed over many times on a list.<br>
<br>
paladins need a defineing place in EQ or well always be unwanted.   the PoN MB has some suggestions that have been submitted to verrant, some are as crazy as wanting a freakin horse pet, some as common sence as all time crit on undead and a useable disc.  the new lvl 60 spell from SoL if it goes live is a 775hp 30ac buff (mini aego) that will either stack with aego and the like, or be self only and stack with aego and the like....  either way well be more wanted in raids...   also a 10sec stun that works on high lvl mobs (supposibly 55+ dragons and giants included)  but thats just in test and well have to see.  <br>
<br>
the mini aego (called worbidation or something stupid) will help define us as a mini cleric buffor (heck all other buff classes get a good raid buff clerics, shaman, druid, even rangers)  with SoL i think alot will change with our class (hopefully a offiensive and defensive disc)  and maby a upgraded atk modifier for 2hs.  <br>
<br>
heck if clerics can get group aego atleast give us a minibuff that costs alot of manna and a p-dot<br>

<br>
Chin up.<br>
<br>
What Herakles said is very true, not only for paladins but all the other classes that got dicked in the 50 to 60th level expansion. If you are not a warrior, enchanter, rogue, cleric, monk, then when you get in 6 man XP groups you really need to have your stuff wired tight and get 100% out of your class. To show them you know how to really play your class and be beneficial to the group.<br>
<br>
Sad fact is the kunark expansion radically changed the game, and how a lot of classes are viewed....and a lot of people have suffered because of it. Brad McQuaid just now got around to admitting they fooked up (check his last castersrealm interview). At least they know of the mistake they made in having 14 classes but only several really needed roles post 50th. Comforting, /bonk.<br>
<br>
So anyways if you are not one of the lucky specialist classes then yes you have to hustle to prove your worth, and your playing skill rep will mean a lot.<br>

SKs, druids, necros, mages, rangers etc they all are useful in a 6 man group. The last 10 levels of EQ were made to be a slow agonizing death crawl. Since they are like that people play even harder to get through them and have much less tolerance for anything that isnt THE most efficient, most XP driving effort they can get. Its sad, it has kind of taken the soul out of the game IMO.. Maybe if Verant would just jack everyone's character to 60th a lot of these class woes would go away, since XP is no longer an issue? Everyone could get back to playing EQ for fun, perhaps?<br>

<br>
And no, this doesn't just mean use your stun, and it doesn't just mean heal in downtime, and it doesn't just mean any one thing.  It means that every group is different, and quite frankly, Paladins are capable of filling a LOT of holes in the group, as long as your group knows what you are doing and what role you are filling.<br>
<br>
The other problem is that there are so many pl'd/ebayed idiots in the game, that they don't have a clue how to play their characters, much less someone else's.  If you're grouped with a moron that thinks his entire job is to stand/cast/sit/repeat, how do you think he's going to have a clue what another class brings to the table?<br>
<br>
So the perception is, among the young and young at brain, that paladins are weak warriors with weak heals and weak buffs.  And that perception has been around since before kunark came out.  Remember that the next time you're in a group and the only thing you're doing is trying to deal melee damage, cast a few stuns, and maybe throw out some heals and buffs, you are part of the problem, not the solution.<br>
<br>
And by the way, i don't want a horse as a pet, i want a squire =).  And give him a hump on his back and a bad eye.  And cool pet names like Fetchit, or Diesforyou, that would make me grin. <p>Phread

<br>
When an exp group is formed, everyone's looking for max kills, min time.. that = max exp, min time..<br>
<br>
Honestly, I'm part of the problem your all talkin of above, nothing personal.. but when I go for exp I like a group of the following...<br>
<br>
1.) Best group scenario...<br>
Warrior, Rogue, Monk, Cleric, Enchanter, Shaman<br>
2.) Only acceptable (to me) substitutions.<br>
Monk - Ranger *With epics*<br>
Shaman - Wizard, Druid.. in such case an evac is needed or slows are easily managed by enchanter.<br>
<br>
Past that, really I don't see room for others in a hardcore exp group.. And in the rat-race to 60, that's all peeps wanna be involved in.<br>
<br>
The only case I go outside of this, is for a guild pally, if we don't have a monk or epic ranger.<br>
<br>
I have what I see as a realistic question for all you pally's though, wth any of you use 1hs? What's the purpose, majority of the time you're casting for hard aggro and peggin taunt if main tank, and whatever AC you pick up on a shield isn't goin to outweigh the damage you'll do with 2hs, so if anyone can elighten me, pls do... Same with SK, just never seen the idea behind it.. It just amazes me seeing someone pick up a sbs+noct and puttin a nice DN lance or axe in ur backpacks..<br>

I mean a ranger wielding lets say a lupine dagger and a dragon horn yak or WS, or lam combo will be dealing as much damage as your warrior, plus if he wants to toss out an additional DD or two per fight he will be outdamaging the warrior....not to mention snaring, damage shielding, call of earth and strength of nature buffing, possible chloroplasting (if hes 55th+), and topping off heals, etc...I understand the damage output increase that our epics brings to the table, but honestly a 53+ ranger without epics is still a capable addition. I think it really all boils down to how well you play your class.<br>
<br>
Sometimes unless its several very specific areas, such as juggs/reets....WHY have a warrior in a 6 man XP group? A shadowknight or paladin can taunt as well or better, can tank the stuff you will be fighting in an XP group usually, they bring other spells, skills to the table and your rangers, monks, and rogues are going to still be the damage dealers anyways. I know thats kind of an extreme view but honestly why have a warrior in a 6 man XP group? Seems an argument could be made that paladins and shadowknights make better additions in that regards.<br>
<br>
I think the whole notion of who brings what to the table, you must have this class, etc etc is BS. There are some situations that you must have an enchanter and maybe a cleric but thats as far I am willing to go on announcing who IS required (ps. Im only talking about 6 man groups here...heh not raids, etc) The most important factor is player skill. I have seen very &quot;goofy&quot; groups do a heck of a lot more with less...and it all boiled down to skill.<br>

Here an example, group of 6 at upper dogs in vl.<br>
All dogs dead and a small break before respawn...and thats with me a Paladin in the group add to this 2 shammys chanter monk mage.<br>
So what more can you get with other people in the group? can exp be even better? <br>
Sometimes people amaze me, how can so many get so high lvl without a clue?<br>
<br>
Urgas Ironfeet<br>
Crusader<br>

<br>
oh and yeah mostly it is better to go 2h but if you are main tank as a paladin and dont have your epic it is better to go with 1h and shield.<br>

<br>
(SoM is 16/27 with 50dd stun proc)<br>
<br>
at lvl 56 good 2hs dont fall from the sky (and being no one cares about palidans there not normaly the highest on everyones &quot;to get list&quot; on raids)  so you have to go with whats cheap or easy to find ... normaly a 30/40 2hs is a good choice (dam/del is 1.25) .. not a huge diference from 1.69<br>
<br>
add in the extra ac/saves ... and damage done from bash (not much at all ... but always a factor in a fight with a caster mob that CH/gates) and id go with a fast 1hs (with 50dd stun proc) and a good sv shield.  <br>
<br>
normaly im either main tank or #2 tank and then most of what i do is stuns anyway.   <br>
<br>
1 stun (6sec) is 3-8 rounds of mobs hits .....  take 10-15 stuns a fight and youve reduced the damage taken to main tank by about 75-80%.   saveing your cleric manna and makeing crowd controll much easier, besides ... were the least missed damage dealing class out there. like they will miss my damage if im stunning.<br>
<br>
or if im main tank ill just hit and bash (sword procing 50dd stun) is also a good combo.  <br>
<br>
in upper dogs the diference between ac and sv is alot (being nuked for 25 when others are nuked for 150-250 makes a huge diference)   and being able to bash a caster from healing/gateing/nukeing most of the time.<br>
<br>
we all have our purpose in groups, a paladin as of now seems to be to prevent damage more than deal it out, if you can use that instead of work agenst it groups go much smoother. <p>Jgable Ivonavitch 56 Knight of Dro

If your having trouble finding one it is time to find something else to do or goto a new zone to try. There have been MANY times I have ooced &quot;Cleric lfg&quot; and waited near and hour or more for one or never did get one and left for elsewhere. It happens to everyone and its not cause they don't want you but rather because there already enough of your class atm or the zone is already overpopulated. Or underpopulated can also be troublesome. If a small group has come to a zone for a purpose they might not want to add an outsider or maybe they are just soloing. Most people and groups I talk with don't say ewww nope don't want that class. Have to keep in mind also though that in places like Sebilis group composition is important and therefore if a starting group already has tank slots filled then they are unlikely to add another in favor over a healer or evacer/snarer or chanter etc. <br>
<br>
Anyway most times it simply comes down to need and demand not what class is better than another.<br>

<br>
And like other people have mentioned, how well you play your class makes the biggest difference.  I'd take a lower level pally that knows how to play her class over a higher level warrior that was an idjit anyday. <p>--------------------------------------------------<BR>

They are worthless in all situations except when you need a DS wh*re or a lamb.  Low AC/HP compared to warriors, less taunt than SK's, less damage than all other melee classes (except maybe bards - which is questionable), mediocre spells, did I mention the worst damage output of any melee class?  They are ok on raids I guess, extra melee damage, even if very little, self suffecient, and most importantly, DS whorage!  I never want a paladin in my exp groups tho.  Not having dual wield = poor damage output.  Poor damage output = takes longer to kill stuff.  Takes longer to kill stuff = killing less stuff.  Killing less stuff = getting less exp.<br>
<br>
Oh, and BTW, regarding the &quot;Cry me a river, I'm a ranger&quot; comment.  Rangers own.  Damage output lying in between that of a warrior and a rogue (comparable to monks with the proper gear), great discs (trueshot and weaponshield), exceptional buffs (CoP, SoN, CoE), utility spells (snare, chloroplast, SoW, invis, etc) etc etc.  They are an asset to any raid or exp group IMO. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ujohng4you.showPublicProfile?language=EN>johng4you</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/anim_1.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/12/01 3:01:39 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.geocities.com/jgablepali/newequp1.JPG WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Poor sad, nerfed Paladins</span><hr size=1> dumplinger ... either your a moron or havent grouped with a good paladin ....  well have to see which is true <p>Jgable Ivonavitch 56 Knight of Dro
