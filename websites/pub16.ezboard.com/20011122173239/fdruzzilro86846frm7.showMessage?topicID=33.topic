Approching an Inn of some sort, Aelia is accosted by several creatures and fearing for her life, starts bounding over the trecherous dunes and prays that this mythical South Ro is close.<br>
<br>
As she runs, a few more join in the hunt, now she is scared, and quite wounded, thinking to herself she makes a wish that her beloved elder was here once more to guide her.  Suddenly, without warning, her speed increases and she is able to outrun these pursuers and makes it to the territory of South Ro.  Sitting down on the otherside, practicing her bind wound skill, she looks at the strange icon in her window.  What could this be, she wonders.  Quite an astonishing gift it is, I wish I could thank the person that bestowed this upon me.<br>
<br>
Aelia is then greeted by a young wood elf that kindly asks if she is ok and if she needs any assistance.  Braelan offers to take her to any place it is that she wishes.  Aelia, shocked by the turn of recent events declines the offer and chooses to brave this new land by herself.  The wood elf departs in some sort of portal and vanishes from her sight.<br>
<br>
Pondering her next move, Aelia reaches into her packs and finds the gift she was given before her mentor and friend vanished.  Removing the furs that protect it, she discovers a mystical tome.  This tome is called Book Of Dark Bindings.  Staring at it for a long time, Aelia wonders what it possibly could be for.  Then she notices a small insription in the book: &quot;With this book, you can create wonders.&quot;  What could this mean?  Is this some sort of quest?  A trial?  What do I do with it, Aelia wonders.<br>
<br>
Putting the book back into her packs, she sets off across the arid, sandy desert.  Bathed in extreme heat, Aelia steps lightly across the sandy dunes in search of her next destination.  She marvels in awe at the charaters with dual names as they battle huge creatures, one was named Ancient Cyclops.  Aelia makes a note to ask her mentor about the purpose of this creature as his appearance sent the whole zone into an uproar.  Appearing on the horizon, Aelia spies a pyramid like structure just like the one in Nekulos Forest, as she nears closer to the structure, she sees a group of people sitting up top.  Feeling brave and sure of herself, Aelia inquires as to where these people are journying.  &quot;To the Plane of Hate&quot; they respond. &quot;Good luck to you!&quot; Aelia says and politely asks where she may find the entrance to the swamp.<br>
<br>
An elder decends from the structure and offers to guilde the young elf to the next part of her journey.  Aelia offers to pay her guide, but they refuse and vanish in a cloud of smoke.  In awe of all she has seen today, she opens her journal and makes a small note about the kindness of this person.<br>
<br>
As she approches the gorge which leads to the swamp, she notices a strange glow to her left, turning she looks face to face with her elder.  Appearing out of thin air, he greets her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Did you look at your gift young one?&quot;  he asks.  Yes, I did kind one.  But what is it for?  What possibly could I use this for?  &quot;As you grow older, you will learn my child.  Where are you headed so soon?  Ye have grown into quite the formidable necromancer, soon you will be ready for the challenges of the other continents.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I am headed across this land, unsure where to go, I've gained 3 levels since you saw me last.  Where should I hunt at my level lord? Aelia asks.  He responds &quot;You could journey far into the lands of the Iksar and Kunark or you could stay and venture into the realm of the Aviak.  Your choice child.<br>
<br>
I have to tell you about all of the maginificent things I have seen!  Such kindness from people, it's been simply facinating!  &quot;Follow me young one.  I will show you around this new area you are in and take you to a place called Guk and Grobb.&quot; T'lzan responds.<br>
<br>
Gathering up her things, she ventures off with T'Lzan and they discuss the events as they journey off to these places Aelia has never seen or heard of. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulordofthekargat.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lord Of The Kargat</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/2/01 12:06:51 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://server3002.freeyellow.com/mellifleur/head.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Perilous Thoughts</span><hr size=1> All the time this young child of darkness walks the lands and scouts prey ...she had a very small clue she was being watched...watched by the dark minions that she very creates...and ...another set of deep dark recess lays its cold gaze upon her....she realizes this not ...but continues on her merriful cursed journey in gaining items and experience from her slayings...<br>
<br>
She never realizes the mysterious gaze set upon her ....<br>
<br>
The dark minon ...watches..nameless to all but himself ..he gazes at the soul ..watching her ...as he was instructed to do by his dark majesty.<br>
<br>
The cold thoughts of this overlord dwell into reason as he continues to try and keep an eye on her.<br>
<br>
&quot; why am i watching this wretched beast ....she is nothing ..i can dispatch of her with just a mere thought and a small command to Kikaneb ...his tedious work aggrovates me .....but you taught me well father...for i must hate you as i hate my own ....and you bore me ....as does the silly wench....&quot;<br>
<br>
Staring at the incessant trollop ...as she crosses the barren waste of the lands only known as Dread....he to fights of beasts as only to occupy his time...as he encircles a Drachnid ....she slips away ......little to his knowledge ....after the battle with this drachnid, which went quite easily ....he turns to look at her...but he has lost her !...and the snow has come down ever so thicker ....he cannotsee her tracks or anything ..distraught and understanding his majesty's wrath ....he opens a eclipsing portal ....and returns unto his masters citadel .....waiting for his punishment ..and accepting it with a Hate of him so deep only his majesty ebbs more.<br>
<br>
Using the powers of the dead man and the levitation it brings ..it walks through the swarms of the Kurikei and Clerics of Innoruuk like they were emaningless spittle.....coming to his Masters throne room ...he is taken aback by the sight !....the shock of what his deep set eyes reveal cause him to lose concentration and he falls to the floor as his floating is broken......he steps forward into the room ......<br>
