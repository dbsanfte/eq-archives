I have been in contact with the Gods, the Nephilim. They have instructed me to start a new religion. These beings, the Gods, are the owners of the flying saucers. They have told me that the world as you know it will soon end. I know this all sounds ridiculous but I believe I have enough proof here to confirm my contact with the Gods.<br>
<br>
   For those not familiar with the Gods I suggest reading the books of Zecharia Sitchin and William Bramley which go in to great detail about the Gods. The ancient astronaut theory is that many years ago aliens from another world came to this planet and created humanity and influenced its culture and civilization. These authors point to evidence in ancient texts and artifacts as proof of ancient alien visitation. <br>
<br>
The aliens are still here, but are hidden.<br>
<br>
Now I know you think I'm mental or trying to fool you, but I have proof that I have been in contact with the Gods...<br>

For instance, I alone am aware that the Parapsychology Journal has the wrong year on it. I have found it best to analyze what I recieve, rather than take it at face value. I think you, me andall people must maintain open minds. I could believe myself to somehow be elivated above cmmon perception. I think it would be delusional. I wouldn't be surprised if some superior being would find it amusing for me to do so. To me, if your popular enough, people will go along with anything you say. If you're popular enough, people will go along with this. It won't mean any more than that either way. God among men is a very strong statement. It is your game or their game, irregardless of what you have to back it up. You're not a God and people aren't potential Gods. Thats another life form. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulisaaugustine.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lisa augustine</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/6/02 9:31:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://communities.msn.com/_Secure/0KwAAAPkOlT6aDP5jYIGCABrsT6Wt6Hg!E78Pt0RZgWkii12G9jpLo4Mla852faCRXJjE5QlrPAw/Earth.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was abducted by aliens - a most atypical abduction</span><hr size=1> Yes there are aliens- and they probably are living here  on this Earth... but  even though they want us to consider them Gods, they arent' God's.      They are just superior intelligent creations-- also created by the One True God who created us.<br>
<br>
Yes, they are probably much more advanced than we humans are--  but don't let them fool you!   they don't want humans to focus on God..    I wouldn't doubt that they even know about God's existance but have rebelled against Him.<br>
<br>
I believe that you have been abducted... just pray that God will show you the truth about them.<br>
<br>
I do believe the World will end- but this planet won't be destroyed.    Just all the politics and World System on this planet will be changed-  and it will be from Jesus Christ- not aliens. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulhr2000.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LHR 2000</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/8/02 8:22:41 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=131.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://upload.turbosport.co.uk/gallery3/2002488415444597.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: I was abducted by aliens - a most atypical abduction</span><hr size=1> Yes it is a stupid idea that this world will last forever. 5 billion years from now our sun will explode. and our universe is expanding as well.

<br>
   And who knows when this reality will end. Perhaps 5 billion years, perhaps tomorrow. Perhaps this entire reality is nothing more than a virtual reality. It might all just be a game. It's possible. Anything is possible.<br>
<br>
   &quot;God among men&quot; is what he said to me. Omira, a God, said, &quot;you are a god among men&quot;. The statement puzzled me at first and I can't get that moment - those words - out of my mind.<br>
<br>
   And these &quot;Gods&quot; don't believe in any GOD that created the Universe. I don't know if all Gods think this. Perhaps the ones I communicated with were unlike most Gods. <br>
<br>
   It's all very weird, yet interesting. At least I wasn't probed...it could've been much worse...<br>

He tells of their first encounter in a feild upon his farm. They spoke at great length. After that, the craft returned on a regular basis. And the farmer, and His celestial friend would sit under a tree upon the farm and speak for ours on end. The farmer has written over 4000 pages of transcript of what the alien commander related to him and their discussions in general. the most significant of which, The alien being told the farmer, that of all the worlds they had visited, and all the civilizations they had observed; Humanity was they only one technologically advanced enough to destroy themselve, yet not spiritually advanced enough to prevent it. Pretty profound thought. We should all consider this statement and reflect upon it. As, there will be a time soon, when our mutual cooperation will be required to prevent our own demise.<br>
     In 1998, Peter Jennings of ABC nightly news reported that a rogue asteroid hed been discovered. And that it was on a collosion course with earth.  He continued by saying that scientists had calculated that it would reach earth in the year 2028. August I believe was the estimate. That was the only such report of its kind. It was never mentioned after that. Government intervention, would be my assumtion. I have a college friend, who wrote a paper on the Philidelphia Experiment (The US Navy's Experiments into Time Travel) which occured shortly after WWII. In his research, He found that the Navy had sent its people over 3000 years into the future. if you are familar with the Philidelphia Experiment, you know that many didnt survive the emperiment. Survivors speak of the beings of that time, and how they were told of Earth altering changes which occured in the year 2028. <br>
    We have roughly a 1/4 century to pull together. To save ourselves from ourselves, then from the destiny which bears down upon us.  We are not several governments, or religious factions, or any other groups of people squabbling over petty differences. It is time for those of us the world over, to stand up in one voice and say, we are one People; We are Mankind, We are Humanity. This is OUR Earth, and this is OUR home, and we will not tolerate this any longer. We must force our Government and Religious leaders to end the insanity. To end the conflicts, and set aside the differences. Then, and Only then, can we as a People move forward and take our place among our celestial brethren. <br>

A little tidbit of useless knowledge. Right now, as we sit here reading on EZboard, there is a moon of Jupiter undergoing the same primordial changes which brought forth life on Earth. <br>
<br>
Also, recent photogtraphs from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal new suns, planets and entire solar systems being formed from cosmic dust right now. Our universe is ever changing, ever growing. Life will continue to renew itself. If only we, as a species could abolish the negative and focus our positive energies. Then perhaps WE too could continue also. We could move forward to these new beginnings and never worry about humanity ceasing to be.  <br>
<br>
Alas. Genocide is our greatest threat. How can we save ourselves from an exploding sun, or a rogue asteroid, or any other number of doomsday possibilities; if we can't even save us from ourselves?<br>

This is the part of the site I like the best - <br>
<br>
&quot;HOW TO JOIN<br>
<br>
       If you join me you will live, so the Gods tell me. Your body might die but your soul will be protected and live on. The Gods want to save the smartest.<br>
<br>
       The question is how do the Gods know that you truly believe I am preaching the truth? The Gods only want to save the most worthy. It is not enough for you to simply put your name on a list of believers. Perhaps you join every religion looking for salvation.<br>
<br>
       The only way to prove this is if you give to me something which you value. You must give me money, for several reasons:<br>
<br>
              1) you can't give me your lovers, family or friends as slavery is illegal <br>
<br>
              2) we all know you value money <br>
<br>
              3) this will make me look like a con-man, a charlatan<br>
<br>
<br>
       (NOTE: For now, do not send or give me money. I will update the site when donations will be accepted.<br>
<br>
       The Gods said I could save any 50 Yakies of my choosing so anyone that comes to Indianapolis to seek me out at my address will be tagged (protected). Such a journey is proof enough of your conviction for me. <br>
<br>
       As I have stated many times previously I make no claims that anyone who joins will become immortal, wealthy or will meet the Gods. All these claims are from the Gods. I can guarantee teaching of higher teachings as they have already been taught to me.<br>
<br>
       I'm only the messenger.)<br>
<br>
<br>
       You have to ask yourself: Is it a con or is it real? Have I given enough evidence or not?<br>
       This is the ultimate test.<br>
<br>
       Only those possessing the greatest intelligence will pass this ultimate intelligence test. You must know:<br>
<br>
              a) the Gods exist<br>
<br>
              b) what I preach is from the Gods<br>
<br>
<br>
       Most people don’t even believe that UFOs are alien technology, only a few are willing to have open minds to conceive of a hidden reality possibly existing.<br>
<br>
       The Gods have told me that there will be a new hierarchy. In the olden days Demigods (part God, part Yaki) ruled over men because what better people to rule Yakies for the Gods then those which were both. But the human population is uneven with its divine genes. Some Yakies are more Godlike than others. But only the divine genes relating to intelligence are what the Gods care about. <br>
<br>
<br>
WILLS ARE WORTHLESS<br>
<br>
       Giving your money to me once you die shows the Gods nothing. For once you are dead you have no use of money. The money will be accepted but you will not. Your soul will die. You can only be saved while alive.<br>
<br>
<br>
COME TO INDIANAPOLIS<br>
<br>
       As of right now followers are to come to Indianapolis, where I am. You must move here. You must live here in Indianapolis. I haven't been told the reason but I imagine it to be some custom. Perhaps it's necessary I see the first followers in person.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Man oh man, what a kid won't do to sucker people out of money. Yes you are a con man, and yes you are a charlaton. BTW, what is your address for the pilgrimage? Nice try at beginning your own cult, but really - I think it SUCKS.<br>

<br>
My people had a very old legend about our people being brought to this world from another [fact], other legends state that we have been aided by &quot;aliens&quot; from time to time especially during periods of world disasters - like the immersion of our homeland beneath the ocean.<br>
<br>
I have never heard of a threat to human life by these &quot;Gods&quot;, or the end of the world theory.  Maybe they meant to say - the end of the world AS YOU KNOW IT, meaning a new political or spiritual outlook.<br>
<br>
Our legends state that they have always had a positive influence and remain in the background rather than 'lording it over' us.<br>
<br>
