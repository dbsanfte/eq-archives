I don't know if it will shed any light on what you experienced, but it may help calms any fears.<br><br>Always,<br>Debbie<br><br>***<br>For many, a full blown manifestation of the Angel of Death, or any spiritual entity for that matter, is either a rare or shocking occurrence. Depending upon each individual's understandings, beliefs or fears, a manifestation can severely alter one's path for the better, or worse. Many people are simply not &quot;ready&quot;, whether emotionally or psychically to deal with a total manifestation, particularly of the Death entity, and He is acutely aware of this. Therefore, manifestation is often preceded by a series of precursive oddities.<br><br>Some of the more universal preludes to any spiritual manifestation include, flashing pin-points of light that look very much like twinkling, distant stars. This phenomenon is usually glimpsed as fleeting sparks out of the corner of one's eye and against the darkness of the room. These pin-points can be colourful, or simply white. Sometimes, not always, a specific colour can help identify the entity trying to materialize. This is often true in the case of the Angel of Death, whose precursive colour is often seen as a bright bluish-purple. Because these images are so often rapid-fire, colour may not be immediately registered from the eye to the brain. A flash of light is simply that. Some other foreplays include; momentary vertigo, or 'spinning' usually followed by either the flashing lights, or equally elusive 'black spots' that move rapidly across one's vision. Voices, music, odors and other sensory elements may also be present. This can assist in identifying the presence. Many people have reported familiar scents associated with a loved one that has passed on. Also, mysterious appearances of personal items associated with same. Poltergeist activity, bouts of de javu, and periods of &quot;slipping time&quot; are also prevalent.<br>The nearness of an imminent materialization can be measured much like the proximity of a storm can be determined by counting out the moments between a thunder clap and the strike of lightning. Applied to spiritual matters, count the time between the seeing of pin-point stars, and any immediately subsequent astral anomalies such as mentioned above. The shorter the time span between, the closer one is to a full blown manifestation. The form a particular manifestation assumes depends largely upon the receptivity of the viewer(s). Materialization may be no more than a cloud of trailing, grey &quot;smoke&quot;, or, it can be the total personification of an entity. How evolved the personification becomes is related both to how one views a specific entity, and the level of subconscious resistance, i.e., fear present. I know of numerous instances where total manifestation occurred but the immediate shock it engendered in the individual caused the apparition to withdraw as quickly as it came. If most spirits sense fear, they will quickly withdraw so as not to make their appearance synonymous with fear, (unless, in rare cases, where fear is their intention). Generally, spirits can tell what we are ready for and when. Although, sometimes they &quot;test&quot; our claim at readiness by literally saying, &quot;Here I am! Now what are you going to do?&quot;<br>There are some very strikingly unique precursors to Azrael's coming. Some are oddly on a strictly &quot;physical&quot; level, such as the sighting of a dead bird, or being witness (usually unintentional) to an animal or a person dying. The feeling of an unnatural chill, or as if one is &quot;out of time&quot; with one's own surroundings. There is an uncanny &quot;heaviness&quot; in the air and breathing is difficult. Some have described it as a &quot;smothering chill&quot;. It is often twilight, or dawn, (there is usually the symbolism of a threshold involved, whether it be a perceived, or actual threshold). A strange electricity runs through the body, (many of these sensations are often present in other &quot;higher&quot; entity personifications). Gradually, patches of darkness appear to swallow the scenery and then grow to take on form. A personification of Death is almost always the darkest thing in view, almost like a cut-out in the landscape. Even against the darkness in a dark room, He is like a black hole, pulling in any light around Him until all that remains is a faint bluish-purple aura to outline His form.<br><br>No matter one's experience with spirit manifestation. Whether it be great or lacking. Research shows that a manifestation of the Angel of Death is somehow always immediately recognized as such, regardless of the specific form It may take. Somewhere deep in every mortal's consciousness is an innate memory of what it feels like to be in the presence of Death. The instinctual knowing that a specific entity is indeed, Death, is as primal as the drive to survive. His energy is a part of all human consciousness. The part of discarnate memory never fully washed away in the River of Forgetfulness. <br><br><!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/s/some_common_precursors_to_manifestation.html">www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/s/some_common_precursors_to_manifestation.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 3509<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(1/21/02 8:36:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=6>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: angel of death</span><hr size=1> Urxie, that is a fascinating read.

I just said i doubt it was the real Angel of Death.<br><br><br><br>The way you decribed him seems to be the more tradtional view of what the Angel of Death SHOULD look like. It's something that is passed down. The Angel of Death is Angel, Im sure he looks like any other Angel. Not some black figure with a Sctyhe that runs around takeing peoples souls and scareing others he come on. <br><br><br>The Angel of Death is a good guy believe it or not. He does gods will, if it be punishing people who go against his will. Your aideing the souls of believers towards heaven. He wouldn't clad himself in symbols of evil like black hoods and other such things. That is if has ever taken flesh form like other angels have. <br><br><br>A spirt claiming to be something like the angel of death isn't uncommon. In the possesion case that &quot;The Exoricst&quot; was based on the spirt carved symbols like pitchforks and other symbols of the devil on the possed boy. But these symbols weren't associated with the devil in acient times. They were more symbols for things they devil did what we could understand. So I doubt this boy was possed by the Devil, reguardless if the spirt said it was. It's as easy for a ghost to lie then it is for us to lie. I could die and become a ghost and say I was the ghost of Bill Gates. Doesn't make it true. <br><br><br>I don't know what you say.....Could have been a ghost. In fact a medival Excutioner might consider himself &quot;Death&quot; cause it was his job to take peoples lives. Hell it could have just been some crazy dude in a halloween costume.  <br><br><br>Do I believe you saw the Angel of Death? No.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/useaghankai.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Seaghan Kai</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(4/24/02 12:52:40 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.comixtreme.com/Marvel/Ultimate%20Marvel/headshots/jackrussell.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: angel of death</span><hr size=1> I saw the a movie recently that had an interesting take on the Angel of Death.

I was awakened by someone softly touching my face with my pillow. I opened my eyes and there was someone on their knees next to my bed.<br>I was not asleep, I was not dreaming but they were not solid. <br>when I looked at him I was filled with a sense of sadness. I asked him who he was and he said &quot;I am the darkest death&quot;<br>with that I became very frightened and just as soon as he could sense my fear he disappeared<br>for the next two nights after that when I was sleeping, I could be in the middle of a dream about anything and I could see him walk by in the back ground of the dream.<br>When I was awake I felt like I was never alone. I felt like it was following me. I still feel that but not as strong or maybe I have just got used to it.<br>I lost my aunt and a friend both that same week after seeing him. <br>Many people have told me that's why I saw him and that he was the angel of death.<br>Honestly, I am not so sure about that. This happened back in November and to this day <br>I cant sleep with the lights off. I cant look in a mirror while walking past it without feeling like I am going to see him.<br>I have come to the conclusion that it is one of two things. One is I have lost my mind and I am seeing things. The other is based on what my first thought was when I saw him.<br>That first thought for some odd reason was of the Pneumonic Plague. Maybe because of the reference to &quot;the darkest death&quot;?<br>At this point I am hoping that I am insane because if I am not then this could possibly be a premonition or a warning of some kind. I can not shake the feeling. I simply cant get past what I saw .<br>If I had the money I would go to a shrink and get some good medication then no matter what it is I could be so stoned I wouldn't care. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showMessageRange?topicID=162.topic&start=21&stop=25>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showNextMessage?topicID=162.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=162.topic&index=20><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/images/addreply.jpeg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.emailToFriend?topicID=162.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.threadControl?topicID=162.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=162.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=162.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm71">Promote Your Board<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">Astrology<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm72">Staff Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesadministrationnoticeboard">Administrators Only<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm70">Recent Spam Posts</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> -
