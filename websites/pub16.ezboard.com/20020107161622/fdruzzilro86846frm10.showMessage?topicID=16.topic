Its actually a modification of Gordan Sinclair's 1973 Editorial.<br>
<br>
<br>
REpost of his original article<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;LET'S BE PERSONAL&quot; Broadcast June 5, 1973 CFRB, Toronto, Ontario<br>
<br>
Topic: &quot;The Americans&quot; <br>
<br>
The United States dollar took another pounding on German, French and British exchanges this morning, hitting the lowest point ever known in West Germany. It has declined there by 41% since 1971 and this Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least-appreciated people in all the earth. <br>
<br>
As long as sixty years ago, when I first started to read newspapers, I read of floods on the Yellow River and the Yangtse. Who rushed in with men and money to help? The Americans did. <br>
<br>
They have helped control floods on the Nile, the Amazon, the Ganges and the Niger. Today, the rich bottom land of the Misssissippi is under water and no foreign land has sent a dollar to help. Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy, were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts. None of those countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States. <br>
<br>
When the franc was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. <br>
<br>
When distant cities are hit by earthquakes, it is the United States that hurries into help... Managua Nicaragua is one of the most recent examples. So far this spring, 59 American communities have been flattened by tornadoes. Nobody has helped. <br>
<br>
The Marshall Plan .. the Truman Policy .. all pumped billions upon billions of dollars into discouraged countries. Now, newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent war-mongering Americans. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplanes. <br>
<br>
Come on... let's hear it! Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tristar or the Douglas 107? If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all international lines except Russia fly American planes? Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or women on the moon? <br>
<br>
You talk about Japanese technocracy and you get radios. You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy and you find men on the moon, not once, but several times ... and safely home again. You talk about scandals and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everyone to look at. Even the draft dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on our streets, most of them ... unless they are breaking Canadian laws .. are getting American dollars from Ma and Pa at home to spend here. <br>
<br>
When the Americans get out of this bind ... as they will... who could blame them if they said 'the hell with the rest of the world'. Let someone else buy the Israel bonds, Let someone else build or repair foreign dams or design foreign buildings that won't shake apart in earthquakes. <br>
<br>
When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still broke. I can name to you 5,000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble. <br>
<br>
Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake. <br>
<br>
Our neighbours have faced it alone and I am one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them kicked around. They will come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles. <br>
<br>
I hope Canada is not one of these. But there are many smug, self-righteous Canadians. And finally, the American Red Cross was told at its 48th Annual meeting in New Orleans this morning that it was broke. <br>
<br>
This year's disasters .. with the year less than half-over… has taken it all and nobody...but nobody... has helped. <br>

<br>
I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this, but just knowing that we have other countries' support in our plan for retaliation is payment enough to me.  When I heard that NATO passed Article Five it brought a tear to my eye.<br>

Let Tuesday's transgressions never be forgotten.<br>

I don't want anything that will lead to war or the deaths of thousands more innocent people (Afghanis celebrating does not make them guilty).<br>
<br>
I am, however, very much in favour of having a united front against terrorism and bringing the men that did this to justice. <p><center><embed src=http://www.geocities.com/lannellalegerdemain/lannellasig.swf width=400 height=40 play=true loop=true quality=high></embed></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukokuten.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kokuten</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.tertiary.net/Portrait_Small.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/13/01 8:35:20 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/74977 WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ..</span><hr size=1> While I'm not going to attack you for holding an opinion, I am going to state that I feel that the only way we can make clear that we are not to be attacked in this manner is to react with overwhelming force in an incredibly swift manner. <br>

I do appreciate, also, that my view is cockeyed and would not work on a world-policy level. This is why I do not make world policy decisions. <p>---

However the problem I see with a more laid back, let justice only prevail, etc. approach, is no example will be set. Let's make a point to all these sick bastards that the US is not to be screwed with.  I've helped pay for how ever many 1000's of warheads we got, lets use em already, and btw, ya people celebrating makes them just as guilty imo, a surgical strike should be taken agains their military strongholds, trade cut off, and basically put them in an economic pinch so tight they'll beg us to hang those guilty.<br>

<br>
  While I have no desire to see any innocents in any nation harmed.  This man regardless of his involvement in the events of Tuesday is a grave threat to the peace of the world as a whole, IMO.  <br>
<br>
 He and his organization must be dealt with.  With as little loss of innocent life as possible.  Once again this is only my opinion, but it seems to me that there must be a clear difference in our actions and his.  If in our quest for justice we become the thing we fight then we have truly lost.<br>
