In order to obtain it, you must do several things.<br>
<br>
1.  Kill Lord Grimrot (Live version).  He is level 40 or so Paladin and can deal alot of Damage.  Would not recommend a Cleric try to solo him.  Highly magic Resistant.  Drops Scythe of Petulence(?).<br>
<br>
2.  Kill Lord Grimrot (Dead version).  He is about level 30-35.  Can easily be soloed by a 52 Cleric.  The version had a pet.  Drops Heart.<br>
<br>
Spawn time on the place holder is 3 hours 20 minutes in RL.  PH is the only Putrid Skeleton the remains standing.<br>
<br>
3.  Need to con warmly or higher.  To obtain this faction, kill all of the putrid skeletons at the undead camp while waiting for Grinrot to spawn.  This builds faction with Priest of Life.<br>
Collect all Bone chips that drop.  Give to Lashun Novashine in Qeynos, 2 at a time, this also builds faction.  If all else fails, give Lashun Novashine 2gp to raise factions.<br>
<br>
Hope this info helps a fellow Cleric.  If you wish to discuss it further, give me a tell.<br>

At the same time, a wizard was camping it for his wife, who was a cleric parked there in NK to loot the corpse.<br>
<br>
I too have heard many, many claims about how to get Grim to spawn in both live and dead versions.  I was extremely lucky.  I was running through NK one day and I'll be damned if the live Grim wasn't up.  I knew who he was and what he was for, and I also knew that a level 36 paladin wasn't about to kill him.  Believe it or not, I shouted in zone to see if anyone would help me kill him, and a monk showed up, beat the living hell out of him, and ran off.<br>
<br>
2 weeks later, after logging on every 3 and a half hours of so, I finally got Undead Grim to spawn.  I tried every trick I read.  I let the ph despawn,  I killed the ph at 5pm, 5am, 6pm, 6am, and immediately after he popped.  All I know is that from personal experience, this is a LONG camp, or you get really lucky.  No trick I've ever heard of worked for me.<br>
<br>
Yes, the items are no drop.  Even if you can MQ it, your friend is going to have to do at least half of this camp.  I personally don't know anyone who ever MQ'd the Aegis, but I've never seen a quest that required multiple hand ins that could't be MQ'd.<br>
<br>
If you want to try, I'd do it this way:  As long as this camp is, you will usually see one of the items twice before you see them both once.  Have your cleric there for the very first camp and loot the very first item.  When you get that item yourself, turn it in and see what the text is.  If it says anything other than &quot;thanks,&quot;  you can most likely MQ it.<br>
<br>
Just a suggestion, no guarantees.  But that is how I would do it. <p>Phread

back, root him at his orginal place and camp out to clear<br>
agro... the next spawn was the live version, so who knows<br>
it might of been a fluke...  Good luck.<br>

Aegis of Life is a camp that you have to be prepared to log on every 3 and a half hours for a couple of weeks.  Anyone that gets this shield without doing that got really lucky.<br>

If she doesn't have the time to commit to that camp, there are other wis items for the back she may want to consider. <p>Phread

When I got my Aegis I could not solo the live Grimrot so gave Moel a tell and he came up to the ruins and killed the vile thing for me. Not one mention of a payment was ever mentioned. He was the one who gave me a tell when the dead one had spawned. During my time in SK Moel quite often would log on his chanter and give out clarity to all who wanted it. I am a bit biased though I am proud to call him a friend. <br>
<br>
In every zone there is always one person who never seems to leave the place, but with Moel he must have left at some stage or he would not be lvl 60.<br>
<br>
Sure he charges for helping people out, sometimes but not all the times. If you looted something that was rare wold you give it away I think not.<br>
