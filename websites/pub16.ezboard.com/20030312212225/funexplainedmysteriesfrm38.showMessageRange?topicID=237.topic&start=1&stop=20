I've always had an interest in the supernatural, and it's only been in the past year or so that I've started to really regret it. I believe evil spirits are haunting me. I know, I know, it sounds stupid to most people, something a teenager would say to get attention. The thing is, is that I'm not lying. They're everywhere, like shadows, silhouettes, auras at times. They're not human, I don't believe in people dying and coming back. They either go the Heaven or Hell and they stay there. But I DO believe in evil spirits, just that they aren't human.<br>
They've been around for a long while, about a year or two, or maybe three? I can't remember. All I know is that they scare the heck out of me. I've tampered with witchcraft, Ouija boards and all that nonsense, and it was only after I talked to my parents about it that they told me never to try theses things. They were real and they were dangerous. Now I'm even more scared. <br>
They surround me, sometimes 2 or 3, sometimes a single one, and sometimes a whole bunch of them. They frighten me, and I can't get to sleep once I see one of them. I'm frozen in bed or wherever I am and I can't move because I'm scared they'll come after me. They never hurt me before, but I know they don't mean good. I told my dad( who understands these things way better than my mom,) and he said they might be guardian angels. Yeah right. I told him angels wouldn't mean to float around and scare the living daylights out of a fifteen year old girl, and they certainly wouldn't give off a feeling of...I don't know how to describe it. Evil, maybe? My dad tried to drive them away, first telling them to leave then yelling at them, but everytime he does this, they just mass up. Dozens of them appear at once and I have to tell my dad to stop, for fear they might hurt him. My father told my mother, but she never speaks of this. Should I visit a priest? I don't want these things to go after anyone else, which is the main reason I never told anyone, besides the fact people might think I'm crazy. I don't know what they want from me. Is it because I've always had an interest in the occult, and now I'm paying for my curiosity? Or is it because I've always had a strange talent for predicting stuff(hard to explain...like, I know what song the radio is going to play before it plays it, I can predict the weather sometimes, days in advance, I can tell when something bad is going to happen and move out of the way in time, and I can finish people's sentences, even those I barely know. I can also guess what someone is thinking, and what they did a short while ago...freaky.) Anyways, all I know is that I need advice, I need help and I need it as soon as I can get it. I don't know anyone that went through the things I have, and I need someone who understands these kinds of things, and who might know what I'm talking about.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usixthsense16.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sixthsense16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 60<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/13/02 2:42:30 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Whats Going On With Me?</span><hr size=1> I hope I can help. <br>
<br>
First of all, I don't think these things are evil. I think they are wanting or needing something from you. They sense that you have this ability to predict and to see spirits, so they are curious. The ability to do this might have just came after you entered puberty. It often does. My ability came much earlier and it scared me greatly at first. Then I got curious and started to research things. Knowledge helps a lot in these cases. <br>
<br>
One thing I'd like to know is if you have always lived in this house or have just moved there. If you have just moved there, they may have been there all along and just became attracted to you. I don't believe they were conjured up with the witchcraft or Quija board. <br>
<br>
I don't think that they mean you any harm. I think the fear comes from you. It comes from not knowing what they want. If there was someway to find this out, they may leave you alone. Instead of screaming at them, try to talk to them.<br>
<br>
And sometimes spirits do come back, but they go back and forth between worlds. Just like Angels. They are in Heaven, but have been seen on earth. I'm not saying that these shadow figures are Angels. It's just an analogy.<br>
<br>
If you would like to talk to a priest it might help you mentally, but he just might tell you they are evil. I, myself, don't think they are.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps. If you have any questions. Ask. :) <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A bird will drop frozen dead from a bow without ever having felt sorry for itself.--D.H.

<br>
I agree with Sixth on this one, try to communicate to them, and ask them to communicate to you, but in a kind manner, and if they refuse to do so,,,tell them in a firm manner to leave, its YOUR place, you have control of what goes on in it..and I know I said FIRM alot...but alot of times thats what it takes,,,screaming at them just gives them more power, because they KNOW they are scaring the crap outta ya...and if you DO decide to get them to leave...dont talk or think about them for a week or so...if they hear ya, they may think you miss them, and they will come back...<br>

<br>
"The ability to do this might have just came after you entered puberty. "<br>
quite correct .usually girls have more problems than boys at this age .<br>
just take heed of what sixsence16 and aphrodite dream said very sound advice indeed .<br>
i also dont think these 'things' are evil  <p><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00" vlink="#00FF00">

<br>
Yes, I have had the same problem since 1999.  The shadows are in the shape of a human except filled with a golden glow.  There are also shadows that are of a widely dispersed nature, grey shadows, and black shadows.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I realised that the shadows (golden coloured) were higher entities only when I went into:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.tricycle.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi">www.tricycle.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
and began talking with some of the people there about what I have seen.  The expertise is there, and this is where you should pose your questions on this subject.<br>
<br>
<br>
I was basically told that the shadows simply wished to speak with me and that if I stood still long enough, I would begin to see the person clearly, then be able to speak with them.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The first shadow I saw was a black one, I only later realised that it was the astral form of a man that I had just met at a &quot;church&quot; meeting - and, yes, he was following me home, I just thought I was imagining it.  If you too had been looking around you would have seen the scout yourself.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The next lot were a group of men who appeared in grey shadows, but I stuck around long enough until I was able to speak with them.  Almost immediately.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
The third lot was a group of golden shadows.  You need to be patient with yourself as it is your level of development that decides whether you are able to speak with them immediately, or if you are able to receive their messages correctly.<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
If you have any doubt please speak with the people on Tricycle.com - as I said before, the expretise is located there for this type of discussion..<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

I heard somewhere that even a new house can be haunted, as it may not be the house itself, but the people within the house, or the surrounding area that is being haunted.  Am I wrong?<br>

Other factors contribute to the haunting of a house. It can even be transient spirits drawn there for negative energy or because of an object the people might own. For example a brand new house has a murder happen there. Afterwards a new family move in. Things start to happen. Even if the house has never been lived in before the murders. Also, as you said, houses can be built in the wrong places like ancient burial grounds or old cemeteries. They can be built over a site where tragedy happened. That's the bad thing. During the Civil War there were people killed and never located. How do you know where to build in a safe place?<br>
<br>
There are literally tons of reasons a new house can be haunted. I believe my house became haunted because the original builder was happy we were taking it over. Every time we start a new project he starts to appear. The other spirits are of people who once lived here. <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

Places, persons, objects; all things that are typically refered to as being haunted. These are merely things which the spirit/entity use as a link to this Realm.

The reasons of these spirits for remaining, are as numerous as the manifestations themselves. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uleglas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Leglas</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/25/02 2:42:18 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   SpiritMagnet, check your feelings about them, objectively</span><hr size=1> If you still feel they are evil and cannot establish constructive communication with them then I recommend you treat them as evil and take protective action.<br>

If you are a competent spellcaster you will know what you can do. If not then I recommend wearing crystals, the one that I think works for you in this is peridot, but check out my links in this post:<br>

Trust your feelings about crystals, they work differently for different people.<br>
<br>
I recommend you do not talk to a priest, unless you get very lucky (1 in 1000) the outcome is likely to be negative. Again, trust your feelings.<br>

I haven't checked this place out in quite some time.<br>
Let's see. No, things haven't gotten any better. In fact, they get worse. I've tried absolutely everything I could think of, and in the end nothing worked. But, I have had another strange happening in my life, if anyone cares to know.A month and a half ago a native woman moved next door. Quite nice, actually. Anyways, she scared the heck out of me the first day I met her. ( Now, this sounds completely unbelievable, but I assure you it's true.) My mother invited the woman, her name is Nancy, and her husband over a week after they moved in. We were all sitting around the table, having a nice chat, when my mother asked me to refill our guests' glasses. When I bent over to pour Nancy some more water, she told me, and I quote: &quot; He's right behind you.&quot; She just smiled like this was the most natural thing in the world, and I didn't say anything. Now, I had seen some of the shadows ( which now appear slightly more human, I can make out facial features and the like now) around when I was sitting at the table. I didn't speak to Nancy again for another two weeks. She called my mom and I one day to bring us shopping. On our way back, she creeped me out yet again. I met my aunt at the mall, so she came with us. My mother told me I could sit in the front so she could talk with my aunt. While I was sitting there, Nancy kept smiling at me. Finally I asked her what was wrong and she told me: &quot; I can feel it around you, the sense.&quot; I didn't say anything else. Now, for all of you who think I'm making this up, because I admit it sounds crazy, I suggest you stop reading now, because it gets worse. The day after we went to the mall, Nancy came over to help my mom bake for her &quot;Christmas Club&quot; ( lets not get into that). After my mother left she stayed for a little while. She told me, and I'll never forget this, right before she left: &quot; I know you're scared of your job (  what the hell? ), but you have a purpose in this world ( ???) and I suggest you get cracking. Use your mind.&quot; I have no idea what this meant, but it gave me the creeps. I've spoken to Nancy now and then since that, and every once in a while she spits out this nonsense. If anyone out there is still reading, believes me, or at least has any idea what she means or what I should do ( I KNOW one of you is going to tell me to stop watching tv, I can see it coming :P), your help would be appreciated.<br>

For if she is then it comes as no surprise to me that she would be able to see these things. My family is Native American and it seems everyone in this family has some &quot;skill&quot; be it seeing spirits or simply predicting things that will happen to saying what they want to happen and it coming true. <br>
<br>
I know when my grandfather died 2 years ago, during the wake my brother saw this line of spirits coming from behind the house, through the woods and into the house. We checked into it and found out they were paying respect. But the thing that startled my brother the most was what was leading the line of spirits - a buffalo masked dancer that according to him towered above the trees. Now I don't expect anyone to believe this but I was there and while it seems this family trait had skipped over me I could hear the footsteps as these spirits stepped onto the porch and entered the house.<br>
<br>
But ask her to fully explain herself and since she can see these things too, ask her if she could help you? <br>
<br>

<br>
The astral plane is all around us. We are surrounded by astral entities all the time. Because the physical plane overlaps the astral plane.<br>
 Most people are not open to the astral, thus not be able to see it<br>
<br>
 you seem to be open to the astral (spirits) that is why you see them all the time<br>
<br>
 Unless they hurt you physically, or psychically, then they are not here to harm you. If they hurting you, you should kik them out. Do a house cleansing, charge your house with your energy and drive them away.<br>
 They will go. Just don't fear them, as most astral beings feed on fear<br>
<br>
 If they are not hurting at all, talk to them. Sit in your door, with no distractions, open yourself to them and ask them what they want from you. <br>
 They will tell you.<br>
 <br>
 If they don't, then they don't want anything.<br>
  Leave them alone<br>
<br>
 The woman who speak of, she might know, she might not. Even if she sees them too, she does not know what your purpose in life is. Only you can know.<br>
<br>
 Listen, but don't put all your faith in her. If you are meant to help them, they will let you know.<br>
<br>
 I have many spirits in my house. They don't bother me, I don't bother them. They just are there. I don't see them all the time, when I saw, I see them and that's it.<br>
<br>
<br>
 I can understand you feel scared because everyone tells you you are not suppose to see them.<br>
<br>
 They are wrong obviously. <br>
 They are  part of this universe, like we are, like plants and animals are. <br>
 You are just more attune to them, thus you see them<br>
<br>
<br>
 They could be your spirit guide. They tend to be a pain, if you try to shun them out, they will make you pay attention. If you don't, they will make sure you do.<br>
 They might try to scare the living @#%$ out of you, throw objects at you, do all in their power, but because they are sayin:<br>
<br>
 Hello! We are here. Stop ignoring us!<br>
<br>
 They might seem evil to you because society has marked that uponyour subconscious.<br>
 <br>
Or You might get a bad vibe because they might be dark entities and/or powerfull, but try not to confused dark with evil <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 Trust me. If they were evil and wanted to harm you, they would have done it long ago. They would not linger for year and years trying to harm you, they would have done it right away.<br>
<br>
<br>
 Spirits do not harm the living for no reason at all. When they do, is because they have a strong reason to do so. <br>
 Unless is there something you are not telling us, then they have no reason to try and harm you. ( If you played with the occult, then depending on what you did, you might have opened a portal to the other side/astral plane , and you attracted them, maybe they curious, maybe they want to feed on you). <br>
<br>
 Thus the warning, don't play with fire unless you want to get burnt <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
  The occult itself won't harm you, but astral entities do like those who dwell with the occult without knowing what they are doing, and get their paws on naive, little girls <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 <br>
 hag attacks ( psychic vampires) do 'harm' people, just in the sense that they do feed upon the living, but even they do not kill anyone. They just feed on their lifeforce, and besides being tired and an nuisance to you, they harm you in any other way<br>
<br>
  If they do bother you, do kik them out, they will go<br>
 If they remain, is because they are connected to you somehow, whether they seek help or they are your spirit guide ( or guardian angels, whatever u wanna call)<br>
<br>
 They just remain because you are undecided. You do not know what you want to do with it, you don't know how to say leave, or stay, you confused, thus making them confused and making them lingering about you, waiting for you to decide<br>
<br>
<br>
 Hope that helps <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
<br>
 in case you do want to get rid of them, learn how to shield, ground and caste protective circles, and do a house cleansing<br>
<br>
 you can find those by typing them on google.com search<br>
<br>
 Just go with the ones that feel more 'right' to you <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udillydaydream.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dilly Daydream</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/12/02 12:59:14 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Whats Going On With Me?</span><hr size=1> This sounds very good advice to me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have never had any experiences like this so I'm afraid that I cannot add anything to that which has already been posted. <p><b>Dilly the Daydreamer</b><br>

Perhaps these shadows are attempting to get a message across to you and Nancy is not much help telling you riddles.  <br>
<br>
It appears to me that you are being asked to develop certain mental faculties or skills that you may have had in a previous life.<br>
<br>
I would either ask Nancy to come out with what they want, or ask her to recommend a REAL psychic or telepath to clear this matter up once and for all as I know how stressful it can get sometimes.<br>

It's normal to be afraid and seeing them doesn't make you crazy. They are coming at night because you are more relaxed and open to make contact. It is also not unusual for other people who are receptive to them to see the same gift in you. It is merely a validation of your ability. <br>
<br>
There are a few things you can do that might bring you a little comfort. 1st, visualize wrapping white light around you for protection. It will act as a shield so to speak. Next you can sleep between light blue sheets which also acts as a shield. Last, if you truely want them to go then you must command them. If doesn't work to have your Dad or others do it because they are trying to communicate with you.  <br>
<br>
When I say command them I mean that you must phrase your words as such. &quot;I don't wish to communicate with you, I COMMAND YOU TO GO NOW!&quot;.  You have more control then you think. <br>
<br>
If you decide to speak with them you still need some protection such as &quot;white light&quot; for you do not need to take in their enegy. Most spirits that linger are low energy and flock to those who can feel them or see them merely to communicate. <br>
<br>
Spirit guides would wait until you are receptive to show themselves. These are uninvited guests. It doesn't mean they are evil just uninvited.<br>
