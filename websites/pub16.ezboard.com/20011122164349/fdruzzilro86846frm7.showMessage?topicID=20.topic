<br>
It began one afternoon.  She had been a relatively happy child  . . . or so she had thought.  Happiness is relative to the worst one has felt.  The children in the neighbourhood would tease her about her colours, mocking her.  Her parents advised her that there were worse things in life - she believed them.  They glossed over it all quite smoothly, as though they had expected these problems.  She never understood why they showed her such disdain.  She knew Erudites, even half-breeds, were not loved in Qeynos.  She’d even met one but he played well with the other teens, well accepted.<br>
 <br>
&quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   You're not one of them, you know.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;  She turned, startled.  She saw nothing.  Perhaps it was just one of those conversations she held in her head.  She walked on.  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I knew your mother.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;  She stopped dead in her tracks.  She refused to turn around, knowing now that it had to be one of the other teens trying to get under her skin.  She knew that if she turned and made eye contact that she risked the tears.  She would not give them that.  &quot;<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   You look so much like her.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;  Bastard.  The tears started but she bit her lip ‘til they were arrested.  Her hand slipped smoothly into the lower seam of her vest where she had hidden the shank she’d made.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I would like to tell you about her.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  Tell me what, she wondered, that she was a drunken whore?  A prostitute?  She’d heard their accusations before and would never hear them again.<br>
<br>
She spun in place and threw the blade toward the source of the voice.  Simultaneously realizing that the voice was *not* that of a teen, but an older man.  Too late.  She saw where the blade was flying but still saw naught but shadows.  A hand leapt out from them and caught the blade.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   My girl, you are truly your mother’s daughter.  That would have taken out my eye.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  The hand was dark, and not without wrinkles.  He was Tier’Dal.  She should have fled from this dark invader and sounded an alarm.<br>
<br>
They met later, when it was safe.  When they would not be hanged for being seen.  She’d never even known of the Catacombs before.  His name was J’axla and he was her grandfather.  He told her, over time, of a missive he had received in Neriak.  He himself had been imprisoned in Neriak with no hope of escape.<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She had been travelling, that was her way.  Never in the same spot twice,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he smiled, eyes far away.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   It was her first time in Qeynos and she decided that she wanted a taste of some Bayle’s jewels.  She could have done it, she was that good.  Some local punk had the same fantasy, but he was a clumsy, pale idiot.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  She couldn’t help but snicker with him.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She was almost finished when he fell from the windowsill.  In his panic to get out, he prevented her exit and the guards came upon them.  The boy fought and died.  Good riddance.  She saw that she was out manned and surrendered, knowing that it would be in her benefit and might allow her a chance for later escape.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--><br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She was imprisoned but after just a few hours and, before the guard dozed, her door flew open.  Blinded in the sudden daylight, she was grabbed by a couple of men and dragged past an unconscious watchman.  Into another room, where a robed man cast a spell upon her.  When she awoke, she was in a different cell.  This one was dank and stunk of urine.  It felt like the Catacombs.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
J’axla skimmed the remaining details.  She did not press.  It seemed as if some of the finer details may have not been in the letter at all, but pieced together from his own investigations.  Apparently, her mother had been brought down to the Catacombs by some cult with the intent of impregnating her for some ritual.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She never gave a name but could say, from his demeanour and speech, that he was military and educated.  For months they kept her until one day one of her keepers became careless.  She was bound loosely enough that she could reach the lock pick buried in her hair.  She freed herself and opened the lock to the door.  One central torch burned and there were still too many guards around.  Waiting, she identified four different voices.  Retreating back to the cell, she retrieved her seldom-emptied waste bucket.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  His eyes began to shine a bit with pride, and she suspected there might be some embellishment.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She crept up the hall, away from the guards when another turned the corner and spied her.  They charged and she doused the torch with the contents of the bucket.  In the darkness they were crippled.  Disarming the first, they all fell to their comrade’s blade.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  Four, no, five guards?  He saw the look.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Five guards,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he repeated.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Your mother was very able.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  No more were slain that night.  She’d been too pregnant and was still too lost to risk the combat.  There in the Catacombs, full of shadow, she was in her element and found an exit.<br>
<br>
The gods were both laughing and crying that day.  When she entered the streets of Qeynos, weak with hunger and slightly wounded, she fell into the hands of the City Guards.  Not recognizing her, she was apprehended merely for trespassing on their lands.  Despite her condition, she was cast out of the city and took refuge in an abandoned cottage out of the city.  For as long as she was able, she crept back into the city to steal food from the citizens and stockpile a bit for when the pregnancy took her over.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   It was during this time that she wrote me for the first time.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
The child had been born during the winter months.  The birth had been long and painful, too painful.  A single scream had escaped her lips and drew a charwoman’s presence.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She took pity on your mother in her condition and assisted the birth.  It was a complicated birth and...</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->&quot;  He left the rest unfinished but added, “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   She wrote once more after that.  You were lucky to have been a half-breed at that point.  It saved your life.  If you had been any more like your mother, you’d have been taken from the charwoman and banished.  Left to die.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Grandfather?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”  It was awkward.  It was the first time she’d ever called him that.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I want you to teach me to… to be like her.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Shebali(2),</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” he hesitated.  It was a nickname he had given her.  She thought it to be a term of endearment; from the way he used it.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   I have seen how able you could be, but I don’t know.  It is a not a life like you have known here.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
She had already just heard the worst of what could happen.  “<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Please, Ul’Ilharn(3),</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” her eyes pleading.  He saw the shunning, the alienation, the need.  She waited until his answer came.  He was caught aback, not even realizing she'd been absorbing his language.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Xas(4).</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
<br>
A silence fell upon them.  There was one question she had not been able to bring herself to ask J’axla, and he had not yet offered.<br>
<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   What was her name?</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” she asked.<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Lannella,</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->” came the soft reply<br>
“<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Then it will be mine, too.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->”<br>
