<br>
About 7 years ago, when I lived in Bakersfield, California, I used to hang out at a hobby/gaming/craft store called Riverview Hobby. It was, and still is, the only decent place in Bakersfield for the gaming geeks. It was owned by an older man named Gene who ran the place with the help of Laura, a part-timer who worked two days a week. Those two days were the days I was down there, since Laura didn't mind a bit if I sat and read through every last book on the shelf without buying a thing (it was also where I spent most of my money - I wasn't a total mooch).<br>
<br>
Now, several decades before Riverview Hobby was a hobby shop, it was Riverview Hatchery. A young boy (the son of the owner, if I recall correctly), was killed in an accident in the hatchery, and both Gene and Laura had experienced strange happenings, which they attributed to the ghost of the boy. It was always playful, occasionally knocking things from shelves, but usually just moving objects from one part of the store to another, or opening and closing doors. I'd heard plenty of eerie stories from Laura, and Gene was always very matter-of-fact about it, as if ghosts were the most natural thing in the world.<br>
<br>
One night, as I was helping Laura close up the store, she sent me to lock the front door (we'd always leave through the back). I locked the door and went back into the back room while she counted out the till. We heard the string of bells on the front door jingle, as if the door had been fully opened (someone could have shaken the locked door from the outside, but it wouldn't put that much &quot;swing&quot; on the bells). Laura looked at me, I looked at Laura, and I went back out in the front to see if maybe I hadn't locked the door fully, and somebody had walked right in. Nobody was there. I checked the bolt, and gave the door a solid pull to make sure it was locked tight. &quot;Maybe it was the ghost,&quot; Laura said. Did you make sure the door was locked? I told her I had, and that there was no way the door was unlocked. A little creeped out, we finished closing, and left through the back door.<br>
<br>
The next day, Laura called me at home. She had that &quot;I believe you, but I have to make absolutely sure&quot; tone when she asked me if I had locked the door. I reminded her of my going back out to double-check, and she had heard the slight jingle the bells gave when I had pulled on the door, assuring that it was locked. Apparently, a few hours before the store opened, a would-be customer hadn't seen the &quot;Closed&quot; sign, had <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> opened the unlocked front door</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END-->, and walked right into the store. Finding nobody there, he had left and called the police. The police called Gene, Gene called Laura, and Laura called me.<br>
<br>
At some point between my locking the door, and the &quot;customer's&quot; arrival, the front door had become unlocked.  This was in a sketchy neighborhood (the biggest buyers of test tubes and glass tubing were using them for a very specific chemical &quot;experiment&quot;)., and yet nothing had been stolen, or even noticeably moved. The keys were still on the hook where I had hung them after locking the front door. A &quot;typical&quot; boss would have reprimanded his employee for &quot;leaving the door unlocked,&quot; but Gene had no reason to doubt either of us, and saw no reasonable explanation other than just a mischievous spirit.<br>

I bet it was the boy's ghost. Thanks for sharing that with us. <br>
<br>
Speaking of locks. That reminds me of a story that happened to me once. Years ago my husband and I lived in this old run down 1965 New Moon trailer. Everything was bad on it. The wiring, the plumbing, and the locks on the doors. The front door was OK. It broke and we had to replace it, but the back door was in dire need of repair. I had to leave it unlocked for my husband to come in at night because he worked nights and came home at 11pm.  My mother constantly told me that if we didn't get that lock fixed we would have a drunk standing in the living room. I knew the lock needed replaced, but I still thought what she said was funny. <br>
<br>
One night he came in and forgot to use the chain lock like we had been doing. Later that night something weird happened. It was more like early morning hours, around 1 or 2 am. My husband didn't wake up. He couldn't wake up after a night of shift if he wanted to. I just woke up with a weird feeling, so I got up to check on what was going on or if anything was going on at all. In our living room stood this guy. All he could say was, "Are you Sherrie? Is this Sherrie's house?." I tried over and over to tell him he was in the wrong house and to leave. He was about 5'8" and wore a ball cap. He had dark hair. He wore a flannel shirt over a black t-shirt. He also had jeans on with a pair of old Addidas on. He never said anything and just turned and walked out. The weirdest thing about this is that our two dogs didn't bark. They barked at everything. They would bark when it rained. Also the sensor light just outside the door was not triggered. Neither was the one at the other door.<br>
<br>
I ran to the window to see which way the guy went and there was no guy. There was no car. Nothing. Not a sign of him anywhere. I heard no car leaving or any car at all for that matter. I could see from all directions and he would have had to have passed by one of our windows for me to see him. Needless to say we made the effort to get the lock changed. The last weird thing in this story is that when I got up the next morning, the door was chain locked. I hadn't locked it the night before because I was so confused.  <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

He didn't seem to be drunk. He was just confused. I wasn't afraid of him. He was there about 5 minutes before he left and no one else in my family saw him. My daughter got up after he left to ask me what had happened. She said she heard me talking to someone, but didn't know what we were saying. <br>

It is still a mystery today. I still tell it to family members and friends. The whole thing is weird, but interesting.  <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

Late last month (just in time for Halloween) a friend of mine in Bakersfield messaged me, saying, &quot;Hey, your ghost story was published in an underground newspaper here.&quot;   I didn't recall this post right away, so I figured I must have written one of those &quot;It was a dark and stormy night&quot; things a bunch of years back and just forgotten about it.  I wasn't feeling too patient, so I decided to see if I could find any information on my own before Bill gave me the full scoop. Google is always a good place to start, so I punched in my name and the word &quot;ghost.&quot;  Nothing on anything I'd written, but I turned up <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/dan.maggie/html/15.html">Fifteen Dead Guys</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->, a site I hadn't seen in years. There was my name, right at the top of the page, with a message letting me know that one of the people on my list wasn't dead, and wanted to get in touch with me! We met in the army, and he was shipped off to the Desert Can of Whoopass right as I was bargaining and finagling my way out of slav.. er, service, and I never heard from him again. I put him on my list thinking he was probably dead and if he wasn't, there was always the remote chance he'd come across the site and find a way of contacting me (I'm not sure why I put &quot;email me&quot; - I hadn't heard of email in 1990, much less had an address I could have given him). Anyway, through some stroke of bizarre luck he'd found the site, and through yet another stroke of bizarre luck, here I was staring at it again.<br>
<br>
While I was still reeling from the shock of finding a long-lost friend completely on accident, Bill gave me the full story: Someone in Bakersfield had come across my original post in this thread, and decided &quot;Riverview Hobby is haunted&quot; would go great in the Halloween edition of their paper. People had been coming into the shop, asking the owner all about it (and hopefully buying stuff too). Of course, I was credited as &quot;Bonobo62&quot; instead of my real name, so fame and fortune are still a long way off. At least I can blow my mind again and again by thinking of the bizarre set of circumstances it took for all of that to happen.<br>
<br>
Now, if the publisher is reading this (who knows, maybe he/she is a regular poster here, or at least checks in now and then), I'm only mildly ticked that you used that without contacting me. It got me in touch with someone I hadn't heard from in over a decade, and was decent free publicity for the shop, so all will be forgiven if you send me a copy of the issue. <p><!--EZCODE IMAGE START--><img src="http://home.mindspring.com/~sillyputty/copywrong.gif"/><!--EZCODE IMAGE END--></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sexysixxx>SexySiXXX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Suite Amazon Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 177<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/22/02 5:47:59 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=256.topic&index=12>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.guardiansofluclin.net/files/ANGEL20.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: My Ghost Experience</span><hr size=1> Very interesting and eerie stories, indeed.

One winter, my parents went of their yearly vacation and left me home to watch our four dogs.  The dogs woke me up really early, about 7:00 (that's early if you're on Xmas break) and wanted to go outside for a potty.  Still in my pj's, I put on a warm jacket and opened the back laundry room door to let them out.  We have the kind of locks on our doors that have a little button on the door knob that you push in and turn horizontal if you want to lock the door, and vertical to unlock it.  Well, I opened the door, the dogs went out, I followed the dogs out and shut the laundryroom door behind me.  Just as the door shut I realized that I hadn't unlocked the door.  You can open the door from the inside even if it's locked, but you can't open the door from the outside if it's locked.  I cursed myself and tried the laundryroom door and it was locked tight.  I tried all of the doors and downstairs windows and they too were locked.  (I was home alone and made sure to lock up everything the night before).  We didn't hide spare keys outside so I knew the only way to get back in was to call a locksmith.  I tried the laundryroom door a couple more times to make sure because I really didn't want to wake my neighbor but it wouldn't give.  I know we have a ghost and in the past I've had some fun experiences (he/she's a practical joker) and I actually said out loud &quot;Please unlock the door for me.  I know you're in there right now having a good giggle at my stupidity.  Please, please, please!&quot;  I waited for a good five minutes and nothing happened.  Finally, I went next door and called a locksmith who was a very cool biker guy <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hippy --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/hippy.gif ALT=":hippy"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  we'd used before and he came over.  He tried to unlock the front door, but it was an intricate lock so he moved on to our side garage door.  But that one really gave him a hard time because we rarely ever put a key into it and it had coroded (sp?) and he had a difficult time getting his tools into it.  When he couldn't get that door unlocked, we moved to the backyard to the laundryroom door and the first thing he did was place his hand on the door knob and turn it.  Sure enough, the door was unlocked and opened easily. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek3 --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/ylamazed.gif ALT=":eek3"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   My jaw dropped and the locksmith looked at me like I was the biggest idot. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lolup --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/lol.gif ALT=":lolup"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I tried to tell him that it had been locked but he wouldn't stop laughing.  He didn't want to charge me but I made him take a $20.  I know that our ghost unlocked that door after the locksmith arrived to make me look like a fool once again.
