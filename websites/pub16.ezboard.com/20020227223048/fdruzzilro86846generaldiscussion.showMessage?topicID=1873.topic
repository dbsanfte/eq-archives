I am here merely to express my gratitude for a lot of people that I have spent the better part of a year getting to know.<br><br>First: The Reason why I left<br>It is truly a simple reason.  Quite frankly, I fell in love.  I have been seeing someone for a while now and this person lives about 3000 miles away.  I, after much debate and some hard thinking, have decided to pull up stakes and move in with her.  She is the light of my life and I have decided to through caution to the wind and follow my heart.<br><br>Second: Why the Post?<br>Well, as I stated before, I have gotten to know alot of you over the past 8 mos. and I felt I owed it to you.  I am not one to take any experience in life lightly, I treasure all of the people I meet and generally like to stay in touch.  You all are possibly the BEST community of players in EQ.  I have learned that first hand through my dealings and through conversations.  You are quick to help someone when the unfortunate happens and always willing to lend a hand to a neighbor in need.  There are not alot of communities out there that do that.  You all should take the time to learn about each other even more, as I have, and you will see that there are some bright shining examples of the human race right here on Druzzil.  I would just like to thank all of you for the compassion, caring, boisterous personalities that you are.  You have made my job fun and above all, you have made most peoples experience in EverQuest fun.  And for that, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br><br>Third: So what happens to Druzzil?<br>Many people equate what a server is like to the GM or Guides.  The GM does have a hand in it but the majority of the Server community is guide by the players.  You all make or break the server.  It is either a cesspool run by low life or a Gem (Druzzil Ro).  Please just keep doing what you have always done, the formula works =).<br><br>I know some of you may be thinking - Is that REALLY Xetulous?  I made this persona a couple weeks ago in anticipation of this day (forgot when I was checking the board one day to log in as someone else, oops).  I decided that I would leave some of you some memories of my interactions with you.  These are just what stick out in my mind, please don't be offended if I forget to mention a conversation we had.<br><br>I remember....<br>Having someone Ninja Loot the Dain's corpse, AS I WAS STANDING ON IT! LOL, I had a few laughs at that one =).<br>Shooting the Breeze with Exxeban about Old Milton Bradley Games and RPGs.  BTW, I lost my Fortress America =( was cleaning the apartment and couldn't find it =(.<br>Singing Happy Birthday to someone from Clan B when I got a petition from Ladi.  (BTW Ladi, you can post that SS now, won't hurt anything.<br>Teaching Ahjess to Backflip (You got it down yet?=)<br>Having a Conversation with Lanella and thinking she was probably one of the most intellectual people I have known.<br>Messing Around with Rhedd's surname =).<br>Making Yelinak say, 'Level ?? Dragon LFG' and having ML Spitting Milk out there nose<br>Having Jara Dar's Shade say, 'VINDICATION' (On a side note, someone cast a spell on me and they actually WERE DT'd =)<br>Watching Countless Dragon raids by numerous Guilds<br>Sitting in the EC Tunnel unanon taking questions =)<br>And some of the best memories were dancing for ANYONE upon request =)<br><br>You see, alot of you caused me a lot of joy.  It was not a trouble to come into work at all really.  I thank you again friends and keep on enjoying EQ.<br><br>On a final Note I have one request.  Please treat the Guides and GMs with the same compassion and respect that you showed me.  They have a thankless job and there are certain rules that have to be followed.  They do what they do because, quite frankly, they love to help out.  A kind word here and there goes a long way torwards boosting the confidence and the attitude of the Guides and GMs.  Thank you.<br><br>That is all I have at the moment.  I will continue to look at these boards though (I am leaving tomorrow on a week long trip across country though) and I will be happy to respond to any questions except questions about company secrets, past decisions, policies, etc.  Thank you all and good journeys.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Xetulous the Devious<br>Former GM of Druzzil Ro<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uahjess.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ahjess</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Vimyredo</span><br>  Posts: 846<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/6/02 6:09:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1873.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Words from a Former GM...</span><hr size=1> Xetulous,<br>Let me be the first to congradulate you on your new found love.

It so happened that I was bound about a foot to the left of the chancellor spawn in Loio..  at level 52, as a cleric.<br><br>I died, in the persecution of some group activity, somewhere, doesn't matter..  I respawn at my bind point, in a room FULL of sarnaks..  <br><br>at last count, when the smoke cleared and my rescue group showed up, I had 13 corpses on the ground and was spitting flames.  Several of the corpses were stuck, and couldn't be moved. I /petitioned, and pulled all the corpses I could..  rezzed a couple, but that didn't unstick any of the others. <br><br>A Guide, who I can't remember the name of for the life of me, showed up, and was CS_Rezzing me after verifying that the corpses were frozen by a bug. He didn't have to do that, and I'm very grateful he did, but I digress...<br><br>The last chunk of my rescue crew shows up, late, and one of my SKs, played by the female component of a couple in california, walks up, sees the pile of corpses (we only had about a dozen on the ground at this time), and the first words out of her mouth were &quot;Holy shit, that's a lot of fucking corpses&quot;, as she was standing next to the Guide..  <br><br>The Guide never said a word about it, even though it was a clear violation of the ToS..  dunno if he had /filter on, or what.<br><br>Aside from the slip of the lips of my dear, dear SK, we referred to the Guide as &quot;sir&quot;, and used our please-and-thank-yous, like I have with (almost) all my interaction with them.<br><br>My favorite, to this day, interaction with a GM was having one pulling for us in the ass end of Sol B..  and training the raid crew...<br><br>Or maybe the time we had a GM accompanying us on a Faydedar run, who sent me a tell asking why it was taking so long (I had to swim, some of us don't have the benefits of GuideTravel, or whatever their travel spell is).<br><br>or..  or...<br><br>yeah.<br><br>To sum it up, Xetulous..  we'll miss you, thanks for the memories. I wish you the best of luck chasing the fickle, easily frightened beast known as Love, and I hope the server maintains it's honor in your absence.
