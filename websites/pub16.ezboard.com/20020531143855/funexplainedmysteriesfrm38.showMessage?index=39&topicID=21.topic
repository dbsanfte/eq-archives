The giant bird is like the thunderbird of myth that use to fly these areas. Some say that it still does. A true prehistoric flying giant bird has been discovered. It is thought that it's flightpath would take it up through the Smokey Mountain region (right through here).<br>
<br>
Want to hear something creepy Merc? I have been having a reoccurring nightmare about a large, almost human-like bat creature. It started long before I thought about posting that story.<br>
<br>
You mentioned something about trying an exorcism in another forum. For one, I know how to do one myself. Better than most. Those techniques would never work in that house or that land. Too many different types of entities. To much evil. That land was cursed long before a christian god ever came to that land. Some places just can't be exorcised. When I did live there, I would often get fed up with all of the noises and things, and scream &quot;Would you just leave me alone!&quot;. If I was mad enough, they would usually listen, for a little while. Most of what was in the house was friendly. It was what was outside that you had to be afraid of.<br>

As for exorcism..I don't know if that kind of thing works. I think you have to keep them away with<br>
your thoughts. Know what I mean? You have the power in you regardless of what's out there. <br>
You are your own best protection against evil in any form. Its about and I can't say Karma here<br>
but I will say it's about your reception or lack of reception to them. I think you mentioned that<br>
at the witchcraft forum. If you allow yourself to be a part of them they become a part of you.<br>
Does that make sense. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I don't have to have faith, just be willing to possible put myself in danger. I use a very strange technique I learned many years ago. It is more of an expelling and barring of re-entry than a real exorcism. It is the same technique that I used to bar the friend of mine who astral traveled into my room from entering again. Very useful on harmful spirits, but I would never use it on one that just needed to pass on. I used a version of that method to try and make the farm safer. It worked mostly. It stopped most things from coming to the house. Some it didn't even faze. Some things just can't be stopped. No matter how strong a person is, they are only human. Somethings out there are much, much older. <br>
<br>
Merc, good luck finding any info on that bird. It is a giant megafauna bird that lived in South America. For years it was thought that there was no way that it could have flown. Later it was theorized that it flew using certain air currents infront of major storm systems. These systems flow up through Central America then curve through Texas, follows the southern coast of North America then up the Smokey Mountain Range straight through the Carolinas and Tenn., Kentucky, and farther north until it curves back south around the western coast where the birds would have eventually returned home. They came infront of the storms so that is why some think that is where the thunderbird legends came from. Of course the birds where thought to be extinct many years before humans arrived in North America, but science has been wrong before. The birds are supposible extinct, but many people see them still today. <br>
<br>
Now, in my bat-thing dreams the things are usually human size with leathery wings instead of arms. They are longer than normal arms. About the length of their body.<br>
<br>
As for onynx, I have none. Why?<br>
<br>
Now it is finally time. I promised this story for Halloween, but was unable to deliver. As one of my last posts here, I will finally tell it.<br>
<br>
This is actually a story with two parts. They are connected, but happened months apart.<br>
<br>
Growing up I slept in the front bedroom of the house. My bed was a very special one. It was a full size bed with a large wooden frame that my grandfather had carved for my grandmother. He had died in his sleep in that bed when I was three. While I was often afraid in that house, I always knew in my heart that I was safe in that room. One night I found out that I was wrong. One night as a layed in bed with the lights off unable to sleep, I felt something jump up onto my be. I was laying on my side and it jumped up behind me. I felt it slowly walk across the bed towards me. It was walking on four legs. I layed there, afraid to move. Afraid to do anything. I felt it as it slowly walked over me. My eyes now wide open and watching saw nothing. It seemed to be about the size of a large panther. For some reason I think of it as a cat. It had a soft, cat-like walk. Not a hard walk like a dog. As it stepped over me, I could sort of feel it there. IT was the same as being near any large animal, it just sort of has a presence. You can feel it there even if you aren't touching it. I was laying on the edge of the bed, and I could feel the mattress push in as it stepped over me and onto a small space between my stomach and the side of the bed, one foot at a time. I believe that I layed there most of the night, afaid to move or go to sleep.<br>
<br>
That was the only time that I was visited like this and after a few months, I had almost forgotten about it. That was until I got another visitor one night.<br>
<br>
I had fallen asleep with the light on, again. This was something that I did very often. I would usually wake up in the middle of the night and turn it off. This night was no different. I woke up, noticed that the light was on, sat up to turn it of, and saw that someone was sitting at the end of my bed. he was wearing a white suit, in a very old style that I couldn't quite place. He also had a top hat and gloves. In one hand he held a chain. At the end of that chain, a collar. That collar fit around the neck of a very large black panther. Seeing this, I immediatly fainted. When I came to, he was still there. For some reason, this time I wasn't afraid. I remember sitting and talking to him till almost dawn. Most of the details of what was said are fuzzy. I seem to be able to remember the full details only when they are important. I would pass most of it off as a dream if not for a few things. Some of the things he told me came to pass (My doppleganger being just one of many). Another is that his cat left me a reminder. At some point near dawn, I had fallen asleep (He left at that time. Maybe he put me to sleep.). When I awoke, I had long claw marks that ran down the inside of my left knee. They weren't bloody or anything like that. They were already scars. I still have them to this day. They have never gotten smaller or healed anymore in any way. Just a small reminder of my visitation that night and his way of telling me that &quot;it wasn't a dream&quot;. Amazingly, this visit doesn't bother me very much. The one thing that I really don't like about it is that I can't remember his face. I could descrbe his suit down to the smallest detail, but no face.<br>

I wonder if the first visitation was from the large panther belonging to that man. It sounds logical to me, but then again, it could very well be completely unrelated.<br>
<br>
I do wish you could remember some of what you talked about with this man. Evidently, he told you of some things that would eventually come to pass as you say he foretold your &quot;doppleganger&quot; and that DID happen. You say that he told you of other things that came to pass. I wonder what they were, but can understand that to be fuzzy for you.<br>
<br>
So THAT is how you got the marks on your knee you referred to in posts you made earlier asking people to guess how the marks got there. My guess (but I did not say) was that it was from the wolf faced humanoid in the attic. I was wrong.<br>
And you still have those marks to this very day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  WOW!<br>
