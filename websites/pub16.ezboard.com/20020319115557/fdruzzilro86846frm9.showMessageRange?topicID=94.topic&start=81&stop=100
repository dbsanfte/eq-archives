However, and correct me if I'm wrong (and I'm sure someone will *insert smile*) that what is being said is that your skill (i prefer the word knowledge) goes up the more diverse the raids you have performed in.  And in suit, the more diverse the raids and simply the more no. of high end raids you have been on, the better your chances are to come away with high end equipment.  So if the statement was ... in general, the more different high end raids you've participated in, the higher your knowledge (skills) will be and in turn the better gear you will have.<br>
<br>
I think that what stirred up the commotion is two-fold. One in the over simplification with saying the better gear you have the more skilled you are.  It can easly be seen in different ways, depending upon what side of the track you live on.  Also, it implies that everyone with lots of great gear is skilled.  Well, I've met some who have had high end gear that I wouldn't necessarily call them knowledgeable and some at level 50 still in raw silk that I would consider skilled.  <br>
<br>
Just my perspective<br>

I've been trying to get the point of view of others and it blows my mind how simplistic this all is.<br>
<br>
When I said,&quot;I've gotten really tired of the overall attitude of people who don't play the high end game and blame US, the uber guilds for their inadequacies.&quot; What i should have said is this,&quot;I'm tired of getting flak for being in a guild that does tough shit with a low amount of people, and getting crapped on by a person who didn't get around to it yet.&quot; Yes, this means people who haven't seen or done a zone and give me shit because Hoss &quot;ruined&quot; it for them. VI set the script in place, VI has the recapture quest (broken) so who do you blame? Hell, I don't even have an ST key....<br>
<br>
I mentioned not hating the players but hating the game instead. Someone mentioned that it was hogwash. Was I off by much? Let me explain. Where to start besides the small stuff like class imbalance and broken quests? Perhaps the biggest flaw of the game is the spawn times. It's meant to slow the game down. All it does it make it competitive for people to &quot;race&quot; to spawns.<br>
<br>
The IGB has not been around since D-Ro was made, in fact it wasn't around when I joined Hoss. Ask yourselves something, if the IGB were still around in full force, and was never &quot;defiled&quot; how long would it take before we had 10 guilds on rotation? 20? 30? As stated before, spawn times reduced the amount of loot distributed out to a population per server. In a given month with no patches (yeah right!) Nagafen can be killed 4 times. Now, take your guild_X and you need Naggy and his phat l3wt for your guild or even for yourself, and figure out how many times you get that spawn each month. With 10 guilds on rotation you won't see that mob for how long? Thought so. In the cycle of life, there is birth, life and death. I haven't really seen any of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds die out. We just keep getting more and more bored level 60 players who want to go kill stuff and the amount to kill gets smaller and smaller. Survival of the fittest? Not quite. Survival of the earliest maybe.<br>
<br>
Where was I? Oh yeah....<br>
<br>
Have I personally wronged you? Have I trained you? (besides my little lost excursion through fungus grove, I'm sorry about that) Most likely the answer is no. What has my guild done for a smaller guild? Well what do you consider as far as help, and how many people from Hoss does it take to be considered helping? I spent many hours helping CR people in Fear. I've travelled across a dozen zones to rez people with nothing but a thank you in it for me. I've buffed 50 people or more for a naggy raid before along with CR of that raid and many others. You say rez's and C2 doesn't count? Whatever. I've given items to new players, plat to others. I have buffed low level groups out of the kindness of my heart. No payback. No thought of anything in return. I've refused payments from people that I've rezzed. Where do I need to go to get in the graces of other players? As stated before, I play to have fun.<br>
<br>
Kaludram- I've known you quite a while indeed. To see what I say about my guild's behavior? They acted in accordance with the wishes of the members of Hoss, whole or in part. Did we release the Sleeper to cut off Primal flow? Not at all. We did it to do it. Quick question: When you buy a video game, do you play it to beat it? In essence releasing the Sleeper was sort of beating the game. To a point of course. It was put in to be difficult and hard and it was done. You are right when I say,&quot;Stop crying.&quot; It is JUST a game after all.<br>
<br>
Anyways, the Sleeper is supposed to wake up. Why put it in game if it isn't supposed to happen? Sure the recapture quest is broken (refer to broken quest comment) and it makes people upset that they can't get primal anymore. I can understand why you are upset. You do know it still drops right? Just not as frequently. If/When VI decides to fix that quest, guess what? You'll have warders again. You'll have primal flowing once more. It's just a delay. Do you have the needed keyed people for ST? Go farm the 3 mobs that drop primal.<br>
<br>
Do I feel that what Hoss did was selfish and greedy? Not in the slightest. Do I have any primal? Nope, don't even have a key to get in. The selfish and greedy act would have been to get all our members outfitted with keys and primal, and their twinks. We didn't do that though. We just enabled a script that was put in game. 'Nuff said.<br>
<br>
As far as the intent of the original post, I was mad when I wrote it. I had logged into the game as always and spammed with hateful remarks on how selfish, greedy and insensitive I'd been. I wasn't even there. These remarks coming from people I knew, people I liked, people I actually talked to on a daily basis. Received several from complete strangers because they saw the guild tag. If you ask me, it sounds a lot like I'm a victim of blind harrassment and you are a victim of poor game design. <br>
<br>
If my post offended you, let it roll off your back. I won't apologize for any of it, it's not something to apologize for anymore than the flames directed at me. Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and they all stink. Hope you have a good gaming experience and my guild doesn't ruin it for you.<br>

<br>
Why did we release the Sleeper? Because we wanted to. It was fun. It was a HARD fight (Ventani). Because it was there (just like the mountain).<br>
<br>
I had the opportunity to spend the weekend with Brad McQuaid at Buttonwillow Raceway (man his 911 Turbo is FAST) and he had some interesting comments. I mentioned that we released the Sleeper, and now the server was in an uproar.. know what he said? Here's a DIRECT QUOTE.<br>
<br>
Brad - &quot;You know.. people complained for a LONG time about not being a part of the EQ world and story. About not being able to change the world as a result of their actions. Then, after we add the VERY FIRST player modifiable content, they now complain about that too. Some people are just not happy unless they can complain about something&quot;<br>
<br>
So.. it's been a couple weeks now since we did it. Time to move on.. Time to get over it.<br>
<br>
As for the 'Ubers' not helping out.. You should consider asking VE who broke Fear, who saved them from the Golems, who gave them ALL of the armor drops only taking Dracoliche and CT for ourselves. Or ask NI who helped finish off Vindicator for them last week, rezzed them in so they could loot their BP, and then gave them close to 2 hours to prep for their 1st Statue attempt. That's right.. an 'Uber' guild. The dreaded, conniving, snake like Hoss no less.<br>
<br>
Basically.. all of us are tired of apologizing for being in more powerful guilds than you, or defending rediculous and nonsensical accusations of treachery or disrespect. You want some help from us.. you have to ASK. It's not going to be handed out on a silver platter.<br>
<br>
Thanks.. Drive through..<br>

<br>
An excellent example of today's societal mentality.  Twas done because WE wanted wanted to and WE could do it, irregardless of the consequences to others.  I suppose the same excuse could be used for camp stealing, KSing, leap-frogging, and ignoring raid reservations.  It seems the philosophies of at least two guilds of high lvls players are exactly the same.  <br>
<br>
Sadly Fiz, you cannot &quot;win&quot; this game, note the title &quot;Everquest&quot;.  Lots of people have beat the Sleeper before so twas nothing new.  As I understand it that Warder has even been killed before on this server, again nothing new.  I would think, with you expressing such a mentality, you folks would have a drive to do something new.  Any of you been in Vex Thal?  I would find that a lot more impressive.  Oh well. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

I mean, I can appreciate the fact that it prevents some people from getting primal gear, but there is another way to look at this.  There are very few guilds who were capable of killing the warders to begin with, and those that could were basically farming primal stuff, right?  I mean, there are plenty of other difficult mobs in the game that could provide the same or greater challenge, so it comes down to loot.  Now, even if the Sleeper was not released, the recent decision of Vindication to go FFA pretty much guarantees that either they or someone else would be in there all the time.  Would any up-and-coming guild really have a chance to get primal anyway?  Now there are fewer mobs that drop it, making it much more rare, so will the uber guilds continue to take the time?<br>
<br>
Hopefully the quest to recapture the Sleeper WILL get fixed soon, but in the meantime, maybe some of the other high-level zones will see a bit more activity.  It's kinda like the abundance of epic weapons -- primal stuff is not supposed to be common.  Perhaps the decision to release the Sleeper seems wrong to some, and I'm not saying that it was considerate to do it, but it's not worth the attention that it's being given, either to protest or defend a deed that has been done.<br>
<br>
And as for FFA, there were already a number of mid-level guilds who were NOT recognizing any reservation systems, either stating this, or just waltzing in to grab mobs.  It's not anything new, not even to this server, but it's just getting attention now that an established uber guild has openly stated that FFA is their policy.  I think people are just now becoming vocal about their concerns because of the &quot;I could happen to me!&quot; mentality, while some of us have been feeling the effects of FFA for months.  <br>
<br>
Those of you who have respected the reservation system(s) should continue to do so.  Those who do NOT honor such a system aren't going to start any time soon, and the playground doesn't need more bullies if you ask me.  Those of us who are willing to get along nicely should stick to it, and those who choose not to can fight with each other, each trying to one-up the other.<br>

Hi.  This is a game.  It's played to DO stuff.  You cannot compare it to a real world society.  It's completely unfathomable that you would even try.  <br>
<br>
But let's play along with your game and pretend this IS the real world.  Hoss applies for a really cool job that offers great benefits, fame and fortune.  You apply as well.  Hoss is more qualified for the job.  You lose out.  You throw a temper tantrum that you were not hired.  You blame the Hoss for being more qualified.  You blame the company for having only one job.  You key Hoss's car on your next trip past the office building!  You wind up looking like an ass.<br>

Actually, they didn't rule that out either. The developer (sorry, I forgot his name but it's the guy that did all the quests for SoL) said that perhaps they might put in a quest to put the Sleeper back after all the servers have had the Sleeper released. <br>
<br>
I doubt that would mean they would allow the warders to drop primals at the rate they did, tho. They didn't say so expressly but Abashi was harping a bit on other things that he thought was 'broken'. He mentioned CH's in fact. He didn't elaborate. <p>Macchan Draagonheart<BR>

I think it is likely that if they resolve this storyline, it will most likely be a similar experience to waking the sleeper and be another one time event.<br>
<br>
I don't remember where I read it, but someone at verant commented on how some players will never be happy (in response to a comment about awakening the sleeper and server being in an uproar). That statement has some merit, but at the same time they cannot deny the fact that at their first attempt at something like this, they made some serious mistakes. Ignoring this and blaming the players will not help them learn to do better in the future. They made an encounter that was supposed to be fun to do, but instead players wanted to farm the items instead. The fact that they put stuff on the warders that will never drop again, or will not drop nearly as much, is pretty ridiculous. The fact it makes people NOT want to do their neat little story should say a heck of a lot to them.  <br>
<br>
I think the best way to think about all this, is to just consider it a GM event without needing GMs. It is a shame if you miss it, but it doesn't take away from your eq experience. I have missed alot of neat GM events, but I got over it, and I got over this.<br>
<br>
In a way it is a shame it took this long to do it. The primal weapons that should rightfully be rare and special (because of the fact it is from a unique event, and because of how powerful), were relatively easy to get and became a sort of standard. Setting this standard and then just taking it away is wrong. How many GM event items shape the way the game is played forever afterwards?<br>
<br>
If these weapons were truly balanced in verants eyes, then if anything they should have been extremely rare before the sleeper was awakened, and then had drops the same as they are now for after being awakened. Reward the players for actually doing the storyline/quest, and maybe they will want to do it. If you could get your epic by only doing half of the quest, would you finish the quest anyway? How many people do quests they know are broken?<br>
<br>
Oh well, sort of lost my train of thought now. This is just my opinion, you don't have to agree. Heck I might change my mind next week, or tomorrow even! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have no real experience with any &quot;uber&quot; encounters, the baddest mob I ever helped kill was maestro, and my only experience with primal weapons was seeing someone's primal proc in a group a few times, which I might not have even noticed if it didn't prevent my buffs from sticking. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uwoolhead.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Woolhead</A> at: 1/28/02 11:30:33 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 296<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/29/02 1:06:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=98>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> Sirensa, predominate opinion on the server is that your guild as a whole looks like an ass.

Yes, it is a game, so why would do you even care about people's opinions of what you do in said game?  You seem to, as does Fizbain.  In fact some of you are quite upset.  Why?  Answer, it is a game that emulates a fictional life.  A fictional like that most people who make it to 60 have invested a great deal of time and effort in.  In the end when bad things happen in the game it effects people in the real world.  If it didn't you would not have taken such pride in releasing the Sleeper.  So as I often hear ubers exclaiming &quot;kk, thx la~&quot;.<br>

Because someone will always be upset, no matter what someone does.  When you have a group of people one decision will matter.  Not to you maybe but to the next person it might.<br>

There are those that enjoy life and those that bitch about what others have.  Sometimes, just because.<br>
