the GM was so in their pocket that he was TLing L`malla's CR people and clerics OUT of the zone while trying to do a CR as Vindi trained the CR process 3 times and then the GM had the fat gonads to try and blame us and thats when Deadsouls said it in shout it was him.<br>
Malla had already cleared the first 7 dragons in ntov and Vindi did the hop up in front and went from there.(against the pnp that the GM quoted)<br>
and before a damn one of you try to deny it  , I have SS of most of the event .<br>
<br>
let me go a little further here and quote from Linlainu's post.<br>
(On another note, not everyone understands just exactly what FFA means. Most people assume that Vindi is going to spend all their time ksing YOUR mobs )<br>
well thats a damn good assumption so far isnt it?<br>
<br>
(To have someone tell me that the act of people in my guild gives them enough warrant to send me.. nasty tells.. disrespect me.. and even forfeit our &quot;friendship&quot; is ridiculous)<br>
but it is ok for you to KS and screw over people and they should still call you friend? what you did wasn't disrespectful? nasty?<br>
<br>
(We have no plans of zoning in and ksing mobs from smaller guilds that are already set up. )  I guess L`malla killing the first 7 NTOV dragons  and then to have Vindi come in and jump ahead doesnt apply to this statement huh?<br>
<br>
(Now to tell my Im a bad person, or not worthy of a friendship because of that.. )  I'll be the first to tell you, you are not worthy of my friendship,  take it as you will, I dont expect you to be heartbroken over it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udantari.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Dantari</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 5<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 12:07:12 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication declares FFA</span><hr size=1>   My two cents here.  I do not speak for my guild here, only for myself.<br>
 <br>
  IGB has been a very respectable effort on the parts of all Druzzil Ro players to keep the game on our server civilized, friendly, and honorable.   The rotation gives everyone a fair shot at the good stuff.<br>
 <br>
  Along comes Vindi and declares that they will not follow this rotation, or abide by this gentlemanly set of rules that the rest of us adhere to.  Regardless of weather this is an occasional disregard of the rotation or a frequent one... it makes no difference.   Either way I see it as unfair, as I am sure that many others do.<br>
 <br>
  Vindi has done this as a GUILD.   This effectively says that everyone within that GUILD supports this type of disregard for other peoples gameplay, and also supports the decision to go FFA.   To be associated with a guild such as this is to say that each individual member supports these type of actions.  <br>
   <br>
  Are there some members of this guild that are good people?  Perhaps there are, but thats beside the point.   But then again, good people don't act like this.<br>
 <br>
  I may be a very small fish in a very large pond, and it may mean nothing to anyone that I say this..  but I will never again group with or help any member of Vindication so long as this guild engages in this type of gameplay.<br>
<br>
   Does this matter to them?   Probably not.<br>
   <br>
   Does it matter to me?   Yes, indeed it does.   <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

It's only a matter of time before you really screw up, and end up disbanded permanently. FFA if you want, but I bet it won't work out as nicely for you as you have planned.

evidentily when they are bored, they decide to screw over another guild. well, we need to stand up to this not as a guild or two, but as a server. bullies dont wanna play when they are outnumbered. and as for that GM, he was not our server GM. our server GM is bogell. and as for him booting ppl out of the zone, talk to VI and they will investigate him and if he is caught with bias towards Vindi , he wont be on our server any more ever. same thing happened to xzott. <p>Why bake cookies when you can steal them

<br>
Hopefully all the good people I know in Vindi will realize that this is something they shouldn't support and leave Vindi. IGB is what makes Druzzil Ro such a GREAT server to be on because it allows everyone their fair shot at the big encounters. I just hope that everyone boycotts ANY member of Vindication until they either dissolve of their own accord or realize that they made a poor choice. I for one will be doing my best not to buy, sell, trade, group, port, rez, etc. with ANY member of Vindication. <br>
<br>
Yeah, yeah people will still be able to do epics (cept the cleric one cause no rotation on that means that clerics will have to take days off of work just to camp Zordak to have him KSed I have read about this happening to multiple people on multiple FFA servers...<br>
<br>
FFA is not FUN, it SUCKS for all involved unfortunately I don't think Vindi will realize how good IGB is once they get they realize that they will be getting less chances on rotation mobs =)<br>
<br>
IGB will go on, only Vindi won't be on it =) GRAT ML, Hoss and L'Malla and whatever other guilds are on the top end encounter rotations on IGB you all just got one less guild you have to share with =)<br>
<br>
NOTE: My opinion is no way a reflection of how my guild feels (well maybe it is but I cannot speak for them let each speak their own).<br>

It seems to me you have no idea what you're talking about. At this point in time Vindication has probably enough people on to do almost any mob in the game (aside from AoW\tunare\etc.) on at most times of the day. While a decent guild is prepping for their first shot at ubermobx, vindication will come in and kill it because it is FFA. Rotations don't work unless everyone agrees to it. They can kill any mobs whenever they want now. Hell they already did Vyemm , Vulak , and Tormax (and they probably are not done) in the first day. You <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> cannot</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have a IGB rotation if one guild(one that can kill everything that the other guilds can kill) doesn't agree to it.<br>

They ARE prepared to be exiled from Dro...they have been prepared...and they chose the perfect time that was in their best interest, what else do they really need from anyone but themselves?...<br>
<br>
IMO, Vindi could be de-guilded, players banned, and never heard from again, and I would not be affected one bit by it...You guys are assholes, the definition of it...and unfortunently, I can do nothing about it by myself, nor anyone else...<br>

I am incredibly disappointed and sadened at this new development.  <br>
<br>
The only queries that I put to Vindication are...<br>
<br>
If you all truely believe that what you've done is ok, then why are you all /anon?<br>
<br>
Are you worried that everybody else would flame you in game?<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
If what you've done is ok and acceptable then why would anyone flame you?<br>
<br>
Hmmm, Could it be that you knew this decision would be unwelcome among the ENTIRE server community and have thus chosen to remain hidden among the shadows of /anon as a common thief?<br>
<br>
Can any decision that goes against the wishes of an entire population be the just and correct one?<br>
<br>
I am not in a &quot;rotation&quot; guild, nor have I ever been, and I did have my issues with it.  However, I also believed that it was a relatively decent way of doing things.  <br>
<br>
But now, whenever a guild wants to do a rare type spawn they will have to be on guard hoping that another &quot;bigger&quot; fish does not decide they want to play in the same pond at the same time...<br>
<br>
How can that be fun?<br>

<br>
One thing no one mentioned from the post from three months ago is that they also mentioned in that post that when they went FFA that they were going to actively try to prevent other guilds from getting primals or other higher end equipment to prevent them from becoming capable of taking the &quot;uber&quot; mobs because they thought that there by far too many toons at that level already and did not want any more crowding at the high end.<br>
<br>
To me this means that they will try to shut down the more desirable raid oriented epics (cleric epics for one) to prevent more of these items from coming into the server, thus preventing up and coming guilds able to raid effectively and &quot;threaten their supply of uber mobs&quot;.  I would also think that they might try to waken the Sleeper so that they don't have to camp dragons all day to shut down the primal supply.<br>
<br>
Perhaps just my paranoid thoughts, nothing more but I don't think that it is much of a stretch to infer from their posts. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uspensesunhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spense Sunhawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Otterphiliac</span><br>  Posts: 100<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 2:50:55 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=62>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> well...</span><hr size=1> Thompok I don't know who you are and I don't know if your up there in the levels, but you don't really seem to know the guilds on this server. ML is the guild that can be anywhere at anytime because they are the largest guild. Hoss who does it with less has more skill then Vindication. Vindication is not that large and I don't know why you think they could just walk in when ML, L`Malla or Hoss is in the middle of setting up to kill a mob and take it over (NToV is a different situation since they took other mobs not the ones that we were prepping for which we had to give up because of some Lame GM who wasn't even from our server.)<br>
<br>
This is a mess. I wish it wouldn't have happened because it really ruined a lot of our nights. Just because some people are selfish pricks who get off on doing things like this to others. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=nitsua>nitsua</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 2:54:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=63>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication declares FFA</span><hr size=1> Does anyone else find it funny that half of the people that are bitching and moaning about FFA in this post will never see any of these mobs?
