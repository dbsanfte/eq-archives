The example of Fear  primarily occurs because of CT.  There are a lot of guilds that can do Fear, and so they schedule raids. When CT is up, the guild whose turn it is to kill him shows up, tells whoever is there to fook off IGB overwrites any reservation on this board, then continues to wipe the zone out.  It wouldn't be hard for the guild wanting CT to allow the guild who has the reservation to complete their raid, or hell even assist them, then take out what they want.  What typically happens is that uber guild x goes in for CT, will see some rares up, then say to hell with the other guild we want epic drops etc etc for ourselves.  The trend is, the upper crust of the uber guilds actually help out, Mythic Legion and Hoss are a couple of examples.  It is the lower echelon of the IGB guilds that get greedy, probably because of need but who knows.  We have a good thing going on D-ro as far as not being FFA.  I hope it stays that way, but to make it work, guilds have to respect reservations.  For some, Fear is the hardest, and best raid they can do, but it gets spoiled when someone shows up and busts it.  I just hope the guilds that have a reputation for running over the smaller guilds dont whine when someone busts in on their raid.  It's really gonna suck when a small, non-IGB guild goes and ninja kills a ragefire, or maybe gets  capable of killing some of the IGB rotation mobs themselves and says,&quot;remember that time when....&quot;  What goes around comes around.  I've been playing EQ for 2 years now and remember when some of the so called uber guilds couldnt do hate and fear without help...didnt take too long to get to where they are, and it wont take that long for a lesser guild you are screwing over to get to where they can really screw you over and get some payback.  To baalzebuth, perhaps you should check for gramatical errors as well...&quot;You should try to format your post, check for spelling and grammar errors&quot;...not a gramatically correct sentence, you have what is called a comma splice.  If you are going to be so bold as to respond to someone's post by referring to their spelling and grammar in a dimunitive manner, you sure as hell better make sure that your typing is solid if that is the only thing that you can contribute to the thread.  I probably have some proofreading errors in my post as well, but if I lacked any ability to present an argument and could only type, &quot;me smart, you dumb, you no spell good&quot;....then I believe I would have done a better job of it than yourself.  Don't knock on people for spelling if you are uncapable of knocking on what they are saying.   <p><br><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~jazzy/maric_sig.gif" border="0">

I'm not going to comment on the IGB/Normal reservation list. This is a dead horse.<br>
<br>
what I'm gonna comment on is the grammar flames. There's an unwritten rule on any public forum, brought over from Usenet.<br>
<br>
&quot;Any Grammar or Spelling flame must contain a grammatical error or misspelling of it's own&quot;<br>
<br>
and it's true, 98% of the time, in my experience.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, and this is my point, the original poster's work was very difficult for me to read due to the high amount of misspellings and grammatical grumble. You appear to have some editing skills of your own, perhaps you would like to post a revisied &quot;cleaned up&quot; version of that original statement, for the easier perusal of the D-Ro readers. <br>

<br>
heres my idea for a solution.(Non refers to any guild that isn't a member of the IGB. IGB does duh!)<br>
<br>
When there is a conflict because of a unscheduled patch or a failed attempt by IGB, IGB and Non should try to work out a solution between the guildmasters (or the leaders of the raids). If a solution cannot be reached by the 2 guilds, then IGB should get the raid. &quot;Might makes right&quot;.(dont get uptight just yet.) When a Non guild schedules a raid, in the same post, schedule an alternate date. This alternate date will be their bump date. This date they would have the right to the zone, and no bumping would be allowed by the IGB guilds, their timer would not start until the Non guilds raid is done.<br>
(exceptions: If the Non guild doesn't have enough people to make a viable attempt. The Non guilds' Raid time should be respected by the IGB guild, the number of Non guildies to make a viable attempt,  would have to be worked out by the Guildmasters.<br>
<br>
I think this would work out for the smaller guilds because they would be able to at least try every other raid scheduled at least 3 weeks in advance. These smaller guilds need a higher % of their members to attend to make the raid successful and need to be able to schedule a raid without always having to dread a possible patch and the likelyhood of not being able to run their raid as planned.<br>
<br>
I think that this would work out for the IGB guilds because they get first dibs on the zone, (specifically it might not be their guild, however IGB does get priority in general terms) Also, unscheduled patches are a bonus to the IGB guilds, a quicker pop means less waiting for their turn. So even if a Non guild with &quot;bump&quot; date has the right to the zone under these guidelines, ultimately there was less waiting for that IGB mob. Also, if an IGB guild fails on a mob, it pushes the mobs timetable out 24 hours..this could interupt a planned raid for a Non guild, which had no control over IGBs' schedule changing. <br>
<br>
Ok, your guild has a bump date and their is a conflict...what happens now? You should still try and work things out with the IGB guild, try and work together.<br>
If thats unacceptable, you should be given a chance to complete  your raid. The IGB guilds timer would start when the Non guilds raid is done or when they call it off.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, we all need to get our guildmasters and guildmistresses on the same page when it comes down to common raids. Right now as it stands, there will be more conflicts happening as Verant hurriedly slaps band-aids all over, patch after patch.<br>
<br>
<br>
Couple general rules. If Non schedules a raid and they have a lack of support to attempt their raid and it is called off, no bump status for their alternate date, and if there is a conflict...tough bananas.<br>
<br>
Responsibilty of the Non guilds include<br>
1. Post 3 weeks in advance a raid date and a bump date.<br>
2. Make sure you bump date doesnt conflict with a scheduled raid of other Non guilds and of course the IGB guilds.<br>
3. When scheduling a raid make sure you dont schedule on someones bump date.<br>
<br>
Responsibilty of the IGB guilds<br>
1. Respect the bump dates and times.<br>
2. Resetting the timer in case of a bump date conflict for the IGB guild in question.<br>
3. Accept the fact that if there is a failed attempt made by an IGB guild, this will change the mobs spawn date and the resulting conflict on a bump date is IGB's fault not the Non's.<br>
(even though it might not have been YOUR guild who failed)<br>
<br>
Well thats my idea, if the Guilds could agree on a set of rules to follow, there would be less arguing and more compromise. There has to be compromise on both sides.  Hopefully Verant can get these quick fix patches over and the mobs can settle down to a more normal schedule. Even if this happens, I still think there should be an agreed upon set of rules due to failed raids, and zone repops(if they affect the IGB mobs)<br>
<br>
Lets stay constructive in this thread so it doesn't get sent off to The Void. We should, as adults, be able to sit down and calmly come up with a solution that works for the majority of the guilds regardless of their status being IGB or Non.<br>
<br>
Certain things would have to be discussed by Guildmasters, these include<br>
1. Limit of alternate days allowed on board for any one mob per guild. <br>
2. number of players (and levels) that would make up a viable raid for Non guilds<br>
3. anything else I might be overlooking which might come up<br>
<br>
If this post does nothing but get the Guildmasters talking to each other to find a solution, was worth it. <br>
<br>
Lets try to keep this thread constructive.<br>

<br>
Damn qixid's long post popped up after I clicked to add this post hehe...As far as solutions, you can make a million rules, talk about a million situations...but if a guild wants something in a zone, they will find a way to turn the rules in their favor and take it.  The guilds that reserve Fear on this board want one thing, the guild on IGB wants something else...it's not hard to work something out so both get what they want.  The problems come up when one of the guilds try to take something both guilds want, like golems and other shizits.  I'm sure the smaller guild who has reserved Fear really doesnt care that the uber guild is in the zone....what they care about is when they go on a killing spree and start taking stuff.  Yeah CT summons the zone and everything has to be killed fast to leave a big window...there is no reason they cant talk to the other guild who had it reserved and let them loot the stuff they came for.  That doesnt mean just the stuff they dont want either.  Everyone wants golems, fright, dread yada yada yada...but hey, the IGB guild has to make sacrifices to get what they want just like the other guild has to make sacrifices.  Now my guild has had guilds roll in on our raids on a few occasions...it wouldnt be so bad if the response I got when I said wazah? wasnt the usual fook off we are here there is nothing you can do about it.  I mean really, if someone acted the way some of these guild representatives act to me in RL, I'd kick their ass right off this damn planet.  It's real frustrating when that happens.  Now it doesnt always happen, some guilds are very much ready to work something out and be cool...but there are also a couple that really dont give a rats ass about other people.  I dont think the problem is with IGB, or even the guilds that are a part of IGB...the problem is with those handful of dickhead officers that some of the guilds have who, despite their guild itself being cool peeps who dont wanna steal stuff, decide to be arrogant and have that powerhouse mentality.  I mean damn, just be cool and make some effort to not walk over little guilds.   <p><br><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~jazzy/maric_sig.gif" border="0">

Arguing this point just makes the smaller guilds more disgruntled and the Uber guilds more defiant. <br>
<br>
They don't see eye to eye and there is lack of respect and understanding on both sides.<br>
<br>
No one is at fault, but arguing the point and pointing fingers of blame only makes the situation worse. <br>
<br>
So lock this or bump or something until people can speak without threats or &quot;promises&quot; and without pointing fingers.<br>
<br>
