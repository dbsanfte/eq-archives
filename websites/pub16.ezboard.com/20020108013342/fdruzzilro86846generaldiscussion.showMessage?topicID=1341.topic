I don't mind being a snarer or puller because I can get a little action then, but I hate to be used just to feed mana and I hate to be used just for corpse summoning.<br>
<br>
Let's take Old Sebilis for example...  Unless you're an enchanter, tank, and/or cleric, you will not find a group too often if never at all.  I like to hunt there because of the fast pulls, nice gems and nice items, but, whenever I go there I can't find a group so I have to hunt elsewhere to get my exp.  Necros are useless in places like that, and I admit that.  Only time I ever get a group down there is if I ask a necropsis scarab group if I can get next on the list to join, or someone just happens to put a group together and go somewhere, and neither happen too often if never.  And it's the same way as Velk's Lab, also.<br>
<br>
Our Screaming Terror spell, the &quot;ghetto mez&quot; is worthless, our heals are decent but not as good as clerics not to mention we have to work extra hard to heal and heal ourselves in the process, our snares are awesome but only lasts for 3 minutes, our lifetaps are great for us when we need the health, our DoTs are awesome and the best.  I hate to walk into a zone like sebilis and not get a group.  I hate to walk into a zone like Cobalt Scar and find quad kiters are taking everthing in site, and not even care.  So where do I go hunt?  Ocean of Tears.  I either solo seafuries, or I get one or two people to join me and kill Allizewsaur(different story).<br>
<br>
Basically, only thing we can do is solo, that's what we were made for.  No group, unless you're helping your respected guild(s) on a raid or get in an exp group, are going to take you because you can't mez, heal, or tank.  That's just the way it is, at least in my own experience.<br>

Coming from a guild that is tank-light and necro-heavy, I love having necros in any group, any dungeon.  Necro pet + necro dot = a lot of dead critters.  If one class can solo, it seems to me they should make a great contribution to a group.  I've never understood the logic that says it's otherwise.<br>
<br>
Diablerie has done some pretty awesome (and odd, but fun) things utilizing the strengths we have.  Yes, a 5 person group of 52s with one tank (plus necro pet) CAN take Tserrina down (we were told we couldn't...after the fact), and one necro and one enchanter can hold Frenzy.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
All classes have strengths to add to a group.  It's when you start comparing class A to class B and nitpicking about the miniscule damage differences that one has over the other that you get problems.  It's a game, and the best part about it is having fun with the people behind the toons.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p><BR>

Our mezzing is worthless, compared to a chanter, but if I can keep some baddy frogs off my friends for at least 15 seconds, it makes all the difference (rather have a necro dead than your tanks/clerics).  Hard to keep healed and Pact? No it isn't.  I've NEVER had a problem keeping myself healed, Pacting and STing all at the same time.  Not to brag, but you do have to practice these methods to make them affective.<br>
<br>
Your CS complaints are very well grounded.  I hate going there and finding nothing to hunt.  Allize is a descent source and if you ever need a partner, let me know (I love killing that &amp;*^*&amp;)<br>
<br>
Don't downsize yourself as a necro.  Try getting a group from your guild to go and test different stradegies with them.  In seb we have our uses, if not for anything but for mana feeding.  If ya don't like it, make a different char.  Like I've said before you make of your character what you can.<br>
<br>
I think too many times necros want to use their soloing spells when in groups and I don't use any of them when I am in a group.  We aren't tanks, we aren't dmg dealers.  We have a role and I can deal with it.  If you can't deal with it, make an alt, that's what I do when I get sick of being used for mana.<br>

<br>
Not many people remember how sucky rogues were back when EQ came out, but I managed to make friends, join groups, and level up though that time.<br>
<br>
Did it have anything to do with my class's abilities? hell no, Rogues sucked.<br>
<br>
But I always had a good attitude, always tried hard, tried to be freindly, and let people know what I could bring to the group.<br>
<br>
Now that's 'kind of' a different story, but here's kinda how it relates...<br>
<br>
ANY class, when played skillfully is usefull in ANY group. If you sit at zone in hollering for a group, no ones probably gonna take you up on it, but if you take initiative, add like people at the zone, kill stuff that you can handle while waiting, chat with people, try out your 'ghetto mez' skills, and work hard, you'll run into less and less problems finding a group, IMO.<br>
<br>
I've grouped in 2's and 3's with every single class out there, and done excellent, had a good time, got some experience, and learned a little more about what people can do.<br>
<br>
Necro rogue fear kiting = way less mana used, necro tank, with lifetaps and 'heals' = slow exp, BUT doable (esp while your sitting around looking for a group), etc. <br>
<br>
Keep your chin up, keep a positive attitude, and take some initiative to grouping. <br>
<br>
Necro's can solo some of the zone stuff in Seb, right? well, invite that other lfg person, and pull that mob, and see what they can bring to the fight. Sure, be carefull, adjust your strategy, but help each other out and learn some new things.<br>

I know what I can do and I know how good I am at doing it.  It's when someone tells you no and compares you to another class.  Like say when I want to get in a group and snare, and mind you I snare very well with darkness AND I am a decent puller, not the best, but decent, and someone compares you to that of a druid.  I have all the respect for druids, don't get me wrong, but, what other classes can snare and dot in the same spell?  3 minutes?  yeah 3 minutes is not that much compared to a 10 minute snare, BUT, if no druid, then necros would be great to have in your group.  IF by chance you have a druid AND necro, guess what, druid snares, necro casts 5 DOTs including their lifetap dot.  OMG, can you spell dead critter?  Imagine a group like this in a place like sebilis: Enchanter for crowd control, Cleric for healing/rezzing, Warrior or Paladin for tanking, Necromancer for DoT and 53lvl+ pet for additional tanking/backstabbing, druid for snaring/some healing, and another class that could nuke, tank, backstab or pet class.  When you look at that, that's one helluva group.  And I like the kind of group where we can be used IN CONJUCTION with a class who has at least one or two similar abilities because you can stack 5 DoTs on critters.  I like to be used for things other than corpse summoning and bitch twitch.  I like being in the shit where we can make things happen and everyone is happy.  I don't like being called on just to summon someone's corpses and then left back looking for a group to hunt to gain exp.  We solo good, and we have lots of contributions to make to a group besides sending people mana. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukasyra.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kasyra</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 57<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(10/11/01 3:52:15 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.hawkee.com/fallout/lenore1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Necromancers in general..</span><hr size=1> If you think our 'ghetto mezzes' are worthless, its no wonder no one wants to group with you.

You do have to admit that our mezzes are not as good as a chanters (ST doesn't work on all mobs), but in the right place it ROCKS).<br>
<br>
The best place for a necro I have been 50+ is HS (aka Charassis).  There are a lot of undeads that we can mezz and charm easily and our undead DDs are so mana efficient it's rediculous.  Anyway, I love my nec, I know how to use it and I have many friends from many guilds that will attest to it.  You must unlearn that which you have learned LOL.  Seriously, experiment with your char and play it with pride, no matter what class.  Cause in this game, if you don't put your own spin into your character, you'll just be like all the rest.<br>

What might of great use in this thread (and hopefully a way to steer it out of the nasty post void, Lord knows we've seen enough posts go that way today) would be for Deca or anyone else to post some thoughts on what a necro *can* do for a group.  I.E., what makes a good necro, what spells to use, what tactics to use, etc.<br>
<br>
I think this would be of particular use from non-necros, as they're the ones who hold the opinion on whether or not the necro should be in a group.  <br>
