Hello Nikki I hope that you are well soon. Do I beleive in Aliens? That's funny Nikki. If you don't understand where I stand then I must be doing something right. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I beleive in the &quot;possiblity&quot; of aliens. Is there a difference that I am missing somewhere? I like ideas and thats what I really beleive in...ideas that engender thought. The idea of aliens being ghosts or thought transmissions or anything of that nature.... I can go with those ideas. I am more for the idea of letting people beleive whatever they want to beleive and to feel however they feel like feeling. I think we're saying the same thing really... Respect is where it's at and where it should always be...it's the beginning of everything that we want to be good and right in<br>
this world. Without it there is nothing.  <br>
<br>
The idea that the earth is winding down or de-evolving is held by some physicists. I'll look it up on the net and see if I can find it.  It's a valid argument in the field of physics that the earth is winding down to the end times....therefore being reduced back to the big bang. Which is a wierd saying and I can't figure out how they came up with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  For scientists they certainly lack imagination. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   This would be only in the evolutionary theory though. I think we have to many topics going here! I'm known for doing that. What the scientists beleive again is only an opinion as are all things. And opinions should never stand in the way...they should just be food for a good debate! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Take care Nikki <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

It is interesting what you say about the de-evolving of this world.  Scientists believe we are winding down to the end times?  That is very interesting indeed!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I never really thought about it that way, but it does seem to fit what I believe about the changing world.  I do believe that is happening, the winding down towards the end times, I just never heard of it termed de-evolving before.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   It's a contradictory term in a sense, because along with this change comes so many wonderful things, but that is a topic for another post, not in this one.<br>
<br>
Bravo to you for having the openness and capacity to realize that every individual has a right to believe what it is they want to believe, and find their own truth, that's the way it's supposed to be!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I agree that opinions should be food for thought and a good debate, or discussion.  That's why we're all here, to learn from eachother, to share opinions.  Is Godman still out there?  Haven't read a post from him in a while.  I hope I didn't offend him. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   That would not be my intentions.<br>
<br>
What else could we throw in to the 'aliens do not exist' theory?  I like how you think about it, I respect that perspective... aliens could be anything, the possibilities of aliens is what you believe.  You don't count it out.  I like that view!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Personally, I believe they exist, as for exactly what they are I suppose nobody can say for sure as we as a society have no information on that.  Although, the governments certainly do.  Area 51 anyone? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I hope so. I don't think that we can scare the Godman away! He's seems to be a <br>
introspective person with a firm hold on his beleifs, not one to be persuaded easily into beleiving things but once convinced of something little will change his mind...kind, sincere and honest he opens himself to criticism in the search for truth. (I'm trying to sell a vacumn cleaner here!)

You will probably never see the word de-evolving anywhere. I made it up. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I didn't know what they call the unwinding of the universe and that was really in answer to God-mans egg question. It would only fit<br>
if the egg could support life on it's own to begin with that it must have gone through a series of de-evolution to end up needing a chicken to hatch it! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I have some stuff to post for you about the big <br>
bang theory. It's interesting really. If you like that kind of stuff. <br>
<br>
If i didn't beleive in possiblities I would close the doors to everything that I beleive in the most.<br>
That which I can't see. I can't see you or Godman but I am going to take it that your out there somewhere. haha Under that assumption I will say that just because you can't see something doesn't mean that it doesn't exist?? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Also since we do exist I have to say that during the big bang that's it''s possible that a <br>
split happened and that there is a twin world out there that is just like ours...if one world can evolve why not two? As  things in the universe are made through splitting and pairing of things I don't see why it's not possible that we have a twin world that split off from us during the process called the big bang and became the shadow world or the world of things that we cannot see but only percieve. It could also be inhabited with the ghosts that God man beleives in. They evolved in an entirely different form than us...something that  looks like us but has the use of other powers or abilities that we didn't evolve with. (Maybe I should write a book! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) In other words Ghosts or anything like that live in the twin world  which we can see and partly understand through our senses but can't bridge the gap between because the door between them is not one that we are able to cross into for long or vice versa.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  The possiblity of turning this into a book is definitly there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  And it is really out There! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   So I'll move on. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Why did you beleive that we are winding down? I found that an interesting statement. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Heres the information about the  big bang theory and the quantum leap inbetween to the end of the universe. I hope we can come up with something to convince God-man that something exists somewhere....just if it's to keep him here debating.  I have to look at your link about Karma....now that's something I really don't understand. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Take care okay and thanks for the post. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rollin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/roll.gif ALT=":rollin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Cosmology<br>
<br>
                The currently accepted cosmological model is the big bang.<br>
In this<br>
                picture, the expansion of the universe began with an<br>
intense<br>
                explosion roughly 15,000,000,000 years ago. In this<br>
primordial<br>
                fireball, the temperature exceeded 1012 K and most of the<br>
energy<br>
                was in the form of radiation. As the expansion proceeded<br>
                (accompanied by cooling), the role of the radiation became<br>
                diminished and other physical processes dominated in turn.<br>
Thus,<br>
                after about one minute, the temperature had dropped to the<br>
                1,000,000,000 K range, making it possible for nuclear<br>
reactions to<br>
                take place and produce deuterons and helium nuclei. (At the<br>
higher<br>
                temperatures that prevailed earlier, these nuclei would<br>
have been<br>
                promptly disrupted by high-energy photons.) With further<br>
                expansion, the time between nuclear collisions would have<br>
                increased and the proportion of deuterons and helium nuclei<br>
would<br>
                have stabilized. After a few hundred thousand years, the<br>
                temperature must have dropped sufficiently for electrons to<br>
remain<br>
                attached to nuclei to constitute atoms. Galaxies are<br>
thought to have<br>
                begun forming after a few million years, but this stage is<br>
still very<br>
                poorly understood. Star formation probably started much<br>
later, after<br>
                some billions of years, and the process continues today.<br>
<br>
                The observational support for this general model comes from<br>
several<br>
                independent directions. The expansion has been documented<br>
by the<br>
                galactic redshifted spectra. The radiation left over from<br>
the original<br>
                fireball would have cooled with the expansion. One of the<br>
most<br>
                striking discoveries of the 20th century came in 1965 with<br>
the<br>
                observation of a widespread cosmic radiation corresponding<br>
to a temperature of close to 3 K. <br>
<br>
                ...................quantum leap to end.......<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
                Finally, there is the question of the future behaviour of<br>
the universe:<br>
                Is it open? That is to say, will the expansion continue<br>
indefinitely? Or<br>
                is it closed, so that the expansion will slow down and<br>
eventually<br>
                reverse, resulting in contraction? The outcome hinges on<br>
the total<br>
                mass of the universe. For this reason, the extent of the<br>
dark matter<br>
                (the missing mass) may be decisive. The amount of luminous<br>
mass<br>
                currently known to exist is insufficient to close the<br>
universe, but if<br>
                dark matter is universally present in the quantities<br>
suggested by<br>
                galactic rotation or galactic-cluster dynamics, then the<br>
universe will<br>
                be closed. An additional factor might be the mass of<br>
neutrinos.<br>
                Theoretically postulated to have zero mass, neutrinos are<br>
now<br>
                experimentally known to have a mass less than 1/10,000 that<br>
of the<br>
                electron. Because there are so many neutrinos in the<br>
universe,<br>
                neutrino masses even as small as this might render the<br>
universe<br>
                closed. The issue remains unresolved, although the<br>
detection of<br>
                neutrinos (albeit only 19 of them) associated with a<br>
supernova<br>
                observed in 1987 suggests that neutrino mass is probably<br>
less than<br>
                the critical value postulated.<br>

I am convinced that I now know who Niki is! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I haven't been on my computer in about a week or so, and I woke up this morning to find a &quot;Where did you go...&quot; message.  So here I am.  And boy are my eyes tired from reading <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  !  Ok, so much to reply to...   I guess I start here and work my way backwards.  BatWoman you are 100% correct, many &quot;scientists&quot; believe that the universe will yo-yo and after it's done expanding collapse back in on itself.  This is mostly irrelevant because it will take millions and zillions of years to find out.  So I'm not too worried.  My egg theory is not quite understood it seems.  I think that a chicken-like bird for whatever reason laid an egg that hatched to become a chicken, either evolution or some mutation caused this change.  The chicken-like bird of course hatched the egg and raised the ugly kid as a loving parent.  Then that Chicken went on to be a pornstar within the chicken-like community, and unfortunately there was no 'protection' back then and now we have lots of chickens...   OR maybe chickens were created in a lab in 2643 by a scientist named Col. Sanders  He then time travelled back and planted these lab chickens everywhere, then he travelled forward in time and established KFC.  Clearly we must give great thanks and praise to him for Yummy chicken!  I haven't eaten breakfast yet, sorry.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah, thanks for the compliments Bat Woman.  My pea-sized ego grew immensly to the size of a peanut when I read them, even if you are a professional vacuum saleswoman.  <br>
<br>
Ok, now for the ludicrous arguements that Niki has presented to me...  I believe much like Merc in the vast possibilities.  I believe people can and should believe whatever they want to believe.  I'm very open minded.  I think if you want to think like Adolf Hitler good for you, after all everyone should be allowed to think however they want...  NOT!  Clearly the only reason anyone is nice to each other is this, &quot;I don't want THAT to happen to me, so no one should be allowed to do THAT&quot;.  This is why a society can agree on laws and 'morals'.  Not because humans are a superior race of animal.  We don't kill our weak simply because we don't want to have to deal with the day that we'll be the weaker one and get killed.  So we make rules by which we'll play the game.  The stronger more aggressive people become millionaires.  The weak stay poor and unable to pull themselves from the rut that they live in.  Do rich people want to kill all the poor people?  NO.  Someone has to work in factories, be garbagemen, plumbers, maids, butlers, chauffers, and anything else they don't want to deal with.  Not that any of these jobs are inferior, clearly they all have their place in society, but I'm sure that MOST garbagemen and plumbers wouldn't be doing that if they were Millionaires.  So the rich make sure that the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.  There is very little chance for there to be any change in this situation.  Is this not the Strong surviving the best?  The meek shall inherit the earth...  But will there be an earth to inherit?  How many homeless people have you allowed to move into your home?  All of them, I'm sure as you're such an evolved human and you love all others.  What about people that get out of prison with $50 and a bus ticket?  You definately need to take some of them in, rapists and thieves need love too right?  Or maybe the brainwashed 'morals' that so many claim to cling to only apply in theory and not in reality.  It would be 100% correct to say that the majority of all Americains are Christians.  Where is the brotherly love for thy neighbor then?  Why are people still starving in the richest country in the world?  Must be because we are SO superior to other animals on this planet.  Pets are clearly there to help fill the void in our lives.  We don't want to feel alone, and it is nice to feel like GOD sometimes.  There is nothing that you can do to a dog to stop it from 'loving' you.    <br>
<br>

If you believe in possibilities at all, why can't the aliens be as I have described?  Because you don't want to believe it is about all I can think of.  Certainly there is just as good a chance that aliens will be nice as that they will be 'human'.  I think that everything must be done out of motivation, so I would say that a nice loving race of helpful aliens would only be that way because they are aware of some meaner aliens and are looking for allies to ultimately help them defend themselves from the meaner aliens.  The possibilities are endless.  The real problem lies in that there are NO ALIENS to conduct such activities.  Clearly there are NONE. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unikihebb.showPublicProfile?language=EN>nikihebb</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 63<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/6/00 9:25:08 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Interesting Godman.</span><hr size=1> Thanks for responding.  I see that we have differing viewpoints on many things, which is ok.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I would take in a hungry or homeless person if they wished, and I knew they wouldn't harm my daughter.  As for rapists and murderers, you are right, they also deserve love, but they don't deserve to go unpunished for their crimes, an eye for an eye dear Godman.  I am not a capital punishment supporter, so they must be incarcerated, but there is a lack in the prisons of help for the souls of these people, but that is for another topic.  I have been raped, but I have forgiven the rapists, and hold no malice towards them.  They will learn their lessons the way they must, I was just an unfortunate party to their life path is all.  This is my belief on things.  I really try not to judge, as my favorite personal quote is &quot;judge not, for you will become that which you judge&quot;.<br>
<br>
So, do I see myself as evolved?  I am no better or no less than anybody else, we just all see things our own way.  That is what I believe, it is my spiritual path.  So when you say would I love a rapist or murderer?  The answer would be yes, I love them as a soul in the Earth School, learning the lessons it's supposed to.  I view every person with the same non-judgemental attitude.  That doesn't mean I bare my soul to them, I chose not to marry a convicted murderer or rapist, get real.  They are a danger to others until the time that they see and feel the result of their own actions, until the time they whole heartedly feel the regret for what it is they've done.  That may not happen in this lifetime for that person, and if it doesn't, and they are so askew as to be a danger to others, then that is their lesson, and others need not be subjected to that danger.<br>
<br>
Other ways I help?  By listening, I give the same respect to the homeless person drinking a bottle behind my office that I do a non-homeless person standing on the street corner.  I give them respect, so that they may feel they are not less, but equal to me, only in a different circumstance.  I offer them a smoke, or a part of my sandwich, whatever I'd also offer to anybody else.  I could be where they are one day, you just don't know for sure.  I listen to their stories, I see them as a soul, not as a piece of trash or a disturbance to be shooed away because they are cluttering up the back steps.<br>
<br>
Also, I donate a lot of the little money I have left over to groups that help the needy and homeless, I also spend a lot of time on the street talking with homeless people, sitting in groups with them when I bring around sandwiches or blankets for them.  I volunteer at the soup kitchen, and will shortly be feeding the homeless and hungry downtown at one of my own 'soup kitchens' on the corner in an empty lot.<br>
<br>
As you see, I give everything I can to others.  My mission in life is not to make a huge amount of money, but enough to provide for my daughter in the best way I can, but not live excessively.  I am not an excessive person.  I do what I have to to get by, but I don't over do it to the extent that money becomes my driving passion.  I spend the little extra money I have no others who need it, that's the way I am.<br>
<br>
So I don't believe in the 'survival' you refer to, not in the least.<br>
<br>
There are people in this world, Godman, that are not focused just on their own 'survival', although it is not a majority unfortunately.<br>
<br>
As for your theories about the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, that is the way of this earth, but it is not the right way.  I try to counter act that everyday I'm alive, and I'll never stop trying.  If everybody thought the same way, there would be a lot less poverty in this world.<br>
<br>
It is not a matter of the weak get weaker, it's not so simple.  The 'weak' so you call them, are in a devestating position of repression, and a lot of them have lost their spirit, their drive, there are few people in this world who'd give a homeless guy a job, because of the way he looks, or his sadness or anger at his situation.  It is a poverty of not only financial means, but also a poverty of the soul.  It is very sad, and I am here on this earth to help others to get back on the track where they begin having confidence in themselves again, that's a big first step.<br>
<br>
I can't save the whole world, but I am trying.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for aliens, I concur, you are correct in that they could have any reason for being here, I don't say I have all the answers.  I only say that the answers could be absolutely anything, not just the negative, but the positive as well.  So, in a sense we were kind of saying the same thing, just from different perspectives. (??) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
As for my belief in Aliens, I believe in them, you don't, that's just the way it is.  You are allowed to feel that way, as am I, so we agree on that.<br>
<br>
You are a great debater, Godman, and I thouroughly enjoy debating with you.  For each statement I make, you see things from your own perspective and counter mine.  There is a true balance of opinion here!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I agree with your thoughts on the chicken, though.  Godman's view is way out there.  It is kinda ridiculous isn't it?  But, Godman is very opinionated, and seems to over-exagerate his thoughts in order to get his point across.  This arguement is getting a little off topic, though.<br>
<br>
It's like we could go back and forth until our faces turned blue, but we'd never really get anywhere with one another because we all have differing styles and points of view.<br>
<br>
It's just fun to debate sometimes, even if ridiculous, because it gives us a chance to really feel what we believe is absolutely true for ourselves.

Godman, you are entitled to your opinions, but so are Niki, Dottie and Ann.  To call Niki's arguements &quot;ludicrous&quot; are, in my opinion, a little unkind.<br>
<br>
Re: &quot;Many people are easily offended by my statements. They do not want to believe the TRUTH.&quot;  <br>
<br>
You believe what you say to be the truth.  Others disagree because, to them it is not the truth, and not necessarily because they do not want to believe the truth (whatever the truth may be).<br>
<br>
I really do not want a falling-out here.  I just ask that people be a little more tolerant of other peoples' opinions and accept them with respect for others' views.<br>

<br>
No really I'm sorry for bringing up rape, I had no intention of bringing up anything so terrible and personal at all.  I do not want anyone to be upset at all, only to think about why they believe whatever they believe and for them to consider all the possibilities.  Ultimately people only believe what they want to regardless of any real &quot;truth&quot;.  I simply choose not to believe in things just because someone else does.  If I go to the North Pole, I won't find Santa Claus.  That doesn't mean that people don't believe in him.  I certainly will never know if there is a God for sure regardless of how much I truly believe there is one in my heart.  I believe whatever I want to believe just as everyone else does, and I apologize if anyone has been offended by my beliefs.  And Merc was not serious about the egg thing, at least I don't think so.  Otherwise I'm sorry that the egg came first if she was.<br>

Our technology isn't as advanced as we figured, and I think if they figured that the earth was too hot to support life then we're all a bunch of walking miracles.  Isn't that a nice way to see people?  I think aliens are out there somewhere, and they've probably found us, we're just to in to ourselves to notice. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
