I was shooting to be done by 5 PM, I knew a couple people had fear raids to go to and the fact it the loot awarding was done around 5:30. Giants were cleared before the Diplomat even had a chance to respawn. Great work everyone and thanks for all the help! =)<br>
<br>
Vox was exceptionally stingy today though, not a single epic drop, haste item or eyepatch... Oh well, guess that happens. Cleric hammer was won by Sirvus, 2 rez sticks were won by Ichabod and Blackfang, and a drgonbone bracelet was won by Aaldolek.<br>
<br>
I wanted to take this time to thank the enchanters, we had 5 today, and I want to let everyone know what an important role they play and how deeply they deserve thanks. For every complete heal that Vox is able to get off, it's like fighting her half way through again. Without enchanters, she could do that at least 3 times.. That's the most I've heard of, and if you take Vox's 32K hitpoints and ad another 3x 60% of her health, it's like fighting a mob with twice the hitpoints, around 64k. That's a lot for a pickup raid type group of people, a lot for people who are at best in their low 50's to manage. Usually, when there is complete heals from Vox, the raid is about over.<br>
<br>
Enchanters are the ones that prevent this. Not that Vox can't be killed without enough enchanters, but the other methods are unreliable at best.. Being able to lay down 3k hitpoints damage in less than the 30 seconds it takes for Vox to cast complete heal is tricky to coordinate unless you actually get a lot of nukers.. Stunning really doesn't seem to interrupt Vox's casting anymore. I really think any info that stuns interrupt Vox comes from old guides and there has been a change since then.<br>
<br>
But to really appreciate the enchanter's role on Vox, consider what they must endure. I'd love to be able to review an enchanter's log, and I don't know how mana sieve hate generation compares to damage or healing hate generation, but the enchanter who mana sieves gets a LOT of hate. That can't stop them either, They have to mana sieve as quickly and as continuously as possible to drain Vox's mana before she even tries to heal herself.. Heck, it's worse if her health goes down fast because that means the enchanters have to work faster. This tends to put them at the top of Vox's hate list.<br>
<br>
Enchanters don't tend to tank very well, it's pretty sure this will mean quick death. The best you can hope for is to not let the enchanters get killed by the area effect damage of Vox. Once they get clawed, that's usually the end of the story.. And it's gotta be hard on the clerics, Vox could have 1 of 3 reactions: 1) the enchanter stops and before death Vox manages to hate someone else more, 2) the enchanter stops and Vox claws them to death or 3) The enchanter stops, Vox claws, cleric tries to heal until Vox hates the cleric more, Vox then claws up the cleric before finishing the enchanter...<br>
<br>
All this fun, but hey, look on the bright side... Lady Vox has just restored you to full mana so you can go back at it again!<br>
<br>
Well, somehow we've had enough enchanters that are willing to endure this torture, most of them on multiple occasions. I must give a big thank you, without you guys this wouldn't be possible! I really hope next time we can get you guys something from Lady Vox so at least your eyes won't get poked out. =) <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uramellron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramellron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(7/29/01 2:08:26 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox and enchanters and stuff.</span><hr size=1> Well, speaking for this enchanter, I would like to thank YOU for organizing these dragon raids and giving alot of people a chance to do something that they would otherwise not be able to accomplish.<br>

In my opinion, loot is secondary. I've met alot of nice people since I started attending your raids, and that to me is what it is about.<br>

Actualy, next I want to try to improve the death rate.. I'd like to have the kind of raids where there's under 10 deaths, of course I don't think there will ever be a point where the bear pit deaths stop... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uramellron.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Ramellron</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalWhite.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(7/30/01 12:04:28 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vox and enchanters and stuff.</span><hr size=1> From what I have seen, the enchanter who lands Tash might as well find a convenient place to die.

I, a 48 Paladin, attend your last Vox raid.  It was my first dragon raid.  I was in group 8 (lol). Every single stun spell I cast was resisted.  I'll be equipped with a wurmslayer and a shield on the next dragon raid I get to attend.  I'll let you know if I ever succeed in interrupting one of Lady Vox's spells.<br>

Until I see someone e-mail me a log file where they stun and the next line shows Lady Vox's casting has been interrupted, I won't set up groups nor call commands with stunning in mind. My personal feeling is that stuns won't interrupt, but even if they did 1) they are so resisted it is unreliable to expect to have the luck to land one when needed 2) the enchanter mana-sieve works so well it's not necessary to use a stun strategy anyways. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ucherickofthesilverwolfpack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cherick of the Silver Wolf Pack</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 140<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/2/01 2:38:04 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To Xorshaik about Paladin stuns on Vox</span><hr size=1> Let me know the next run.
