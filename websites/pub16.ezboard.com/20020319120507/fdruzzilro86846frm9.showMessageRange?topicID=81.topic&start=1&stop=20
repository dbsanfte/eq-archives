And also, the EVER so popular &quot;It's just a game, we are just trying to have fun&quot;<br><br>Lemme tell ya how I feel right now.<br><br>L'Malla kicked arse last night. Had a little snag on Aaryonar, but once he dropped it was smooth sailing. dropping dragons WITH their guards (fighting a dragon and 2 lvl 60 mobs, even 3) was just breathtaking. I honestly think it was, not just for me, but for MANY of us there last night, THE most fun we had in EQ to date!<br><br>Think about it, not just killing NToV dragons, but killing NToV dragons with guards in tow, with minimal deaths, just working like a dream team! FUN!  When people logged last night, some at 2am, some as late as 4 or 5am in their time zone, after taking out 5 major NToV dragons, ALL they could think about the whole next day was how tonight could possibly TOP THAT!<br><br>We were fully expecting to be able to finish NToV tonight, finish off those last 7 dragons, and kick MAJOR ARSE! Like the excitement of getting ready to go to prom, or go out on a hot date, or getting ready to go to a party. THAT kind of adrenaline rush!<br><br>So, we find out Vindication decided that they were bored, and played the game for fun, and decided to LEAPFROG right past us, 'secretly' (you know, logging on early enough to get by us before we log on), and kill the rest of the dragons?<br><br>I am absolutely disgusted. Sick to my stomach. Saddened. I feel like my prom date just got kidnapped, or that party I was going to go just caught on fire.<br><br>Is it 'fun' for one guild to screw the mature and orderly rotation that is setup, to throw it all away, and to turn my best night of eq into a &quot;act of espionage?&quot;<br><br>If there are any 'mature' Vindication out there, any of you with families, or adults, I'd like you to read this, and think about it. Did you have fun punching my date in the face, or setting fire to house party I was going to? HOW can you feel good about what you did? <br><br>I feel like I just camped Drelzna for 12 hours and had a lvl 50 wizzie walk in and ice comet her, and walk out with jboots. <br><br>I feel like I've just spent 14 hours at the Avatar of Fear's room, trying for that Rubi BP, and been ninja looted. <br><br>I feel horrible. Truly saddened, disappointed, disgusted, cheated, robbed, and spit on.<br><br>- - - - -<br><br>I won't 'stoop to their level' though. Yeah, its just a game right? I won't (at least I'm sure going to try not to) /rude Vindication, I won't make threats, I won't train them, etc. <br><br>Oh, I'm hurt and upset, and spiteful, and what I DO WISH on Vindication, is that their 'all anon sneakiness' does nothing. I wish that no matter where they go, all anon, that people know, and watch out for them. If it's FFA they want, then it's FFA they'll get. <br><br>I hope it bites them in the arse. I'd love to see the more mature guilds on the server work together to gather at a moments notice and take out mobs before Vind has a chance to go for them. <br><br>I'm all for working with any of the other guilds to take out any big mob the second it spawns JUST so that Vind doesn't get it. Need some more DPS for a mob? shoot me a tell.<br><br>I'm gonna go spend some time with my family now, and try to forget that people as immature as the ones I've had the misfortune of being stepped on tonight by exist. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uspensesunhawk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Spense Sunhawk</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Otterphiliac</span><br>  Posts: 97<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 12:04:10 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> /agree</span><hr size=1> You summed it up perfectly Woody.
