<br>
ive purposed a few ways to fix some loot &quot;problems&quot; that may arise as we start doing bigger and better raids ...  i helped lead the guilds first fear raid the other day and there were a few problems with the loot distribution.   (some rolled by class .. some awarded) <br>
<br>
i dont like either way ... but i lived with it.  the guild is by no means &quot;uber&quot;  with only 15 or so 50+ and all but 3 of those are 51s.   myself and Morkai (57 wiz) are the only ones in the guild with real &quot;uber raid&quot; exp. and are trying to gear them up for the cool stuff out there to explore. (raids are more fun without fights over loot)<br>
<br>
this guild is a tight knit group of people (almost NO tournaround in guild members) which i love so verry soon we will be &quot;dragon&quot; ready.  <br>
<br>
I have purposed the &quot;points&quot; system .. a shortened vareation of vindications PoV system.  they still feel that its too complicated and needs to be made easier (and some flame on how good the /random system is)<br>
<br>
i wonder ... which guilds with atleast 20+ lvl 50s still random for &quot;uber&quot; loot??  and which ways people distribute it?  almost like a verry long poll .. and id like a few suggestions/imput to go with the reasons why the guilds went this way.<br>
<br>
AS is electing a &quot;council of 9&quot; now that will run the guild and be the officers for the people and by the people. which is an idea that i loved.    just need a few collective suggestions from you guys on how you do things.<br>

<br>
ML is the only guild I know of on our server that is higher level and uses /random, most do officer distribution, Hoss, L`malla, and CN and Formerly Seekers all operated on Officer decided loot distribution.  It can have benefits and downsides, but so does a point system.  I suggest getting a general consensus from your guild on what system they would like to use.<br>
<br>
Just remember what ever system you use, there will still be SOME problems that arise, but just try to be as fair as possible, and the problems will be few and far between.<br>

It really comes down to the quality/bonds between your members. If they are petty, greedy, or selfish no an awards system will not work, you will have people &quot;expecting&quot; loot and others bickering that they dont get enough. A point based system is ok as well, with the right tinkering it really shines IMO. Randoming is ok, but it would be my least favorite unless you had a tie going on and had to determine between a couple candidates for uber item X? Again refer back to point one, if you are tight and close knit loot should not be such a problem. But we all know the high end game of EQ is hell on guilds and will change a person overnight =/<br>
<br>
I think the most important thing is that people are there for each other and to help the guild. If they get loot out of it, great.<br>
<br>
My advice go with a point system that is not totally open member bid (for example the druid cant win the cobalt bp that just dropped) or if you have the right guild for it, go with an awards/officer directed system.<br>

As far as what system your guild should use, I guess the easies answer would be whatever system the majority finds fair.  The point system is very fair, but requires more diligent monitoring and upkeep.  Officer decision is fair as long as it's based on fair factors like participation and whatnot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/umulrineweeple.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mulrine Weeple</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/15/01 4:45:03 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.amanda.dd.com.au/art/dragons/adoptions/animpatti.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guild loot &quot;rules&quot;</span><hr size=1> Vivar what are you doing go make another twink so no body knows it is you and you can get a group.  <br>

We use a combination of rotation and award.  Each class has a rotation and the next in line gets the drop if they are on the raid.  If they're not then it goes to the next person in line.  On items that aren't clear cut for a certain class, then the officers decide which class it is most usefull for (i.e. which class having it is going to benifit the guild as a whole more).<br>
<br>
We're still working on how to do with guests on the raids, it's not as easy as it sounds.  On our dragon raids we award an item to each formally invited guild, and keep an item for our guild and then random anything else that is left over between the classes that will benifit most from it.  (I mean we wouldn't allow casters to roll on a rbb or a CoF, we want the loot to go to people who can and will use it, not to people who would give it to a twink or sell/trade it off.)<br>
<br>
On the planes armor drops are randomed between everyone on the raid of that class, with winners sitting out until everyone of that class has a drop.  If we ever go up with just our guild (which I don't see happening just cause we have to many friends outside of CO, but ya never know heh) then we'd do it by rotation instead of randoming.<br>
<br>
On our first Dragon raid, we randomed inside the guild on a CoF and it caused a lot more hurt feelings than we have ever had when loot was awarded inside the guild. <p>Kragstomper Steinblade<BR>

<br>
That was a bad one, but we were really unprepared for that type of loot at the time.<br>
<br>
In JS we maintain a class list rotation that seems to be working pretty well so far. We will /random, but only in cases where there are more than one eligible person prsent. Participation is heavily factored in. You must be present to loot and if you are not the item will move down to the next person on the list. If no one who is present can or will use the item then we'll save it and offer it to those who were not present. Nodrop items eing an obvious exception.<br>
<br>
It will get harder when we get to do the REALLY big stuff. Most of our guild is in the 30's range, with a few 40's-low 50's mixed in.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ufaenyar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Faenyar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 104<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/15/01 1:03:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://ourplace.dhs.org/~gfoster/pics/Faenyar-Fishing.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The CoF incident</span><hr size=1> In the paragons, we use a mixture of /random, NBG and awards.  In small group situations, the group handles it however they want (and quite often they end up bringing something back and giving it to a guildie who needs if nobody in the group needs it more).<br>
<br>
On raids, the raid leader reserves the right to award a few items to people who performed exceptionally (saved the entire raid, etc) and this does happen occasionally.  The raid leader also reserves the right to reserve one item from the raid for the hassle of running the raid, and this happens once in a blue moon and is well stated up front (i.e. &quot;I just want everyone to know that if such and such drops, I'm claiming it and if anyone has a problem with that we need to talk about it before we start&quot;).  Often, our raids will be centered around getting specific items for specific people (for example, one of our warriors has crap gear and needs upgrades... we do specific raids to get him better gear and if it drops everyone knows it goes to him).  Finally, if it's just loot we picked up along the way we /random it among anyone who's eligible to use it and who was there (including guests) as long as it makes sense that they have it (for example, our monks don't roll on granite spaulders even though they are listed as a class that can use them).  Once you win something you are out of it until everyone else (within class boundaries of course) wins.<br>
<br>
Most of the time it works out very well for our guild because we are very tight knit and we all know what each other needs and wants.  We're actually not a very loot-hungry guild, we enjoy the experiences much more than anything else.  We have managed to pick up some sorta cool stuff along the way and so far have had zero problems.  For example, we spent about 6 months raping and pillaging the hole to practice for a yael raid, and I led MANY raids there as training runs.  As a consequence, most of our casters have at least one piece of loam gear, we have loam gear rotting in the bank, and I think ALL of our tanks now have granite spaulders and we're working on getting them for our clerics next.  Also, when we finally did drop yael (our very first god level encounter) and he coughed up a loam encrusted robe, it went directly to me, and everyone knew for 6 months that when we finally coughed one up it was mine.  I think everyone else was just as happy for me to get it as I was, there are better robes out there but it's a badge of honor for me and for everyone else as well.<br>
We have knocked down Tserinna a few times too, hoping to score a robe off her... and I've made it clear up front that I will NOT roll for it, it should go to some other caster.  I already have a nice robe.  We have a few other casters in the guild who also have nice robes and they have made the same statement.  Most of the people in our guild are the same way, once they get something nice they want everyone else to also get something before they feel comfortable getting into the rotation again.  We *do* have a few people who are greedy loot mongers who always have their hands out, but we all know who they are and we keep a tight lid on 'em.<br>
<br>
We're planning on moving into the Kael arena within a few weeks and will be raiding there a lot to get some of the velious armor drops for people.  We have 2 people in our guild who are designated as the first epic drops (we're focusing hard on getting them their epics first so everyone else's epic raids will go easier).  These are for a cleric and enchanter... and the designated cleric and enchanter aren't eligible for any raid loot drops at all unless NOBODY else can use it (including people who aren't even present).  They are getting their epics first, so they forego all the rest of the loot until they are done.<br>
<br>
I don't think our loot system (which is a hodge podge of stuff) would work well with guilds that aren't as tight knit as we are.  However, I think a point system would positively suck for us because we don't really care how many raids you show up for, that's not what we're about.  We *are* turning into a raiding guild and we're training hard for it, but again, it's not how many times you showed your face that matters to us.<br>

<br>
ive sat in chat for countless hours with many guildies who feel its a problem in the guild .. <br>
<br>
points are awarded 1 per raid .. and 1 for being at the raid entierly .. (breakin to CR) <br>
<br>
on epic raids the person the raid is for gets 0 points and costs 0 points to loot there epic piece.<br>
<br>
loot is decided which class/classes get to bid on it .. and its shouted  <br>
<br>
jgable shouts {item here}  [stats here] &lt;this class&gt; /radnom bid<br>
<br>
those that want bid the amount they want (such as they can not go negative) as follows <br>
<br>
john /random 5....  (has 5 points in bank) rolls a 4<br>
jane /random 4 .....(has 6 points in bank) rolls a 2<br>
jerry /random 8 ... .(has 15 points in bank) rolls a 3<br>
<br>
john would get the item and have 5 points removed from his total.<br>
<br>
in the event of a tie .. the people who tie all do a /random 100 so that the odds are fair on the tiees<br>
<br>
<br>
sounds like a fair system .. so that all at attendance get a chance .. but with emphasis on those who help the guild more by attending more raids.<br>
<br>
its easier in a 8 min rot time to just shout<br>
jgable shouts {item here}  [stats here] &lt;this class&gt; /radnom bid<br>
<br>
and get on with it.<br>
<br>
thus keeping favoritism .. out of the mix but perticipation a key factor in who gets loot.<br>
<br>
<br>
this seems to have been agreed with by alot of the guild that it is a good comprimise to both sides of the debate. <p>Jgable Ivonavitch 57 Knight of Dro

As your guild grows larger then perhaps change to a point system.  With a smaller guild you relatively know who deserves it most and can keep away from personal bias by consulting the other officers.  For a larger guild it gets a little bit harder to keep track of peoples' merit so a point system is one way to keep track of things.  No loot system is gonna be perfect and please everyone though. <p>Maric Shadowblade<br>57 Blackguard </p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 8<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(8/17/01 9:22:51 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: guild loot &quot;rules&quot;</span><hr size=1> Officer distribution isn't really an option that 1FOL can use without great risk of prejudice.  Just about every other person is an officer.  The last actual count was 1:2.5, (might be down to 1 in 4 by now); and that was when the roster showed 60ish people, now it's well over 100.  <br>
The last full guild-group I was in had at least 4 officers in it.<br>

<br>
I think we run about a 1:10 ratio in Paragons and it's quite effective and successful.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents worth.<br>

It encourages raid participation by allowing the points, keeps *most* control in the hands of the members who wish to spend their points, but still gives some opportunity (via random) for those who may not have RL time to come to every guild function and gain less points.  It's nice for us non-powergamers to have reasons to attend and hope for something out of it.  The randoming also puts limits on officer distribution where bias may occur.  <br>
Obviously, if the raid is built upon a particular member getting an item (ie epics..) then they would get it, or the guild could have a wish list at the start (&quot;I'll forego all drops and bids if I can have ___ if it drops&quot; if no objections on it).<br>
<br>
QUESTION:  Some of our guild had chewed a points system idea around and, since we'd like a system that encourages participation for the lower level raids as well, had the idea of assigning points to anyone who attends that can &quot;be productive&quot;.  So, the level 13 that wants to be part of an MM raid (say, 25-35) gets no points for just cheerleading; but the 50 CLR gets a point for coming and providing rezzes.  Since the lower levels can't attend the higher raids then they can't bid on items during the raid, but maybe versus each on unclaimed items.  People on raids can't bid with their Alt's points.<br>
Does this sound pretty rational? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A> at: 8/19/01 11:01:27 am<br></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=1051.topic&start=21&stop=21>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=1069.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=1063.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=1051.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=1051.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1051.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1051.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">Nasty Post Void</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion>General Discussion</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.3 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
