Just stopping by another board I vist and posting it here. Heh the first statement applies for this forum too =)<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
I love this forum, I usually read it daily. Its very supportive and filled with a lot of knowledgeable players. The Ranger community in EQ is one of the strongest.<br>
<br>
With that being said I must say that I am slipping back in to ranger semi-retirement, or at least a long break from EQ.<br>
<br>
<br>
Several reasons.<br>
<br>
First off I'm 53rd level. I have been 53rd level for about a month. I was burnt out on my ranger, rarely playing him, then about several months ago I started playing him hardcore  again with focus and enthusiaism. Now I'm back to being burnt-out on the ranger class and the high level game in general. If this hadn't happened I would prolly be 55th or 56th by now. Heh. Haven't done much work on my epics-unmotivated, haven't been seeking out XP-unmotivated, Haven't even attended recent guild raids-burnt out =/.<br>
<br>
The ranger is a fun class to play. Individually one of the most flexible, however in the higher 50th+ game we are still not a needed/wanted class no matter how much they tweak us.....I'm tired of being a background player on raids and a very situational choice even for 6 man pick up groups in Seb, KC, etc. I've started playing my dwarf warrior alt simply because if I am going to continue to invest time playing EQ I want to play a class thats wanted/needed at *all* stages of the game.  I am a very skilled ranger player with 120 days+ /played, I have done everything in Kunark multiple times minus Veeshans Peak, the planes more times than I can count, I'm raid focused, a good team player, friendly guy, etc....however everywhere I have looked the &quot;need&quot; was based on class moreso than reputation or skill. If I am going to invest time and develop my playing skills, learning the game inside and out, I want to play a class that has a larger impact on post 50th gameplay (since its essentially half of the time you spend playing EQ if you do reach 60th). Its like getting a PhD so you can have a job that pays 20k a year. I want more reward for my time invested.<br>
<br>
I'm also frustrated with the higher level game in EQ. The best way I can summarize it is as a bar chart; the bars representing time and committment dramaticly go up, while the bar representing fun goes down. When they raised the level cap to 60th they ruined the game IMO because the way the content was designed around those 10 levels broke the game IMO. Class balance and need was tossed out the window, and to succeed at these levels you have to invest some ungodly amount of time in contrast to the benefits/fun reaped, not to mention its very limited as to the required classes. Theres not a lot of wiggle room tactically speaking.  EQ is a game played for fun, it should not be a lifestyle choice, and the high level design almost forces it to become a lifestyle choice, like its your second job. Basically it comes down to this, when you are 50th+ you either log on and play hardcore or you are just floundering going nowehere fast. I also don't like the high level options for when you are not raiding. Sitting in Sebilis and Howling Stones is the same exact thing I've done for the last two years of playing this game. I started killing Frogluks back at level 30 and I'm still killing the bastards at 53rd...Geesh.<br>
<br>
Really the most important lesson I'ver learned since playing EQ is its the people and friends you make along the way that truly keeps you in the game. But the 50th+ game takes a real toll on guilds, friendships, etc. Loot squabbles, greed, people not pulling their fair share (from a subjective standpoint), the time sink and XP stresses of 50th to 60th, etc etc can really tear these apart. It gets old. It has gotten old for me.<br>
<br>
I'm burnt on the ranger class and the high level game in general.<br>
<br>
<br>
Well I've rambled enough. I have made some points that I'm sure some people will debate or consider, or just mock =P ....thanks for hearing me out though.<br>
<br>
I think i'm going to play my little dwarf warrior some, take a break from EQ, resume my social life, play some soccer, chill out and see if things change after a break?<br>

<br>
The way I deal with the redundant parts of the game is. Essentailly I just find constructive ways to deal with the downtime. Just watch TV, read a book, have a conversation. The thing I don't quite understand is why people feel they have to play or perhaps more accuratly have to play hardcore. All good things come in there time.<br>
<br>
Just for example ...<br>
<br>
Spending quality time with my girlfriend, playing poker and drinking with roommates and some other friends.<br>
<br>
Leave for 2 hands<br>
<br>
Clear tundra yeti room in Dreadlands, feign death<br>
<br>
Go back to poker<br>
<br>
every six minutes pop back in and tap mend)<br>
<br>
18 Minutes from time of cleared room leave for a hand or 2, clear room feign and repeat.<br>
<br>
Only reason I care to level, is that raids are fun. ^_^<br>
<br>
Rather then that I don't see much differance then when I was level ten then when I'm level 44 now. Just that I don't look as goofy.<br>

I understand your frustration.  I only met your avatar a couple of times in the game.  (Once, with my rogue, the adventurer extraordinaire and I really enjoyed the conversation)<br>

<br>
If a game requires you to play another game (or TV) while waiting to play the first game,<br>
what does that tell you about the gameplay of the original game.  Same with if the game<br>
requires you to play on two or more computers for it to be remotely interesting.<br>
<br>
Also, being able to FD and be completely sure of safety is available to few<br>
classes. Being able to solo effectively is also limited to very few classes. <br>
Try leveling up a class that requires grouping, and you might see why<br>
people are always trying to get ideal groups and inevitably turn into powerlevelers<br>
when xp comes in so slow at higher levels.  Downtime is paramount and grouping<br>
is all about efficiently making xp.<br>
<br>
The high level gameplay sux0rs.   Poker or even Minesweeper is more engaging<br>
gameplay and requires more use of your brains than EQ.<br>
<br>
We need next generation MMOGs to come out ASAP.<br>
