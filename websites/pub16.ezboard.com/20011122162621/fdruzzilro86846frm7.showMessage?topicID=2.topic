Too long, I see now, for I barely recognize the child I reared as my own those many years ago. How long has it been? 30? 40 years? Ahhh...the time, the time...so much time has passed.&quot;<br>
 <br>
Startled slightly but instantly recognizing the voice of my mentor and patron father, I replaced my dagger under the folds of my robe. I looked up to see him standing in the doorway of my chambers. His heavy robes engulfing his small frame.<br>
<br>
&quot;Myrdyn! By Innoruuk's hate, I had hoped to see you again before the ceremony! You have no idea how much Ive missed you!&quot; I jumped up from my desk to the old dark elf, his form telling of centuries of life and<br>
countless battles. Gingerly, I took his hand in my own and bowed respectfully, feeling the raw power of stored magic within his frail body. <br>
<br>
&quot;I did not know you had returned from you studies at the outpost so early. I was sure you would remain till word of our victory in the old wurm's temple had reached our commanders ears in Neriak.&quot; I stood straight and looked into his eyes, seeking an answer to my question.<br>
<br>
Myrdyn, looking haggard and forlorn, chuckled dryly. &quot;I had heard about  your appointment as a scribe....I could not, would not have missed this day for the promise of all the scrolls in the realm. I had to come and pay my respects and to see you again, my child.&quot; A tear appeared at the corner of his eye, but was quickly wiped away in a pretense of lowering the cowl of his cloak. &quot;I....brought you a gift my dear, a tome I discovered in the ruins of an old Iksar place of worship. I have cast a spell upon it to decipher the crude language. I think you will find it quite interesting.&quot; He placed the tome down carefully on my desk.<br>
<br>
I smiled at him, remembering the first time I had encountered this elf, a wizard of considerable power. He had seen my potential as a child and, after the assassination of my father, had taken me in and taught me the might of wand and staff versus the cut of a blade. Though he never fully approved of my eventual pursuit in the arts of necromancy, he never ceased to care for me as protectively as if he were my real father. I thanked him sincerely for his gift as he moved around to take a seat at the small table that was littered with scrolls and spell components.<br>
<br>
&quot;I must say, I was quite pleased and proud to hear of your appointment as a scribe. 'Tis a great honor to gaurd, and eventually add to, the ancient scrolls of the Teir'dal ancestery. I myself was a scribe at one point in my life, but the great wars of the Takish Hiz called me away from my duties, to fight alongside the young Lanys. Ahh...the memories. But enough of that, tell me, how have you been my child? I feared for your safety greatly when I learned you were to venture into the lair of the old wurm. But now I see those fears were sorely misplaced. Do tell me of your exploits.&quot;<br>
<br>
Smiling, I recanted to him the battles I witnessed and participated in with the point patrol groups seeking to explore the cavernous lair of the dragon Trakanon. I told him of the wonders of the lost treasures we recovered, and even showed him some scrolls of power that were beyond even his formidable control. The time passed quickly and we shared many laughs and moments of solemn silence over tales of lost friends and comrades. <br>
<br>
Finally, as if he had been reluctant to do so, Myrdyn, his old wrinkled face appearing even more haggard than when he had first entered, stood up and went to my door, fastening the lock. He stood there for a moment, a soft chant emanating from his lips. I recognized the chant as a spell of sound deafening. I watched him curiously as he returned to his seat.<br>
<br>
&quot;My dear, I came back to witness your appointment, that much was true. But I also returned to warn you of the possiblity of treachery at the hands of Teir'dal you might call your friends. Many would view this appointment as a just reward for a faithful follower of the father, or a blatant insult for being passed up. I came here also to lend my eyes where your own cannot see. Already I have sensed the magical aura of scrying devices aimed at your domicile, but my own dweomers of protection have shielded us thus far, but for how much longer I cannot say. So I say to you know, to view this appointment not only as an honor but as a risk to your very life as well.<br>
<br>
I sat back slowly digesting the news. Of course I realized the dangers that came with ascension through the hierarchy of a society as chaotic as that of my race. One of a lower station would eye the back of one above them as a fine place to rest their daggers if it meant they could claw their way up the social and politicial structure of our society another notch. It was our way. But never did I stop to think that mine could be such a position. I looked to Myrdyn, his face scanning my own looking for some hint of what emotions his warnings were inspiring within me. <br>
<br>
&quot;You risk much, Father. Coming so far, along a perilous route, to bring me even more perilous tidings. I am thankful for your counsel and your protection. I swear I shall be careful and keep to my self till the ceremony. I will not let what happened to my blood father happen to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
We locked gazes over the small table, the single candle I had placed there earlier burning low with the passing of so many hours. He took my hands in his and nodded approvingly. &quot;I must take my leave of you now, dear one. The council has arranged room and board for me in the temple, and the road still weighs heavily in these old bones. I shall come to you in the 'morrow and we shall have some more catching up.&quot;<br>
He smiled warmly and moved to the door. He uttered a word of release, dispelling the shield, and opened the door to the alley.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aluve my daughter. Sleep well.&quot; &quot;Aluve Father. Till the 'morrow, sleep well.&quot; I stood up and locked the door behind him. My mind turning with the events of the night. First the ascension, then Myrdyn's sudden and certainly unexpected visit. And now the possibility of treachery and assasination. I had survived through 53 seasons of life as a dark elf by using those very same tenets. I would not now or ever allow myself to succumb to them. <br>
<br>
It was our way.<br>
