Sure we might feel ourselves nodding off or feeling drowsy but we dont actually know that we have been asleep until we wake up. So, what would happen if we didn't wake up? Ever. <br>
I'm trying to decide what happens when we die. I find it almost impossible to believe that after about 70 years of intelligent life that it just ends for eternity, and that we are not aware of it. But I dont really believe in god - or do I? I dont believe a word written in the bible, but I cant really grasp the fact that we are here by accident or natural evolution. You people reading this accross the world thanks to the internet is not an accident, its intelligence, quite advanced too. Man has created electricity, ability to fly and explore space and more. Yet at around 70 years of age we die and all we have individually learned and experienced is lost. I dont think so. <br>
And what about ghosts. I am uncertain about them too. But stories about poltergeists throwing things and &quot;losts souls&quot; contacting us (for help?) are far too common to dismiss so how can they be explained. Do our souls die with our body, and if not then how can our souls exist without our bodies. I really need an answer on this before I die. Its more important to me than finding aliens or anything else.<br>
Driving me mad now!<br>

<br>
I think you can rest easy, as you have hit the nail right on the head.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Our existance, as far as I'm concerned, cannot be merely an accident, nor do I feel that our life on this earth is the primary reason for being here.<br>
<br>
If you are not sure about the existance of God, maybe I can help you, around this site alone, there are numerous bits of evidence that there is an infinately wise presence at work (check &quot;Outer Space&quot; if you'd like to see some incredible photos).<br>
<br>
To see God, one has only to look toward a sunset, or at a newborn baby, or any other of the millions of beautiful things in our realm of existance.  If we can believe in the beauty that surrounds us, than we must believe in the unfathomably beautiful things that we have yet to see.<br>
<br>
I agree also, that there is too much evidence of otherworldly things, for any but the most closed minded of people to dismiss.  I have seen enough to convince me, and my experiences pale by comparison to most I've heard.<br>
<br>
Finally, I was most moved by your mention of &quot;waking up&quot;, because that is precisely what I believe happens to us when our time on this world is through.<br>
<br>
I hope this helps, please write again soon,<br>
<br>

The evidence of things not seen. <br>
<br>
Nothing in this world is happen chance. It is all designed. A lot of people get confused because they look at so many different faiths. But whatever you call Him He is still God. <br>
<br>
He understands us all and knows us individually. Forget all the things you've heard and just sit back and look at the things around you. The beauty is everywhere. Sure we have all the bad stuff, but there is so much beauty and greatness around us.<br>
<br>
And as far as ghosts go, to me, they have always been proof that people do survive after death. Like angels they are helping us and watching over us. They are also trying to teach us in their own ways. Even if it be don't do what they did or be more thankful, it is there way of helping.<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing this with us. It wasn't ever hard for me to figure God out, but I know it is for some. For me my life has been filled with proof. I hope soon that it will be for you. <p>&quot;For those who believe no explanation is needed.

You are so right!  I think exactly the same way.  What makes a person who they are is the soul, or spark of life, the spirit, however you want to name it.

I do believe in reincarnation and have experienced memories through dreams and bleed throughs that led me to accept reincarnation as a truth for me. <br>
<br>
My husband did experience a physical death. I will not get into much detail for it was his experience. He did leave his body, enter the tunnel and see the light. He is not afraid of death. He knows the soul lives on through his own experience.<br>

One thing I know for sure is that this life is the only life you will be exactly who you are right now. <br>

It can linger in the light indefinately if it choses. <br>
<br>
The freezing of a body or cloning for that matter is ego centered and the soul is not. The spirit has identity and unless it is trapped between worlds so to speak, such as a ghost, and with it's conciousness intact it is silly to think that the soul and spirit will reunite in that same body and continue where it left off. <br>
<br>
I guess I see the spirit as sort of the memory of the soul. Anyway I agree with sixthsense16 that if the original soul of the body has moved on to a new one then it won't return to the awaken frozen one therefore the awaken frozen one wouldn't be the same person when revived. I do however leave my mind open to the possibility that another soul may chose to enter into that revived body and have it's own experience. No matter how I look at it the revived body or cloned one won't be the same life as it was.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sixthsense16>sixthsense16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 116<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(12/9/02 12:02:16 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=278.topic&index=10>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.paranormalandmuchmore.com/candle21.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: When we die?</span><hr size=1> You are 100% right psychic2. :) I, too, believe if the frozen body was revived by some chance it would not be the same.

BTW, no reincarnation theory that I know of accepts the idea that we reincarnate with the memories of a prior life.<br>
<br>
The evil of bad karma is that we reincarnate to suffer for it, but never know why.<br>
<br>
The prevailing idea in the science fiction stories that deal with it is that this current body is just a chrysalis, and that when we die--or transform, we go to another plane of existence, of take on another form.<br>
<br>
My favorite is from Sentinals of Space, by Eric Frank Russell, in which we become Cosmic Butterflies, winging between the stars.<br>
