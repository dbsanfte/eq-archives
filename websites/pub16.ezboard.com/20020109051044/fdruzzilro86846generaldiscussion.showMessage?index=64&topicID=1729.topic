Since It did not I am compelled to reply.<br>
<br>
First off after reading all the posts, I agree that IG had a right to CT.  The problem I had on my original post/thread was the fact that when I logged on, I was told we were just S.O.L. IG was already clearing FEAR and had been for a couple of hours.<br>
<br>
Yes, they offered Treesmasha the option of us coming with them and helping clear and looting the mobs. This was only after Treesmasha came on and talked to guild leader, earlier Maelika was told tough luck, have a nice day. (She was also abused in OOC and has the screen shots to prove it.) What is that all about? Was it necessary?<br>
<br>
The problem with the offer is, 1) Our raid was scheduled for 8:30 EST, they were already in FEAR and clearing it. So by the time all our people came on they would have already cleared it and the loot rotted. 2) We were told that the Golems were not negotiable, we could not have.<br>
<br>
Basically, the way I understood it was, hey they not ready to go and we are not waiting for them to be ready. So the posts about being willing to compromise were superficial at best. <br>
<br>
I would not have had a problem allowing them to kill CT. I would have loved to join them, if they would have been willing to wait for our scheduled raid time and allowing us to have the epic drops. The lag would have been bad but oh well. ( we were also hosting Crystal Oracle)<br>
<br>
I schedule us for FEAR on 7 November, much planning went into our raid and I know many of our people worked RL issues around that date. I hope in the future this does not happen again, I know that Treesmasha is more even tempered then I and did his best to work it out. <br>
<br>
I have been Playing EQ since February 2001 and have discovered that there are many good people in EQ, I know that IG has many good people as well. I hope this incident allows all to remember that the game is still new to some people and they have hopes and desires for their characters as well.<br>
