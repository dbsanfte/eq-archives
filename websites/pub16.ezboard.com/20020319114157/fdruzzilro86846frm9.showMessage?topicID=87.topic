Sometimes they leave my name out, but generally the have always refferenced our guild. They often make the claim that the person who trained them admitted to it in tells.<br><br>The accusation is entirely false. I had hoped to be able to send my log file to work so I could use it as supporting evidence in all postings I made regarding this issue, but I woke up too late to send the file and still get to work on time. I'll add the log to the posts later.<br><br>Here are the sequence of events.. I'll start with when I logged in.<br><br>A little background: On the IGB, we were up for Dozekar yesterday for our first attempt. The public post hasn't yet been updated for Hoss's kill last friday, otherwise it would reflect that. Being patch day, VE knew Dozekar would be spawned that day, and we'd done a great deal of equipping and strategic discussion in preparation. I and many others were very much looking forward to our first try.<br><br>(I'll leave out the part regarding the preparation of my dinner, just bear in mind there are periods of AFK involved <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  )<br><br>I'd learned before logging in that Vindi had already killed Dozekar. My plan at that point was to start dinner and try to see what progression had been made, and that hopefully I might be able to somehow preserve some named drakes for VE at least, if they hadn't yet been killed, through civil discussion in tells.<br><br>Bear in mind, this was only my plan, it never reached that point. (The point of scouting the Halls of Testing)<br><br><br>When I logged in, I had camped at ToV zone in, there were a few VE on, but no clerics until a little later. Grazel was on.<br><br>When in the same zone, /who &lt;guildname&gt; will still list those who are present even if they are anon. Doing so for vindi showed that there were still 36 present.<br><br>As a manner of trying to have a corpse at the zone in so that I could be rezzed back for summoning in the event that I died in my scouting efforts, I proceeded to visit the drakes in the first hall and suicide.<br><br>Grazel dragged me back to the zone-in, I was rezzed..<br><br>At this point, I kinda forgot to leave somethign on my corpse. I put two single bandages in main inventory slots, then I went again to die in the same manner.<br><br>At this point, Grazel was busy in tells so I simply had Twyynke rez me where I died.<br><br>While I was in the bizarre, Linlainu sent a tell.. I'll have to pull the logs to see what it was about, I paid it little mind at the time.. I'm sure I must've been unaware that Vindi could have any basis to think I trained them, I knew I didn't.. If there is any basis to thinking there may have been any admission of anything, concluding that I admitted to training is certainly taking things I may have said out of context. At no point did I say anything along the lines of &quot;I trained you vindi :P&quot;<br><br>After I was rezzed, I set about dragging my body myself back to the zone in. This involves a simple process: feign, move, drag repeat. In the process of dragging myself, I had 3 &quot;Xorshaik has fallen to the ground&quot; in a row.<br><br>Anyway, I get myself dragged to the zone, loot my stuff, remember to leave the bandages on the corpse..<br><br>At this point, (maybe even sooner) I again checked /who vindi. I found that there were only 10 in the zone.. Apparently Vindi at this point had wiped out.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So there are your chronological sequence of events. After this chronology, a few more VE were on, a few Vindi were at the zone in, some bickering took place.. After that much time had elapsed, I started getting tells accusing me of training. <br><br>I'll post my logs later, and maybe ther will be details I can update.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There is a lesson to be learned about how Vindi operates from this. The standard operating procedure for Vindi involves using deception to make the innocent appear guilty, and to cause anguish as a means as reducing others capability. Be aware of this, at least perhaps through awareness folks can reduce their effectiveness in breaking down the capabilities we have <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uauedaar1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Auedaar1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/jump3.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/24/02 12:48:15 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindi's training allegation</span><hr size=1> one thing i must say about this is that in a FFA environment, vindi did get to dozekar first.now i have no love for vindication at all. techniquely, they did not do anything wrong according to the FFA environment they are living in. vindication probably had been set up in ToV to go into north wing.however, since my guild(ML) did beat them there, they decided to respect FCFS and changed their plans. i know that this is alittle out of place, but this is the first VE post about that isnt a super flame thread. dont forget vindi withdrew from the IGB. i dont know what happened with trains and whatever. <p>Why bake cookies when you can steal them<BR>                                       <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17343> Auedaar Mystique</a><a href=http://www.ffmusiconline.com/ff6/disc3/08-Gogo.mid><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/pcs/gogo/laugh.gif></a> <BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18067>Jelilu Spinesplitter</a><a href=http://www.ffmusiconline.com/FF6/Disc1/11-Shadow.mid><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/pcs/shadow/anger.gif></a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 259<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/24/02 1:40:32 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=87.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindi's training allegation</span><hr size=1> Funny thing is Vindi members were posting on here about how proud there were about training ML in WW.
