I will OOC usually with humor.<br>
<br>
It is amazing how fast you can get things done with humor. <br>
<br>
I needed a port once in EW (I hate getting ports there) when I was level 30. My mom needed her big bad daughter to get her body out from under emporer Crush. I ooced &quot;Need a port to Gfay fast please, the oldest Newbie in Everquest, my 57 year old mom, needs her big bad daughter to rescue her from Emporer Crush&quot;. I had 6 offers in 30 seconds as well as much ooc hilarity.<br>
<br>
And look out my mom is level 53 now. ROFL. <p><center><img src=http://a1.cpimg.com/image/9B/78/6923931-131b-00C800FC-.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uvicarofliquor.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vicar of Liquor</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 34<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/3/01 4:35:49 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics speak out- How to ask for a ress (and maybe get </span><hr size=1> It also helps that Aria is married to a cleric (not that I ever get to actually see my wife) and that she quit listening to Faerwynd!<br>
<br>
As far as I go, if I am not busy, I don't mind helping folks out.  I do NOT want to have to wander all over Skyfire looking for your corpse.  Chances are that whatever killed you can probably also kill me.  Try to have the body waiting either at a port in spot OR at the zone closest to a port in spot.  Be POLITE when you ask me for a res and try to include where the body is in the first tell.  If a cleric tells you they are busy, leave them alone and say you understand.  Do NOT badger us for an hour about how you have a level 60 super uber cleric on another server and you know how easy it is to res someone and we just don't care about people and are greedy!  Do NOT under any circumstances badger the cleric to hurry up or stop what he/she is doing to come res you now so you can get back to exp grinding.  NEVER EVER tap your foot impatiently at a cleric if he is doing you a FAVOR!!  Yes, this happened to me just this past weekend.  I remember the guys name and he will not be receiving my services any time soon.<br>
<br>
Lastly, the way to my heart is peridots.  It is not easy looking as good as I do.  My armor is quite heavy and my wife can beat me arm wrestling!  If you give me PP for a rez, I will more than likely become encumbered.  If you give me peridots for a res, I will more than likely remember you and go out of my way to help you out in the future.  A donation of peridots shows that you actually care enough about the clerics in your life to spend the small amount of time learning what they really need and trying to provide it for them.<br>

Number one reason is I personally have a hard time saying no, even if they are rude, and just dont have the time. I usually just vent in guild, bless their heart's. Number two reason is I rarely have the time to aide because of the high tempo of guild activites, which coincide's with reason number one. So time coupled with a bleeding heart has lead me to doing nothing but &quot;rez's&quot; for hours.<br>
<br>
By know most people on server know who the cleric's are and most are friends with them. Cleric's by nature, from what I have expierenced, are friendly and tolerant. Most I say <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START 8) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/glasses.gif ALT="8)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>
<br>
If on the rare occasion I do take off /role and I get a &quot;rez&quot; request, I am more then willing to help if with in reason. I never charge. A /hug or &quot;Thank you&quot; is payment enough to satistify me. It is appreciated if you drag the corpse to a zone line, provide transportation, and be polite. Funny works also. Even the rude request's 50% of the time I have entertained.<br>
<br>
Other then guild &quot;rez's&quot;, which can numb your mind, I cant help but stop everytime I see a corpse as I am traveling and check and see if that person is online. Many time's I hear in /group &quot;Wait up, Mama's &quot;rezzing&quot; anothter corpse.&quot; Nothing is more gratifying then &quot;rezzing&quot; someone that was in definite despair.<br>
<br>
I know I'm rambling, basically if your polite and I am not in the middle of something I am more then happy to help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ualihjazanzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alihja Zanzibar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Alihjadomis</span><br>  Posts: 772<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/3/01 8:00:14 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.rutabaga-paradox.org/images/mullet.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Clerics speak out- How to ask for a ress (and maybe get </span><hr size=1> /rant mode on<br>

So there I was...  in CS, kicking it on the beach with a friendly group.  People seem to die a lot here.  Something about the drakes and bad dragon faction...  Anyhow, I'm usually happy to ress folks if I can.  The requests I had were friendly up to later on in the evening.  Then, ..  I dunno..  something happened.  It was as though Scotty himself had beemed up all intelligent life from the planet.  <br>
<br>
As I'm ressing some folks, between pulls..  someone hollers /ooc &quot;Help&quot;  .... &quot;help!&quot; ... &quot;Help at drd ring PLZ&quot;<br>
<br>
Remember those people who would scream for help in your local newbie zone; expecting that the only reason anyone else would possibly be in EQ is because you are all there to service them with their every need?<br>
<br>
... did you ever wonder what became of those people? <br>
<br>
Well, I'm here to tell you what became of those people.  <br>
<br>
-- They LEVELED!<br>
<br>
2 minutes later, I received this tell:<br>
<br>
&quot;Need ress at drd ring plz&quot;<br>
<br>
I said I was healing a group on the beach, right side as you exit druid ring, between the othmirs towards the tower, (but not quite to the Bulthars).  If he needed a ress from me, please drag it and I'd do so as mana allows.  He replies, &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br>

I /ooc: &quot;Hi there people who are sending me tells looking for resses..  I'm healing a group on the beach, right side as you exit druid ring, between the othmirs towards the tower.  If you need a ress from me, please drag it and I'd do so as mana allows&quot;<br>
<br>
I receive another tell from someone else.  &quot;Where are you?&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;healing a group on the beach, between the othmirs towards the tower.  If you need a ress from me, please drag it and I'd do so as mana allows&quot;<br>
<br>
They drag corpse over.  I ress it.  No problem.<br>
<br>
Another tell comes from a person in yet the same guild.  I give him the loc.  He drags his corpse over, I ress it.  No huge explanation, no problem.<br>
<br>
The first person sends me a tell, &quot;Can u come to drd ring?&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;No, I'm healing a group&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;PLZ?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;nope&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You're near the tower?  Where is the tower?  Can't u just meet me?&quot;<br>
<br>
I say, &quot;Uh-  &quot;I'm healing a group.. in battle&quot;  <br>
<br>
He says, &quot;So... meet at the towers then?&quot;<br>
He says, &quot;plz&quot;<br>
<br>
At this point, I'm annoyed.  Not even just *slightly* annoyed, I mean... REALLY annoyed.  --  Ready-to -start-spewing-out-effenheimers-type-annoyed.  I began to ponder if there was some joke I should know about? (I was grouped with my guild... you never know)  Or had there been a spawning of beached f*cking idiots?  Did Ebay have a discount sale?  --  Was the moon in saggitarius?  I don't know folks..  From here on out, I refer to this person as:<br>

/afk message:  Hidee-ho!  I'm banging my head against my desk at the moment..  your chances of getting a Ressurection are:   Slim &amp; None..  Slim just left town!  Leave a message after the beep.&quot;<br>
