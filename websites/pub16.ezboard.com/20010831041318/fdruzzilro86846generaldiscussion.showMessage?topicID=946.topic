(long post)</span><hr size=1> Last nite, I was with the guild while we started to head into the deep trenches of SS, again. The following is a conversation that completely un-nerved me. I have taken names out, of course. I tried take screenshots, but missed a couple times. Some words are remembered and not retyped... But.. Please, tell me... Why do clerics have to put up with this?<br>
<br>
Noname: M'Lady I've been killed in Wakening Lands - on the chance that I can find my poor body and bring it to the zone would you consider rezing it?<br>
Me: Sorry.. no.. I'm in guild raid.<br>
Noname: I'll remember that next time Clan Brigatta asks Noname2 for a rez.<br>
Me: There's no need to treat me that way.. I'm sorry, but I am currently the only cleric on guild raid and 1m. I can not run out of the zone to rez you.<br>
Noname: (said somethin... I missed on screenshot)<br>
Me: You don't like my answer, put me on ignore.<br>
Noname: I see you haven't changed. I'll tell noname3 that<br>
Noname: and noname2<br>
<br>
...&quot;you have been killed by rudemob from train&quot;...<br>
...&quot;you have lost a level. You are now 54&quot;...<br>
...&quot;Loading, please wait&quot;...<br>
You have entered Trakanon's Teeth.<br>
<br>
Me: You are about the rudest person I have ever met. No matter, now I have legitimate reason to not run out to rez you. /who all Ladi, jerk off.<br>
Noname: wonderful reparte.. absolutely sparkling.<br>
Me: You don't like my answer, put me on ignore.<br>
Noname: its not what you say, its the way you behave now and in the past - I am not surprised at all at your behavior. Be safe and have a WONDERFUL guildraid.<br>
Noname: ***kissy<br>
<br>
At this point, I just stopped responding. Was no need to continue. Why peeps think we are rude and insensitive when we can't rush out of something to rez them? I know plenty people that I have gone out of my way for, but usually I am not planning as deep a raid into SS as I was last nite. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Here's another one.... from about a week back.  Differant person, of course.<br>
<br>
Noname: Paying for a rez, plz<br>
Me: Sorry... takin guild to CoM.<br>
Noname: Your the only Cleric here plz I have 2 corpses only asking for one<br>
Noname: plz<br>
Me: Sorry... takin guild to CoM.<br>
Noname: PLZ!<br>
Noname: If you have a Guild that finds riading is more honorable than helping someone in need I am so sorry.<br>
Noname: I will pay 30pp<br>
<br>
....&quot;Loading Please wait&quot;....<br>
....&quot;You have entered Emerald Jungle&quot;....<br>
<br>
Noname: You are selfish. You know that? Wanting to raid in front of helping someone which your skill can help with? You are one heartless person.<br>
Noname: And what Honor do you show not even responding to me? None my friend. I feel much sarrow for you.<br>
Me: Pardon you a second. Just take one step back and pardon YOU. I am leading a group of younger levels in my guild to CoM so they can learn it. I am helping MY FAMILY and do NOT deserve this from you. Back off and learn some MANNERS.<br>
<br>
At this point, my temper hit the roof. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I think you now know why I am called the &quot;tempermental, highly exciteable leader of Clan B&quot;. Noname, in this instance, did not choose to respond to that last tell.<br>
<br>
Ok... so I have a temper. But, I also have 3 clerics. Lvl 55, 52, &amp; 45. I have hated going /roleplay from day 1. I am proud of all I have accomplished and should NOT be expected to go /roleplay to hide that I am cleric and not available for rez. Am I so wrong to get upset that people can be this rude? Yea, I know... cleric job is to heal, buff, rez. But, when busy with guild am I REALLY expected to drop everything and RUN to rez someone who died? Honestly?<br>
<br>
Sorry for long rant... but I'd love to hear what the clerics of Druzzil Ro feel about this!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

(long post)</span><hr size=1> 'Tis sad when people cannot see the whole picture, and realize when a cleric is busy. <br>
<br>
I'll add a story of my own, hoping it doesn't detract from your tale.<br>
<br>
Last night in Kael Drakken, my RL brother, who plays a ranger died while trying to go though with camo, which faded at an bad time. I dragged his corpse to the EW zone, where I saw a lvl 54'ish cleric medding. <br>
<br>
I asked them if they could rez him, offered to pay, and they refused to answer at first. They stood up, looked around, and again refused. They stated that it takes a lot of mana, and they were busy with the guild.<br>
<br>
I then started checking in /gu to see if any clerics were nearby, or to see if any other clerics were near a zone. I also noticed that this cleric was still standing (at least for a couple minutes), and commented to her that if she can stand instead of medding, then why can't she cast a rez on my brother... *shrug*<br>
<br>
- - -<br>
<br>
Here's the kicker... I drag his corpse to the other zone, get him a rez, and get a tell from someone who saw me near the EW zone. He died somewhere in the middle, and wanted to know if I could drag his body to the EW zone...<br>
<br>
OK, ask my Brother, and friends who were waiting for me, to hang on, b/c I had to do a quick Corpse recovery. *shrug* I do it all the time, they understood and continued to wait, and med...<br>
<br>
So I get this persons corpse to the other side and who is waiting there to rez them? The same person that refused to rez my brother!<br>
<br>
I don't hold grudges, I try not to be judgemental, BUT I hope that you read this (*cough* cleric with a birds name...), and rethink how people help each other out in this game.<br>
<br>
- - - - -<br>
<br>
Ladi - sorry for hijacking the post, guess I wanted to show another side of 'rez requests'. I DO feel for you and the random tells you get, and how annoying it can be.<br>
<br>
If any of you out there feel compelled to /tell random clerics for a rez, at least have the courtesy to have the body dragged to their feet, and offer to pay for thier time if they are busy, and most important, UNDERSTAND when they are busy, on a raid, or whatnot, and don't be rude.<br>
<br>
And on the 'other side', Clerics, wake up, lend a hand, and realize that the person you refuse to help may be the person helping you out 5 minutes later! <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulanadina.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lanadina</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://www.angelfire.com/oh4/Selice/heart_red.gif HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 27<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(7/17/01 12:04:56 pm)</font><br>     <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://www.arthistory.cc/html/josephlinsner/56.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Rant!

I feel for ya. I can't tell you how many times people have berated me in tells because I couldn't go ress them. If I'm on a raid, or on the way, I cannot do the ressurection. But there have also been times that I've gone out of my way to help perfect strangers.<br>

<br>
Lady S,  I would have added them to my no ress list and dished back every bit of BS they gave me.  What did he/she think you would say?  &quot;Howdilly doodilly!  Oh thank you for being a disgusting little twit, I'll be right there to help you!&quot;  <br>
<br>
Props to you, Lady S!<br>
<br>
I don't know how people rationalize that it's okay to try and make a cleric feel bad for not wishing to leave their groups and guildmates in danger.  My advice to the non-clerical ress needing people out there is, &quot;don't try it&quot;. <br>
<br>
 If I can ress you, you can bet I WILL ress you.  If I say I can't ress you, well..  I really mean that I can't ress you.  Offering more money only makes me ticked off.  My group's safety is the most important.  It takes precedence over the plat which is so generously offered. <br>
<br>
It's not just our job to ress people, it's our job to keep the people in our groups alive and full of health so that we don't have to ress them.  Being a cleric means you have to be alert and paying attention to how fast your groups health is dropping. <br>
<br>
How would people feel if the shoe was on the other foot?<br>
<br>
Aaay, teleporters, do you leave your group in a dangerous dungeon to go port someone for money?<br>
<br>
Necros? Do you ditch your group to run off a few zones away to summon a corpse whenever someone asks you?<br>
<br>
Rogues?  -  Do you disband your group in the middle of a raid to leave the zone and drag someone's corpse whenever they ask you?<br>
<br>
Hello there kind enchanter!  Will you run over here to the Overthere, from Lake of Ill Omen and clarity me?<br>
<br>
Shamans, would you ditch your group because that guy across the zone needs a sow?<br>
<br>
Heeey, magicians, would you leave your group because a  ranger 3 zones away needs arrows badly?<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, golly I sure hope not!<br>
<br>
The final question...<br>
<br>
Would YOU want to be grouped with me if I left you to go ress someone for cash?<br>

Druids, because I have had SOOO many bad experiences with them that it makes my eyes burn to even read the name sometimes. Clerics are the other one, because as many jerks as I run into as a Shaman, there are 20 times as many that you all have to deal with.<br>
<br>
&lt;Insert personal rant here&gt;<br>
Eating a death is not fun, but guess what sometimes you have to. I ate yet another one on Saturday because I was too damned stubborn to gate away from a blue mob. That's my fault. At no point did it ever occur to me to start sending tells to people I don't know and who are not even in the same zone to help me recover from MY mistake. When I did try creating a cleric, I must have missed the screen that stated that I HAD to res anyone who wanted one. <br>
<br>
I don't care if you drag your rotting corpse over and drop it on my boots, I still have absolutely no obligation to do anything about it. Especially if my group is engaged in combat or recovering from combat.<br>
<br>
As a shaman, I will not travel across a zone just to buff someone, no matter how much you beg or what names you call me. If I were a cleric and I was busy doing ANYTHING at all that I find more interesting than resing you, I might not take ten steps to the left to res you. Call me names or get in my face and I absolutely will not do anything for you. In fact I'd rather stand there and offer free reses to anyone else in the zone than res you. Sorry everyone. Rude people make me almost as angry as stupid people. <br>
&lt;End personal rant&gt;<br>
<br>
Ladi S, I wish you had posted the names of these people so I know who NOT to help in the future. Keep in mind that most of us schlubs who can't res have no hard feelings if you happen to be near but cannot res us. AND we sure as hell appreciate the drive-by reses that some clerics drop on our dead selves occasionally. At least that's how I feel.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ustratdregar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>strat dregar</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC=http://files.mrfixitonline.com/moodstamps/237.gif BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(7/17/01 1:56:04 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.gigahosts.com/~c1003/aimicons/icons/3dstuff/militaryflags/marines.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: hmmm</span><hr size=1> yeah im sure every clr has had this kindda thing happen to them i have been through this many times.  some people just &quot;cant uderstand&quot; for some reason.<br>

Druids, rangers and shaman SoW.  Clerics and paladins rez/revive.  Rogues drag corpses.  The list goes on.<br>
<br>
Who are the people who have this attitude?  The same ones who base a character only on stats, and who will mock you for having &quot;newb&quot; gear.  They don't care that you have something better to do (have fun?), because if you aren't there to perform your class-defining ability for their benefit, you aren't worth the bandwidth you're sucking down.<br>
<br>
If I sound a little bitter, it's because of the stupidity I am subjected to every time I enter a zone.  While on the way to a raid, this is the basic dialogue I had with one such person...<br>
<br>
Dude_001: Can you plz port me?  I need to get to Freeport!  (I was in Everfrost at the time).<br>
Me: No, sorry, on my way to a Vox raid.<br>
Dude_001: Plz?  You can come right back to your raid.<br>
Me: Sorry, the nearest druid ring is in NK and I won't have time.<br>
Dude_001: Dude plz.  I just need someone to port me to Freeport and PL me to 15.  Plz help me.<br>
Me: Do I know you?<br>
Dude_001: No, but dude plz.  <br>

I know exactly how you feel, and that kind of thing bothers me too.  I had the same kind of experience.<br>
<br>
One day I was hunting in KC and I had the misfortune of being the only 49+ Cleric in the zone, and it was one of those horrible, horrible train days (Is it just me, or does that seem to happen more and more often?) As such, I was rezzing people all the time, even forced my group to zone when someone dragged a corpse to be rezzed to me in LCY and brought a train.  Well, after several hours of spending 20 min getting xp, 30 min zoning, 30 min doing CR, and 40 min rezzing, I was getting a little frustrated. I was less than half a blue from hitting 52 (again) and I just wanted to get xp.<br>
     I finally get in a moat group when I get another request for a rez at the zone.  I tell the guy sorry, but I am low on mana (just under 2m) with no clarity, and I am just rezzed out for the day.  Well, the guy can't believe this and we exchange tells for 5 min, when I realise there is just no way to make this person understand what I have gone through. To him, I am just being selfish.<br>
<br>
Now I understand his point of view being how could I not rezz him when he is so close and so on.  The problem is he has no idea what my point of view, and unless people play clerics, they probably can't. Do any of you realise that when you ask me for a rez, you might be the 20th person to ask me in the last 2 hours? Sure, that almost never happens, but it does happen.  <br>
<br>
I guess the thing that frustrates me the most is, no matter how many nice things I do, how many people I've helped, it's the one event people take badly (like above) that get's remembered. I hope I don't get a bad rep, but I can see how they can get started out of misunderstandings.<br>

<br>
Can you rez me<br>
I respond where'd you die<br>
they say i didnt die my friend did tell him<br>
i say to myself nope if the other guy wants a rez he can tell me<br>
I contune to Chardok... go AFK a few min to cook supper, wish i must say where the ebst hamburgers ive had in ages..<br>
come back seeing ive been spamed in tell to rez. so i kindly tell the guy I am omw to chardok i am busy i cannot.<br>
<br>
The guy continues in OOC saying Deal lmalla Can you make your cleric rezz me..<br>
<br>
this continues till people in my guild step in... i ingore him...<br>
i guess after i zoned to chardok he basahed me and lmalla for not rezzing him..<br>
<br>
the moral of this story is and I must stress this<br>
<br>
<br>
A RESSURECTION IS A PRIVILAGE NOT A RIGHT! IF A CLERIC SAYS NO DO NOT PESTER THEM! <br>
<br>
You can ask almost anyone, you send me a tell and your ncie about it I'll rez you for free even and half the time ill pop 200p out to pay a druid to port me to you.<br>

The noname that wanted a rez while I was in SS did not understand that I was busy... and he chose the time that I was in deep combat, tryin to help guild kill this train, to get angry at me.<br>

I don't know, now, exactly why I wanted to post this... cept that perhaps I wanted another point of view so that if the Nonames mentioned read this board, they will *maybe* understand?<br>

Some don't seem to understand that YOU are a player just as they are, and whether the cleric they ask for the rez is busy or not is irrelevant because they want to be rezzed and now. Here is one of my favorite all time conversations from someone who just didn't get it:<br>
<br>
(The names have been left out to protect the stupid.)<br>
<br>
Some_Guy01 tells you,&quot;Can I get a rez?&quot;<br>
You tell Some_Guy01,&quot;I'm sorry, but I'm currently deep inside Velk's Lab.&quot;<br>
Some_Guy01,&quot;I'll drag it to the zone line. PLEASE!&quot;<br>
You tell Some_Guy01,&quot;I'm in deep. Way past the point of being able to gate out, rez and make it back to my group. Sorry.&quot;<br>
Some_Guy01,&quot;Just because you are in an ub3r guild, you think you are special or somethin&quot;<br>
(At this point, it made me laugh.)<br>
You tell Some_Guy01,&quot;Let's put it this way, even if I was in a guild no one ever heard of, it still is impossible to get to YOU and rez, then return to the point where we are. Seeing as how I'm keeping them healed, it would be poor judgment to do so. Have a nice day.&quot;<br>
Some_Guy01,&quot;Fuck you! See if I ever help you!&quot;<br>
You tell Some_Guy01,&quot;I'll try not to lose sleep over it.&quot;<br>
/ignore Some_Guy01<br>
<br>
<br>
See? How can you really get frustrated when you deal with idiots? I try not to think of it as anything to get burned up about, so I use the /ignore command.<br>

Sorry to say this but unfortunately I don't think any of our points will be getting to those that need to understand what they are doing wrong. One good side effect is punching the keyboard will help vent some of those frustrations. <br>
<br>
As a druid I do get requests all the time for ports, buffs, sow etc, I will when I can but if I am busy will just say &quot;Sorry friend but am busy doing &lt;fill in here&gt;, otherwise would do it&quot;. If they continue then response is either ignore or say &quot;sorry but just cannot&quot;. Do not expound any further, if they choose to get nasty then they have just burnt a bridge that most likely will never be rebuilt. <br>
<br>
EQ time is too limited to waste on those that are not nice (except roleplayers)... so save you fingers, save your mental health and save your mana for those that deserve it and get back to enjoying the game.<br>

One night a few months back I was playing in Unrest and got killed by a train, while my group managed to escape.  One of the group members said he was going to ask a cleric to rez me, and I old him not to bother.  I was only 20th, so I didn't lost that much experience.  Next thing I know, I get a tell from Cassandrah asking if I am ready for my rez.  I zone back into Unrest and thank her profusely, then sit and as soon as I medded enough mana to cast Breeze, the first one went to her, even before myself.  She seemed almost shocked, but I really appreciated her spending all that mana on me and increasing her downtime to reduce mine.  Why can't these people who complain about not getting rezzed understand? <p>Vexis Larseker<BR>

As a druid who spends a lot of time medding I've put together the following statistics which help me to understand why clerics and druids are in such need in Norrath.  They are:<br>
<br>
1)  65% of all corpses in Norrath are within 5 minutes of poofing, leaving thousands of poor souls with nothing to show for their 3 hours of game time,<br>
<br>
2)  35% of all Norrathian citizens only carry 5 copper on them, regardless of what day it is,<br>
<br>
3)  95% of the population of Druzzil Ro are doing CR's at the SAME time,<br>
<br>
4)  Only 1% of the population of Norrath is made up of druids and clerics (2% on Saturday nights),<br>
<br>
5)  100% of the people who think I'm rich because I can SoW and port are incorrect,<br>
<br>
6)  0% is the amount of experience you actually get from doing SoW's and ports (as hard as that may be for some people to believe).<br>

Second, omg...people sure can talk a lot when they are p.o.'ed. I think I can understand where some of the attitude comes from with the people you are complaining about. I know 9 people that have characters that use those characters for one reason...to make money (affectionately known as wh@#3s). This is only the people that I know of, I'm sure there is more. It goes along the same lines as the campers that camp items only for money. So yes, I can understand some of the attitude that the jerks have, they think everyone with the ability to make money with their skills, should.<br>
<br>
It's been mentioned a couple times already, the /ignore command works wonders. Also, the more you interact with someone that you KNOW is going to be a jerk, the more of a jerk they will be. Sometimes I find myself getting down to there level just to defend myself, that is non-sense, just /ignore them, we are bigger than that. <br>
