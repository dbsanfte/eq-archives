A very interesting thing to note here about the Bimini road and that is Edgar Caycee, the sleeping prophet fortold of its discovery what forty or so years before it was found?  He gave readings and healed people all over the world just frmo going into a trance and allowing his psychic self to 'read' people and he also did some readings about Atalantis and even talked of living a incarnation there as a Atlantean citizen<br>
<br>
Also worth mentioning is that perhaps if they bothered to check the road might even run along the earth's linear magnetic alignment.  In the book by Peter Noone, 5/5/2000, he has pictures of that special Kerlian film showing the 'pyrimid energies' that are undeniablly there on that film, which easily could explain ALOT of things about pyrimids ya know?  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <p><font face="Verdana,Arial" size=1><hr>Have a good one & chat with you later!

For where Atlantis might be:<br>

<br>
Of all the books I've read on Atlantis, the most impressive (and the one <br>
with the most archaeological evidence) is Rodney Castleden's Atlantis <br>
Destroyed, published this year by Routledge.  Castleden also wrote The <br>
Making of Stonehenge, The Knossos Labyrinth, The Stonehenge People, <br>
Neolithic Britain, and Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete. (And Classic <br>
Landforms of the Sussex Coast for the Geographical Association, but <br>
that's not relevant here!).<br>
<br>
On page 7 he discusses the Pillars of Hercules:<br>
&quot;Before the sixth century BC several mountains on the edges of mainland <br>
Greece were seen as supports for the sky.  Amongst others, the two <br>
southward-pointing headlands on each side of the Gulf of Laconia were <br>
pillars of Heracles.  Then, to the Greeks, a large island with one end <br>
just outside the pillars of Heracles could only have meant Crete. [This <br>
isn't the sum of Castleden's thesis, wait for it]...Support for a <br>
Peloponnesian location for the pillars comes, unexpectedly, from Egypt.  <br>
The Medinet Habu texts, dating from 1200 BC, describe the Sea Peoples <br>
invading from islands to the north (possibly the Aegean), 'from the <br>
pillars of heaven', by which the Egyptians probably meant that the <br>
invaders came from the end of the world as they knew it.'<br>
<br>
He then goes on to say &quot;The thesis of this book is that the story is not <br>
one piece of identifiable proto-history but several, and that Plato drew <br>
them together because he wanted to weave them into a parable that <br>
commented on the state of the world in his own times ... he wanted to <br>
entertain, improve and exalt his readers.  A distant memory of the Minoan <br>
civilization was available, preserved for his use, as he said, by the <br>
seventh century priests in the Nile delta.  The wealth, orderliness and <br>
strangeness of the Minoans are sketched in for us.&quot; Castleden then points <br>
out that Plato does not write about Atlantis as a utopia, but about <br>
Athens -- &quot;It is the Athenians who are described in utopian terms.  It is <br>
they who have relinquished private property... and have prolific fields <br>
and boundless pastures.  It is Athens that is the excellent land with <br>
well-tempered seasons.&quot;<br>
<br>
Castleden follows this with a very detailed discussion of the archaeology <br>
and geography of Minoan Crete and Thera and how that compares with <br>
Plato's tale.  He goes into detail about how the story might have been <br>
transmitted to Plato and Plato's possible motives in writing the two <br>
essays.  (He also mentions that there was a century older text by <br>
Hellanicus, of which only a small fragment survives, called 'Atlantis'!).<br>
<br>
In the last chapter, he writes &quot;There are several reasons why there have <br>
been so many misunderstandings about the nature of Atlantis and its <br>
location in time and space:<br>
<br>
&quot;1.  Plato left the various elements in the story's visible and <br>
undigested.  Although he altered it, he did not do so thoroughly and the <br>
result is that Atlantis as described cannot have existed at all.  That <br>
has led some commentators to claim mistakenly that the story is fiction <br>
from start to finish, and thus to overlook the proto-historical content.<br>
<br>
&quot;2.  The Egyptians who acquired the story in 1520 BC or shortly <br>
afterwards had a very different geographical sense from he Greeks of <br>
Plato's or Solon's time.  To the 16th-century Egyptians, the Aegean was a <br>
long way to the west.  When the story was passed to Solon, the known <br>
world was expanding rapidly, and either Solon or the priest may have <br>
assumed that Atlantis was out in the newly visited Atlantic Ocean.This <br>
mistake may actually have led to the ocean being named after the lost <br>
land, rather than the other way around as most people have assumed.<br>
<br>
&quot;3. The geographical mistake was compounded by a misreading of Linear A <br>
or B numerals, or a misreading of hieratic or demotic copies of the story <br>
made in Sais by Egyptian scribes, in the fifteenth century or later.  <br>
This led to a tenfold exaggeration of many of the distance measurements, <br>
and a hundredfold exaggeration of area, so that the Plain of Mesara, <br>
instead of being small enough to fit into central Crete, was inflated to <br>
the size of the southern Aegean.  The land areas involved became too big <br>
to fit into the Mediterranean: another reason for removing Atlantis to <br>
the outer ocean.<br>
<br>
&quot;4.  A similar mistranslation of numerals led to an exaggeration of the <br>
900 years elapsing between Thera's destruction and Solon's Egyptian visit <br>
to 9000 years.  The idea of an advanced bronze age culture ...in 9600 BC <br>
has always been unacceptable to pre-historians, and that has helped to <br>
push Atlantis to the outer fringes of academic study.<br>
<br>
[Here I'd like to interject that I've always been puzzled by those who <br>
believe in a 9600 BC Atlantis and ignore the archaeological evidence that <br>
there was no 9600 BC bronze age Athens.  They seem to want to say that <br>
half the story is true, the other half false.]<br>
<br>
&quot;5. The hypothesis revived repeatedly in the 20th century - that Minoan <br>
Crete was Atlantis - has proved inadequate ... The parallel hypothesis, <br>
based on more recent archaeological evidence, that Cycladic Thera was <br>
Atlantis is also in itself inadequate.  Because these hypotheses can be <br>
rejected separately, many have rejected the idea that Atlantis might have <br>
existed in the southern Aegean, understandably overlooking the <br>
possibility that if the two hypotheses are combined they do meet the <br>
needs of Plato's description.<br>
<br>
6. -- omitted, about the Pillars of Heracles and dealt with above. <br>
<br>
&quot;7. It is possible that contemporary allegorical readings of the tale <br>
were intended to be implicitly ironic, and that in relation to Sparta and <br>
Syracuse Plato intended Athens to be Atlantis.  From the execution of <br>
Socrates, Plato learned the value of cricumspection and may have chosen, <br>
for safety's sake, not to say directly what he meant.&quot;<br>
<br>
What I find so impressive in this book, as I've said, is the wealth of <br>
archaeological evidence.<br>
<br>
One final point. Castleden is holding to the later date for the Thera <br>
eruption, and includes an appendix justifying this.<br>
<br>
Castleden goes into a lot of detail about where Plato got inspiration for <br>
various aspects of his story.<br>
<br>
A nuch older book, Atlantis: Fact or Fiction, ed. Edwin Ramage, is also <br>
interesting, especially the section on the literary perspective.<br>
<br>
Doug<br>
<br>
Ah. They didn't close the Great Pyramid, the 'door' is an 8 inch square block of stone -- might be something on the other side of it, of course.<br>
<br>
There are no old stories about Atlantis and Lemuria, the very name Lemuria was invented by geologists in the 19th century.<br>

So it strikes me that Plato included this to add validity to the story, because he really wanted to be believed.<br>
<br>
At any rate, my favorite story of the real Atlantis is the one that suggests that it's South America.  There's nowhere it contradicts the aforementioned details in Plato's writings.<br>
<br>
And I too have heard about Cayce's descriptions of Atlantis, I just don't know what to make of that.  He doesn't have a perfect track record, but it's at least very thought provoking.  As for the Bimini road, I've read a lot about it, but I never heard about it actually leading to anything. (pyramids, tripods, crystals, etc).

Who is to say that in thousands of years from now someone won't find a book by a fantasy or science fiction author and think that it's true? Perhaps Atlantis is someone's fictional creation ~ only with time fiction become to believed as truth/myth. It's strange that ancient stories are always believed to be allegories, but never for the pure and simple joy of entertainment? Personally I think Atlantis is a great idea, but it's fiction.  <p><html>

<br>
Imagining Atlantis by Richard Ellis, a badly put-together book that nevertheless covers everything and then some.<br>
<br>
Citadels of Mystery by L. Sprague de Camp has an excellent chapter on Atlantis.<br>
<br>
Citing &quot;details&quot; as some sort of evidence or proof is ridiculous, as all fiction, including Utopian examples, use details for verisimillitude.<br>
<br>
The numbers in Plato would place Atlantis either between or just outside the Pillars of Hercules, through the Srait of Gilbraltar or just outside the Mediterranean Ocean in the Atlantic Ocean.  There is no sign of such a &quot;continent&quot;, not even a large sunken island.<br>
<br>
Best guess is that Atlantis was Thera, which blew apart in a detonation bigger than Mt. St. Helens and caused huge tidal waves and so on.  Read Pliny the Younger's eye-witness account of Herculaneum and Pompeii and raise the destruction by an order of magnitude or more, and you'll have some idea.<br>
<br>
The stubborn belief in some magical &quot;Atlantis&quot; never dies, of course, as the work of Graham Hancock demonstrates.  And each sunken city he locates off this or that coast becomes &quot;...the new site of Atlantis...&quot; in the media.  It's sad, really.<br>

One's off the coast of China and the authorities aren't being cooperative, fearing the find will contradict their imaginary history.<br>

The second is off the coast of Japan and the other is off Cuba.  There are others being investigated as possibles.<br>

How long before is anyone's guess, just now, but only by finding out can we ever know.  Closing minds to this is silly, and refusing to research or explore sillier still.<br>
