<br>
<br>
<br>
Their shadows merging into the coming darkness of dusk, a ragged band of mercenaries sat around the wavering flames of a small campfire.  Armor and weapons still bore blood, not an hour old, while shields and helms lay discarded, dented and battered.  The weary party numbered four, although another two had at one time fought beside them.  The broken form of an elven cleric lay nearby, hastily covered by a torn cape, while unseen desert scavengers picked at the remains of what, in life, had been a human ranger from distant Surefall Glade.<br>
<br>
Wincing, Cirrean Shadakine flinched as the Northman warrior finished binding her wounded sword-arm.  An orcish battle axe had taken the skin off, from shoulder to elbow, although fortunately it had not been a well-placed blow.  Luckily, the brute had been wielding a bronze axe rather than the typical rusty blades many of the Deathfist tribe bore, so the wound was clean...as wounds go.  The other members of the party shared in various injuries, but otherwise could not have been more different.  The barbarian warrior leaned heavily on a massive warhammer, facepaint and blood smeared across his face and arms.  A gnome necromancer, his black robes torn and filthy, scrounged for bone chips, while a half-elf bard attempted to repair the slashed straps of her dusty blue armor.  Her breastplate was creased down one side, where an orc raider had dealt a painful blow with a spiked mace.  The sound of cracking ribs had been all too clear above the noise of melee, but Cirrean had run the orc through upon her sword, stopping it from delivering a killing blow.<br>
<br>
Grumbling to himself, the barbarian ran calloused fingers through his cropped red-brown hair, surveying the carnage around him.  Far from his clan in Halas, Nian McBrannon felt out of place in the Desert of Ro, surrounded by scorching sand and earth baked hard by the wrath of the sun.  The ranger, Brice, had been his companion while journeying through the Karanas, and the two had become an effective team.  They had slain many a bandit during their travels, and had relieved a number of roaming animals of their skins, which Nian stowed in his pack for when he returned to the family tailoring business.  Now, Brice - or what remained of him - was being torn apart by jackals behind a nearby dune, although he had already been hacked beyond recognition by the first wave of orcs.  Nothing much left to bury...<br>
<br>
The high elf cleric, Vanathos, had done his best to keep Brice alive, but that only resulted in placing him next in line for death at the hands of the green-skinned savages.  He had been journeying to the Oasis of Marr with his betrothed, the bard Gallice, and reluctant to set up camp with the others.  It crossed Nian's mind that the two elves would not have lasted long against an orc partrol on their own, but safety in numbers didn't stop a simple wooden club from breaking the journeyman's frail back.  The lad should have been smarter than to try going toe-to-toe against the rival orc priest, but he wouldn't listen to reason. Or have an &quot;uncultured&quot; barbarian telling him to stand down in front of his woman.  The necromancer, Zekerek, had managed quite well, his summoned skeleton fending off orcs amidst a vile green cloud and acidic rain which the gnome conjured up with unrepressed glee.  Honestly, Nian couldn't say whether or not the evil spellcaster had complete control over the poisonous storm or not, but it was undeniably effective.<br>
<br>
And then there was Cirrean, the Erudite woman.  Nian and Brice had come upon her in Kithicor Forest, on the road towards Freeport, just as the sun was setting behind the mountains surrounding Highpass.  At first they had thought her to be a paladin, perhaps seeking to slay the risen undead in the forest at night.  That was until they spoke to her, inquiring as to what a young woman might be doing alone in such a place at that darkening hour.  The Northman could not help but chuckle, recalling Brice's rather blatant attempts to charm the girl.  Needless to say, the ranger changed his attitude a bit once she showed her true colors.  Then again, pink armor didn't reflect her &quot;true colors&quot; in the first place.  But for whatever reason, she agreed to join up with them as they headed into the desert.  The Freeport Militia, despite the misgivings some citizens had about them, were very honest in their hatred for the Deathfist Clan of orcs that were encroaching on their very gates.  Honest, and willing to pay well for any mercenary willing to hunt kill every orc that dare set foot in the Commonlands.<br>
<br>
Having met the gnome necromancer as he set foot on the Oasis dock, and the elven couple at a nearby fishing village, the unlikely group headed back towards Freeport.  Rumor had it that the orcs had joined forces with a nomadic band of dervishes, and were threatening the human habitations there.  Nian had his own personal interests as well, hoping to visit a cousin who had come to live in a coastal Northman settlement at the edge of the grasslands.  While Zekerek told tales of the lizard empire in Kunark, and Gallice sang songs of heroes long gone, they trudged across the dunes beneath the rays of a raging yellow sun.  That is when they crossed paths with the orcs.  The odds were grim, fifteen Deathfist orcs versus their six.  Brice, having difficulty while trying to scout ahead amidst shifting sand, was the first to fall.  Vanathos tried to get off a healing spell, but Brice was already face down in the sand.  Nian and Cirrean ran forward, weapons held high, while the gnome called forth a skeletal pet from the scattered bones that lay among the sand.  Gallice, clutching her lute, stood in shock for a moment before nervously drawing a shortsword.  Brice, if he still breathed at all, was trampled as the orcs charged.  What followed was unrestrained killing, almost artistic in execution.  As the terrified bard looked on, her elven suitor was lifted right off his feet by an orc's wooden club.  Nian and Cirrean waded through the orcish mob, hammer and sword arching overhead, coming down in methodic blows, and rising up again covered in a haze of blood and sand.  Meanwhile, the gravity of the situation finally dawned on Gallice, as Vanathos landed in a crumpled heap at her feet.  The words of some battle hymn on her lips, she cast aside reluctance and joined the fray, as Zekerek began to summon a furious maelstrom of plague and poison.  <br>
<br>
It was the combined effort of the remaining four that earned them victory, although the orcs fought to the last breath.  Cirrean undoubtedly saved Gallice's life as the orc commander was attempting to crush the half-elf's skull, while Nian fought alongside the necromancer's undead servant to break down the orcs' attack.  Choked by the noxious fog, the green beasts put up little resistance.  His cape clenched over his face with one hand, Nian swung his hammer in circles, crushing orc bones at every turn.  Cirrean, while felling orcs with vicious two-handed slashes, began to utter the words of a spell.  Just as the barbarian warrior thought that he could fight no longer, the last of the orcs ran off into the dunes in a sudden panic.  The encounter was over almost as quickly as it had started.  By anyone's count, a dozen dead orcs at the cost of two lives seemed more than reasonable, but such odds do not take friendship into account.  Nian maintained his composure, but both physical and emotional pain drove Gallice to unconciousness.<br>
<br>
So there they were, under a twilight sky, the aura of death still heavy in the air.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Old Enemies, New Battlefields...<br>
<br>
<br>
&quot;Nian, we need to break camp and get moving before the surviving orcs come back with friends!&quot; Cirrean snapped, irritated to no end by the renewed sobs of Gallice.  All night, the bard had sat with her back to the fire, looking out into the shadows and trembling.  Vanathos' death had virtually sapped her will to go on, but Cirrean felt little sympathy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Elf, your lover is dead.  A cleric whose god did not save him could not have been much of a holy man.  His own brash actions got him killed, to impress the likes of you.  Nobody forced his hand, and...&quot; the shadowknight was cut short by an angry glare from Nian.<br>
<br>
&quot;Woman, you overstep your bounds.  Gallice has lost her lifemate, and whatever the circumstances, mourning is a path that must be tread.  Even one who serves a dark god should know some measure of grief, for someone or something!&quot; Nian's words had far from the desired effect, as the dark paladin sneered and shot the gnome necromancer a wicked grin.  Zekerek snickered, but said nothing.  Shouldering his heavy pack, the Northman shook his head and kicked sand over the smoldering remains of the fire.  The accursed summer sun was already high in the sky as they set out for the barbarian village up the coast.<br>
<br>
As the first of the thatch-roofed huts came into view, Cirrean's gaze shifted westward.  During her time spent training with the Tier’Dal in Neriak, she had overheard talk of an emissary to the Deathfist Clan, a dark elf by the name of Dorn.  Given her present company, and their activities in the desert, it would probably be best to avoid the elf until she could make a quick visit alone.  He was supposedly operating out of a dervish camp near the barbarian village, so she made a point of scanning the horizon for unwanted guests.  Muttering the words of a spell, she blinked as a purple light flashed at the backs of her eyes.  No, there was nobody pursuing them, visible by the naked eye or by magic vision.  The Northmen, however, were a different story entirely.  One glance made it clear that Nian, not thinking before he spoke, had mentioned that his dark-skinned companion was a shadowknight. The barbarians glared at Cirrean, as if daring her to make one wrong move.  She reached out and grabbed Zekerek's shoulder, stopping him in his tracks.<br>
<br>
&quot;Don't go any further.  That bonehead McBrannon felt some need to share our true professions with his countrymen.  I assure you that there are no open arms to welcome us here, so stay on your toes.  He will undoubtedly be awhile, knowing what I do about barbarian custom.&quot;  With a nod, Cirrean motioned for the gnome to follow her.<br>
<br>
While a village shaman was tending to Gallice's injuries, Nian met briefly with the local chieftain to discuss the advance of the orcs over a skin of wine.  As the greybeard spoke, it became clear to Nian that there was more going on than just skirmishes between the regional militia and the orc tribes.  The dervishes were moving northward too, and even worse, had not only ogres but also barbarians among them.  <br>
<br>
The elder's words were grim.  &quot;Nian, many of our kinsmen have joined these desert brigands, led astray by false promises.  The Freeport Militia battle the paladins and clerics of their own city for control, using the orcs as a convenient distraction to keep foreign mercenaries from interfering.  The dervish tribes have seen an opportunity to capitalize on the current situation, recruiting even ogres and orcs to assist them.  By the Hammer, there are even rumors that they receive aid from Neriak!  If Freeport were to be invaded, half the continent would be paralyzed!&quot;  As the chief finished his sentence, Nian was already on his feet and ducking out the door.  At the mention of the Tier’Dal city, his thoughts immediately went to his two mysterious companions, the gnome necromancer and the Erudite woman.  A quick jog through the village proved Nian's suspicions.<br>
<br>
They were gone.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Cirrean and Zekerek studied the map that hung from the tent wall, as a tired-looking dark elf pointed to faded markings across the stretched vellum surface.  <br>
<br>
&quot;As you can see, the Deathfist have stepped up their advances towards Freeport from the West, with camps in the Commonlands.  We have established our own camp there as well, plus my brethren have agents in the area.&quot;  Dorn B'Dynn tapped his finger against a crudely drawn building on the map, and continued.  &quot;The Indigo Brotherhood have dispatched their dragoons to monitor militia activity in the region, but it seems that the few guards stationed in the area are pleasantly corrupt.  They maintain an outpost there for appearances, but do not actively attack the Deathfist legions there...and they have strict orders not to interefere with our dervish allies.  Neriak sits poised to conquer Freeport, with a little help from these cutthroats!  Once the Freeport militia wrest control of the inner city from those blasted paladins, we can quickly attain control.  The militia are simply a mercenary army, and we know where their loyalties really lie.&quot;  The assassin sneered as he rolled up the map and tucked it into his belt.<br>
<br>
Cirrean's brow creased as she considered what the elf had said.  &quot;You tell us of Neriak's alliance with the dervishes and orcs, which is nothing new.  Ogres have always had ties to your people, and the orcs have been eager to help your kin when it suits them.  What does this have to do with me?&quot;  Her gaze was piercing, although the sporadic giggles of the gnome were taking a bit of the edge off.<br>
<br>
&quot;This conflict does not directly concern you,&quot; Dorn replied calmly, &quot;but there are events abroad that require attention.  There is a new player in another conflict, which does involve you.  Your home continent of Odus is about to become the next battleground, and the Brotherhood desires confirmation of these rumors...by someone we can trust.&quot;  Cirrean arched an eyebrow, as the dark elf continued.  &quot;Your meddlesome people have uncovered yet another mystery, probably best left alone.  As if the discovery of the Hole did not draw enough unwanted attention to our fellow practitioners of the Dark Arts in your home city of Paineel, they have now unearthed another section of Old Paineel.  It seems that a rather substantial kobold enclave exists in the buried ruins and surrounding tunnels.  These kobolds answer to a self-proclaimed King Gragnar, and have amassed quite an army.  Now then, if they were to side with the Heretics, it could shift the balance of power on Odus and give your people an opportunity to reclaim the entire continent.  On the other hand, if the kobolds simply desire to expand their own territories, Paineel could be threatened.  As if this were not bad enough, the news of an underground kingdom carries with it the promise of untold wealth and lore.  These kobold warrens are drawing adventure-seekers from all corners of Norrath to your hidden city, and the situation could quickly become out of control.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What, pray tell, is Neriak's interest in all of this?&quot; the dark paladin whispered, suddenly aware of the many ears that might be listening.<br>
<br>
&quot;There are certain...resouces...in your fair city, for which we share a common concern.  The opening of the Hole set off a chain of events that continues to unravel, and the Brotherhood does not wish to see its ally in the West besieged when certain goals are so near to being realized.&quot;  The elf's face was stern as he spoke.  Before Cirrean could question further, he pointed to the tent's entrance.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah, your transportation has arrived,&quot; he said, gesturing to another Erudite who stood at outside, cloaked in a richly embroidered red robe.  &quot;Yes, even some of your race have seen fit to join our little operation here.  If your gnomish friend would be so kind as to remain here with me for a time, I would encourage you to be on your way.&quot;<br>
<br>
Without waiting for a reply from Cirrean, the dark-skinned wizard spoke the words of a teleportation spell, and the two vanished into a shimmering portal.<br>
