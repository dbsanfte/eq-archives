I logged into Fungus Grove and spent a bit shouting LFG.  <br>
Hmm, moved on over to Netherbian (several within my range there), nothing.<br>
Tried Marus Seru for the first time - everything was green.<br>
Slid over to Mons Lataris for the first time - all alone in a blue zone (soloing rogues aren't pretty).<br>
Dawnshroud - decent number of people - the sound of crickets chirping.<br>
Grieg's End - took a wrong turn here - but still empty nonetheless.<br>
Maiden's Eye - enough that there was room in one or more groups - still nothing.<br>
<br>
In the end, I was so bored I quad-kited the Nexus Scions for a while until I ran low on mana.<br>
<br>
Total time wasted:  almost 3 hours.<br>
<br>
Where the bleep can a 48 Rogue find a group nowadays?  I haven't had this problem in months!  I don't want to resort to joining the cheap XP route of the LOIO/OT/DL/KC crowd (did some of DL already &lt;ick&gt;) and SolB seems to be PLing grounds lately.  What's left for someone who doesn't start till 11pm EST?<br>

Fugus Grove is a good spot where you can get a group, same with Maiden's Eye, but you seem to be a little low for it... Dawnshroud Peaks are high 30's range zone. Grieg's End is pretty much &quot;Bring your own group&quot; deal.. Nobody wants to kill in Sanctum Seru yet. Good place is The Grey, but zone is vacuum, you need some sort of EB item, and mostly level 52+ people hang out there..<br>

Your best bet on the moon probably would be Fungus Grove or Maiden eye..

I can just barely solo things there, which is typical of most places, Sebilis included.  The creatures are a deep blue at 60 as well, they are likely just below 52, perhaps 48-50, for the most part.  I wager the majority of the reason pick-up groups are so hard to find is that most people go with friends or their guild.  That is typically what we do.  We have also allowed oogs to occupy open spots, however each time we did we had bad experiences (other than 1) on Luclin.  Not necessarily bad people for the most part, simply lacking sufficient skill to be of use.  Perhaps this is also another reason?  <br>
<br>
Also note that many Luclin zones do not have high populations, and generally it seems the server is less busy since SoL.  I have found myself alone in zones very often, and typically there are less than 10 people in a zone with me.  I am often very surprised by the low numbers of people in Sanctus.  Additionally, it is the Christmas season when people are out doing things with family, and SoL bugs/requirements have left many people without the ability to play EQ.  Perhaps we shall see a change after the holiday season. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ufinnsonorcbringer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Finnson Orcbringer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/17/01 9:26:01 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Server populations</span><hr size=1> Whilst there will indeed be many players off doing the rounds of festive visits and other family stuff I'd have thought with schools being out and businesses closed for an extended period there would be more people with spare time to enjoy EQ.  <br>

Aw Contraire, Pierre. Maiden's Eye is fantastic exp for levels all the way up to 60. We were there last night briefly and exp was pretty speedy for my 59 Necro in a full group of 60. Sure, not ideal exp for our level so we soon moved on to The Umbral Plains. But Maiden's Eye is still much faster than anything I've seen in Chardok, Seb or Velk's.<br>
<br>
Back on topic - there were OT numbers of people in Maiden's Eye when I was there yesterday. Lots of room to set up pull points. (The amount of room is also a problem because of careless kiting idiots.) There's also plenty to camp and lots of uber drops.<br>
<br>
I think Maiden's would be a good place to go if you're LFG.  I was with guildies but we had a rogue with us that was pickup.<br>

I have had my lvl 41 shadowknight on the moon for several days now, just exploring and checking out the quests.  Other than getting into a small group on my first night of exploration, I've just been having a look around.  Made it as far as Tenebrous Mountains before heading back to Shadow Haven to port home.  <br>
<br>
The zones do seem really underpopulated now, but I attribute that to the lack of spoiler info, the increased requirements, and the fact that a lot of people decided to make newbie Vah Shir.  In a few weeks, there will probably be more grouping opportunities.   I like running around checking out new zones, but a lot of players prefer the comfort and safety of playing in zones where they know all the mobs' levels, know what phat lewtz drop, and have a map of every square inch.<br>

You seem to need a key and there is a 60 golem and his 5, 50+ friends all KOS in the room where the door is.  Btw, aggro is insane in the Plains.  Might be twice that of raptors in TD and the MOBs are like those in SG, hp heavy. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulannellavelglarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lannella Velglarn</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/hottopic.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Safehouse & Amway Rep.</span><br>  Posts: 465<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/17/01 3:00:26 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.strike9.com/eq/Lannella/fullsize/headshot3.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Maiden's Eye</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> Beware the zone-in from Dawn Peak.

Very true - when I went in there the other night (LFG), I was greeted by a couple of faces.  Fortunately, whenever I'm zoning into a &quot;blue or better&quot; zone, I usually have one finger on Hide as I come in. <p><A

Why?? I couldn't figure it out.<br>
<br>
I couldn't get in a group so I walked up to the tarmoks, tried to snare it.. resisted.. np, I can root i think to myself.<br>
<br>
WRONG!<br>
<br>
resisted, lots of red as it is beating the living hell out of me, cast again, resist, cast again, resist (WTF!?) I'm getting low on life from getting doubled consistently for 107 so I run to the echo caverns zone. It doesn't follow. At the zone line I heal myself and consider going back. Then i get a faction hit!<br>
<br>
Tarmoks never had faction before.. ugh.. Go back there and they are dubious now. and thats when I found out they are all now light blue instead of dark blue at 54.<br>
<br>
At that point I looked up into my chat box and found that they are now immune to 'movement altering spells'<br>
<br>
Lets list what Verant did to Fungus:<br>
Screw Druids<br>
Add factions to the mobs there to make it even harder to get through or pull singlely.<br>
Nerfed Imp Form for enchanters so they are no longer indifferent in Fungus Grove.<br>
Screw Druids.<br>
Raises everything's resist, I couldnt even land a Nuke on a mob I thought about kiting through the outpost.<br>
<br>
Why does noone hunt in Luclin? Because with the introduction of Luclin, VI did something that they had never done before, make a ton of good hunting zones. They saw people actually having fun, enjoying these new zones and hunting there and pulled out the big fat ugly nerf stick and made sure that it would never happen again. you are not supposed to have fun in EQ! what were you thinking!?<br>
<br>
Dont even get me started on the grey.<br>

Goodness knows why, but I shall share.  The domesticized bugs of the Tarmoks have no faction, and are always indiff.  Thus someone with enough foresight to avoid bad faction with the Tarmoks can pull their bugs right through them.  The bugs are slightly higher lvl, thus better xp, and also drop spells.  The bugs can also be snared a fair amount of the time.  Yes the Tarmoks have some nice weapon drops.  If this is what you want stop complaining.  Some of those drops are VERY nice and should NOT be easily acquired by the soloer.  The fact that they could be when SoL was first released is an unfortunate thing that was rectified reasonably rapidly.  I am just in tears I did not get in on the common spell drops. lol <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=1772.topic&start=21&stop=22>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=1774.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showMessage?topicID=1780.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=1772.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=1772.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1772.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=1772.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm10">IRL<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm11">The Admin Vault<option value="druzzilro86846frm12">Raid Archive<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">The Void<option value="druzzilro86846frm13">Polls</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion>General Discussion</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b8<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
