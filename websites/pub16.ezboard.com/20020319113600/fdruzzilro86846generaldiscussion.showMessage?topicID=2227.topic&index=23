I did not know you were just trying to do reservations on this board.

This is primarily in rebuttal to Darklord and various other individuals who make the same blanket assumptions/accusations.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> got me where I am today, and my guild (Mythic Legion), was kind enough to award me the baubles I have in appreciation for my efforts alongside my guildmates.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> You</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> (being the people that assume lower level guilds did this for me, as in for all players in the 'Uber' guilds) did not get me to where I am today, or get me a single piece of my gear.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> have put things onto the EQ market and given away things to <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> that <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> never had the chance to get at the levels <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> will now see them.<br>
<br>
So stop assuming <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> I</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> owe <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> you</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> anything, and play the game and enjoy it.<br>
<br>
And FWIW, I love seeing new faces, getting tells from younger monks about how to pull X, Y, or Z mob, giving out droppable items, mass slaughtering in a lowbie zone so newbies can loot for free cash (since I can't buff them very well aside from Spirit of Ox or Resist Cold), or just hanging out somewhere and sending grats tells to folks who are still in zone shout/ooc mode for their DINGs. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15409">Sensei Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

How did todays lowbies help get me where I am now?  I have been playing since Beta 2, have had multiple 50+ characters and have been in ML for over 2 years.  I came over from Fennin Ro, helped with the first Naggy, Vox, Efreeti Lord, Ghoul Lord, AM, Guk King, etc., etc., etc. kills on the server.  In no way have the current &quot;lowbies&quot; helped get me where I am today.  I got there myself.  Granted, I was at one time what would be considered today a &quot;lowbie&quot;, but when release came out, I was considered uber.  My first character was the first lvl 50 bard on Fennin, Mlavagite.  You can say what you want but in no way do the current lowbies help get me anywhere.  We help them and I shall continue to.<br>

Once upon a time you couldn't raid NToV, you didn't carry the newest, shiniest toys and you thought your planes armor was the coolest stuff on the planet. <br>
<br>
Once upon a time it would have ruined your week if someone more powerful than you came along and thrashed the mob you'd planned for a month to kill. And, yes, for some guilds it seriously does take a month to plan a planes raid. That is where some of the problem lies.<br>

People such as Chastaty, Tiberious, Jedidiah, Yalamyil, Zrider, Karil and Lomack.

&quot;So you now claim you were never a Mid Level guy , dreaming about ST items, or NtoV items&quot;<br>
<br>
Sorry man, these weren't around when I was lvl 20.  Best thing going at that time was bronze armor and Bloodstained Tunics.  ST and NToV didn't come out until Velious, well after I was 20 or 30 or 40 or 50.  So that don't wash.<br>
<br>
Anything else you want to misquote or take out of context?<br>
