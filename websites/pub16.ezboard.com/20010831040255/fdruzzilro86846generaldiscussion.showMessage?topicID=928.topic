I have been retired for, well, two months now? There is not a day where that has passed where I am not reminded of the great fun I had with a great many people, most importantly the smiling faces who had always surrounded me, and the friendly competition of my constant dueling.<br>
<br>
As much as I would like to return, even if only for a day to check up on my old friends, I recognize that if I were to do so, I would be unable to break out of the addiction once again.<br>

I would like to ask you some questions though(nothing important) if you could email me at wackyman_81@yahoo.com<br>

<br>
One day, while roaming about in EC, my little cleric of about 12 levels was assaulted by a wandering mummy. I ran as fast as I could, but it seemed I would not be able to outrun this thing.<br>
<br>
Suddenly, I was spammed with battle messages. I stopped to see what was happening, and there stood Xantess, finishing off my persuer. It was so fast, I had never seen damage done like that before. I was utterly amazed.<br>
<br>
We chatted for a bit, and I asked her a few questions about her monk. I found myself not only impressed with the ability of the monk, but the attitude of the person behind it as well.<br>
<br>
That night, Kastian was born. <br>
<br>
Over the next few months, I saw Xantess here and there, usually dueling some poor fool in the EC tunnel. I recall when Kas was level 15, Xantess offered 50pp to any lowbie who could do 50 points of damage to her in a duel. I accepted this challenge, (a sort of 'student fights master' scenario i guess) and promptly was running from by nearby bind point. I think I had done about 30 points, and Xan had been easy on me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
These kinds of things happened now and then during my own journey up the level ladder. I knew I'd probably never be quite like her, no matter what level I attained. She would always offer advice when asked, and even offered to help me personally in several situations. (difficult camps, etc.) Looking back now, it is a shame I didn't take her up on those offers. I'd always enjoyed her company.<br>
<br>
When her account was hacked, I offered my services, though I knew there was little I could do to help her get back on her feet. A month later, I saw her again, better equipped than I, and as always in good spirits. It appeared she didn't need too much help. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
The last time I saw Xantess, we fought on the rooftop 'mini arena' in North Freeport. She would beat me down near death (even using some terrible dps weapons she was carrying around for fun), then bind me up again, and continue. We talked as we fought, and she told me about the Ranger BotB spectacle. I wish I had been there to see it, perhaps more than anything Ive seen in EQ. After a while, I managed to disarm her, and was instantly sorry, as she began to trounce me with her epic fists. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
In the last few months, I've often wondered what had become of her. It is good to finally know.<br>
<br>
Xantess, thank you for being a friend. I wish you the best in whatever you do. <br>

Kastian, your post was touching. I am glad to have met such a friendly and deserving young lady, I wish only that I could have done more for you.<br>
<br>
Nanaki, thank you for being a friend, through all of it. Remember my cleric's bronze gloves?<br>
<br>
Tremaile and Zerixia, my two favorite enchanters. Thank you both for being true friends, understanding, and maintaining my guise.<br>
<br>
Styrkaar and Bilebelch, so opposite yet alike. The both of you will be missed, thank you for the great times.<br>

Noryko, I am glad to have been able to assist with your epic. It is the least I could do in return for you having ran all the way out to lavastorm to resurrect my senseless rear end.<br>
<br>
If any of the guild Hoss is to read this, I would ask that this message be relayed to the guild as a whole, specifically Sirensa, Andaas, and Zelgie. I thank you for all that you had shown, given, and done for me. It truly made my EverQuest experience enlightening, enjoyable, and much deeper than anything I could have had without you. Thank you.<br>

Seclusion and the Vindication crew, who had made me welcome for so very short a time. I wish you all the best of luck and thank you for having welcomed me with open arms, I apologize that it could not last.<br>

Shindar, to whom I respect as a friend and brother, though I doubt he would view me as such now.<br>

To all who have ever participated in my newbie events, thank you. It was as fun for me to hold and conduct them as it was for you to attend.<br>
<br>
I should stop now. I could go on like this forever, so many more names, so many fond memories. EverQuest has made its mark upon me, a mark that I shall not ever forget. If I have not said your name, please do not despair - I have not forgotten you, nor shall I ever.<br>

As much as I dislike doing this, I know that I will not be able to return. The least I can do is give back a little to the community that has given me so much. I spoke with the true Xantess yesterday, she agrees with the decision. She wanted to thank all of you for everything.

At level 13, if you know your class good enough, you can defeat tons of people. At higher levels, there is a huge difference. I remeber beating Xantess in a duel once(although I lost first).  I was given some pointers and turned around the second fight to win. This was around level 40ish. <br>
