For 99% of the server population Druzzil Ro hasn't changed in the slightest.<br>
<br>
I'm in a guild that does the planes but we can't take out the boss mobs. We complete epics, but only the easier ones (monk, rogue, druid). We can do VSR but VS might give us some issues. We've got one or two 60s, a bunch of 55+ and a few dozen 50+. Basically, since Vindication went FFA the game hasn't changed at all. We continue to do our raids as scheduled. Vindi isn't lurking around the corner ready to gank mobs away from us. We've had plane raids, Chardok raids, epics, etc scheduled here for weeks and when the day comes we go about our business as usually. In fact we've gone on several raids where for whatever reason 2 guilds showed up at the same time and we have always found ways to share the spawn and help each other out.<br>
<br>
EQ will never be fully removed from various player competitive/RvR scenarios and EQ will never be removed from misunderstandings about trains, who aggro'd first, who camped longest, who had sufficient force. The game will go one. Druzzil Ro isn't any different from most other EQ servers. Most servers have 2-5 guilds that are NToV capable and increasing numbers going down the line: ToV, Velious bosses, Kunark bosses, planes, etc.<br>
<br>
The game goes on. Just keep playing.<br>

<br>
<br>
as for my statements regarding FFA, my guild is reaching the point where we have the capability of being underfoot of the ubers very soon..  <br>
<br>
and with FFA, underfoot might just become &quot;crushed&quot;.  I don't know, but it's working out better than I'd expected.<br>
<br>
and I didn't notice the original poster was only level 24..  my bad..  but, as far as I'm concerned, there's not much to the pre-50 game except socialization and fun..  the big bad mobs start to happen when you go planar, and it just gets better from there.<br>
<br>
sure, taking out a single level 40 giant or something while you're level 30 is cool, but taking out a level 60 giant while you're 50 is, in my opinion, tougher, and funner, and the loot's better.<br>
<br>
I get my kicks from +15 to this, that, and the other stat items..  see invis boots, lev-casting nose rings, headpieces that proc shrink, and leggings that proc grow..  And I don't see that kinda stuff outside of higher-end mob encounters.<br>
<br>
and what do I do when I see it drop? I award it to a guildie, write it down on my little list, and crack a smile 'cause I upgraded someone's EQuipment.<br>
<br>
and I'm babbling, so I'm going to talk about chezze, and crackers, and marma&lt;Kokuten has gone Linkdead&gt; <p><Img src="http://www.tertiary.net/Torvus/kokuten.gif"> </img>---<br>

Good post Mitten. I am sure a few of the high level guilds will remember coming to help SB in their early days of PoF break-ins. Having spent some time in SB I have to say I have always found SB to be a guild of having fun, taking it easy, and just turning up and seeing what happens hehe. Looked after by keyeluke during raids is a pleasure...congrats on ya bubbles btw, if anyone deserves them you do. I have also found 99% of all guilds on our server to be completely helpful in any way they can, and yes that does include all the guilds that get mentioned here from time to time.<br>
 The last PoF SB went on, I was lucky to be invited along for the party, once there seeing NI in the same zone, helping the guild along, as they prepared for CT was good to see, especially after reading so many negative posts on the boards regarding bad feeling amongst some.<br>
 Why have I posted what some might count as drivel above?, and from someone that most don`t know, just trying to get some views across from the silent majority, that will not get to see some of the upper level gameplay for a while yet <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .<br>

<br>
Believe me (And I think I speak on behalf of all of TV), I don't want to be involved in the FFA BS nonsense.  But believe it or not, we *are* up and coming.  Sure, we may only have a half dozen or so 59-60's, but we did have around 55 50+'s in PoH a few weeks ago.  That leads me to believe we could take Trak pretty easily.  <br>
<br>
I think everyone else agrees.<br>
<br>
Besides that, many of our members have a cohesion that I don't think a lot of other people do.  Last night a small group of us did Howling stones.  Was 2 groups and we both went opposite ways, and we had the lower level group (myself being the only tank, and 52nd level.  We had a 52nd rogue with us, a cleric, necro, shaman and mage).  We were doing VERY well with pulling multiples (5-6 at a time, mind you).<br>
<br>
Did that for a few hours until we finally got whupped by about 7-8 adds.  We could have sat there all night if we could have dropped an enchanter in the mix.<br>
<br>
I dunno, HS might be &quot;small time&quot; to you guys...  But it's places like this that people learn their tactics.  They learn how far they can push a poor necro's ghetto mez, or how long that cleric can wait to CH your poor dark elven arse.<br>
<br>
We may not be the best thing on the block, but some of you &quot;Ubers&quot; might be getting in our way shortly <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Go try those mobs you need to practice on, as it were.  Vindicator/Velk/Trak.  Other kunark dragons.  Those are stepping stones.  In all likelyhood, it will be many many months before some guilds are up to farming ToV regularly.  While it may take others only a few months to get that far...it all depends on the people in the guild, and how hard they want something...as ive stated in many of my posts.  <br>
<br>
If you want something bad enough, youll get to it and work hard.  If you keep lazy, youll get fat and slow and eventually die a premature death.  <br>

You know what should happen?  After defeating a set list of uber mobs (AoW, Tunare, various Luclin boss mobs) a screen should pop up for all members of that guild which says &quot;Congratulations you have beaten Everquest!&quot;.  A list of developers, GMs and QA(were there any?) will scroll by and at the end kick you off the server, delete your character, and uninstall EQ.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :evil --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/devil.gif ALT=":evil"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
But that won't ever happen...<br>
<br>
They sure could use a new expansion though.  SoV was completely geared towards high level encounters.  Luclin wasn't so there isn't nearly as much content for the higher level players.  Kunark has a few places the 'uber' types can visit.  The old world has NOTHING for them at this time.  I can understand WHY they went FFA, it isn't fair to the rest of the population but that is besides the point.  <br>
<br>
There simply aren't enough places for them to go, they can't spread out so they end up competing for the same slow ass spawning mobs.  <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> Every</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> player on the server would benefit if Verant added some new 50+ only zones, through a free download or new expansion.  They have the same rights in this game as everybody else(boy that sounds lame, but its true) and Verant is trying to cram too many people into the same zones.  And due to human nature, when they have to interact with each other involuntarily they tend to get nasty. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showPrevMessage?topicID=2043.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showNextMessage?topicID=2043.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2043.topic&index=13><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.emailToFriend?topicID=2043.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.threadControl?topicID=2043.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2043.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=2043.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm10">IRL<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids Reservation Board<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm11">The Admin Vault<option value="druzzilro86846frm12">Raid Archive<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">The Void<option value="druzzilro86846frm13">Polls<option value="druzzilro86846frm14">Inter-Guild Board<option value="druzzilro86846frm15">Gigglalot's Crap</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion>General Discussion</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.6.2<br>Copyright ©1999-2002 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
