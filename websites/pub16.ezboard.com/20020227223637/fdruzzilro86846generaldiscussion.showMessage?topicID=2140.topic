The EULA, by its own terms, is an agreement...that means that the software purchaser and SOE have purportedly agreed.  The validity of &quot;point and click&quot; and &quot;shrinkwrap&quot; agreements have been brought into STRONG doubt in numerous cases.  Often the courts reason that is software manufacturers wanted to demonstrate that a consumer wanted to agree they could have them execute written contracts before alklowing them to buy the product.  That is done with many industrial/commercial software.  The Point/Click agreement is in the same category as the waiver of liability agreement printed on the back of parking lot ticket spitter tickets, and often just about as valid...read NOT.<br><br>2.) Contracts like the EULA, presented to someone after the fact are known as contracts of adhesion and are frowned on by the courts.  When they are implemented they are construed strongly against the entity drafting it, here SOE, and in favor of the consumer.<br><br>3.) Any agreements are subject to varied interpretation and the EULA is no exception.  I could easily argue any number of points therein.<br><br>4.) Any contract the terms of which violate law or public policy is invalid, at least as to those violative terms.<br><br>While I have only read the first couple pages of the complaint, I promise to read more, it appears they are making some valid arguments.  If SOE can use the EULA to deal with players, why shpould someoen else not exercise their rights as well?<br><br>I promise to do a more in depth examination but also recognize that the size of MMORPGs also make them fertile sources of class action suits when people feel agrieved.<br><br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ucherickofthesilverwolfpack.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Cherick of the Silver Wolf Pack</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/globalBlack.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 277<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 9:52:09 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2140.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BlackSnow Inc sues Mythic over intellectual property...L</span><hr size=1> Can anyone post what the suit is over?

They very conveniently have a link to their camelotexchange and aoexchange websites in their press release stating to go there for more information.  Also by sheer chance, on the page that they have their press release where you go for more information, they have quick easly links to look for and buy items for DAoC and AO.<br><br>BlackSnow tries to look like a good guy by claiming that the online gaming companies are stifiling competition in the economy of their own games by making it improper to transfer items out of game and thus the game companies are monopolies in their own game.<br><br>The &quot;factual&quot; statements that they are propping their argument on, and why they are starting with Mythic specificly (if they get a good judgement they will probably try to use the judgement against other gaming companies) are:<br><br>The DAoC world is based upon storylines that Mythic did not invent and thus they have no &quot;base&quot; copywrite over their own world.  Thus without a base copywrite, the characters and items cannot be considered derivative works that Mythic has control over.<br><br>Mythic somewhere apparently has an auction policy statement that Mythic &quot;does not condone the selling of accounts, we will not discourage it.&quot; As well Mythic &quot;will not help to resolve, in any way, problems that arise from the selling/trading of accounts.&quot;  They feel that these statements constitute the establishment of a &quot;system&quot; for exchanging items and characters out of game.<br><br>So their legal battle breaks down to:<br><br>1.  Characters and any items should be considered &quot;property&quot;.<br><br>2.  The online virtual &quot;property&quot; belongs to the players and not the gaming companies because the virtual &quot;property&quot; are &quot;products of work&quot; that the player creates through hours of play.<br><br>3a.  The virtual &quot;property&quot; for Mythic specificly is not entitled to any copywrite protection because the base copywrite for the DAoC world does not belong to Mythic so any items in the world can't be considered derivative works.<br><br>3b.  If the virtual &quot;property&quot; turns out to be copywritable, the copywrite laws should not prevent the exchange of the property between two people who are licensed by Mythic to play the game.<br><br>3c.  If the virtual &quot;property&quot; is copywritable and licensing laws do allow Mythic and other game companies to regulate the exchange of the virtual &quot;property&quot; through customer licenses, the EULA click through that Mythic (and other online gaming companies) uses should be invalid and unenforceable, thus the &quot;property&quot; trades are not constrained by any license agreements or terms of service agreements.<br><br>4.  Since Mythic has an online auction policy that does not outright prohibit the trading of the virtual &quot;property&quot;, they have established a &quot;free market&quot; over out of game item/account transfers and cannot assert control who/how the virtual &quot;property&quot; is traded.<br><br>What they want to get out of the suit is:<br><br>1.  The Mythic EULA and terms of service are unenforcable and so no one should be bound by any of the terms, specificly any terms that prevents BlackSnow from making money off of the trading of the accounts and in game items.<br><br>2.  By Mythic getting their ebay postings popped and the account on ebay and the BlackSnow ebay accounts shut down that BlackSnow should get money from Mythic to replace any possible money that BlackSnow &quot;lost&quot; due to the loss of listings and inability to list more items.<br><br>3.  Even if BlackSnow looses the first two points, BlackSnbow wants the court to find Mythic's online auction policy as a deceptive and fraudulant statment that is so heinous and evil that EVEN IF Mythic is legally able to regulate the transfer if items/accounts and allowing the auctions online of items/accounts is bad for the gaming system, the courts should allow BlackSnow to continue to do so as punishment to Mythic for deceptive/fraudulant business practices.<br><br>The lawsuit that BlackSnow is bringing to trial seems to be flawed in several areas.  Their case is trying to win by playing a shell game between copywrite/trademark laws, licensing laws, property laws and deceptive/fraudulant trade practaces.  I wouldn't put it past them to try to also bring in &quot;work for hire&quot; vs &quot;employee&quot; legal status for the players to try to help establish ownership of items/characters.  I'll laugh if they also try to establish online rolplaying games to a &quot;private club&quot; and make the monthly fee &quot;membership dues&quot; to try to help their case.<br><br>The best argument that BlackSnow has is that since the Dark Age of Camelot game world is not copywritable, the items and characters have no copywrite protection.  Other game worlds that are creations of the gaming companies are not vulnerable to this particular argument.   Also as noted, that since click through EULA's have some doubt as to their legality, BlackSnow thinks that they have a good shot to get a ruling that BlackSnow can ignore it to allow the transfer of accounts (which are distinct from characters) and items. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=khuzdul>Khuzdul</A> at: 2/7/02 3:58:26 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ugrazel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grazel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 193<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 5:14:22 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2140.topic&index=7>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: BlackSnow Inc sues Mythic over intellectual property...</span><hr size=1> Blacksnow seems to have forgotten some important points.<br><br>DAoC is run on privately owned machines.
