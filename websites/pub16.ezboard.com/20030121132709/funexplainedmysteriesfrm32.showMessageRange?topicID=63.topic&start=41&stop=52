I was so hoping that someone would share my fear... My #1 fear in the world is.... bears. I love teddy bears, and I even collect knicknacks of bears, but I cannot stand live bears. <br>
<br>
Second on my list is thunderstorms. The slightest rumble of thunder and my anxiety level is THROUGH THE ROOF!!!<br>
<br>
I also go along with the fear of knives. I, too, cannot watch knife scenes on tv. I will completely flip out on whoever leaves a knife laying IN my sink.. Just this past weekend my dad thought it would be funny to take a fish-knife (for those of you who are unfamiliar with those... they are a really really long filet knife, very sharp with a heck of a point on it) and point it at my bare leg. Needless to say I screamed... jumped and started hyperventilating. My husband, the wonderful man he is, calmly stated, &quot;You should have introduced her to a bear at the same time&quot;. <br>
I have dreams of either being stabbed in the back while I'm sleeping..... or a bear breaking down the door to my house. <br>
<br>
I agree with the whole &quot;death&quot; thing... I guess if we werent afraid of them causing us deathly harm we wouldn't be afraid of them???   <p>[img]http://www.berleenrose.com/tags/halofalling.gif[/img]

They want to believe in something so badly that they sell themselves out to the first thing that offers them peace. <br>
I'm a Christian, and i have found peace in God, a peace that i haven't found anywhere else. the difference between God and those other &quot;religions&quot; and groups and stuff  is that God isn't just a slogan or something that makes people feel safe so that they can go on with their lives happily, although some people make Him out to be that way. He's more than that, and to people who aren't familiar with Christianity, this is going to sound crazy. My God is living, and i have a personal relationship with Him. He isn't just about life and death. if that were so, my faith would be pointless. Christianity is about love. I sound like a hippie. okay, you know that kind of unconditional love that your mom has for you? It's like that times a million. i encourage people who don't know God personally to do so. at least read the Bible and try and see what i'm talking about. life is way too incredible. there. i'm done ranting. ^_^ i hope i don't sound crazy...i promise that i'm not. to an extent at least...heehee.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=silverkitten>SilverKitten</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 3<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/11/02 10:19:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=45>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What scares you?</span><hr size=1> Clowns, bee's anything related to bees wasps,hornets excreta.

When I wake up from a nightmare, I really have trouble falling back to sleep and almost always end up pulling one of my stuffed animals into bed with me. And my nightmares, the ones that keep me awake like that, always feature something evil that really doesn't like me. I'm scared that I might someday actually encounter something like that and will be too weak to come out on top. It doesn't help much that I believe in ghosts and demons and whatnot, because that means that as far as I know, there's just as many real supernatural bad guys out there as there are good guys, and all I know how to do is probably not gonna help me if I run into one of them.<br>

That dream came about cuz I was watching a lot of DBZ at the time) or typical weirdness (my next-door neighbor as the maternal unit of my friend across the street, both living in a house that doesn't exist--at least not in the location depicted in my dream).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately one of the oldest dreams I remember having was a nightmare, and I've had recurring nightmares--two October 30ths in a row I had the same dream where my sister, our Dad, and I were in the middle of nowhere running from this flying gargoyle-type thing--and nightmares that had connections to other nightmares--in I think my most recent nightmare, the submarine-type place had happened before, I was about to be running from the evil entity in the dream, which in another one I actually got to the running part, and I could tell the evil was evil because of a red light on the possessed person, which in another dream that wasn't really a nightmare I was helping in an attempt to cast an evil demon out of a house on my street so we could have a party, and the only indicator of where the demon was was a tiny ball of red light. <p><font color="white"><a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/~brilroswen/">History</a> will be kind to me for I intend to <a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/user_info.php?id=53813">write</a> it. --Sir Winston Churchill</font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukiaora.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kiaora</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/26/02 11:54:33 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=51>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://fp.kiaora.plus.com/images/kia_ora.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What scares you?</span><hr size=1> wasps and spiders, heights, being driven by my mother, and spotting my youngest son balancing on the kitchen units *again*. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uhapagirly.showPublicProfile?language=EN>HapaGirly</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/30/02 10:08:03 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm32.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=63.topic&index=52>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: What scares you?</span><hr size=1> What scares me?<br>
