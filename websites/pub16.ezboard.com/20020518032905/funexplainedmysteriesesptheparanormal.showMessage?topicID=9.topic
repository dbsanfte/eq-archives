Some of the pets that I had noticed this as well. <br><br>When I was younger, I would sneak my dog into the house when no one was home. He loved to roam all over the house except for a few rooms. My bedroom was one of those rooms. He would refuse to go in there. He would just stand at the doorway and growl an bark. If I forced him inside, he would sit and wimper until I let him out. He hated that room.<br><br>Years later when I had inherited the house and my girlfriend had moved in with me she decided that we needed a cat. She brought home a young kitten and we let it live in the bedroom with us. Her first night with us she slept in the floor. By the next night she had learned to climb the covers and get into bed with us. For the next few months that we lived there that cat slept next to either my girlfriend's head or mine. She refused to be in the floor while the lights were out. She wouldn't budge until the sun came up. We thought that she was just clingy.When we moved we found out differently. After we moved into our aparment she never slept through the night with us again. She spent the first few weeks just running around and exploring the apartment in the dark. We figured out that there was something in that house that scared her that we couldn't see.<br><br>Have more. Will share later.<br><br>~~Knight~~<br><br>ps. Shadow, I have to sleep sometime. <p>Support the DAV(Disabled American Veterans). We don't desert our wounded on the battlefield.

Cats are careful animals. They are hunters and they are very cautious so I do wonder why they do that. Either they are having their senses dulled in one way and heightened in another-for ex...they learn to trust humans forgetting their innate instincts in the desire to be liked or they are confident that they can protect themselves and therefore don't mind aggravating someone who doesn't like them. The only other answer is that they are developing more human characteristics through years of being domesticated. It's wierd in a way really and interesting. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Most people would think this topic was krazy....but at UM anything goes..(almost) which is one reason it's great here. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   But most wouldn't focus on animals I don't think.
