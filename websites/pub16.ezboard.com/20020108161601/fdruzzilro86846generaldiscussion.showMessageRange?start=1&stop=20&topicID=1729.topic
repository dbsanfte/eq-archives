I would like to extend my apologies to the Druzzil-Ro community for any heated discussion that has occurred on this site due to the nature of my guilds raid that went bad.<br>
<br>
I would like to state certain facts as I know them, and I do not wish to receive any replies here.<br>
<br>
The only way for a reservation system to work is for all people to work together cooperatively.  If there is more than one system, then things will fail, as they did last evening.<br>
<br>
I have tried to gain access to IGB, and not had any luck so far.  I will pursue that goal much more vigorously now.  But I do believe that those who possess the information should share it with those of us who have no access.<br>
<br>
The facts:   a guild officer of PA discussed the raid with the leader (?) of IG and was basically told that we were out of luck as they had CT on the IGB boards.  About an hour later when I got on, I spoke with the same person and was eventually offered the opportunity to go into an already broken fear, help IG, and loot the armor drops.  But, CT, draco, and the golems would not be ours in anyway.  Now, I don't claim to be able to take CT.  But we were planning on the golems for certain.  SO, this offer was unacceptable.<br>
<br>
I do not know if IG knew of our planned raid prior to the discussion, I do know that a member of IG knew as he is a friend of mine whom I had asked to go with us.<br>
<br>
Pactus Aquilus will, in the end, survive and grow stronger.  But, I do have a few simple questions.  Was CT up any of the previous days of this week when there were patches?  If so, why wasn't he taken down then?  And, if, and I say IF, IG knew of PA's planned raid prior to the start of their raid, why did no one from IG have the courtesy to send me a tell in game?  I am on a great deal atm and easy to reach.  Could not IG have waited for PA to do most of Fear prior to their arrival to take down CT?<br>
<br>
Enough said.  No responses required or sought.  This is only food for thought.<br>

Also when a mob on the rotation schedual pops you are supposed to take them out asap so and im sure IG just wanted to get him out of the way.  I do not check the raid board as more times then not the raids do not apply to me so I have no need to check it I believe this is how most of IGs members feel.

However, both sides arent being looked at here.<br>
<br>
Our plan was to get in, and get Fear cleared very early as we were up for Cazic Thule and Tormax...it was going to be a busy night for IG...<br>
<br>
When PA confronted us w/ the ordeal, we had been in fear for awhile, and PA had nothing to send in yet... I do realize how much fun Fear can be and the armors, quest mobs, and loot is for any guild. However, both sides made a bad decision IMO. How can any have a right to the zone when two different guilds have the right of way from two different boards?...Simply said, they cannot.<br>
<br>
I dislike it very much how it ended, as I have known PA as a great guild, and i firmly stand by my guild any time and place... It was most unfortunent how the night ended, and I extend my apologie to PA and Treesmasha for my remarks on the earlier thread.<br>
<br>
I know a response was not asked for, but I felt inclined to respond. Good luck PA and Treesmasha in your future. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 113<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/8/01 9:00:51 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Apologies</span><hr size=1> I am not entirely certain why someone would post questions and then not expect a response.   <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

Every guild big or small deserves this right and should be able to post it on a board everyone uses and a board thats indeffrent to favortisim to only high level guilds.

&quot;How can any have a right to the zone when two different guilds have the right of way from two different boards?&quot;<br>
<br>
This is an easy one to answer however a hard one implement.<br>
<br>
Considering that there are more then %50 of the guilds out there and guessing higher that aren't uber enough to have access to the ig,  maybe out of courtesy those that have access to the ig could check the D-ro raids boards and see if there is some conflict. Or in the case posted here work with the lower guilds.<br>

<br>
I didn't see a dissertion on reservation systems or server etiquette.  What I did see was a softly worded rant which circumvented the admins wishes that this be moved elsewhere by starting a new thread.  The post reads as &quot;I really want to have my say&quot;... which is fair, but requesting that no one else does isn't.  And since the thread hasn't been moved/locked...<br>
<br>
&quot;Was CT up any of the previous days of this week when there were patches?&quot;<br>
If so it was not IG's turn, the guild that was up either killed him or decided to forgoe their turn and wait about a month before they get anthor shot.  Basically, according to the IGB reservation system, the guild who's turn it is for CT has one day to kill CT or the loose their turn and get to wait approx. a month before they'll get another shot (CT is a 7 day spawn).<br>
<br>
&quot;If so, why wasn't he taken down then?&quot;<br>
See above<br>
<br>
&quot;And, if, and I say IF, IG knew of PA's planned raid prior to the start of their raid, why did no one from IG have the courtesy to send me a tell in game?&quot;<br>
There is no coordination between guilds that use this board to reserve things and the IGB board.  Therein lies what you have a problem with.  This wasn't a personal thing.  You'd have gotten a better reaction if you post had focused on that problem and less on why you feel slighted.<br>
<br>
&quot;Could not IG have waited for PA to do most of Fear prior to their arrival to take down CT?&quot;<br>
As was posted prior, PAs raid started at 20:30 EST.  A tad unreasonable asking someone else to start after midnight ?  I just looked and PoF was unreserved the following day.  Most mobs in Fear respawns in under 12 hrs (8?).<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that you found the offer for PA to come along and loot armor that dropped as unacceptable.  I hope you can get the reservation system conflict resolved to your satisfaction. Best wishes.<br>

<br>
1) You have to clear the plane of fear to kill Cazic Thule. When agro'ed he calls every other mob in the zone to his aid. <br>
<br>
2) There is an 8-12 hr window for clearing the plane and nailing Cazic before respawn. <br>
<br>
3) This was IG's first attempt so we were gonna need more then 1 shot, we knew it and we planned for it by clearing the plane as FAST as we could.<br>
<br>
Now last time I checked PoF isnt booked that much, most guilds realize they can get better armor for the same amount of work in Kael. You could reschedule easily enough if you really wanted to go. <br>
<br>
IG on the other hand would have to wait 4-5 WEEKS for another Cazic. (not counting patchs which we have had a lot of lately.. but those arent under our control.)<br>
<br>
Now you'd rather we sat on our hands until oh 1-2am, before we ever got a look at cazic, and then since you'd clear slower then us we'd have gotten 1-2 shots before respawn started. But who cares.. big guilds got nothing better then have 40 people stay up till the wee hrs of the morning so we dont step on any toes. Heck we could even reclear PoF if needed and we really wanted a shot!! Right?<br>
<br>
Yeah you are right, we are selfish jerks.  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utintallevarda.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tintalle Varda</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_star.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 4<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/10/01 9:23:03 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.thegardenhelper.com/kaleid.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hrmm.. can we beat this horse anymore?</span><hr size=1> &lt;looks around&gt;<br>

Hmmm....perhaps it's just me and I don't speak uber properly.  I thought this was an attempt, albeit a bizarre one, to try and work something out between ALL players of eq so that enjoyment of the game could be a universal experience, not a thread where there was name calling.  At least there seemed to be the beginning of <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  some</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> discussion on a problem that needs a resolution.<br>
<br>
Perhaps you felt compelled for some reason to employ the not so subtle art of sarcasm here.  Do you perhaps <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>  feel</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> like a selfish jerk?<br>

Actually, they couldn't.  With 8 hour respawn times on some mobs, they need to move very quickly.  CT summons all mobs to his aid, the plane must be clear when engaging him.<br>

A guild that isn't permitted to participate in the IGB cannot be faulted in any way for failing to honor the IGB's allotted rotations.<br>
<br>
Imagine me, you, and my brother all come to an oasis in the desert.  Brother and I agree that each of us will take half the water, and you get none.  Now, we have an agreement, and it works for us, and if you try and take any water, you're just messing things up, and don't you understand the value of cooperation?<br>
<br>
There's only ONE reason for TPTB to grant a guild access to the IGB: The guild in question is capable of making enough trouble that it's better to let them in than to keep them out.<br>
<br>
My advice to any guild that is being kept out of the IGB is to go stomping on other peoples' reservations and jacking their mobs until TPTB realize you deserve to be taken seriously.<br>
<br>
When politely knocking on the door doesn't work, kick it down.  If you aren't strong enough to kick it down, you don't deserve to get inside.<br>
<br>
No right-thinking player will fault you for bollixing up the IGB schedule when you aren't allowed a place in it.  Not one.  Anyone who does is an idiot. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulozerink.showPublicProfile?language=EN>lozerink</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 78<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/10/01 5:14:29 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is simple, really</span><hr size=1> The Druzzil Ro board should still be reviewed by any guild that has an IGB rotation mob due up.
