<br>
Hey, thanks all for the nice replies to my first post.<br>
<br>
Well, i did say i had more facts on the small polish village i visit so here's another for now...<br>
<br>
The first one derives from WITCHCRAFT which was very commonplace and practiced by elderly women, and younger too. I may have already mentioned that the village is really quite old, i don't know exactly how old it is but i know for sure that its history extends far beyond 300 years. In Eastern Europe (Slovak countries) many years ago people were very superstitious and were fearful of any MYTHS they had heard of and believed them blindly, we all know that people from these countries are quite tough &amp; brave (whether it be from the aid of vodka is debateable<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) but when it came to tales of witches or any other terrible creatures, they prefered not to speak of them openly through general fear which had gripped these folk. Witches ere known as &quot;WIEDZ'NA&quot; or as in the fairytales to scare children &quot;BABA~JAGA&quot; (baba Yaga...pronunciation). Well that was a bit of filling in for you, now for the story i know....<br>
<br>
<br>
My Grandfather was born in this small village and he was the first to move away to WARSAW when he became a young man, but before him all his ancestors lived off the land in the area, which is still possible today. Tales have been passed down from generation to generation and many have been remembered. The first was told to me by friends and verified by their grandfathers: Witches would &quot;curse&quot; anybody that they believed deserved it, even if u happend to give them a glance which they considered &quot;hostile&quot;, one man was simply walking through the town when he walked past the house of a known witch in town, It's commonplace to say GOOD MORNING to whoever u come across, even if u don't know them, she greeted him, but as he knew of the rumours he refused to reply...the man then swore that he saw her looking at him with a look of evil and murmering words which he could not make out but believed them to be spells. Two days later the man died, the &quot;witch&quot; was then feared until her death many years later.<br>
<br>
Only recenlty has the last known witch died in that town (i must add she was only suspected of witchcraft) She was also said to stare at people eerily..with a smile, but very discomforting smile then murmur..she did this to a guy i know and he was sick for 3 days after.<br>
<br>
An older case comes from around the 1850's which involved another man who crossed the path of a known witch, this time his death was much more harsh than a simple stare and spell, it involved a spell involving a big pole (pole...big pole not polish person :O) which was impaled in the centre of his field...this was a sign that bad thigns would happen to him or his family, within a week he was involved in an accident whilst cutting trees...he lost an entire arm and part of his leg, he died from blood loss due to the inadequate medical treatment in those days in such a rural area. <br>
<br>
Of course, the witch was blamed for the mans death, and not long after her body was found in the forest impaled by a pitchfork and with crucifixes marked on her eye lids and throat.<br>
<br>
These are the known cases of witches in the town, but each individual has their own story to tell, whether it be for fun or facat based. Friends of mine have told me seeing witches when they were children playing in the fields, and they were always spotted near or on a pear tree (why? i don't really know why, if anyone could tell me of the association then i would be grateful) My Friends have even sworn that they saw them FLY (now this i find funny and untrue) i do believe they may have seen these things..but flying    <br>
<br>
In the past withcraft was feared for its curses but witches were also accepted almost like nature itself, wind, water and witches were all seen as a thing of nature, but then people began swaying more towards catholicism and the church was quick in acting to portray witches as followers of the devil and evil..since then witches in Poland have died away (almost).<br>
<br>
SWOOSH!! sorry, that was a bit long<br>

<br>
I have a good friend who was born in Greece, she has a neighbor (also from Greece), who she says gives members of their family the &quot;evil eye&quot; on occasion.  My friend is quite convinced that this woman causes illnesses and misfortunes to befall them when she does this, and says that there were people &quot;back home&quot;, who could do this also.  Would this woman be a witch, or just a nut?  I don't know, but my friend and her family sure believe, and that seems to be enough.<br>
<br>
Interesting post, bye for now,<br>
