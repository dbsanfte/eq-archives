Discuss</span><hr size=1> &quot;I think posting intentions is just a polite thing to do.&quot;<br>
<br>
How is it polite?  Are you doing ME a favor somehow by posting your intentions?<br>
<br>
Maybe.  If you're posting to let me know that, should I show up Wednesday night, I'll find the reavers camped, then thanks.  That's polite.<br>
<br>
If, however, you're posting to let me know that should I be working reavers on wednesday night, you'll be showing up expecting me to yield the site to you, then that's not polite at all.  That's just dressing a reservation up in a funny hat and pretending it's something else.<br>
<br>
It's certainly true that 2 high-end toons can kill reavers but it can take a few groups at lower levels.<br>
<br>
But you don't see anyone posting reservations for the ghoul lord, and it'd probably take more than one group of 40s to do him.<br>
<br>
So if we're arguing that any mob that takes multiple groups of characters of SOME level should be reserved, that pretty much opens it up for everything on down to level-5 mobs in newbie zones.<br>
<br>
The problem this leads to is demonstrated by Marics post.  &quot;The strength of reservations is only as strong as those that honor them.&quot;  The idea being that if I'm at, say, VL ledge with an XP crew, and some twits who &quot;reserved&quot; the ledge on the board roll up on me and tell me to beat it, _I_ am somehow the bad guy.<br>
<br>
Essentially, this is an attempt, intentional or not, to kill the system with kindness.  The system works only as long as most folks respect the reservations.  So if you use it to reserve stupid shit that nobody's gonna take seriously, people like Maric are soon running around saying that &quot;XXX didn't respect my reservation of the left-side KC zone-in, so why should I respect PA's reservation of Hateplane?&quot;  And then the system starts to fall apart.<br>
<br>
There's an obvious consensus that Hateplane is suitable for reservations and that D'vinn is not.  Where's the line?<br>
<br>
I think the line is somewhere ABOVE CoM reavers.  Wanna take a poll and find out?  Not a poll poll, but a voting thread where people sign their bloody names and you can't spam up a bogus vote tally.  I bet the votes will run pretty heavily against lumping CoM reavers in with Hate.<br>
<br>
And if I'm wrong and there's a genuine consensus that Reavers are a reservation-worthy camp, I'll happily honor any CoM reservation.<br>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Well here's your vote thread right here Aana.<br>
<br>
As for what I think, I'm not sure.  It's not like you need a guild effort just to zone into CoM like you do with Hate.  They respawn fast so you wouldn't have to wait 8 hours after somebody else cleared em.  But they are important for the growth of low level guilds, and they are heavily camped.<br>
<br>
I am frustrated by my inability to find them uncamped, and that leads me to want to reserve them.  However I have to recognize that The Ghoul Lord in LGuk is just as heavily camped (or more so), and yet nobody has suggested reserving him.<br>
<br>
As I ramble along, I find myself thinking that though I might wish to reserve the suckers for my own personal needs, it would be inappropriate to do so.<br>
<br>
If I expect you to respect my Reaver reservation, I'm going to have to respect your VL ledge reservation.  I just can't see any way around that.  Since I would really rather not have arguments over who stomped who's reservation of the VL ledge, I am forced to vote &quot;nay&quot; on the reavers as well.<br>
<br>
So for now, I'll be sure not to bother heading to CoM when I've noticed someone's posted &quot;intentions&quot; to be there - that would be a waste of my time.  But if I hadn't noticed the reservation and I had arrived at the camp first, I would be put-out if they were to ask me to leave.<br>
<br>
As with Aanadien, if a reasonable majority does want to start reserving the Reavers, I will absolutely go along with it.<br>

I was stating that it was polite to let others know we would be there.  For the record, I don't agree with reserving them either.  I don't think anyone should have to get up and leave their camp just because we waltzed in right on schedule.  However, Pinelda hasn't posted a lot of raids here, and probably does not know that guilds normally do not post reservations for mobs that pop up once per hour.  Nonetheless, it was thoughtful of Pinelda to post intentions.  Why not cut her some slack? <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ualihjazanzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alihja Zanzibar</A> at: 2/17/02 11:05:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utinydru.showPublicProfile?language=EN>TinyDru</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/17/02 10:59:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm8.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=1089.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Reserving CoM Reavers?  Discuss</span><hr size=1> The one significant difference between reserving something like CoM for the purpose of killing Reavers and reserving something like the Ledge for XP is that the Reaver drops a component for the Druid Epic.  Druids can only get this component (Jade Reaver) from one mob in one location - the Reavers in CoM.  XP can be gotten in many places - no need to reserve them.<br>
<br>
And, for some reason that I can't quite articulate at the moment, saying that they are camping the ledge to acquire some loot dropped from a mob at the ledge does not equate to camping a mob for the component for one of the Epic quests.<br>
<br>
On the subject of reserving vs. stating intentions.  I was, actually, under the assumption that I was reserving CoM for at least a few hours that evening.  Being new to this board, I may have misunderstood how things work - I apologize if I did.  The first time I came here I saw CoM in the reservation summary, so I assumed it could be reserved.  I don't really care whether we call it an intention or a reservation - assuming a server of polite people, either should have the same result - CoM will be available at the time you reserved/intended it because either people are respecting your reservation or they are being polite and deciding to go elsewhere because a fellow EQer really needs to mob X.<br>

There is quite a difference between an established xp camp and an area you goto for specific drops, such as epic drops.  Aanadien, dont try to extrapolate my own notions which I really dont think you understand.  What is easy for you, is not so easy for someone else.  I'm fairly certain that nobody has or will post a reservation for right courtyard in KC.  People have posted for Juggs though.  Why respect that reservation if you wont respect the others that you might find ridiculous, but what some people might find legitimate.  If a small guild reserved something and has never ever wronged you in any way...why would you want to step on their reservation just because your own opinions dictate it as a ridiculous reservation.  There are a million &quot;what if&quot; situations that are so far out, but still some people want to rule out reserving something because someone might reserve an xp camp.

Discuss</span><hr size=1> We're approaching this question from totally different angles, Maric.<br>
<br>
You refuse to acknowledge that there's even a question as to which reservations the DRo board should cover--if people post it, that's valid, the system can be expanded to cover literally ANYTHING people want to reserve, and so it's simply a matter of who respects the system (and therefore must commit to respecting any reservation anyone posts) and who doesn't (and therefore deserves to have none of their reservations respected.)<br>
<br>
If you start from the assumption that any posted reservation is valid, then your position makes sense.<br>
<br>
But why do that?<br>
<br>
The whole question in this thread is SHOULD CoM be reservable?  You make a convincing case that IF the answer is yes, everyone should honor the reservation.  What if the answer is no?<br>
<br>
I think the answer should definitely be &quot;No.&quot;  I think everyone should carefully honor any valid reservation, and we should very very carefully limit the things that can be reserved.<br>
<br>
The alternative is to hold DRo board guilds to an unreasonably high standard, one they won't even WANT to live up to because it stands in direct conflict with years of EQ tradition, and they'll eventually just bail on it. <p>----------------------------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89094>Jumpp Jivenwail</a>, 60 Rogue<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97652>Aanadien Jones</a>, 60 Enchanter<BR>

It's all about perspective and putting yourself in someone elses shoes.  To some people, CoM is trivial and you can go in with little or no preparation.  On the other hand, there are those who just dont have the ability to do that.   <p><br><img src="http://www.mindspring.com/~jazzy/maric_sig.gif" border="0">

What people considered reservable a year ago is now considered unreservable because those same people can annihilate it.  They do not care about those under them that are at the point they were at a year ago.  Those people are irrelevant.  That is the feeling I am beginning to get.  That feeling makes it less and less enticing to reserve or honour reservations.  <br>
<br>
Just because you can kill a MOB with 1 or 2 of your friends does not mean everyone can.  Everyone should have the opportunities you did when you levelled up through various zones.  I am seeing a lack of interest by many people to allow this to happen.  <br>
<br>
Vindication did not leave, they just spread their disease of selfishness and inconsideration. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Kaludram, you are missing the point a bit.<br>
<br>
It has nothing to do with being inconsiderate, or selfish.<br>
<br>
Let's just say a group of IG decides that we want to kill reavers cause someone, I dunno who, needs their epic.  We get to CoM.  No one is there.  So we go and kill some reavers.  Whee.  If someone is there and says 'we are killing the reavers' I cannot see us caring one way or the other, and we will head to Sebilis or something to kill the King or Emperor or whatnot.  But what we won't do, just because it doesn't occur to us, really, is to check a reservation for CoM.  And if someone shows up 10 minutes after we clear them, well, just wait a little bit, won't be long.<br>
<br>
This is different from, well, Hate or Fear.  We do look for reservations there, or see if someone is there, because it is a lot bigger deal to everyone than CoM.  8 hours makes a huge difference.  Needing a raid sized force makes a big difference.<br>
<br>
In the thread on the other board you listed IG as scum balls (or something of the sort) apparently merely for showing UP in Kedge.  Once they found out that someone, anyone, was killing Phinny, they left (I wasn't there).  You try to make the point that they left merely because they knew ML was there.  You don't seem to ponder the thought that they didn't look here for a Kedge raid reservation, because why reserve Kedge?  (again, from our perspective).  But they didn't muscle in, they didn't steal Phinny, they didn't, from what you say, berate you or belittle you.  They found someone killing Phinny and left.  Case closed.  Any attempt to make it something sinister really doesn't fly.  All checking for reservations would have done is save themselves the trip, in reality.<br>
<br>
This would be different if you were there, setting up to crush the joint, killing front spawns, etc, and guild X decides to swim past you and bag Phinny, even after you tell them that you are there.  First Come, First Serve is what you were doing.  You were there, you were getting ready to kill.  Free For All is rushing past people who are obviously about to do..whatever...and taking it out from under them.  Even Vindication, in their NToV grabbing (best term I can think of for it), didn't stoop to that level.<br>
<br>
I think you will find that THAT is a relative rarity on the server.  Which is a good thing. <br>
<br>
I also think that more good things happen between guilds, even Uber guild to Uber guild..and Uber guild to NON-Uber guild, than bad.  Way more.  But most of those are small niceties that just never make press.<br>
<br>
But screaming and yelling does.<br>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Gryfalia - I understand your point (as I also understand many of the other well-made points here as well).  You bring up the root of my issue though - time.  It IS a big deal to me if someone has just whacked all of the Reavers due to the fact that I have a pretty limited window in which I can play EQ.  Waiting for the respawn (by the way - has anyone confirmed whether this is a 1 hour or a 2 hour spawn?) just makes that window of opportunity all the smaller for me and others like me.  Again - it takes time to gather the people to do something like this - and then making them wait on top of it - you start to lose folks after a while, some have to log, etc.<br>
<br>
With all of that being said - I must also consider that this might be just the way EQ works (and I am not trying to be sarcastic or nasty in any way here) - those with more time will be able to get more done and those with less time will just have to make due.  I can't very well ask another EQ player to forgo something that he/she wants to do just because my time on EQ is limited.<br>
<br>
Hmmm - now I've confused myself (which really isn't that difficult in the first place... <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ).  On the one hand, I feel that a place like CoM SHOULD be able to be reserved / intentioned due to the fact that it has a fairly rare mob drop required for one of the Epic quests AND that it, for many people, requires a small raid sized group to get it done.  On the other hand, if the timer on the Reavers is indeed only an hour, perhaps that would be short enough to still gather the raid force, but to simply have them take their time getting to the castle (kill more stuff on the way).  This would probably work ok, but if the respawn is two hours, this would get a lot closer to being unworkable.<br>
<br>
In the end, I am still for being able to reserve CoM due to the reasons I mentioned above.  I understand that this does not mean that CoM is MINE MINE ALL MINE for the day - I think that placing an arrival time and a specific mob target helps with this.  I also understand that by placing a reservation on the board that the time slot is not guarunteed due to the fact that there are many people who do not look at this board.  What I AM hoping for is that the large number of people / guilds who DO read this board will respect that time slot and shoot for something else (the same as they are hopefully doing for Hate, Kael, etc.).  Kind of like pushing the time slot odds in the &quot;right&quot; direction.<br>
<br>
It appears to me that CoM (as well as Kedge and some others) have been on the reservation schedule for some time now (although I have not been browsing this board for a very long time, so I may be wrong).  It also appears to me that there is not a big explosion of guilds / people wanting to reserve previously unreserved things.  My guess is that there will remain a fairly static list of areas to be reserved with minor updates and changes as time goes by - it shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.  I don't think that leaving spots like Kedge and CoM on the list will open the flood gates to reserving everything in EQ.<br>
<br>
Whether we consider something reserved or simply a statement of intent, I would like to think that, given enough lead time on the posting, the people / guilds who participate on this board would be curtious enough to respect that posting.<br>

IG did nothing wrong imo, and I apologize for my words.  <br>
<br>
All I want is a list.  A list not only high lvl guilds agree on, but the mid level ones.  <br>
<br>
I now see at least 3 mid-level guilds disagree with people in high level guilds saying CoM reavers cannot be reserved.  Does this not seem a bit odd?  Were CoM Reavers ever reservable? If so then they should continue to be so, as any MOB should be.  If people had the opportunity to reserve them before then other people, at the point now that the original people were at a year ago, should have the same opportunities.  Of course this is my opinion only, but I would truly LOVE a damn list so I do not waste my time in the future. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>

Discuss</span><hr size=1> Sure, it takes multiple groups of low-40s to do reavers.<br>
<br>
That's not the point.<br>
<br>
It's a damn shame when a bunch of level-45s plan a CoM raid for weeks and then show up to find four level-56 guys working the reavers.<br>
<br>
But the reservation system can't fix that even if we want it to.<br>
<br>
There's no tradition of reserving CoM.  And the fact that it's so easy for a small handful of mid-50s to kill the reavers makes it impractical to apply a guild-level reservation system.<br>
<br>
As nice as it'd be for the poor lowbies, it's just unreasonable to expect every little xp crew to be aware of your reservations and to stay the hell out of your way.  Guilds can pull this off because they can designate a &quot;reservations guy&quot; to monitor the board, post their reservations, and keep informed about others.<br>
<br>
This is generally beyond the ability of small ad hoc xp crews, and a system that makes such an unreasonable demand of people will be laughed into oblivion in practice.<br>
<br>
Short version: I'm not saying it wouldn't be NICE for the reservation system to work for lowbies in CoM.  I'm saying it's IMPRACTICAL and as nice as it'd be, it won't work, and trying it will damage the system's credibility. <p>----------------------------------------<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=89094>Jumpp Jivenwail</a>, 60 Rogue<BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=97652>Aanadien Jones</a>, 60 Enchanter<BR>
