However, Roh still needs a hankey.  If you think we released the Sleeper so we could &quot;screw&quot; the server, then you need to go play your little politics game somewhere else.<br>
<br>
   What do you think, that everyone in Hoss has primal?  Every one of our warriors has a SoD?  Think gnome masks rotted for us because all our bards/rogues have 1 already?  Think again.  Removing the sod/mask etc from the game affects us just as much as anyone else.  So no, we didn't do it to screw the server over.  Btw Primal STILL DROPS so stop saying that the rest of the server now has been robbed of their chance to get one.  Oh no you might have to work a bit harder now.  I don't remember reading in the licensing agreement that all you had to do was get a key, and go to ST once and be guaranteed to walk away with a primal.<br>
<br>
   We released the Sleeper because of the challenge of it.  Do you have any idea how hard Ventani is/was to kill?  No dragon in Ntov can compare to him in difficulty.  Vyemm?  Nope sorry we killed him easily on our second try ever.  Think we've only lost to him twice.  Zlexak?  He's a bugger, but not even close.  Vulak?  LOL.<br>
<br>
   Killing Ventani took us two days, and countless failed attempts.  Strategies were made, discarded, revised and re-revised until we got it right.  Until we fuond the way to kill that Dragon with only 32 people.  Now that's one hell of an accomplishment.  If we left a Warder up, then we could have farmed Ventani and the challenge would be gone.  He'd die withot a fuss anymore, same as all other dragons do.  Instead we got the one kill that mattered the most, and the rush of watching Kerafym appear is beyond description.  That's why we killed him.  Never once did we do it because we wanted to make getting primal harder for everyone else.  A good chunk of the 32 people that killed him still wanted items from ST.<br>
<br>
   To say that it was a &quot;sad day for Druzzil Ro?&quot;  Please, don't be so melodramatic.  Do you REALLY think that Vindi or ML would have never, ever released the sleeper?  Or L'malla or Guild X?  Think again.<br>
<br>
   Btw, primal is overrated.  If you think you can't handle a certain mob or zone in the game just because your guild isn't decked out in primal, uhhh.. you really shouldn't be there in the first place. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utilea.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tilea</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 61<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 2:51:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=103>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> oops forgot some stuff <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
   Elidroth's post said it all, in regards to yesterday in Ntov.  Both Hoss and ML wanted to kill the Dragons there.  So we both showed up, coh'd our people in and started killing stuff.  Nothing that happened was in any sort of violation of pnp or pvp or pvg or pwg or any other acronym you choose to come up with.  Unfortunatley for ML they didn't have a very easy time and we killed the majority of the Dragons.  But nobody was immature about it.  We never even saw eachother the whole time.  Just because a server is FFA doesn't mean people have to hate eachother.<br>
<br>
   Personally, I'd rather not ever have to worry about starting a ntov raid at 11am when I'm supposed to be in class instead again, though <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=trillo>Trillo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 21<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 3:00:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=104>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> &quot;We released the Sleeper because of the challenge of it.

<br>
This doesn't make much sense to me.  Leaving another warder up doesn't make killing Ventani any easier.  It would have been the *exact* same challenge only the Sleeper would not have been released.  There was no challenge in the actual freeing of the Sleeper.  The only challenge was killing Ventani.<br>
<br>
&quot;If we left a Warder up, then we could have farmed Ventani and the challenge would be gone. He'd die withot a fuss anymore, same as all other dragons do.&quot;<br>
<br>
??  So why do you keep killing King Tormax?  Statue?  Vulak?  You make it sound like it is no longer any fun to kill these mobs because the challenge is gone.  Why do you still play if &quot;they die without a fuss&quot;?  Why didn't you farm Ventani just like you farm these other mobs? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/upaperr.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Paperr</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/happy/wave.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 17<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 3:00:45 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=105>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Torrin</span><hr size=1> Tilea,<br>

Simply put yes we do, you could have left another warder up and accomplished the same thing and there was no reason to start the script.  That was always the contention. <p><p><p align="center">

I am in favor of a rotation similar to the one used previously.  If we are going to start why not start with the one location that has multiple spawn points so that we can atleast get that undercontrol?  Atleast start with that until the details for the rest can be worked out.  If it weren't for patches, the spawns could stretch out over a week apart.

A primal sword is just pixels.  So is a SoD.<br>
<br>
   Paperr, that's a great story.  How would it possibly change now?  Your friend Guntar would get his key.  Then he'd use the key to zone into ST (yeah the zone's still there, in the same spot and everything).  Then he'd kill stuff.  Then maybe he'd get a primal!  YES, primal STILL drops!<br>
<br>
   Story ends the same.  Maybe now he just doesn't get it on his first try.  Are you supposed to walk away with primal weapons falling out of your overloaded backpack, every single time you go to ST?  Newp.<br>
<br>
   Thing is, I understand your reasons for not wanting to awaken the Sleeper.  You however, do not understand our reasons for doing it.  So, in an attempt to make us look bad, you just jump to the most negative conclusion you possibly can, and then spread it around as much as you can, shouting about how Hoss screwed the server.  All because you don't understand our reasons?<br>

The warders aren't there, that's a pretty substantial difference.  Personally, the coolest thing about ST to me was the Warders guarding Kerafym.  The opening hall with the MoTG and the Progenator's room are neat to see, but imo they don't compare to the Sleeper's area.  Now, there is very little reason to go down that far.<br>
<br>
Honestly, did you not expect to take heat over waking him?  Whether your reasons were valid or not, you did screw over the server.  There is no arguing that point, and people have every right to be angry.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd rather see the issue die.  There is absolutely nothing that can be done now, due to VI's joke of a dynamic script.<br>

HOSS was smart =/. Ventani wasn't reduced to primal farm like all the other dragons in that zone. It wasn't reduced to a routine of hand me the phatty big deal we killed this mob for the 100th time.It was a one time kill that nobody can take away from them. And nobody else will ever have the chance to reach that pinnacle. It was a kill that meant something. The kill had a purpose. For once in EQ, killing something big actually was great for something besides phat lewtz.In a world where every huge mob you kill  IS ABOUT EXACTLY THAT (PHATTY)  I can see why waking the sleeper is a huge deal. I don't see people mad that the loot is gone, I see jealousy it wasn't they who worked on the strat and killed Ventani with 32 people. Genius. /bow HOSS, reluctant respectful gratz. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=zoulle>zoulle</A> at: 2/7/02 4:57:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ugrazel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Grazel</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 194<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 5:36:28 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=114>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, back to the rotation discussion we go......</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Nope, sorry.

Wow, this person needs therapy.  <br>
<br>
It appears that part of what made the kill exciting for them was that noone would be allowed to repeat it.  There also seems to be a compulsion to repeat kills even if it cheapens their own experiences. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uarciuskarn.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Arcius Karn</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 28<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/7/02 6:10:38 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=115>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Ok, back to the rotation discussion we go......</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> It appears that part of what made the kill exciting for them was that noone would be allowed to repeat it. <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>

Killing a mob again and again is not as fun as killing it once and having it actually die.You kill stuff, stuff respawns, you kill again. That WAS exciting, and it wouldn't have been (for many of us) if we had just farmed the hell out of him...it would just be another mob to get loot off. I wouldn't want to kill Ventani more than once or see the Sleeper released again...it wouldn't be the same.<br>
<br>
I understand why you are angry and why you didn't release the Sleeper, is it so unreasonable that you cannot understand why we would do it? IT WAS FUN, period. This is a game, you play to have fun. I'm truly sorry if your fun was ruined, but you'll get over it...or perhaps you're the one who needs therapy. <p><div align="center"><b><strong><font size="-1"><FONT COLOR="Red"> Arcius Karn</font></strong>

Someone repeating something you've accomplished doesn't lessen your own accomplishment. Feeling that it does is disturbed. Letting those feelings push you into destructive acts very bad. <p>Grazel Nukite, Grandmaster<br>

<br>
Nah, that isn't what Hoss is about, Zoulle.  They play to have fun.  Think they have less fun because Vindication killed Tunare first?  I doubt it.<br>
<br>
I believe them when they say that they killed him for the rush.  That seems selfish to me because it did take away from other's future enjoyment in THIS zone.  This is VI's fault though.  Stupid idea to have an encounter that can only happen once when EVERYTHING else in the game respawns.  <br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why people like Tilea continue to play Everquest.  Vyemm is now boring to kill.  Vulak is about as fun as chasing down orc pawns in EC because he is so easy and the challenge is gone.  If it is just to hang out with friends, you should be happy sitting around in SS talking because Vulak is now boring and as you have told us many times, you don't want loot.  You turn it down more times than you take it.  <br>
<br>
Now that the Sleeper is gone and everything else drops without much of a fight, why do you keep logging on and farming these mobs that are so boring to fight?  Why not let someone who would actually have FUN killing these mobs ( or at least trying ) have a chance?<br>
<br>

<br>
-If you preach against the bashing of guilds which many officers stated in many statements that they are against it.  Why do you continue to bring up the ST issue.  The issue wasn't mentioned once in this thread until Rohaise brought it up.  Verant took the rubicite BP out of the game.  They are just as bad as us in example.  Not called a disgrace or selfish.<br>
<br>
*Plain and simple if you are going to be against bashing and bringing up past issues, please do not keep bringing up the ST incident.  It wont help things, if you wish for people to cooperate don't mock them while asking.  Its like Hi jerk, can u help me with my homework?  What hes going to say?<br>
<br>
-As far as my commenting on how I feel a possible solution to the stalemate of recreating the IGB, you guys view me as a psycho locking out all guilds but L`Malla, Mythic Legion, and Hoss.  That is not true.  I was simply saying when people refuse to budge on touchy issues you will get nowhere.  There has to be a compromise.  My hypothetical solution would be to allow requirements to get to be on rotation.  You can always meet them and hey that will allow any guild the opportunity should they prove themselves.  To me, that is fair and not blocking anyone out.  Is it?  Just like I said with NFL playoffs, I know its a bit different, but if you don't meet the qualifications you do not advance on.  Next year in football you are given the chance to do it again.  In EQ terms that is next rotation or qualification.  A system like that can progressively add guilds to more rotations as they are proven ready for such a rotation.  That seems logical and fair and I don't think my example was fair off.  Go ahead and take it literally if you choose, your just varying from the point because you have nothing better to do.<br>
<br>
I'd seriously like to see things based on upon what I am trying to get out, not some standard procedure response for all posts regarding this.<br>
