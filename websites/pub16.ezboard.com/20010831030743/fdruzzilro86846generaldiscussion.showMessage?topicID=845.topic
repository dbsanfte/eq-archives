IF I live in a house and don't keep my doors locked, does that mean that someone has the right to come in and steal my stereo and TV? Is it even right for them to do so if I had called them names or something? If I do lock my door, is it right for them to return with a crowbar to pry the door open? If I then install an alarm system, would it then be right for them to return and cut my power?<br>
<br>
Well, as obvious as the answers are it's analogous to what happenned the way I read it. Let's also put this another way.. Do you think the police or community would get as fired up now as they would have 50 years ago if someone stole a stereo and TV from a house that didn't lock their doors?<br>
<br>
Well, anyways maybe that's the state of thing, but I don't agree with what Chips seems to say.. His point seems to be that an unlocked door or an unsecured or undersecured web site is an invitation for theft or abuse. I disagree, and I think more correctly the invitation is issued by the perpetrator and not the victim. Only the perpetrator can try to say that the victim issued the invitation by not being adequately prepared, maybe it's some kind of trying to clear their own conscience thing.. Faulty logic seems like logic to the one that thunk it. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ueqchip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQchip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 68<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/13/01 9:29:34 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> close, but no cigar</span><hr size=1> Guys, I'm an observer of human behavior.

To go off on the tangent from the original topic..<br>
<br>
The examples you list though are images put forth from the media, and while they are true, to say that they personify America is to say that these are common occurances reflecting popular opinion.<br>
<br>
But to tie the tangent back to the original topic: <br>
<br>
The hacking incidents involved maliscious intent.. I know your tangent wasn't meant to justify the issue at hand, but maliscious intent distinguishes the hackers actions from all the instances listed: The hackers set out to deliberately cause harm.. None of the mentioned litigants (presumably) set out to create their situations for the purpose of suing the named parties.<br>
<br>
And back singly to the tangent:<br>
<br>
The examples are all absurd and I'm sure that most Americans would agree on that. On the other hand, though, one thing that your examples do point out that characterizes America is the fact that one has the FREEDOM to pursue such things as suing McDonalds because you spilled hot coffee on your lap. The fact that in a court of law your case can be heard impartially and decided on the facts is easily taken for granted. Gone are the days where a law could be passed so that someone could be prosecuted for past actions which were perfectly legal before the existance of the law, where the accused has no chance against the system.....<br>
<br>
Okay, enough about freedom and stuff.. I know that's an oversimplification and idealization.. but there's another point.. So-called frivolous litigation does serve a purpose of keeping corporate entities in check.. It's easy to portray lawsuits as frivilous like someone at McDonalds suing because they spilled coffee on themselves. But should coffee cause second (or was it even third?) degree burns when supposedly it's served and intended to go down your throat? And if there did not exist anything to enforce responsibility on corporate entities, wouldn't we still be driving cars with steel dashboards that could crack a skull without leaving a dent? Would we even have seatbelts? What incentive would corporate America have for making cars where you can walk away from a crash rather than having skulls fractured then your corpse thrown from the vehicle and smashed under the weight of the car?<br>
<br>
Wow.. okay, guess that covers that..<br>
<br>
I think the analogy is more-or-less valid, and actually I've never like the phrase comparing apples to oranges.. Analogies don't have to be exact same item compared to exact same items.. Apples and oranges are different fruits, have different tastes and different consistencies.. But they are not totally dissimilar either.. Both are generally round, produce juices, grow on trees and edible.. Hence some analogies work when the relevant properties are similar.. And I think an anology between home security and web site security to robbers and hackers respectively is perfectly valid.. <br>
<br>
At any rate, I'm sure that the analogy makes my point.. Whether it seems more extreme, that is subjective.. But not really in my opinion.. <br>
<br>
Actually, if we're broadening the topic on internet security, I find it interesting from the comparison of the analogy I made.. Idealized perhaps, but think of the 50's when lots of people never felt the need to lock their doors.. We've grown since then, more suspicious and with less reason to trust our neighbor, withdrawn more into our own little worlds.. Perhaps only venturing out in anonimity...<br>
<br>
Then along comes the internet, once again information can be exchanged freely, but as time goes on the trust is exploited by the few and the trust is eroded, people have to use security measures, companies have to use firewalls and determine places where users will not be able to access.. Could it grow to a point where we again can only surf to trusted locations, afraid to be violated? <br>
<br>
Well, that's too bad.. Human beings are social beings and the need and desire to have community is inherent to our species.. All I know is that my choice is try to be a part of society.. Helll, it just ends up as rambling, but I'll leave at that till the next EQChip commentary.. Maybe you can make more sense out of what I said than I can right now.. hehe <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ueqchip.showPublicProfile?language=EN>EQchip</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 73<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/13/01 4:08:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.animfactory.com/animations/creatures/devils/devil_pointing_right_md_wht.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This might intrest some</span><hr size=1> I think I just found a new friend.
