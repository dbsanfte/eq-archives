<br>
<br>
&quot;Cirrean, Daughter of Cazic&quot;<br>
<br>
Prelude<br>
<br>
The young courier gasped as cold steel passed through his heart, never to take another breath.  With a sneer, Cirrean Shadakine dug her boot into his unmoving chest and withdrew her blade.  Flipping aside her victim's tattered cloak revealed the crest of the Temple of Life on the messenger's dusty shirt.  With a wicked glint in her eye, the assassin wiped her sword across the cloth, staining the insignia with fresh blood.<br>
<br>
Cirrean took a moment to survey her latest masterpiece, but was recalled to reality by a cackle and the sound of scraping bones.  Her undead servant Jabann had sprung to action, fending off the annoying fellow who was attempting, in vain, to rescue the messenger.  Skeletal fingers grasping at his throat, Brother Estle repeatedly tried and failed to utter the words of power which would bring down a blast from the heavens upon the vile shadow knight before him.  Rather than kill the journeyman priest outright, Cirrean decided to have a bit of sport with him first.  Her dark face was lit with a ghastly blue-green light as her tongue twisted a whispered spell.  Moments later, the man was screaming in utter terror, losing control of his own legs and staggering along the path towards Qeynos.  Cirrean snapped a command, and her summoned companion ended his pursuit.  Squinting in the half-light, the young woman unslung her longbow and put an arrow to the string.  Brother Estle was a mere shadow against the deeper darkness of another Norrathian twilight, but as his momentary fear subsided and he turned, he was greeted by an arrowhead.  Pleased with herself, Cirrean motioned for Jabann to satisfy his festering hatred for the servants of good.  As the skeleton howled with glee, strangling the life from this man, Cirrean leaned against a rock, shouldering her bow and thinking back to the turn of events that had brought her to be here.<br>
<br>
<br>
Of Friends Found in Shadow...<br>
<br>
Her first visit to Qeynos had almost been her last, but it was funny, how times could change and enemies could become friends when it was required. Cirrean's mother had been cast out of Erudin with her then-infant daughter, accused not only of practicing witchcraft, but also of seducing an &quot;upstanding&quot; royal guard.  The dishonored sentinel, known to only a selected few to be Cirrean's father, probably sat rotting to this day in the dungeons of Erudin Palace.  How could he have known that the woman who he had loved had actually been a heretic spy, and a priestess of Cazic-Thule?  Who would be there to recognize his daughter when she appeared many years later, emerging from the darkness of Toxxulia Forest, dressed in the shimmering garments of a paladin?  Nobody.  Nobody to ask a few questions, to think for a moment that this curiously silent beauty might be something other than what she appeared to be.  In time, past deeds are forgotten, and the faces of sworn enemies begin to bear likeness to old friends.  And as the balance of Good and Evil wanes back and forth, even the dark gods need paladins to do their bidding.<br>
<br>
In any case, there had been some woman standing at the Qeynos docks on the day that Cirrean arrived, another Erudite as bad luck would have it.  This woman, a complete stranger, seemed to recognize the girl who stepped off the boat, and called for the guards. The events that followed were a blur in the back of her mind, but Cirrean found herself lying bruised and bloody on a deserted stretch of shoreline.  By some twist of fate, she found her way into the catacombs beneath Qeynos, and discovered a thriving heretic shrine.  In this strange new city, they served some other god, and swore allegiance to the Bloodsabers rather than the Fell Blade of Paineel.  Still, it mattered not.  The dark clerics and necromancers taught Cirrean the secrets of the catacombs, of hidden passages and guard patrols, of new spells and skills, and many more things.  It was there that she first met a man by the name of Kane Bayle, apparently a soldier of some rank.  He spoke only a little bit to her, but said that with some show of loyalty on her part, Cirrean could join the ranks of the Bloodsabers.  He spoke with disdain of the paladins and clerics of Qeynos, and of the Temple of Life.  Not immediately interested in becoming entangled in local politics, the young woman instead decided to take up the hunt with some of the other young initiates of the secluded shrine.<br>
<br>
That hunt, as it turned out, became a long journey across the continent.  For killing gnolls and bandits, some of the more easily-influenced guards of Qeynos provided Cirrean safe passage across the Karanas.  Other than a few self-righteous paladins and hungry griffons, there were few dangers to avoid when one knew which paths led to the safety of darkness.  Highpass showed promise, but shadow knights were few and far between, as were meals and hot baths.  The halflings of Riverdale were quite hostile, but the Tier'Dal provided her with a reasonable amount of hospitality as long as the young lady did not stray too far beyond the Foreign Quarter.  A seasoned dark elf warrior took a liking to Cirrean, tempting her with jewels and a more fitting wardobe, but she quickly left town before he had time to request that his favor be returned.  Freeport offered employment opportunities for a time, but once again it was political rivalries that bored young Cirrean.  Soon, she decided to return to the battlefields of the Karanas.<br>
<br>
<br>
On to Blacker Pastures...<br>
<br>
It was along the path coming down out of Highpass that Cirrean's thoughts turned to revenge. Revenge for the poverty she and her mother had endured before finding sanctuary in Paineel. Revenge for the times she had been forced to hide from passing guards, bent on the destruction of her kind, whether in Qeynos or Freeport or in between.  Cazic-Thule took power from the fear of the weak, and it was the Heretic belief that to spread this fear was to earn the inheritance of the Faceless One.  The first to feel this fear would be those who had tried to instill fear upon her.  Within the canyon below, Cirrean took her first victim, a paladin who had set up camp in a cave, hidden from the roaming beasts of the open plains.<br>
<br>
&quot;What kind of warrior is afraid of a few scrawny, half-starved wolves and lions?&quot; Cirrean spat, coming into the light of the armored woman's sputtering campfire.<br>
<br>
&quot;Who do you think you are, mocking ME?!!&quot; the woman snarled, leaping to her feet with sword in hand.  &quot;I am a paladin of Rodcet Nife, and you are a foreigner who obviously needs to learn some manners!  Know this, I am betrothed to Kane Bayle, commander of every guardsman from here to Qeynos itself.  You do not wish to cross me, sister.&quot;<br>
<br>
It took a moment for the infuriated woman's words to sink in.  As soon as Cirrean realized the connection, she laughed with unrestrained amusement.<br>
<br>
&quot;Kane Bayle?  You share your bed with a knight of the Plague Lord!  Even as we speak, his men are searching the plains for you, to snuff out your pathetic life!  I shall save them the trouble.&quot;<br>
<br>
Seeing a look of disbelief flash across her rival's face, Cirrean knew that this was the time to strike.  With an indecipherable war cry, she swung her two-handed blade high before arcing it down.  The female paladin countered, bringing her longsword up to meet the fierce attack.  The sweet ringing of steel was drowned out by the roar of thunder as a storm swept down out of Highpass with sudden fury.  Pressing her attack, Cirrean sliced across the campfire as her foe stumbled back.  Again, the paladin blocked the blow and lunged back at Cirrean.  The stab was awkward, and stuck in the brigandine ringmail which Cirrean had eagerly accepted from that dark elf lordling back in Neriak.  What was his name again?  He certainly did have a way with...<br>
<br>
Cirrean's thoughts were interrupted by a shout from the enraged paladin.<br>
<br>
&quot;You are a liar, and nothing more than a common thief.  Kane would never betray me!  And you...you are no better than the bandits that sneak amongst the hills.  May my god guide my hand!&quot;<br>
<br>
Not one to engage in idle chat when there was a battle to fight, Cirrean ducked beneath her adversary's blade.  With the tip of her sword, she struck sparks and hot ashes into the air, and right into the eyes of the paladin.  Screaming in pain and anger, the woman dropped her sword and brought her hands to her face.  Rather than ending the fight with a quick slash or stab, Cirrean decided that this babbling slave of &quot;good&quot; would be the first to understand the fear she intended to spread.  Speaking in hushed tones, Cirrean held her hands out to her sides, fingers outstretched.  In the cave around them, the bones of animals and humans and other long-dead creatures rattled.  A gust of wind swept the canyon, and in a heartbeat, the bones were united into a single cohesive being.  With unbridled bliss, Cirrean picked up the paladin's dropped longsword and tossed it to her newfound &quot;pet&quot;.  The female paladin looked up, her eyes blinded and her face a swirl of tears and ashes.<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever manner of creature you have called upon, it will not spare you from eternal damnation.  I know what you are now, shadow knight!  I do not fear you!&quot;  The paladin's words, still quite coherent through teeth clenched in pain, gave no hint of defeat.<br>
<br>
Cirrean, however, had other plans.  &quot;You believe that you do not fear, because you do not see what is before you.  I will open the eyes of your soul, and you SHALL see!&quot;  Spitting forth a curse, the infernal fear of Cazic poured from Cirrean's mouth, taking on the form of a spectral visage, that of the dark god himself.<br>
<br>
In a brief second that seemed like an hour, the fallen knight's every nightmare became reality.  Realization of her lover's sinister betrayal stole the warmth from her heart, while newfound sight showed her the skeletal creature that now raised a sword - her sword - to end her life.  The scream that now escaped her lips was of complete despair, of soul-wrenching helplessness, and of complete horror as she experienced the very essence of the Lord of Fear.<br>
<br>
Cirrean turned away, quite satisfied simply hearing the screams of the paladin.  A supposed warrior of truth, literally being scared to death by the bitter truths of her life.  Snapping her fingers, Cirrean motioned for the undead warrior to finish the fight.  The image of Cazic-Thule faded as the skeleton impaled the paladin on her own blade, knocking her back into the campfire which consumed her before dying out beneath the rain.  From the blackened remains, Cirrean pulled forth a handkerchief out of the deceased woman's pack.  On it was sewn, in silver thread, the name &quot;Clothspinner&quot;.<br>
<br>
The shadow knight smiled to herself in the darkness.<br>
