<br>
<br>
My great-grandmother died when I was an infant.  From the time I was 7 until 13 I would have dreams about her regularly.  I had no idea what she looked like until one day when I was 9, my maternal grandmother brought over some old family portraits and my great-grandmother was in some of them and I recognized her immediately from my dreams.<br>
<br>
<br>
The second was not too long ago.  I was asleep and was approached by an entity who told me his name was Benjamin Orman and that he needed my help.  This happened three consecutive nights in a row and each time he approached me, I woke up because, frankly, it frightened me never having been approached this way before.  After the third time I asked him to leave me alone because at the time I didn't feel I was able to handle a situation like that.  I remember discussing this with a friend of mine who suggested it might be a family member who had passed.  Only after that conversation did it register that my maternal grandmother's maiden name is Ohrmundt.  After checking my grandmother's family records (she's kept a thorough account over the years) I did indeed find a Benjamin Ohrmundt in the records.<br>
<br>
I feel I have had some contact with ghosts (in fact there is some &quot;ghost&quot; activity going on in my house as of late) but most of the time I often feel as if I'm dealing with a child.  They're very playfurl a lot of the time. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubrilroswen.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Brilroswen</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 16<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/21/02 12:29:12 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Dick Shun Airy Logic?</span><hr size=1> I don't really have any firsthand experience with ghosts and communication with the dead, but my mom has had several dreams in which she spoke with people who had died fairly recently. I wish I could remember what she told me about the dreams, but all I can remember is that in one she was talking to her mother-in-law, my paternal grandmother, and in the other she was talking to a friend of her older sister's.<br>
<br>
Now maybe some of you are gonna automatically assume that my mom wasn't really communicating with the dead, and I admit that it's a possibility that the dreams were merely her way of coping with the deaths, but if that was the case then I think she would have also had a dream about talking with her father when he died several years ago. I think it's possible to communicate with the dead, and I've seen more evidence--numerous testimonies from individuals of varying credibility--in support of communication with the dead than against it. <p><b><font color="teal"><a href="http://www.deadjournal.com/~brilroswen/">History</a> will be kind to me for I intend to <a href="http://www.mediaminer.org/user_info.php?id=53813">write</a> it. --Sir Winston Churchill</font></b>

Regarding the discussion on the first page as to whether or not there is evidence:<br>
The issue here is confusion between the concepts of evidence and proof. Proof is not the same thing as evidence.<br>
Think about courtroom trials.Both sides present &quot;evidence&quot;; information and testimony calculated to sway the jury in their favor.<br>
Proof, which we might consider to be evidence so convincing it can't be refuted, is more what FraterLiber is saying does not exist.<br>
Evidence, which might be considered to be &quot;indications&quot; that something is true,<br>
certainly DO exist. They don't constitute &quot;proof&quot;, though, at this stage of the inquiry.<br>
<br>
I would like to request that those among you reading this thread who have heard voices tell us in detail about the quality of the experience.<br>
<br>
1.How &quot;real&quot; do the voices sound compared to voices you know to be real.<br>
<br>
2.How many different voices have you heard? What sex did they seem to be.How old did they sound? What other specific<br>
traits did they have that would distinguish them from any other voice (i.e. raspy, deep, high pitched,kind, stern, slurred, foreign accent - that sort of thing)?<br>
<br>
3.Where did they seem to be coming from?<br>
In the head? If so, exactly where in the head? Out in the room? If so, how far away from you? From what directon?<br>
<br>
4.Describe anyhing else about them that strikes you as important to know to help someone else understand the experience.<br>
<br>
I think its important for those of us who have never had this experience to hear these details. When someone says &quot;I hear voices&quot; they may not realize this can only be understood in a very vague and probably inaccurate way by those who haven't. It may seem like a chore but I hope you'll help. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i><font size=1 color=#FFFFCC>Angelight</font></i></span><br>  Posts: 4494<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(9/26/02 12:36:44 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: talking to the dead</span><hr size=1> Scott, you make a very interesting point. <br>
<br>
Since I am Bipolar and on certain medications that can cause hallucinations (as well as the Bipolar causing hallucinations) I have to pay close attention when it comes to &quot;hearing voices&quot;.<br>
<br>
As far as the &quot;hallucination&quot; voices, there are four. Two male and two female. One of the male voices I recognize as a friend's voice but don't recognize the other male voice. One of the female voices I recognize as a girlfriend's voice but do not recognize the other female voice.<br>
<br>
All four &quot;hallucination&quot; voices are very close and off to my right. All four of the voices have only ever called my name, &quot;Dottie!&quot; except the male friend's voice I recognize and it says, &quot;Hey, Dottie!&quot;<br>
<br>
The voices are loud, in the same room and I hear them on the outside by ear. Yet I <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b> *KNOW*</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> they are not there and due to my medications and condition. Still when I hear my name called I always turn around to my right and say, &quot;Yes?&quot; Then I realize it is only a hallucination calling my name and ignore it. It doesn't disturb me as they don't converse with me and only call my name.<br>
<br>
Then there are times that I try to communicate with the dead and carry on a conversation. I am rarely successful. Those times that I am successful I hear them carrying a conversation &quot;in my head&quot; and not to be heard by my ear. These I don't feel are hallucinations ... But admit that these experience may be all in my head. I just don't know.<br>
<br>
Please, if you have any other questions about anything I've said, do feel free to ask.  <p><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/dottie.gif><br>

That's a tough one!<br>
<br>
My spirit friend is a 2500 year old Jewish priest... and he tells me there are some ways to tell the difference between the two.<br>
<br>
He says they all require tantric energy to survive... that is they all feed off the living.  But their food is emotional energy.  There are two schools of thought however.<br>
<br>
Caring spirits will raise the human emotional level to a state of ecstasy and will replace what they take with their own energy.  They believe they can eat of the fruit without harming the tree and often provide protection, knowledge and nurturing.<br>
<br>
Malicious spirits, on the other hand, believe we are just food and care nothing for our well being.  They will also raise the emotional levels, but in any way they can.  Often by encouraging fear, anguish or rage, and they do not replace the energies they take... they just suck you dry until there is nothing left.<br>
<br>
Some dead give-aways (no pun intended) are that they will first attempt to isolate you from others.  They do this by convincing you that you are so much better than the rest of the &quot;herd&quot; and that the others can not possibly understand you and will resent you because you are so wise and perfect.<br>
<br>
When they succeed in isolating you, they encourage feelings of displacement which produce despair, frustration and then rage... usually in that order.  When a person can no longer relate to the world they live in, they become depressed and feel like a stranger in a strange land.  The wonder and sense of adventure become degraded.  They begin to question what their purpose is... and that can produce an enormous amount of frustration, since it is not a question that can easily be answered.  When that frustration takes hold, resentments build and once they are vented, exhaustion sets in.<br>
<br>
All in all, you gain nothing and stand to lose everything you might have experienced, created or accomplished in your life.<br>
<br>

<br>
I have visited, and been visited by, the &quot;dead&quot;.  But am only SOMETIMES able to listen to what they are saying (when Im more receptive to what they say, that is).<br>
<br>
Other times during the day, I just blow it off and say to myself - well are you going to go sit and go around the twist, or will you wash those dishes instead (?) - choose now! <br>

&quot;Well to tell you the truth, the first time i ever used a oujia board for some reason i knew what the answers were going to be. And soon after that i started to hear voices when i was just about ready to go to sleep. And soon enough I could hear voices all the time. I even hear them now ... &quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=sexysixxx>SexySiXXX</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Suite Amazon Goddess</span><br>  Posts: 176<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/22/02 5:33:46 am)</font><br>     <br>ezSupporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: do you think you can talk with the dead?</span><hr size=1> I don't think I can right out &quot;talk&quot; to the dead, but I do sense the presence of lost loved ones often.

It's the answers.<br>

If I ever get one that is absolutely believable, there will be a report of a low-flying UFO over Seattle that resembles Fat-man, the Human Flying Saucer.<br>
