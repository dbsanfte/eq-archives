There is a story thats goes with this so I'll start with that.<br>
My grandmother used to live in an apartment above her landlord. My grandmother (we call her Mama) is Puerto Rican and the landlords are Dominican (well thats what she says they are). Well for years Mama never had a problem with her landlords. However, about 3 years ago they started to force her out of the apartment but not how you may think they wouldn't fix things, they were rude to her, and made loud noise all night and day. So when she finally moved to a apartment arcoss the street she had a few words with the landlords. Knowing Mama it was pretty bad. Well eye for an eye. Anyway at night when Mama would go to sleep she'd feel someone else in the bed with her. Now Mama believes in all this ghost, spells, etc. stuff. This is also not the only time she felt someone in the bed with her but the other time she said it was pleasent and safe feeling, thats another story, but this one now felt evil. Not to mention that she also felt a body on top of her, kissing her! She believes, as well as I do, that the landlords from before are doing Voodoo spells to her. She believes this because when she told them off she thinks what she told the husband REALLY hurt him and his wife is taking revenge with black magic. Wait there's more.... When Mama sees the woman at the local SuperMarket she only buys a little bit of stuff, little milk, little bread, no snack food. I have heard using magic beings it back times 10 or something like that well my question is does it come back in the same way you sent it out or does it hurt you in another way?  <p>i leave u wit some words of wisdom to rememba me by

Did your grandmother do magic? there are many explainations involving her case.  it could be vodoo or black magic (although true magic is neither black nor white), or her new house could be haunted, or it could be a fear projected with hallutionations.  you never know.  but please tell me more and I will see what I can do. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uorlandobloomschick.showPublicProfile?language=EN>OrlandoBloomsChick</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 26<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/1/02 3:42:26 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=416.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://broken.blackroses.com/members/ladyarwen/sigs/bladepic.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Need help!</span><hr size=1> There is a basic spell to send back a curse to the original sender....

But I'd have to go with Roxy... (although I think If you don't believe in the 3 fold rule I don't think it effects you... I've seen to much evil to believe this thing accually works)<br>

It could be haunted... and in that case I can't really help.... <p><center><h6>
