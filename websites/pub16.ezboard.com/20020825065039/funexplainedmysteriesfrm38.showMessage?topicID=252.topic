He declined so much in health that I took him to the vet last Wednesday the 17th where they diagnosed him with lung cancer. The vet wanted to treat him for pneumonia in case he was wrong. That night I had a dream that Mom was laying in bed at Dad's and wanted us to bring Harry up to see her. We put him on the bed and he walked up to Mom. She said, "He's all right." And he laid down beside Mom and went to sleep. When I woke up the next morning I knew instantly what this dream meant. My mother passed away Jan. 21, 2001. It made me sick, but I knew what was going to happen. I had Harry since he was 6 weeks old and now he was 13 and a half. On Friday, July 19, 2002 Harry passed away at 5a.m. Another weird thing is that my uncle who had been sick for a long time died at this same time.<br><br>Today I took his medicine back to the vet to get a refund. They were in a small brown bag. I took the bag back to the van with me and laid in on the console. I turned to look in a sack for something just behind my seat. When I turned back, that bag was gone. I searched all over the van and still can't find it. Why the bag disappeared, I don't know. The windows were up, so it didn't blow out. <br><br>These things are mildly strange, but I just wanted to share them with you. I hope you don't find it boring.<br> <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A bird will drop frozen dead from a bow without ever having felt sorry for itself.--D.H.

I can truly identify. I still miss Maiden, my first retired Greyhound that I rescued from death.<br>She was 6 years old when I got her and had been severely abused and neglected.<br><br>It took a year of pampering and patience before she learned to smile and wag her tail. She was the most polite, gracious, noble, kind, sweet, dear, loving companion and all the cats and kids in the neighborhood flocked to her.<br><br>Well, the normal life span for a Greyhound is 9 years. I was fortunate enough to have her for 13 years since I took such great care of her. She got cancer in the jaw which is rarely if ever found in a Greyhound. They are known to get cancer in their front hips (haunches).<br><br>I still love her so even though I've had two dogs since her and the one I have now is very dear.<br><br>Again, thank you for sharing your experiences. It is comforting to do so I feel.  <p><img src=http://www.myezboard.com/projects/ezboard/ezboard_userimages/dottie.gif><br>"The love for all living creatures is the noblest attribute of man."<br>~~~Charles Darwin~~~<br>Please visit us at the <font size=3><a href="http://pub76.ezboard.com/bthoughtmessageboard">Thought Message Board</a><br></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usixthsense16.showPublicProfile?language=EN>sixthsense16</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 84<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/25/02 2:01:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=252.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.paranormalandmuchmore.com/ANIorbExam.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: A few strange things I wanted to share.</span><hr size=1> Oh, gosh. You guys bring tears to my eyes. I am so glad that I shared that after all. I was afraid that it would be boring. I'm, in a way, glad to hear others have gone through what I have. To me it was like losing a 13 and a half year old child. He was my baby. I still don't know what happened to the brown bag his medicine was in. I don't understand why something like that disappeared. Maybe "someone" didn't want it around to remind me. I have too much of that anyway. <br><br>We have a cabinet that we cleaned out and he slept in it. It has spring hinged doors so he could "nose" in and out of it. I looked in it today because I had thought of cleaning it out and using it for something else. But it was like a kid's room. There was a ball he had played with and a plastic candy cane he had stolen from the Christmas decorations. There were also a few things that he had shredded to make his bed. He loved to steal things and hide with them because he knew you wanted them. I closed the door and decided to leave it like that for awhile. I'm not ready for that yet if ever I will be.<br><br>Thank you all for sharing with me. It gives me lots of comfort to know I am among those who love their pets like I do. <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

I myself am not much of a dog person (don't get me wrong I love all animals very much, and have a dog), but a I am very much a cat person. <br><br>   We had 5 cats I had to go give one of them away just yesterday, she would keep my parents up at night. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, the whole way there she cried and when I had to put her in that small metal cage, she just looked up at me so sad, and I just had to walk away from her as she cried, leaving her there with those strangers and knowing she would spend nights alone in that cold metal cage. It was like the moment I stepped outside our house she knew, she knew where she was going, it was awful. I still feel absolutely disguted with myself, and am still so worried that she might not find a GOOD home, or any home at all. <br><br>   I've had cats around me all my life, and have had 2 of them pass away. One naturally, the other we had to put to sleep. Does anyone think we can communicate with deceased animals, or has anyone done it? I've always wondered but would never know how to go about doing it.

I had to give a puppy away one time because she was eating up all of Mom's furniture. She wouldn't mind and "went" wherever she wanted. I finally was told I HAD to give her up. I know that kind of pain, too. I also had a cat named Molly come up missing one time. She was house trained and Mom let her out to do her thing and she never came back. We still don't know what happened to her. And they would of had to have committed me after carrying my injured dog back from where it got hurt. I would never have recovered. I don't think. Harry got loose one time and when they found him he had crossed two major streets in my town. They are very busy all the time. I just about had a heart attack.<br><br>It's good to share those feelings because in this world they don't treat losing a pet as much of an event. You have to grieve with family and friends who know what you are feeling. I wish they had funeral homes and pet cemeteries everywhere and not just in Hollywood. It would really help things a lot. Because they are not just our pets. They are our friends, children, brothers, sisters, and we love them. We need to say good-by to them just like any other family member, but unfortunately we have to do it in our own way.  <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

I had a Golden Retriver/German Shepard mix that grew up with me.  She slept by my bed every night.  When she was 6 or 7 she started to gain weight because we fed her table scraps which I now know isn't good for dogs.  She got arthritis is her later years, lost most of her hearing and sight, and eventually had to be put to sleep at 14 years old.  She had a good life but I still miss her very much.<br><br>Now I have 2 dogs.  One is a Husky/Shepard mix which looks almost exactly like my old dog.  She's 4 now, we got her when she was 8 weeks old.  My other dog is a beagle/husky mix and she's 1 and a half.  We rescued her from a animal adoption group when she was 7 months.  She had a hard life basicly living on the streets, some guy saved her life when these demon possessed kids tried to push her into the street so she could get run over by traffic.
