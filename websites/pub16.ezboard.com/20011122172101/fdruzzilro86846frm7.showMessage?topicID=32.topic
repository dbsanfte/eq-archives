Out of the dim light appears a hand, this hand is attached to one of Innoruuk's own Vicars...Holding her hand, he guides her out of the Citadel of the Dead.<br>
<br>
Once out of Neriak, the Vicar begins his incanations and begins to strengthen the young elf so that she may become stronger and able to survive in the harsh realms that lie ahead of her.  Opening her spellbook, she begins to memorize her most important spells and ventures out to slay the foul beasts which roam the forests of Nekulos.<br>
<br>
Exuberant on her first kill, she celebrates with her newfound elder.  Revelling in her success, he instructs the young elf to continue slaying these foul beasts.  Rising from the ground comes her first ally, comprised of bones and named Jobaber she begins to annihilate all that confront her.<br>
<br>
Slowly she gains experiance and wisdom, listening intently to the Vicar as he instructs her.  Explaining to her the importance of observing before initiating combat, he starts her on a journey out of Nekulos and into a world called Lavastorm.  Into the firey pits they journey, battling drakes, imps and goblins.  Rising fast in her studies, the young elf is now of her 15th season and ready to journey into the dangerous lands of Norrath.  Seasoned by many battles in this land of magma and flame, she journeys far from her homeland to arrive in a new place called North Ro.<br>
<br>
The young dark elf scans the landcape for signs of life and finds not a single soul.  Journying out into this dry land of dunes and jagged cliffs, she sets out to discover this new world and hopefully find some sort of life.  Coming upon some ancient ruin, she is attacked by two very angry ghouls.  Valiantly she roots them and starts to fight back as best as she can, suddenly, her health drops to the point where she is on the brink of death, when out of nowhere, her beloved mentor and friend arrives and restores her health and vigor.  The battle rages on, all the while her companion standing near to cast the occasional heal on her or her pet.  Then, without warning, the fight is over, and the young dark elf hits the ground and lets out a sigh of relief.<br>
<br>
The Vicar, wise to the inhabitants of this strange desert land, instructs the young elf to travel the ocean beaches rather than attempting to cross in the deep desert.  He warns of all sorts of creatures from roaming sand giants to mummies and skeletons.  He guides the young one to a place aptly named Oasis and there he leaves her.<br>
<br>
The young elf approches the boat dock and cautiously inquires as to the whereabouts of a good group of adventurures that could utilize her new skills.  The battle cry is heard across the land and she gathers her few belongings and walks to a place called Ork Highway.  Here she encounters her first real battle and realizes that she is safer in these early years in a group of fellow adventurures.  Glancing around this area, she notices a group of gypsies, a tower out on the middle of some strange island with some sort of creature cloaked in black and a huge sand giant named Cazel.  A scream is heard throught the land as this named sand giant goes on a rampage and murdures everyone close to him.  Using her hide skill, she evades this attacker and inquires to her friend if he would be so kind as to restore spirits to her fellow adventurors bodies.<br>
<br>
The Vicar travels from some place called Karnor's Castle and assists the young elf.  He casts all sorts of spells and recites various incantations until everyone is back to full health and they recieve the blessings of Innoruuk.  Walking over to his young friend, he gives her a small gift and tells her to use it well.  Vanishing in a portal, he leaves her wondering what this gift is................. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.showMessage?topicID=33.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.showMessage?topicID=30.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br></td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.emailToFriend?topicID=32.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.threadControl?topicID=32.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=32.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=32.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm10">IRL<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm11">The Admin Vault<option value="druzzilro86846frm12">Raid Archive<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">The Void</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm7>Role-Players and Story-Tellers</a> <font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><a href="http://www.druzzil-ro.net">Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 6.4 b4<br>Copyright ©1999-2001 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
