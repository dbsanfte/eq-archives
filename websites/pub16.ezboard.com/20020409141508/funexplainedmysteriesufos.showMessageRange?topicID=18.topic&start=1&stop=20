HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: flying triangle spotted in doncaster area</span><hr size=1> Ok, this happened about 26 years ago. My boyfriend and I were traveling down the Courtney Campbell Causeway (a small four lane highway with water on both sides.<br><br>Ahead, I spotted 3 flying object too close together to be airplanes ... too dangerous for that. Maybe helicopters? They were flying right over the causeway in our direction and I pointed them out to Steve. We kept watching. It was not yet dark, still light enough not to need the Street Lights.<br><br>As they got closer, I could see they were traveling at a slow speed ... not like an airplane ... and at the height of, say a high wire in the circus ... so not that very high.<br>Closer and closer they came. There they were! All three were either silver or metallic gray and rounded off triangles solid in form! This is the God's Honest Truth! They made no noise whatsoever. Each had the same lights in the front and each were different in color. This is where my memory fails. I am sure that one was red, but think another was yellow .... could the other have been green? I do remember they were not blue or purple in shade for sure.<br><br>As they passed over the car, Steve pulled over to the side of the street and we got out to observe. Nothing happened to us or the car. No power outage, nothing unusual at all. The objects parted and two went one way over the water toward Clearwater and the other over the opposite side of the street, over the water toward St. Petersburg. I remember standing there and concentrating so very hard for them to come back and make contact. LOL! Silly, I know, but this was the first, and now I know the ONLY (to date) UFO encounter I ever had.<br><br>If they were of this world, they weren't of any technology we know of. Not only that, but what the heck were they doing where they were at that time of day? Anyway, I am open minded that they could have been extraterrestrial or of a technology still not known to us.<br><br>I wish I could report that something more exciting had happened, but there was no close encounter other that the siting of these three crafts.  I remember it as though it was yesterday (except for the three colors of the lights at the front).<br><br>Well, that's the story of my one and only encounter with what may have been craft not of this earth.<br><br>~~~ Dottie ~~~ <p>"The love for all living creatures is the noblest attribute of man."~Charles Darwin</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ugmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Monster from the id</span><br>  Posts: 82<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/5/00 4:44:25 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.gmtzone.freeserve.co.uk/pics/sigpic.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: flying triangle spotted in doncaster area</span><hr size=1> you are a very lucky person<br><br>what u witnessed was a classic &quot;flying triangle&quot; sighting<br><br><br>(point of intrest sometimes you do witness the &quot;black helicopters&quot; when winessing &quot;flying triangles&quot;)<br><br>these things are either<br><br>1.theres<br>2.ours<br>3.mixture of both<br><br><br>i go for 3<br><br><br>what u saw was something special <br>i only wish i get to see something like what  you did before i die <p><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#FFFF00" link="#FFFFFF" vlink="#00FF00"><p>Regards GMT     <font color="#00FFFF">ICQ</font>  <font color="#00FFFF">27828203  </font>    </p><p><font color="#FFFF00">If you would like to contact me or visit the boards andsites i am involved in please gotto</font><font color="#FFFFFF">    <a href="http://www.gmtzone.net" target="_blank">WWW.GMTZONE.NET</a></font></p><p><a href="http://www.naptalk.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="http://www.gmtzone.freeserve.co.uk/pics/naptalk.gif"></a></p><p> </p><p> </p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 37<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/5/00 6:18:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pitt.edu/~llrst11/laura/graphics/yoda6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: flying triangle spotted in doncaster area</span><hr size=1> GMT, Oh YES!

This seems to be the perfect place to tell of my experiance,well actually three of them,not real sure what the third was. Anyway it was at least 6,7 years ago. Was home alone,why not,on a weekend which was unusual for here. Husband was gone overnight,daughter was out on a date but worst of all my brother and his family who lived next to us was gone that night also. What made that so awful for me was that my brother and family was NEVER gone over the weekends,he believes in ufo's but wife doesn't. Anyhow not to make this story any longer than i have to, my dog had been barking outside as I was getting into bed. Instead of walking thru the house to go to her I hollered out the bedroom window to be quiet. Thats when it caught my eye. It was across the road in the front of the house looking like it was sitting on the hill but of course wasn't. I then walked away to get the binoculors,when i returned it was gone. I knew it was no plane or helicopter by the was it was just sitting in the sky. I looked out the other windows then decided to go out to the dog and look around. I was looking across the road in all directions,standing in my drive way when why I don't know I looked up and there it was!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It was directly over me!!!!!! It was low enough to count the lites and to see it was hollow in the middle,a round shape. I could see the shape but it wasn't matallic,instead just black as far as i could see. And it was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!  I stood there frozen,fasinated and scared to death,since I was alone. I don't know how long I stood there but my neck started hurting from looking up for so long. Then it hit me to run in,get the cordless phone and call my brother thinking they were in bed. Of course i took the phone outside so i wouldn't lose this sight but got nothing but pure static. So i kept running in and out of the house trying to get him. Finally at one point,as i was standing there i looked down to rub my neck and when looking back up it had moved. Not a sound!!! It only moved a matter of maybe 10 ft. away. This must have gone on for at least and hour,one minute its in one spot the next in another. Then finally,like IT was finished,it took off and disappeared over the hill behind the house. I was exhausted from the fear,excitement,and the unbelieveabilty of it all. As I turned to go back into the house I looked up one more time in another direction and noticed what I thought were stars. I started to walk back into the house when I thought it just seemed that these stars were just a little too bright,and perfectly formed in a V. I stepped back to look again and noticed they were moving. I stood there long enough to know they were definetly not planes,hellicopters. They were such a bright white light and steadily moving towards my way but in a slow motion. Thats when i got a little panicky,went into the house locking the doors and just waiting for anyone to get home.<br><br>OK now for the second experiance. I find this one fasinating. It was maybe 2 weeks after my sighting,which i forgot to mention,others had seen it that same nite in different locations. Anyway,I had gone to bed one night before my husband. Our bedroom has a skylite,sliding glass doors and two large windows. I got into bed and had just started to fall into a nice sleep when all of a sudden I opened my eyes and the whole room was in a green hue. It was like the outside of the house was covered in a green mist and the lite was coming in all windows and the door. I felt no panic at all,in fact I was extremely calm. I sat up putting my feet to the floor,sitting on the bed. I remember thinkin to myself,&quot;i feel so calm,almost in a trance state,but it couldn't be&quot;. Then all of a sudden I felt like something had just passed thru me,from the back,touching every nerve and fiber in me,and as it left me the light left the room!! Nothing hurt,it just felt like I was aware of every nerve in my body,like maybe electricy had gone thru me. Thats the only way I know how to describe it. After, I must have sat there in the same position for at least half an hour i guess. I kept thinking &quot;go get Charlie and tell him what just happened&quot; but all of a sudden I just turned,layed down and went right to sleep. Of course I told him the next morning what had happened and he believed me,but one thing i regret was not looking at the clock!!! Charlie had asked after i described what had happened if I looked at it!!!!!!!!  I still to this day can't believe I had the luck to SEE what I will sware and know in my heart and head  was a ufo. And then to experiance what i did in the bedroom. I sware its all true. And since this was so long of a story I will wait for another time to add the last,which by the way was not very interesting,just a little curious. A black,huge ball in the daylight sky,that i watched for about 30 minutes while sitting out on the pool deck. Well I mentioned it anyway huh??!! It was there and while watching it,it would all of a sudden be in another place without moving?? Thats the only way I can say it. Then,while still looking at it,it just dissapeared!!!!! And it was a crystl clear,blue sky that day. No clouds to hide behind or move under.

Dotzap &amp; Chinastar, what awesome experiences!  You were both so honored to have them!  I too have had my experiences.  Shall I share?  OK, here goes...<br><br>There's been more than one, but I'll share just a couple here.  One happened about 7 or 8 years ago if I remember correctly.  I was fast asleep in bed and was suddenly awake, wide awake, the room was pitch black.  Suddenly the room filled with light, but not because the lights were turned on, I looked, there was no light actually on, no bulb was burning.  I too was not afraid, just in awe.  I layed there and watched, the light grew brighter, suddenly hovering through my basement was a globe, a shiny, perfect globe of light, about the size of a football (soccer ball in North America).  I had heard of ball lightning, but this was the middle of winter, how could that be possible?  I was laying there perfectly still, afraid to move, it hovered around the room, which was quiet large, about 600 sq feet, and over my bed, like it was looking at everything.  Just as suddenly as it had arrived it was gone.  To where I have no idea, I don't know if it was a ufo probe, or an actual being from a different reality, who knows!  It was fantastic, though, and just like you Chinastar, I wanted to go upstairs and tell somebody, but I couldn't budge from my bed, I lay there thinking about what just happened, but not really forming any thoughts... it was like my mind knew what had just happened, but was in a state of shock or something, because for the life of me I couldn't get out of bed and tell somebody else.  I fell asleep.<br><br>There is one that I'm unsure of sharing because it is so different.  It was a pre-cognitive awake dream, that's the only thing I can think of to describe it.  It happened many years ago, 13 to be exact and it was re-occuring.  Maybe I'll share it, it's very involved.  I have to remember who I'm sharing with, you guys won't make fun of me for it, so here goes.<br><br>I was fast asleep and suddenly I was just wide awake.  I was sitting up in bed with my right hand out to my side, palm up like I was holding something.  I tried to move my arm, but I couldn't.  I looked to my palm and there was a globe, a spinning earth shining, like a holographic image in my hand.  It was like I was holding it up.  Then I notice something to my right and my eyes follow.  This is all like a holographic image playing out in front of my open eyes in my bedroom:<br><br>This tall, young, well built man walks from my right, he is wearing a suit or uniform, it looks official.  He's very stern, not a lot of emotion on his face.  Short, brown hair, army cut.  I see a girl, little girl with long brown hair in pig tails and a red dress.  She is crouching down to the ground with chalk.  She is drawing a hopscotch board.  The man is walking very rigid, but not fast, it looks like he's going to walk right by her.  He looks down at her and stops.  She looks up at him and smiles.  He looks away and continues walking, the little girl in the red dress starts jumping on her hopscotch board.<br><br>The man walks past a 'podium'.  That's what it looks like.  He walks around it and behind it, there's this screen behind him, like the screens you see in board rooms and schools for watching films.  He lifts up the lid to whatever is on the podium.  This is the mystery, I can not see what is on the podium, the podium is slanted towards him, away from me, and I can't see what it is he's opening the lid up from.  As many times as I've experienced this 'dream' or 'holographic' message, I've never been able to see what is on that damned podium.<br><br>This whole time the earth is still revolving in my palm, I feel like it's precious and special and that I must protect it.  I look and the man puts his hand on the podium, the part I can't see.  It looks like he pushes something, or puts his hand down, imagine what that looks like, I can't explain it any better than that.<br><br>Suddenly I see the girl disappear, her hopscotch board is gone, the screen behind the man was blank and now it is totally gone, he looks shocked, I look at my right hand holding the earth and the earth is not there, the man looks around like he's searching, suddenly tears start coming down his cheeks, but his face shows no emotion other than that.  He walks away to the left, nothing left in his wake, the podium is gone as well.<br><br>Other than what I've described here, there is nothing else, there is not a 'background' scene of houses or trees, or a street, or an ocean, nothing, just the people and the objects I've described, it's very hard to explain.<br><br>This whole time I'm experiencing it I can't move, no matter if I want to it's like I'm just stuck in that position, sitting up looking straight ahead with my right hand out palm up holding that revolving earth.  The first time I had that experience I cried, I thought 'please let it stop, let it stop, I am so scared, let it stop, let it stop.'  I wanted to scream for my parents, but it was just like I had the thought that I should call for them but I just couldn't make my body work the way I wanted it to, it was like being paralyzed everywhere.<br><br>Once the dream would stop playing over and over again, usually it would repeat itself about 5 times a night when I'd have it, I would want to rush in to my parents room and tell them but I just couldn't, I would lay down, scared to death, not knowing what the hell it meant, and wanting to deny it, and I would just fall asleep.  I had the re-occuring holographic dream for about a year, then never again.<br><br>I didn't share that with anybody but my closest friend for a long time.  I did not want everybody to think I was crazy, and nobody ever talked to me about stuff like that, so I figured I must've been going loopy.<br><br>It wasn't until my mid-20's that I started thinking about that again.  It only started to really sink in the last year or so.  Then I really had to face the truth, all the things I'd denied for so long.<br><br>I am unsure of what exactly the dream means.  Has anybody ever had a similar experience?  Every time I tell people about it it's like I can see it again, right in front of me, just like it happened.  It's very strange to talk about it, so I will end now.<br><br>Niki <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Dottie</span><br>  Posts: 375<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/6/00 1:21:17 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.pitt.edu/~llrst11/laura/graphics/yoda6.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: flying triangle spotted in doncaster area</span><hr size=1> Chianastarr and Niki <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  First of all Chianastarr, that is so amazing! What you saw: &quot;was hollow in the middle,a round shape. I could see the shape but it wasn't matallic, instead just black as far as i could see.&quot;<br>I don't know that I would have been so brave to stand out there under it for so long. I may have observed it from a distance. I sure do wish you had had a camera! WOW! After what I've seen, I find your account amazing, wonderful and not difficult to believe at all. I'm just so happy nothing happened to you.<br><br>Niki, Your dream is remarkable. I am going to think a LOT about it and try to come up with a meaning for it, but don't hold your breath on that one. I feel strongly it DOES mean something of significance especially since you've had it so many times and it repeats itself in the same night up to 5 times.<br>It is a shame you are &quot;paralyzed&quot; and cannot move. If you do have this dream again and can try your best to remember you're dreaming .... maybe you will be able to get up, carry the hologram along with you and see what is on that podium. It may be of significance that something IS on the podium without you even needing to know what it is ... especially since the man in the suit is filled with emotion and appears to be making a presentation of some kind (the screen and all).<br>As far as the child playing hopscotch. Perhaps she represents the innocent masses who are ignorant as to what is happening and they are carrying on with business as usual. I simply don't know. Must think more about this.<br><br>Dream paralysis is awful! You can't wake, move, utter a sound. I do hope should you dream this again, you will be able to move around in the dream and investigate more.<br><br>I will think on yours and Chianastarr's experiences and if I come up with anything, will let you know.<br><br>Cianastarr, that is a MOST unusual space vehicle or apparition (whatever one wants to call it). So sorry you had no camera, but so glad you're safe.<br><br>Thank you both so much for sharing your experiences.

I have always felt that the nite my room filled with this light that I had been scanned. Its somewhat of a joke between myself and my hubby,seeing the ufo and then being scanned,that i was &quot;rejected not only once but twice&quot;!!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Standing under the ufo and then feeling the light &quot;go thru me&quot;,I was beginning to feel a little insulted!!!

I serously feel it must mean something,it has to. How scarey that must have been for you and also frustrating. Was that man sad because, like Dottie said,the ignorant are refusing to see what is going on and will not see we are in serious danger of destroying ourselves and this earth?????

Each time I ran into the house to use the phone I remember thinking to myself as i was going back out &quot;is this really happening,am I REALLY seeing this&quot;??? I must have asked myself that question for weeks. Maybe the shock of seeing it took all fear away replacing it with curiousty. But as I said,when finally going back into the house after it left and then seeing the huge bright white stars in that V formation moving as they were,I got terrified then. I remember locking all doors and shutting all the windows (it was summer) and laughing to myself thinkin &quot;oh you idiot, like they couldn't get in if they wanted to&quot;!!!!!! I actually got in bed and pulled the covers over my head with ALL lights on in the house!!

It was in early spring, so the sun had already set at around 8:45 PM local time. I stepped out for a minute just to take in the warm  spring air that settled in that day. I happened to look up to check out the pin points of light from the emerging stars when I saw it. 'It' being a chevron shaped flying wing. There were three lights across the front of each wing. I don't recall any other lights on it anywhere. I have lived directly under the flight area of approaching and departing commercial aircraft at a local international airport all my life. I have seen hundreds of planes. None have ever looked like this. It was a wedge shaped wing; there was no cigar shaped passenger cabin. I heard absolutely no sounds from it whatsoever. There were other commercial planes in the sky at the time, and I could hear their engines distinctly. I heard nothing from this craft. It flew in a direct south-to-north path, whereas virtually every commercial aircraft associated with the airport fly in a west-east direction as they take off or land. Also it remained at a level flight path; it definately wasn't climbing or descending.  It was difficult to estimate it's exact size because I really didn't have anything like nearby clouds to judge it's altitude against. It moved through my field of vision in a few seconds, less than half the time commercial aircraft would take.     <p><img src=http://jawjrfotofile.homestead.com/files/lilfirebox.gif><i><a href><font color=red><font size=2>There is no faith in anything so strong it can't be shattered by one moment's glimpse of something it doesn't allow for.</font></font></a></i><br><img src=http://jawjrfotofile.homestead.com/files/rainbow_laser.gif><br><a href=http://pub34.ezboard.com/biciclesandicebergs target="web"><img src=http://jawjrfotofile.homestead.com/files/ielinklogo1.gif border=0></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/udotzap.showPublicProfile?language=EN>DOTZAP</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Angelight</span><br>  Posts: 3400<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(11/12/01 11:20:53 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=19>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> <BR><img src=http://members.aol.com/maidenntheshaden/maxmouse.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ~bump~ (ouchhh!)</span><hr size=1> Wow Psylent1  ... and it made no noise either.

Most witnesses report a dark, triangular object with three bright lights plus a flashing red one in the middle. Size estimates vary from the size of a football field to that of conventional aircraft. The object sometimes hovers for minutes at a time. It also can move very slowly and then suddenly accelerate to high speeds. Some observers report a faint humming sound; others say that it is noiseless. <br><br>The American Stealth fighter (Fll7) is roughly triangular, and there has been much speculation that people have been seeing this craft on night missions. The characteristics reported for the flying triangle, however, are hardly those of a jet aircraft. But one must always remember that human observers are imperfect. <br><br>The July 5, 1990, issue of Paris Match presented a remarkable account of an encounter between two Belgian F16s and one of the flying triangles. We use here those portions of a translation provided by R.J. Durant to the Internation al UFO Reporter (15:23, July/August 1990). <br><br>&quot;On the night of March 30th, one of the callers reporting a UFO was a Captain of the national police at Pinson, and [Belgian Air Force] Headquarters decided to make a serious effort to verify the reports. In addition to the visual sightings, two radar installations also saw the UFO. One radar is at Glons, south-east of Brussels, which is part of the NATO defense group, and one at Semmerzake, west of the Capitol, which controls the military and civilian traffic of the entire Belgian territory. The range of the two radars is 300 kilometers, which is more than enough to cover the area where the reports took place...Headquarters determined to do some very precise studies during the next 55 minutes to eliminate the possibility of prosaic explanations for the radar images. Excellent atmospheric conditions prevailed, and there was no possibility of false echoes due to temperature inversions. <br><br>&quot;...at 0005 hours the order was given to the F-16s to take off and find the intruder. The lead pilot concentrated on his radar screen, which at night is his best organ of vision. The F-16 is equipped with very sophisticated equipment, including chase radar, which is not fixed directly ahead of the airplane, but makes a wide search in an arc' of 90 degrees left and right of the nose... <br><br>&quot;Suddenly the two fighters spotted the intruder on their radar screens, appearing like a little bee dancing on the scope. Using their joy sticks like a video game, the pilots ordered the onboard computers to pursue the target. As soon as lock-on was achieved, the target appeared on the screen as a diamond shape, telling the pilots that from that moment on, the F-l6s would remain tracking the object automatically. <br><br>&quot;[Before the radar had locked on for six seconds] the object had speed up from an initial velocity of 280 kph to 1,800 kph, while descending from 3,000 meters to 1,700 meters...in one second! This fantastic acceleraton corresponds to 40 Gs. It would cause immediate death to a human on board. The limit of what a pilot can take is about 8 Gs. The trajectory of the object was extremely disconcerting. It arrived at 1,700 meters altitude, then it dove rapidly toward the ground at an altitude under 200 meters, and in doing so escaped from the radars of the fighters and the ground units at Glons and Semmerzake. This maneuver took place over the suburbs of Brussels, which are so full of man-made lights that the pilots lost sight of the object beneath them... <br><br>&quot;Everything indicates that this object was intelligently directed to escape from the pursuing planes. During the next hours the scenario repeated twice... <br><br>&quot;This fantastic game of hide and seek was observed from the ground by a great number of witnesses, among them 20 national policemen who saw both the object and the F-16s. The encounter lasted 75 minutes, but nobody heard the supersonic boom which should have been present when the object flew through the sonic barrier. No physical damage was reported. Given the low altitude and speed of the object, many windows should have been broken.&quot; <br>_____________________________ <br>(The above from <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.science-frontiers.com/sf072/sf072g15.htm">www.science-frontiers.com/sf072/sf072g15.htm</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->)<br> <p>___________<BR>Under neon loneliness motorcycle emptiness <BR>Under neon loneliness everlasting nothingness<BR> <img src=http://www.manics.co.uk/manics/music/singles/packshots/05.jpg ></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utowelfrood7.showPublicProfile?language=EN>towelfrood7</A> at: 12/24/01 9:59:14 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showMessageRange?topicID=18.topic&start=21&stop=26>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showPrevMessage?topicID=18.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showNextMessage?topicID=18.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=20><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/images/addreply.jpeg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.emailToFriend?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.threadControl?topicID=18.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesufos.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=18.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">Astrology<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesadministrationnoticeboard">Administrators Only<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm48">Ruth's Handbag...<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm65">UM Shake-Up!<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm66">Test Forum</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> -
