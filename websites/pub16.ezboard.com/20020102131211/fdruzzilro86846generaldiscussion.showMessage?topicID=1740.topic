hehe, yeah that ram is really expencive.  Wait sorry, I was going to agree with you then I realized that ram isn't very expencive at all.<br>
<br>
pc-133 512 meg 40$<br>
pc-150 512 54$<br>
the DDR 512 is around 100$<br>
<br>
The prices reflect if you actually had _no_ ram in your computer currently.  To upgrade from 256 or higher would be  about half as much, then half again everytime you go down an increment.  If spending 20$ on ram is too much for you then you probably shouldn't play games.<br>

The issue isn't the money spent, its the fact that Sony realized how much of an increase in the system requirements would be needed to run SoL.  I've yet to hear of any other computer game company doing such a thing, and although the gesture is nice, it does raise quite a bit of concern over how well the game is optimized right now.<br>
<br>
Note that the 512 MB of RAM would be in addition to what RAM the reviewer's computer has currently.  No other computer game on the market has such high requirements right now, and Sony sending out that much RAM realizes that they realize this is a huge leap forward in games.<br>
<br>
A good leap?  Not for me or you to decide.  Only the future holds the answer to that question. <p>Amankhann

The majority of the players obviously had plenty of ram to handle luclin or I don't think they would've done it with such harsh requirements.<br>
<br>
Oh that and the fact that the engine they switched to isn't a top notch engine.  As many have seen it's hardware requirements are harsh.  This engine while a nice one is poorly coded for a game like everquest.  It is built for something to look good and run smooth and fast working primarly off of hardware, where everquest needs to work off software and hardware to balance out the interenet latency and the good smooth running graphics.<br>
<br>
I also feel the way EQ loads is poorly coded.  When you zone into a zone it loads the entire zone into memory.  All the mobs are sent to your computer and loaded into memory (That is why ShowEQ works).  This is also the reason why the new Luclin takes so much longer to zone, the new graphics and especially the attachable armor (rather than just changing the players skin like before) take a lot to keep up with and to load.  <br>
<br>
If they switched to an engine that only loaded stuff in a certain range of you then they would have a) a much smoother running game  b)  No zoning really necessary  c)  Cut out one of the major problems of showeq, wich can tell where any mob is in a zone and what it has on it.  This would make it where showeq would only be able to pick up mobs in your immediate area.<br>
<br>
For those of you that played DAoC they used the exact type of engine I'm talking about.  They have you zone into cities and dungeons and that is it.  They do that to cut down on the latency of to many people in a zone and you lagging while in a city or dungeon.<br>
<br>
The only downside to no zones.. mobs can eat you! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uemmettblackmoore.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Emmett Blackmoore</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 23<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/11/01 3:53:07 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: SOE offers free RAM to SOL reviewers</span><hr size=1> <br>

I think lots of people think the same way as you man. I'm sure lots of people dont know how to install ram. Like I seen at like Compusa they charge you for the ram and an additional $40 bucks for installing it. So like for 512Mb it will be like $80. SoL is like another $30 i think.<br>
<br>
Anyhow I dont like it. I dont wanna pay $110 just to play some crummy expansion that has bugs and problems still. I need that money to buy X-mas presents now. Mabey after X-mas if i got money ill get it<br>

If you think people AREN'T influenced by such things, there have been times in the past, where &quot;news&quot; sites have chosen to not post articles that weren't flattering of EQ.  VI has given favorable treatment to websites/reviewers who have kept their content positive.<br>
Frankly, I'd think if computer gaming was something you were professionally involved in, and professionally reviewing, you'd already have enough ram.  Or be able to arrange to buy it.  For how &quot;cheap ram is&quot;, one's integrity and unbiased viewpoint would be of greater value.<br>

I wish I could find the quote, but a verant representative said that poll showed the average player had a good enough system that the upgrade they would need wouldn't be &quot;unreasonable&quot;.  But is that for the minimum requirements or the recommended?<br>

They can say it &quot;requires 128mb of ram&quot; up and down all day, but AO's memory leak seemed to hit a sweet spot with 512mb.  DAOC runs alright with 256, but 512 seems ideal.<br>
<br>
And it's not like you have to look at it as though you're buying the memory simply for the game...  It's not JUST games that gobble up resources like a strippper does $10 bills.<br>
<br>
Besides, in all honesty RAM is probably the EASIEST DIY upgrade that you can do.  If you needed instructions as to how to put it in, I'm sure anyone here would be more than willing to offer consultation.<br>
<br>
Either way, I'm not buying this upgrade.  I let my daoc and eq accounts both run out, I think I'll take a few months off.<br>
