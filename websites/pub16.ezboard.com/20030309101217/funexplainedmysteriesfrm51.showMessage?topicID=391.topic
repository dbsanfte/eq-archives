Spells for breaking up marriages, getting what you want, making someone like you, giving someone sores and horrendous pain for three days and nights? Good goddess!!  This is a ridiculous farce and I would suggest that anyone with any modicum of sense will steer clear of this claptrap nonsense!<br>
<br>
It annoys me (quite obviously) no-end knowing that there are more sites like this and unfortunately, there's even more people who BELIEVE the content therein.  Ack, I'm going to shutup now, I'm really incredibly jacked off right about now! Bah! (sorry about the rant but I feel I needed to share!!).<br>

Just today I was talking to my manager about witchcraft and on of the fist things he asked me was if i could fly on a broom.  I didn't over react or anything, I just explained to him that witchcraft is not about flying on a broom, or curseing your foes.  I honestly think Those of us that do know anything about witchcraft should get together and inform those that want to &quot;dabble&quot; in the craft.  That is what this forum is for, but we need to make more of an effort to inform others.  Do you have any ideas what we can do, or if we should do anything at all???? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uuromastyx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uromastyx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 43<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/8/02 12:17:34 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spells and Magic.com</span><hr size=1> Thats terrible. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I dont really know much about witchcraft, but I am very interested in it...I too thought of the 3 fold rule.

I don't claim to be an expert (and I would hate to think that anyone would think of me in that light!) but I am more than willing share the information that I do have (I know that you do as well)...  <br>
<br>
Actually, I also had a comment made (by some very uninformed individuals) at work the other day about Witchcraft.  I bit my tongue and put it down to the fact that unfortunately, they didn't know any better and it was a matter of social conditioning... then someone did the old &quot;wicked witch&quot; (think Wizard of Oz!!) laugh... Good goddess! I had to go get some water at that point!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :lol --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/laugh.gif ALT=":lol"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
At this point, I was wondering whether I should say something, or if I should take it higher.  So, I mentioned it briefly to someone I know in the HR dept. and basically said that in future, it is going to be something that needs to be addressed and comments like that could be construed as religious discrimination.  The person agreed with me and was also in agreeance that religion, no matter what it may be, as long as it doesn't affect the persons standard of work (which I can't see why it ever would), it shouldn't matter a jot.<br>
<br>
Apparently, the practice of Witchcraft is still illegal here in Australia (I only found that out through a very good friend recently!!! How archaic!) and the laws are being repealed at the end of the year.  <br>
<br>
As for whether we should do or say anything, I think that we can only do so much and whether individuals listen or not is entirely up to them.  It can be frustrating at times when you get things slung back in your face because the individual doesn't understand or isn't willing to accept your advice or answer to a question but, I guess you just have to accept it with good grace (and sometimes not so good grace! Still learning the art of patience myself! hehe!).  That's human nature for you! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Obviously there are such spells and people that believe and use them. To say they work or any work is like saying Christian or Islamic prayers work or eating the cornmeal from the temple of Rats works. Each religion has moral codes and ethics as well as dogma. <br>
<br>
My question is - is the 3 fold rule a belief, a warning, or an overall law created as deterence?<br>
<br>
If it is true then why would people create such spells? <br>

<br>
However, the Wiccan Rede clearly states &quot;An it harm none, do what thou will&quot;.  This is NOT dogma in any way shape or form.  Most people tend to overlook this or just want to get into spellwork without looking any deeper.   That's not to say that it's a bad thing, just that awareness of the consequences of your actions (in everything you do really) should be par for the course. <br>
<br>
Those who wish to perform harm to others through spellwork will reap what they sow, simple as that. Whether you beleive in karma rebounding (good or bad) is up to you.<br>
<br>
Spells are a form of prayer in a way.  Who is to say that Christian or Islamic or Hindu or Shintoist or Buddhist prayers do not work for the individual?<br>
<br>
Personally, I beleive that the three-fold law is damned fine advice!  Basically, whatever it is that you send out, will come back to you times three. <br>
<br>
Why do people do it? Because they are not thinking of the consequences and probably couldn't care less about it as long as they get whatever it is they are chasing.  Mostly petty, nasty emotions are involved with this kind of mindset....<br>
<br>
I know I tend to ramble, but I hope that kinda help answer your question!!!  <p><p><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/hmail.html" ><img src="http://hmail.flamingtext.com/hmail/01/03/23/flamingtext_com.23186827.gif" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/upsychodramaticfreek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>psychodramatic freek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 56<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/9/02 4:19:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spells and Magic.com (a bit of a long reply!)</span><hr size=1> Agreed....<br>

    I had an interesting conversation with a Christian friend of mine.  He claims that there is proof that Christain prayor works.  When he asked me of my beliefs he did not ctritise or put them down.   We had a strangly plesent conversation about it.  He did mention that I was one of very few nonchristians that would listen to his points of view and beliefs with an open mind.  I found his oppinion fastinating.   I may not believe in what he had to say, but at least I understant why he believes in Christianity.<br>
<br>

As for the three-fold thing.  I think it is similat to &quot;the golden rule&quot;.  the rule that most of our parents tried to teach us when we were little and not knowing of write from wrong.  &quot;Do onto thers as you would want done onto yourself.&quot;  Its all the same.  Just a way of trying to improve human nature... i suppose. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uconspiracycorner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>conspiracycorner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 20<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/10/02 4:04:13 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=10>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://d21c.com/conspiracycorner/dancingalien.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spells and Magic.com (a bit of a long reply!)</span><hr size=1> Thanks both.<br>

Summer's Death, that's what I suspected. Spells are like prayer. I wasn't implying they don't work, but it seems that religiously I wouldn't expect someone to pray for someone's death (who knows), and am questioning why harmful spells are created. I understand karmic rebound, but it also is a way to keep believers in line, or more eloquently put, is a moral code with consequence. A lesson shone through religion that can be used in everyday life. A 'Do onto Others' type of thing.<br>
<br>
I think too many people look at spells as what I call 'mumbo'. A cure all without actual belief. That would be like me asking a Christian congregation to pray for me or my ailing father (for example) and be an athiest.<br>
<br>
freek - I agree with your last statement and thanks for the opinion and details.<br>

I think people create spells like the 3 days of pain thing because they are blinded.  They only see what they are gaining.  They might not care about themselves.  It is possiable that they think 9days of their own pain is worth teaching somone else a lesson.  It may have something to do with feeling powerfull.... powerfull enought to take someone elses health, pride, or life. They may  just not believe in three fold.  As for the true reason people creat spells of that nature, I can not be certain.  I think it may differ with each individual.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usummersdeath.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Summers Death</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 127<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/18/02 10:28:19 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spells and Magic.com (a bit of a long reply!)</span><hr size=1> Anytime CC.

A lot of people just want the results from spells without worrying about the future consequences of same or about the underlying belief system and deities/energies being called upon to get their desired result.  <br>

It depends on the individual though and how much they are prepared to find out about these kinds of things beforehand.   <p><p><a Target="_top" href="http://www.flamingtext.com/hmail.html" ><img src="http://hmail.flamingtext.com/hmail/01/03/23/flamingtext_com.23186827.gif" border=0 alt="Image by FlamingText.com"></a></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=secondfyre>SecondFyre</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/1/02 1:34:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spellsandmagic.com</span><hr size=1> I don't want to start an argument with anyone (I hate doing that) but I always have to state my opinion. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :-) --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/3dsm.gif ALT=":-)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I personally think the threefold law is a belief...that doesn't mean it isn't real or fake. It just means some people don't believe in it. Thats fine. I personally don't believe in it. I don't follow Wicca, but I used to. And I know its not just a Wiccan thing. I also don't think there is anything wrong with the spellsandmagic website, but some things on there I also don't like. But that doesnt mean it doesn't work. The stereo types of witchcraft bother me too, but that also doesnt mean they aren't real. Who knows? Maybe witches really did used to fly on brooms? If I could I know I would! Well those are just my opinions. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/upsychodramaticfreek.showPublicProfile?language=EN>psychodramatic freek</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Mind Molester</span><br>  Posts: 179<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(10/2/02 1:13:53 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=391.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Spellsandmagic.com</span><hr size=1> thank you for your opinion.
