A link was posted with the rotations, great that helps, now add the link to the site, so planning raids for the little guys is easier. The thing is, the large guys think of the planes of Fear and Hate as small fry. They can clear it in no time and don't need the gear. They forget what it is like to be a smaller guild having a successful Hate raid. It is a similar feeling that they recieve for taking down a rotation mob. It is a milestone. <br>
<br>
While getting to go up with the big guys to get all the drops is nice, it doesnt address the fact that it isnt fun and it takes away from the joy and satisfaction of knowing &quot;we did this, ourselves&quot;. Remember what it was like when you had your first successful Hate raid and don't deny the smaller guilds the right to have that same satisfaction. <br>
<br>
Out of 4 fear raids ER has scheduled, 3 had CT up and 1 was jumped by two other guilds. I would say that the three CT rotation raids were handled very well by the IGB guild, BUT, we have yet to be able to say &quot;We did this, just us&quot;.  Accomadation needs to be made for this.<br>
<br>
<br>
I saw where it said you have your 24 hours to take the mob, if you don't you are out on IGB. And this is given as the reason why it is acceptable to over run another guild on this board. Well, why can't the IGB choose to say, ok since Fear is obviously reserved for that night on Dru Board,and little guild 12 has expressed the desire to do this alone, Uber Guild 11 is given an extra 24 hours.<br>
<br>
Look at the fear reservation for December:<br>
<br>
Plane of Fear<br>
12/07 - Pactus Aquilus (11/07) (link)<br>
12/09 - Crystal Oracle (11/09) (link)<br>
12/14 - Scourge of Shadows (11/23) (link)<br>
12/15 - Dragonspine Order (11/26) (link)<br>
<br>
That isnt alot of reservations. I would think something could be worked.<br>
<br>
Yes I realise this means CT stands for one more day. And this is just an idea, a suggestion. <p><center><img src=http://a1.cpimg.com/image/9B/78/6923931-131b-00C800FC-.jpg></center></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ulilhaer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Lilhaer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 141<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/10/01 7:05:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.animfactory.com/animations/people_m_z/miscellaneous/humpty_dumpty_sm_blk.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is simple, really</span><hr size=1> Why the wordy posts?<br>

There is one Inter-Guild Board and one Dro Board. All the IGB guilds know this board exists. To not cross-check between 2 boards (and post CT intentions) is lazy, inconsiderate, and totally lame. Any and all excuses are unacceptable.<br>

The fact is...take a point of view from IG...first attempt on CT...one day to do so (rules on IGB)...why must we be punished because we moved on our reservation (albeit, according to the other board, which FYI, can be viewed at www.hossguild.com/rotation)...Umm, but why must PA be automatically be awarded fear, us losing our chance at our first CT (who we dont get for weeks) because they are smaller and arent as strong as us? Whatever, I have yet to see someone depict the situation from both sides well enough for an accusation to be made...my point is....this is NEITHER guilds fault...stop accusing IG of being the big bad daddy here, we are not, we are quite enjoyable and we offered PA the opportunity to come up w/ us...they denied, life moves on...<br>

<br>
If you actually did reserve that particular date first, then you have half a point.  The other half of your point kind of falls flat in that nobody seemed to notify the DRO board so that PA wouldn't come along and think they were entitled to it.<br>
<br>
If, as I suspect, that date fell in your lap at the last moment and you had to use it or lose it, then your argument basically comes down to your needs being more important than theirs.  Wrap it up any way you like, *if* they had it first, you decided to just push them aside.

As for my personal grudges, I think I made that totally clear.  I have no grudge against IG or you.  I work with people from IG quite regularly, and I think if you ask any of them they'll vouch for me.<br>
<br>
My grudge is with the system that is currently in place which resulted in this unfortunate confrontation.  I'd like to see it discussed and changed.  I don't think that the thread should be closed because it seems to me that would just be further ignoring of the problem.<br>
<br>
I said it at least twice now.  I don't fault IG specifically any more than any other guild that has done the same thing when their turn for CT or any other rotation mob came up.  IG worked within the system that is in place for them, and I think that system could use some work. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uirdanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irdanar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 117<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/10/01 8:11:39 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://rpgpics.simplenet.com/EQ/Zerg4.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is simple, really</span><hr size=1> Cazic Thule is a 5-7 day spawn.<br>

24 hours is need to get him down to ensure the rotation moves along, period.<br>
<br>
No one likes to wait a month+ to get to a mob, would you?  Adding time to that rather than working out an accomodation with a smaller guild about to go in, by trying to extend to the next day it's free (and often there's 3-4 days in a row that PoF is reserved), affects more than just one guild.<br>
<br>
As far as 'country-club' syndrome for the IGB, I don't buy it.  You don't get into the NFL with Biloxi Baywatchers, you don't get into the NBA with Hoboken Hooters, what makes you think that something equivalent in EQ would be any easier?  It has nothing to do with trying to shut smaller guilds out, in fact, it's very much the opposite.  If it was there to shut you out,  Druzzil would be an absolute pit.<br>
<br>
Those of you who don't like the IGB, not much that can be done to change your opinion of it, since you've known nothing else.  You're like the boy in the bubble imho (a bit extreme, but you get the point), sheltered from the chaos the server could, <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  would</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> be without it.<br>
<br>
The IGB was created to deal with trakanon and Venril Sathir in the early days of RoK, for 3, yes, 3 guilds.  No one else could kill those mobs at that time, and rather than continue to have racing and other bs happening, the IGB came into place.  <br>
Did it have to expand to allow other guilds onto it?  No.  <br>
Did it though?  Yes.  <br>
Has it refused a guild admittance to it?  No.  <br>
Has it asked that guilds use some common sense about what they are capable of before coming there?  Absolutely.  <br>
Has any guild there been refused a rotation slot?  No.  <br>
Have they been encouraged to try other things first?  Yes in a couple of cases.  <br>
Was it malicious?  No.  <br>
Was it realistic based on experience?  Maybe.  Probably, imho.<br>
<br>
Is this going to change the way people like Epiphany feel about it?  Not likely, but I can hope. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15408">Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

I agree, the system can use some work...the IGB is not perfect, but it works quite well for the higher level guilds, but it fails to address certain things like Fear, Hate, Kael, whatever, these are considered FFA...But think about it, the IGB wasnt designed for this...it skipped the fact that certain things can conflict (Inno/Hate, CT/Fear, Tunare/PoG (when the time comes) etc)...How can these situations be fielded w/o redesigning and reconstructing the IGB process and w/o corrupting, the already difficult at times, system? <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uirdanar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Irdanar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 118<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(12/10/01 8:24:32 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://rpgpics.simplenet.com/EQ/Zerg4.GIF WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: This is simple, really</span><hr size=1> Through communication from the IGB guild slated for said mobs.<br>

Innoruuk is not on rotation btw.  Most IGB guilds only kill him out of boredom between rotations, and I can tell you for sure the only reason ML even goes into PoH anymore is for a couple of Epic drops that have eluded some members for 8+ months.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, it doesn't take much to work somethiing out with a guild slated for, say, CT.  Use tells, find an Officer, and get a resolution.  If you absolutely *must* have the plane to yourself, it's not going happen, I'm sorry.  Deal with it, or push it back a day.  However, I can tell you right now, going in there with one of those guilds is probably the best thing that can happen to your guild, especially your first 4-5 runs.  You're basically able to go in there with the Barry Bonds and Tiger Woods of Druzzil RO, take advantage of it, rather than being self righteous and vindictive on this board or others. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15408">Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

That seems easy enough.  Who had it first?  One suspects that this argument mightn't be put forward unless the much stronger response of &quot;we had it first&quot; was somehow unavailable.<br>
<br>
&quot;Excuse me Epiphany for criticizing your character, but ..&quot;<br>
<br>
Actually, no, I think I wouldn't excuse that if I were Epi.  That's pretty mild as personal shots go, but it's still an argument ad hominem, and it doesn't advance the discussion in any useful way.<br>
<br>
&quot;I am most certainly inclined to stand by my guild at all times&quot;<br>
<br>
And you accuse Epiphany of bias?  Good heavens, man.<br>
<br>
&quot;we made a mistake as well...we failed to reach the DRo board intime to stop the matter&quot;<br>
<br>
Here we close in on the nut of the matter: Are you saying that you posted your reservation to the IGB before PA posted theirs here, but that you failed to make this fact public, so PA had no way of knowing you were first?  That'd be an excellent point to make, if it's true, and it'd swiftly move the discussion past finger-pointing and onto the subject of how to improve the co-operating of these two apparently competing systems.<br>
<br>
&quot;but either way, any guild up for a rotated mob on IGB, will, and very rarely not, be there to take the said mob&quot;<br>
<br>
This passage appears to indicate a belief that IGB reservations trump those on the DRo board.  I can see how that'd be a controversial point, and if that's what people are thinking, it explains the relatively poor light-to-heat ratio present in this thread. <p>----------------------------------------<BR>Aanadien Jones, 60 Enchanter<BR>

So.<br>
<br>
If the IGB doesn't refuse admission to guilds who want to post, and IGB reservations are widely believed to take precedence over reservations here, why on earth would anyone post here rather than on the IGB?<br>

Something's fishy here.  Just for example, if Pactus Aquilus wanted to post for a PoF on the IGB, what's stopping them?  Could they do it?  If so, what's the whole problem here?<br>

If you're up for CT, POST HERE.<br>
<br>
Quint and Epi are 2 of my heroes so I know it isn't a personality issue.<br>
<br>
The flip side of this coin is, due to his pop schedule, CT is one of those &quot;Oh shite, we're up tomorrow&quot; mobs. But take the time and POST it anyway!<br>
<br>
And for those people who STILL dont get it, if ya cant take Ragefire/Sev, then dont think you deserve to be on the IGB.<br>

God why dont these people see the light!? <p><br><b>Lilhaer Blackdagger</b>

<br>
So they couldn't sign up at all.<br>
<br>
It has no DESIRE to care about those places, because unless it takes more than 12 people, the IGB doesn't particularly care about it (cept for Ragefire, cause no cleric deserves to have to camp that).<br>
<br>
I take some of the blame, because I misread the reservation (which has some REALLY old data) and saw an evening reign post from the month before.  So when someone from PA contacted me, I checked it out and sent them to the appropriate guild leader type.<br>
<br>
After that it became a matter of working things out.  Some people here seem to think it was a matter of 'who signed up first'.  It's not mutually exclusive folks.  We would have, 100%, preferred for someone ELSE to clear the stupid zone out.  But no way in creation were we gonna wait til 1AM for the chance to go up.  If PA had the forces, we woulda been all keen on them going up and clearing out, but they didn't.<br>
<br>
Offer was made, was refused.  Ok, we keep doing our work.<br>

What would that have changed?<br>
<br>
Just wondering what you think it would have changed.<br>
<br>
One way or the other SOMEONE was going to be going after CT because there was a patch and he was up.  Whatever guild had him would still have had to make a similar choice, and whatever guild have the PoF would have had to make a choice too.<br>
<br>
None of the facts would have changed, a similar offer of 'we will help you clear it' would have been made by the CT guild, and it would still have been up to the PoF guild to accept or reject it.<br>

<br>
Fact of EQ = CT owns all your Fear reservations<br>
<br>
Deal with it, work it out, see posts about it in time to come to an/any agreement with the guild doing it. This alleviates any last minute suprises.<br>
<br>
From a GL point of view, I remerber this from 2 points of reference.<br>
<br>
In the old days VH was surpassed only by SoN, Hoss, and ML. We would view others as folks that had to wait their turn.  We would bring guests (under 5).<br>
<br>
Later, months later, we reformed and many were above us, TR, IG, L'Malla, etc, and we just wanted that piece of the pie.<br>
<br>
When those folks wanted Inno or CT, they would contact us and work it out, and/or post it.<br>
<br>
The same communication should prevail now, I knew on that 2nd incarnation we couldnt do CT, and I couldn't begrudge those who could. So I bartered the best deal I could for my members on conflict nights, and told them to like it or leave and raked in the loot for them. Not the best situation....just the best I could get.  EQ IS survival of the fittest, bargain what you can, grow while can, and hope for the best.<br>

I see no problem with that?<br>

1 VH owned your ass BAD in its first incarnation, altho we used to read your boards when you caught up to us in plane runs and go &quot;MAN look how lucky their drops were!&quot; <br>
<br>
and 2<br>
<br>
I lurk here forever because EQ and the nice folks in it are part of my hobby time, I made alot of friends ( hopefully you are one of them) and also because ATM I got free time and NFL.com is a fast read LOL. <p><br><b>Lilhaer Blackdagger</b>
