Neither of us felt anything like it before, so we just stared at eachother after it happened.<br><br>Another time, we were kissing in a room (no windows were open), and we felt a breeze all around us, and then through us. With every breeze, we heard whispers.The only way to describe it is that it felt like we were a tree and the wind was passing through our branches. When we stopped kissing, we still felt the wind.<br><br>Then, weirder things started to happen. We went outside once and saw that trees seemed like they were smiling at us. It seems funny, and trust me, both of us thought we were crazy, but it was the most beautiful thing we ever saw, and then we found out that we were not like everyone else. Something was different about us. We often talk about how maybe in one of our lives we were a tree. One tree. There is no way to explain what we go through each day, but I'll continue to try. When we kiss, touch, make love, or anything that requires closeness, we begin to be one person. One knows what the other's move will be so we move in that same direction. But its deeper than that. There is a reason why we move in those certain directions. Its like the world is trying to tell us something. And just a couple of days ago, we thought about something. The way this beautiful force guides our movements is like writing. I mean, script writing. If you can imagine that. But its hard to make it out because we're so much into eachother when it happens. It happens all the time now. It used to happen every once in a while, but now it happens every time we're close. Its beautiful.<br><br>I hate to go on but I have to. Just a little more. The trees were number one. They communicated with us already. But there's more. The wind. The first time was what I described to you when we were in the room kissing. But that doesn't really count because the wind could not have entered the room. It was wind from somewhere else. Lately, though, the wind has been with us when we are close, also. We listen to it when we are kissing and it feels so intense; soft, when we are tenderly close; harsher, when we are more passionate.<br><br>Trees - 1<br>Wind - 2<br><br>There's one more and then I'm out. Don't mind, do you? I have to share this: We went on our honeymoon not so long ago and sat in the sand, building sand castles, and gazing into eachother's eyes when something started to happen. Everything around us seemed so unnaturally beautiful. Everything was unique, details sharpened. And the thing was, it was at night. So how could we see everything so perfectly? And then it happened. We heard breathing. Perfect rhythmic inhallations and exhallations. We looked all around us, wondering what's happened. But you see, by this time we were used to weird things happening so it was just a matter of curiousity at this point. We waited. We still heard the breathing but didn't catch on. And then we knew. Its amazing the way we just grasp something and comprehend something at exactly the same second. The moment was incredible. We looked towards the ocean and we looked at eachother and held the same exact expression. &quot;It's the water!&quot;, our eyes screamed. At that exact moment, as we felt the water breathing in and out, we began to breathe that way too (not voluntarily) and it felt like we were one with the earth, like something was connecting us to everything. Like our souls were connected to everything around us. <br><br>So that's all I wanted to say. I know its long, and I'm sorry for that, but it had to be expressed. I tell everyone about this, and of course, as you would expect, more people don't believe us than the people that do, but, really. When you're actually living this, who really cares what people think? <br><br><br>I'm curious to see what people have to say about my situation, so please respond. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.showPrevMessage?topicID=98.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.showNextMessage?topicID=98.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.emailToFriend?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.threadControl?topicID=98.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=98.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=98.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm65">UM Shake-Up!<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm66">SB's Test Forum<option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">Astrology<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesadministrationnoticeboard">Administrators Only<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm48">Ruth's Handbag...<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> -
