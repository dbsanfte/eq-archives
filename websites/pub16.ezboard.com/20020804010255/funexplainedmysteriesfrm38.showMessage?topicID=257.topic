My aunt died of Breast Cancer in 1996, and while she was alive, I used to write to her in between holidays when I saw her, and she was my godmother when I was baptised.  We weren't close in front of the family really because of petty family politics, but I knew she cared about me from her letters and I cared about her a lot, too.  While she was being cared for in her last months, everyone else in the family was let in to see her or to help out, but I was never allowed to see her until they invited a Priest over to give her her last rites and to talk to the family two days after my birthday.  Only then was I allowed into the room to see her, and two hours after I got back home with my parents and my brothers from my grandmother's house, we got a call from my hysterical grandmother letting us know that she had passed on.  For awhile, I felt like I had determined the date that she would die, but in a bad way...I blamed myself for her death.  But now that I think about it, the doctors said that she held out for a lot longer than she should have given her condition, so maybe she was waiting to hear from me one last time (she was comatose when I saw her, so I can't quite say she wanted to see me for one last time, can I?).  I had one dream a year after she passed away where I didn't see her, but I knew she was there, and it scared me.  <br><br>The dream I'm posting about scared me even more.  I woke up crying because of it.  Maybe because I still felt guilty about her death.  What happened in the dream was I was sitting with my fiancee looking through some photos I had taken recently (not for real, but in the dream.  I hate taking pictures normally, let alone showing them to people), and the first one was normal.  In the next one, the aunt that I talked about was standing behind me.  The next one, my aunt and another person I knew who died a couple years after that, and as I flipped through more and more pictures, more and more dead people who were related to me or were good enough friends of the family to be considered family themselves appeared, even people I knew were family but had never met before.  They looked out of place in the photos, a huge overbearing legion of them with solemn faces who had just materialized on the photos and weren't supposed to be there, judging on my reaction in the dream.  And unlike many other dreams when I feel uncomfortable or scared, I couldn't wake up before it got real bad for me.  I talked to my mom about it, and she said my grandmother told her that she had a dream where my aunt was sitting with my trying to talk to me, and I was crying. And she said it was around the same time when I had my dream.  <br><br>Sorry this is so long, but I felt that since I visit this place and haven't really contributed yet, I should write something.  <br><br>So...thoughts, ideas?      <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ugmt.showPublicProfile?language=EN>GMT</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle><i><font size=1 color=#BFD4FF>Monster from the id</font></i></span><br>  Posts: 287<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/1/02 9:19:58 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=257.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://mysite.freeserve.com/gmt3/pics/ujez.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deceased relative trying to contact me?</span><hr size=1> Many thanks for telling us about your dream<br>Although i am not up on this subject i am sure some of our members are and i will be waiting to see what they have to say on the subject<br><br>many thanks for your contribution.  <p><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#FFFFFF" link="#FFFF00" vlink="#00FF00"><p>Regards GMT</p><p><a href="http://gmtonthenet.ionichost.com/ezcontact.htm" target="_blank">How to contact me & where i go</a></p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uuromastyx.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Uromastyx</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Ragin' Cajun</span><br>  Posts: 110<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(8/1/02 7:09:06 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=257.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.denison.edu/~stocker/yinyan1.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Deceased relative trying to contact me?</span><hr size=1> Definitely sounds like she wants to make herself *known* to you...I go through the same things with my cousin who passed away in Dec.

Even the ones that you think about that happened before you were born or those you never knew. The feeling or concept of death is an overwhelming thing for you. Your heart seems to be crying out, 'Who's next?! Who's next?'<br><br><br>"I talked to my mom about it, and she said my grandmother told her that she had a dream where my aunt was sitting with my trying to talk to me, and I was crying. And she said it was around the same time when I had my dream."<br><br>Here I think your aunt is coming through your mom to tell you that everything is OK. She is bothered that you have been so sad and wants you to know that she is fine and better than she ever was. Since she can't get her message through to you personally. Then she is trying to get through to your mom.<br><br>I hope that this is helped in some way. I have a lot of real dreams involving loved ones passed on. When I get to talk to them I call them communion dreams. I believe they are real meetings with the ones you love that have gone on. I'm no dream expert, but I feel this is what this is all about.<br><br>Much sympathy on your aunt. <br><br><br> <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself.

Thinking about it now, many of the people who were in the pictures that I remembered after the dream were people who died of cancer in one form or another.  It's a horrible way to go, and maybe that's what scared me too.  I would like to think that my aunt was trying to communicate with me, and that's the way it felt.
