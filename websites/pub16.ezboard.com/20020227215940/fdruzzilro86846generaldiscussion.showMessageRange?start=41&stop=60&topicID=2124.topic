I'm not here representing Hoss. I'm not an officer, and what Hoss ends up doing re: IGB I have no control over.

There is no fight not to. We've already, multiple times, agreed  that my *personal* position and your guild's position are the same thing. It's silly to argue about it if we agree, no?<br>

However, I'm still not clear. What is inherently *wrong* with a non-exclusive NToV rotation? Don't tell me what a *better* case is, we already agree on that. <br>

I honestly don't know what to believe. This is the sort of thing someone who believes VERY strongly in their cause, to the point of not even entertaining compromise. It is also the stance of someone who knows that their unwillingness to settle creates a permanent stalemate, from which they profit, and in which they appear to have the morally superior position. I hope it's the former. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uelidroth.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Elidroth</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 19<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/6/02 11:55:14 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846generaldiscussion.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=2124.topic&index=42>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ah</span><hr size=1> Rohaise..<br>

Why do you feel you can dictate how the other guilds return to an IGB rotation system? For all of your cooperation rhetoric, you still come and try to lay down the law.<br>
<br>
I do like your idea about hosting the IGB on a neutral ground, but you've got to get over your self installed sainthood over the sleeper. It's done with.. time to move on and deal with TODAY.<br>
<br>
I don't represent Hoss leadership of course, but I think the general consensus is people would like a return to rotation so we don't have to play the spawn race game. I believe the intent of the North ToV only rotation was to initially get something handled that is really the major point of contention amongst the top 3 guilds (Hoss, ML, L'Malla) as well as get everyone talking again.<br>
<br>
So why not start there and then evolve the new IGB as necessary?<br>

<br>
And yes, it is the former.  We, as a guild, believe whole heartedly in getting back to a rotation system.  A full system.  <br>
<br>
We can negotiate which spawns will be rotated, etc on a new, neutral IGB, since things have changed since Hoss woke the Sleeper (Sont, Klan, etc.), and other mobs aren't really in the 'scope' of what the IGB was intended for.  But doing it for just one place to start?  No, it's basically all or nothing as far as ML is concerned.  And we'd prefer all by far. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15408">Sister Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

It seems to ME that the top 3 guilds are All in favor of some form of IGB. If for nothing else to get rid of the stupid spawn race. Most annoying thing in the world would be to have to race to a spawn and assemble so quickly that ya loose your bearings. Then ya fail to do the job and the guild that was waiting behind you (preped the whole time you were fighting) walks in and finish the job for you. Or as Lola put it, the EST people have to do the job because the PST people arent home from work yet. How fair is that to your own guild. Rotation on All mobs would be required tho to prevent the spawn race.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the NToV being the Main topic of ratation scheduleing... Well IG is just about ready to go into NToV. That would be 4 guilds ready to go. We may not be ready for Vulak, but we regularly kill Ikky the Venom. But with an IGB rotation in place, a &quot;requirement&quot; would have to be fulfilled before putting IG on that rotation. As proof we are capable of atleast giving it a good try. Even if totally failed.<br>
<br>
Personally I like the idea of saying &quot;If your guild can take Statue, Without help, then go for it and try Tormax&quot; That would be a natural progression. If ya can't take Statue, you Sure can't take Tormax. Simply too difficult, so not worth the effort of scheduling an attempt that is (most certainly) Sure to fail.<br>
<br>
I say have a meeting of the minds. L'Malla, Hoss, ML, and 2 other top end (Close to top end) guilds get together and make a desicion. Have an odd number of guild resp present so desisions cannot be stalemated. Simple voteing can resolve alot of issues when the voters are respected by each other. Then once it is determined weather a certain FFA guild is staying or desolving, make the intentions known. Names like Mythic Legion, L'malla, Hoss, Dlgoth, Drakky, Sirensa, Andaas, Baramos, Ciner, Ahjess, Furur will live beyond EQ. With that name, will carry a reputation. When EQ has gone and a new MMROPG takes its place many of you I suspect will continue on. Your friends will follow with you. I have used the name Tarkum since I was 13 years old, playing Pen-n-paper D&amp;D. Its up to YOU, the Tier 1 guilds that determine the fate of Dro. And how people that love to play MMORPGS might view you in the future<br>

That assumes that all those who enter the talks accept potential majority decisions beforehand. However, I don't think that's realistic, given the amount of stonewalling (Vindication FFA or bust, ML rotation our way or bust).<br>

Today should be good evidence either way on this point. I'm looking forward to seeing what happens.<br>
<br>
For those that aren't aware: NToV started spawning yesterday. Hoss went in and killed the only dragons that were up, and left for the night because none had spawned yet (due to ML's slow previous clearings, wide spaces in the spawns). Will ML &quot;leapfrog&quot;, Vindi style, now that they stand to benefit from it? Is it leapfrogging at all? Will there be issues when there are 2 or 3 guilds in NToV this evening? Who, if anyone has the &quot;rights&quot; to the zone, according to various previous statements about honoring NToV, or simple courtesy? <br>

I would think simple communication would be enough to resolve Those conflicts.<br>
<br>
A rotation of &quot;all&quot; &quot;uber&quot; encounters would resolve the spawn race And multy guild tension.<br>
<br>
Yes ML has the Largest guild on Dro. They can field over 100 people at one time. On Any given day they have atleast 50 people online during peak hours. why/how do they have a monopoly on NToV? Numbers, shear numbers. This is NOT a dig or flame at ANY other guild. But Numbers can make things happen. Every guild uses there Own tactics. MLs tactic ,IMO, is brute force by numbers. Hoss uses finess and strokeing. L'Malla, I don't know, I have never raided with them. IG trys to use finess same as Hoss. Less numbers require different stratagies.<br>
<br>
ML Can take 50 people to NToV before most guilds can muster 20. Numbers, simple numbers. Thats why ML has a monopoly on NToV right now. Dro is curently FFA and ML has the numbers. This isnt a kiss ass job for anyone. Its mearly a point of fact, and statement by ME.<br>

So while you might have dropped Jorl at 6pm EST ast weds, he can spawn as early as 8am EST weds. or as late as 4am EST Thurs. the following week.  Also, the variable is now larger given the fact that this will be the third non-patch spawning of NToV, adding to the variation of the spawns.  As for &quot;leapfrogging&quot; you, according to posts by your guild and other guilds, no leapfrogging is occurring if you all logged for the night.  We are playing by the rules established.<br>

Hoss went in and killed the only dragons that were up, and left for the night because none had spawned yet (due to ML's slow previous clearings, wide spaces in the spawns). Will ML &quot;leapfrog&quot;, Vindi style, now that they stand to benefit from it? Is it leapfrogging at all? Will there be issues when there are 2 or 3 guilds in NToV this evening? Who, if anyone has the &quot;rights&quot; to the zone, according to various previous statements about honoring NToV, or simple courtesy? <hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>
<br>
Today/tonight will have nothing to do with IGB or courtesy actually.  If Hoss was that concerned about courtesy, they would have stuck up for L`Malla the moment Vind jumped them claiming they left the zone.  Like Hoss did last night.<br>
<br>
&quot;spaced out spawns&quot;  I like that.  Blame us for the random factor on a respawn.  In case you weren't paying attention last week, dragons died in the normal order, in less than 8 hours, with the exception of Vulak (bastard used the opposite end on his timer, grr), and they died in a pretty standard order.<br>
<br>
And, as pointed out, it's widely held that Aaryonar is the gate keeper.  once he's dead, N ToV belongs to the guild that killed him to get in there  (this is something your own guild pushed for back during the original rotations btw).<br>
<br>
ML coming and killing Aary and working into the ring in the normal fashion would hardly be leapfrogging.<br>
<br>
Now, back to some other points:<br>
<br>
Mulrine, ML has been in N ToV twice since FFA.  Once was the scheduled rotation on the IGB, the second was in the FFA mode.  I'd hardly call that monopolizing it.  We want full rotations to be fair <!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  across the board</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->, not just to the 3 (atm) N ToV capable guilds.<br>
<br>
Why is this so hard to grasp?  Yes, we'll lose spawns by going to rotations, yet WE are pushing for full rotations, not JUST N ToV.  We want to see a fair shot for everyone, and a N ToV only rotation to start out doesn't guarantee that.  THAT's why it's not a good thing. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15408">Sister Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

<br>
BUT This is exactly the kind of stress that comes from NOT haveing an IGB Rotation. Dous Anyone really have fun with this kind of sheet? I mean, is it fun to argue on a board about Who did what and made so and so mad. So thay the &quot;Who&quot; can retaliat with other flames and remarks. And so begins another flame fest...<br>
<br>
A solution is in front of our eyes. Grasp it and use it! Save Everyone from certain headache and stress that Nobody wants. No matter What your reason for playing this game, the bottom line is &quot;Is it fun?&quot; Stress is not fun to me, is it for you? bantering at each other about what so-and-so did is not fun. When issues arise, make them known. Resolve them with a 3rd party if you have to! The IGB will resolve SOOOOO many issues between people and guilds. <br>
<br>
Use the solution we ALL know works. This message goes out to ALL Guilds.<br>

Rather than sit on a fence and try to lean whichever way the favorable winds blew, they could have chose to make a stand with people who felt wronged.<br>
<br>
They didn't, and they, by inaction, condoned the actions of Vind.<br>
<br>
I know it's a game, by a quote about WWII comes to mind, though I can't recall all of it.  Somehitng about &quot;They came for this person, and I said nothing, etc, then they came for me, and there was nobody left to say anything.&quot;<br>
<br>
I also find it funny about courtesy being mentioned by Hoss, considering the lack of it shown to the rising guilds regarding Kerafym, and ML in many, many occasions.  We've told Hoss actions speak louder than words, and so far, we've not seen any actions to repair any burnt or disassembled bridges.<br>
<br>
Hell, here we are fighting about doing N ToV only as a rotation, or everything to rotation.  ML wants fair across the board, Hoss wants fair for 3 guilds.  There may be nothing *wrong* witgh either way actually.  To ML, it's a matter of which is more *right*. <p><a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=15408">Sister Quintall Dys'Raydin</a><BR>

So why not start with an exclusive NTOV rotation is the repeated question I seem to hear.  Why not just go back to Full IGB rotation either ?<br>
<br>
IMHO, NTOV is the bargaining chip.  Plain and simple every Tier 1 guild wants to do it.  If L`Malla, Hoss, and Mythic Legion were rotating only NTOV, what is the incentive to go back to a full IGB to allow other guilds the opportunity to try Tormax, Vindicator, Dain, etc.. Correct, No incentive at all.  Thus the Tier 1 guilds theoretically (not saying that they would) could monopolize all Non-NTOV Ubers and limit the rate at which other guilds advance to NTOV.  They could also limit the playing experience of other guilds.  <br>
<br>
IMHO, not those of my guild, loot/control of ubers/selfishness is the only reason not to return to a full IGB rotation.   NTOV loot/encounters being some of the best in the game, why of course guilds want it on rotation NOW that Mythic has had it the last two times.  But it begs to ask a simple question, why not the other ubers then ?<br>
<br>
Mythic Legion, it is my belief, prefers to allow everyone on this server the chance and the opportunity to play end game encounters.  Hence we are sticking to full return to IGB, not a hey can we rotate these mobs to &quot;our&quot; advantage (wink wink nod nod).<br>
<br>
As for Hoss killing the two dragons last night.  Aary is considered the key to NTOV.  It would not be considered leapfrogging.  There is no IGB and the server atm is FFA.  So trying to compare it to Vindi leapfrogging L`Malla is darn right stupid.  L`Malla was on rotation, scheduled, and camped for the night in full expectations of enjoying finishing the NTOV encounter.  Vindi mugged them the next day.  Hoss in this instance is not on a rotation, concurs with FFA, and camped last night with full knowledge of what today would be like.<br>
<br>
As to the time of this writing, I do not have knowledge of the NTOV outcome for today (though I am positive it is in progress), but I hope Good Luck for whom wins it.  But keep this in the back of your minds; This NTOV contest will be every week, ad naseum until IGB is reinstated.<br>
