I'll start at the beginning of this whole mess.  It began about fifteen years ago when I was in high school.  My parents were the first owners of our house.  Nothing strange had ever happened until I was seventeen years old.  One day, for no reason, all the silverware in our hutch disappeared.  My mother blamed me, of course, but I had no idea what happened to it.  Two days later, and everyone pretty annoyed that we were eating with plastic dinner wear, the silverware re-appeared.  We found it in the refrigerator in the basement.  Mind you, someone opened that refrigerator at least once a day, there was no way you could miss it.  <br>
<br>
About a week later I got home from school and mom was ticked because my room was a mess and told me to clean it up.  When I got up there, all the posters on my walls were upside down, all the items on my dresser and desk were upside down, even the stuff in my closet was upside down.  I went back and told my mother that it wasn't funny to mess with my stuff and she said that she didn't do it.  When I took her into my room she swore up and down that it wasn't like that when she was up there earlier.<br>
<br>
About a week after that, I got up for school one morning and was in the bathroom brushing my teeth.  My mom came down the hallway and just froze.  All she could do was point at the back bedroom which had a very large and heavy sofa bed in it.  When I came out, the sofa bed was tilted on one side, the cushions and pillows that sat on the sofa were somehow suspended in air.  Mom lost it and called a priest, I grabbed my books and was very happy to go to school.  When I got home the priest was there.  We went into the back bedroom and the priest touched the sofa and the pillows and cushions dropped to the floor.  It took myself, my dad and the priest to get the sofa back down in this tiny room.  After inspecting the rest of the house, the priest looked at us and said that I was doing this with my mind.  At that point I thought the priest was out of his mind and didn't buy it, neither did my parents, I'm not some male version of Carrie!  Anyway, the priest blessed the house and everything stopped.<br>
<br>
Three years later I was home for the summer from college.  My girlfriend and I were sitting in my parents driveway just talking in her car when I started to get this really strange feeling.  I was looking down the driveway when I saw something peek around the corner of the back of the house.  It looked like a short person wearing a black hooded cloak.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and I didn't want to freak out my girlfriend so I just tried to act like I didn't see anything.  I kept watching the corner of the house and this thing kept peeking around the corner, wait a few seconds and then go back behind the house.  I peeked around the corner one last time, then floated very fast to the middle of the driveway and then shot up in the air out of sight.  My girlfriend jumped, started the car and drove off.  When she finally stopped I asked her what she saw.  She validated everything I seen and felt.  <br>
<br>
A couple of days later my girlfriend and I were going to a party at a friends house.  I wasn't supposed to pick her up until 7 but she called me in a panic at 6, asking me to come over now.  Her parents weren't home and something was banging on her doors and windows and she was scared.  I left immediately.  When I turned on to her street, my car radio started changing stations by itself.  I pulled in her driveway and ran up to the door.  My girlfriend opened the door and said the banging stopped as soon as I pulled in the driveway.  She looked down and in between the door and the screen door were 3 pieces of candy called Le Bon Bon by Chere'.  We tried to make a joke that the little black guy had a crush on my girlfriend.  <br>
<br>
She finished getting ready and we got in the car to go to the party.  As I was pulling away from her house, my girlfriend was putting on a necklace.  Her hands were behind her neck.  All of a sudden the passenger window, which was halfway down started shaking violently. It was moving so much that my girlfriend had to move out of the way to avoid getting hit.  I'm surprised the glass didn't shatter.  I thought the window came off the guides so I pulled the car over and checked the window.  I couldn't move it, there was nothing wrong with it.  <br>
<br>
When we got to the party we were in no mood to be there.  We went outside to be away from everyone.  The host of the party came out to see why we were acting so strange.  With reluctance, we told her what had been going on.  She thought we were nuts.  Then one of our friends joined the three of us.  He looked at the host and said the candy she put out was pretty good.  She said she didn't put out any candy.  He showed her the wrapper, Le Bon Bon by Chere.  Just then I started getting that same feeling that I got that first night in my parents driveway.  My girlfriend felt it too.  We looked at the big tree in front of the house and the black hooded thing was standing by the tree.  All four of us saw it.  It just stood there.  This time I could tell it was between three to four feet tall and was wearing a black cloak with a black hood that covered it's face.  It shot up in the air, like it did before and was gone.  The four of us just stood there, speechless.<br>
<br>
The host of the party had a friend that was a psychic and my girlfriend and I decided to go see her for help.  When we walked into the room the psychic looked at me and asked me who the man from England was.  I didn't have any idea.  Then she asked me who the man from Georgia was.  Again, I had no idea.  The psychic told us that whatever this thing was, it was sent to us and gave us the name of a white witch that should be able to help.  We left and I went home.  That night I was talking to my mother and asked if we had any relatives from England or Georgia.  She said no, but let me in on a story about my father that I never knew.  It seems that when my dad was born, his father left.  My grandmother pulled a Scarlet O'Hara and vowed to never be poor again and started dating all these rich guys for their money.  One of the guys she dated was some automobile executive from England who really took to my father.  He wanted to adopt my father because he didn't like the way that my grandmother treated my dad.  My grandmother would push my dad from relative to relative to live.  He would only see my grandmother once every few months.  When this executive from England approached my grandmother about adopting my dad, she broke up with him and they never saw each other again.  A few rich guys later, my grandmother started dating a wealthy man from Georgia.  He too, took a strong liking to my dad and didn't approve of the way he was being raised.  This guy had some shady ties to some rough people and had my dad kidnapped and brought to Georgia.  He was going to try to adopt my father.  My grandmother's brother was in the mob.  He got a couple &quot;family&quot; members to rough up this guy and get my father back.<br>
<br>
Anyway, armed with this new information, we went to see this white witch.  He said that this black thing was sent to us but he could put a protective circle around my girlfriend and I.  The only stipulation was that we could not discuss any of these events outside of a church, and that's exactly what we did, until one night.  <br>
<br>
Everything stopped for about a week.  My girlfriend and I were out on night and we wanted to discuss the events.  We went to her church, which was open and sat in one of the pews.  We started talking when we both started to get that strange feeling.  I looked up at the alter and what I saw made me freeze.  There was a tall, very thin, older man, dressed in a grayish suit which looked like it was from the early part of the 20th century.  He was skeleton thin and had this angry look on his face.  I could see through him but the only way I can describe it is he kept fading in and out.  One second he was almost barley visible and the next second he looked like he was almost solid.  He also had this glow about him.  Eventually he just faded away.  I looked at my girlfriend, who was as scared stiff as I was and asked if she saw the old man.  She said that all she saw were lights that kept fading in and out.  <br>
<br>
Well, things kept on happening and the black thing kept showing up everywhere, at parties, at our homes, even at my girlfriends sister's house.  Many of our friends witness this thing.  Then, as suddenly as it started it just stopped, and we never saw it again.<br>
<br>
Three years later I was living in an apartment in college.  My mother had passed away six months prior and I had broken up with my girlfriend.  I had left home on bad terms with my father due to his problems with alcohol, he was pretty abusive while I was growing up and I just couldn't deal with him anymore.  I had lived in this apartment with a roommate for a while and suddenly things started disappearing and showing up in different places.  Both of us thought we were just getting forgetful until one night, when we had just gone to bed, we heard voices in the living room.  When we got up to check it out nobody was there.  This continued for about a week.  After that the voices continued but we noticed that the temperature would drop in the apartment to the point where we could see our breath before we heard the voices.  That continued for a week and then an odor started coming with the drop in temperature and the voices.  It smelled like someone lit about 100 packs of matches.  This kept going on until one night I couldn't take it anymore and I stood in the living room and started praying.  A clock that was sitting on the coffee table slid off  and hovered for about a second before it hit the floor.  Then out of nowhere I saw something fly past my face and hit the wall behind me.  My roommate went to see what it was and it turned out to be a butter knife.  <br>
<br>
We weren't getting any sleep and we were both stressed out so we got in touch with what I call &quot;professional ghost busters.&quot;  These people came over with all this equipment and set it up in our apartment.  This one lady came up to me and asked me if I had just lost a relative and I told her my mother had just passed away.  Her and the rest of the team said that she wanted to go see my mother's grave.  <br>
<br>
My mother is buried in my father's family plot.  Everyone from my dad's side of the family is buried there.  As we approached my mother's grave, the lady turned and went over to my great aunt's grave and kept saying, &quot;There's a lot of rage here.&quot;  She wanted to know who she was and I told her.  I also told her about how my great aunt murdered her married lover back in the 1930's and how the family also suspects that my grandmother didn't committed suicide but possibly was murdered by my great aunt.   <br>
<br>
We went back to the apartment and the group of people started doing whatever they needed to do, it really didn't make any sense to me.  I did hear one lady say that she need to move the energy in the room and proceeded to go to each corner in the apartment and mumble something and wave her hands in the air.  When she got to one corner of the living room she stopped and said that there was a hole there and that were they were coming through.  The team of investigators told my roommate and I to go about our business as usual and go to bed at our normal time.  We got ready for bed and just started to go to sleep when I started to smell that strong smell that always started things off.  We both started screaming for the investigators to get in the bedroom and that really is the last thing I remember.  The next thing I knew, my bed was in the middle of the room and all the investigators were standing around me with the lights on.  The one lady told me that everything was over and instructed my roommate to not tell me what had happened.  Of course my roommate told me a couple of days later.  When the investigators came in the room I started saying it hurts over and over.  My roommate said that it looked like I was being lifted by my waist and I was bending backwards to the point to where the back of my head was touching my feet.  I stayed that way for about 20 minutes while the investigators stood around and did stuff.  I don't remember any of this.  Nothing happened after that.  I ended up moving out of the apartment about a year later when my roommate lost it and tried to commit suicide, but that's a different story.<br>
<br>
Three years later I had moved back from college and moved in with a friend of mine who was recently divorced with two small kids.  Things were fine for the first couple of months but then things started to disappear and reappear in strange places.  Then one night, my roommates youngest daughter got up and came into the living room and told us that the little boy under her bed kept waking her up.  We thought she just had a bad dream and calmed her down and sent her back to bed.  This continued for the next couple of nights.  Her daughter had recently got a kids alarm clock and her mother was teaching her how to set her alarm clock for school and how to wake herself up with the alarm clock.  My roommate would set the alarm clock for 7:00 a.m. and her daughter would go to bed.  The first night was fine, but the second night she did this, the alarm started going off at 10:00 p.m.  We thought that maybe the alarm was set wrong, but the next night we checked to make sure the alarm clock was set for 7:00 a.m. before her daughter went to bed.  At 10:00 p.m. the alarm went off.  My roommate scolded her daughter for changing the alarm but her daughter insisted that the boy under her bed did it.  It was at this point that I told my roommate about the past trouble I experienced and that if it was the same thing, these problems would only get worse, and they did.  Closet doors would open and bang shut.  One even broke off it's hinges.  The little black hooded thing started showing itself to everyone in the house and people who came over said that they seen it.  One of our friends said that while she was in the basement, she saw an old, thin man dressed in an old time suit behind the bar.  There was also a smell of fish cooking that couldn't be explained. <br>
<br>
We ended up calling another team of investigators to look into the problem.  The second they walked into the house they said that there was a big problem but they could take care of it.  They told us that we couldn't be home while they did whatever it was that they needed to do.  They told us to come back in a couple of hours.  When we got back they told us the problem was fixed.  Nothing ever happened from that point on.<br>
<br>
Again, three years later, I had just started dating the person I am with now.  I had moved in to their house so my fiancee and I could save some money to get our lives started.  After a couple of months things started to disappear and turn up in strange places.  I knew what this meant and I told my fiancee of the problem.  I wasn't taken too seriously.  Then one night, I woke up to go to the bathroom. As I was leaving the bathroom and as I stepped out into the hall, I saw a black figure standing at the end of the hall.  I didn't look like the little black figure from before and the instant I saw it I knew it was my fiancee's father who had died in the house.  I had this strong feeling that I wasn't wanted there.  I ran back to bed and dove under the covers.<br>
<br>
A couple of weeks later, early in the morning, I half woke up out of a sound sleep.  I had a feeling that something was in the bedroom with my fiancee and I.  I was sleeping, spooned around my fiancee, so I picked up my head and looked over to the closet.  This was by far the scariest thing I have ever seen.  Crouched in the closet was a African American man wearing a plaid flannel shirt, just staring and my fiancee and I.  When I looked at him he just stared back at me with this look of hate on his face and then he slowly started grinning the most evil grin I have ever seen.  My heart was racing but I laid back down and kept thinking to myself that it was only a ghost, nothing more.  When I looked back, he was gone.  <br>
<br>
After my fiancee and I got up I we were in the bedroom talking.  My fiancee started to tell me about this bad dream he had that morning about this black man squatting in the closet.  My heart froze and I asked if the man was wearing a plaid flannel shirt.  He was!  My fiancee thought that it was a dream and that it wasn't real.  We saw the exact same thing.<br>
<br>
Things continued to disappear for a while but it just stopped.  Then about three years later, things started disappearing again.  Everyone in the house was losing stuff and everyone kept smelling cherry tobacco.  My fiancee's father used to smoke a pipe with cherry tobacco.  My father had just passed away about a year before.  I was down in the basement doing laundry one night.  When I went to turn around to go upstairs, the black man that I saw in the closet was there, blocking my way to the stairs.  This time he was half standing and would move in the same direction that I would move to get around him.  I finally just closed my eyes and stated yelling for my fiancee.  When I opened my eyes, he was gone.<br>
<br>
Three years have passed again and my fiancee and I have finally bought our house.  Turns out, we bought the house I grew up in.  My sister lived here with her husband since my dad passed away and we bought it from her.  We've only been here since April.  About a month after we moved in, things started to disappear and reappear in strange places.  The floors creak in the middle of the night and doors rattle.  Our cat, who follows us to bed every night, will suddenly start watching something on the bedroom ceiling.  The cat will walk around the room staring at the ceiling and it looks like he's following something that is floating in the air.  This will go on for hours.  And that felling that I used to get every time that little black thing would appear, well, I feeling it again and I saw the little black hooded thing tonight.  Please someone, tell me what I can do to make this stuff stop!  I can't go through this anymore.<br>

I read your post and it sounds like a combination of poltergeist phenomena, visitations of entities (could be spirits of those who have past or other entities) and in a the case of what happened in your bedroom while the ghost busters where there ... perhaps even possession.<br>
<br>
It sounds as though the violent past family history may come to play in this. I know you've had a priest there to bless your home many hears ago regarding the sofa incident. Have you entertained the thought of an exorcism by one who really knows what they are doing?<br>
<br>
I would have them use sage to smudge every inch of where you're living now and do incantations to rid your place of whatever is there.<br>
<br>
So much has happened to you over the years and you've held up so well under these terrible circumstances. I hope that something can be done to rid you once and for all of all that is happening to you.<br>
<br>
Please keep us posted. Okay?<br>

These events seem centered around you. No matter where you live they happen, so the dwellings you are in aren't connected. You seem to take the problems with you. The Catholics practice a thing called rebaptism. You might check into that. Sometimes when we aren't baptized our aura can have holes in it. Becoming baptized helps complete the aura, so nothing can come through. If you are not Catholic then just being baptized by someone from your faith should do it. But I would not rule out the exorcism. It could make things complete in locking out whatever has been bothering you since you were 17. And there is something there. You are not crazy. God bless you and be with you. <p>"I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself. A bird will drop frozen dead from a bow without ever having felt sorry for itself.--D.H.

Here is a link about what to do: <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/smudging.html">www.crystalinks.com/smudging.html</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--><br>

I've seen smudge sticks available in many places, but contact an herbalist.<br>
<br>
However, I'm curious about the black hooded creatures.  <br>

Also, if they thought it was your mind doing all this, couldn't you banish these demons?  I mean, if you start to get that strange feeling again, try to turn it around.  Much like when you are in a nightmare you will yourself to wake up.<br>
<br>
Good luck to you.  It sounds like you've had some very disturbing experiences.<br>

A friends grandparents lived there. I myself was asleep in a bed, when the foot of the bed was lifted from the floor and shaken gently up and own. My friend was asleep in the loft one evening, and tells of an old woman covering him with a blanket. His cousin, then 4 or 5, walked into the kitchen one day, and asked who the old woman  standing in the hallway was. An investigation by those of us present revealed no one else in the house. His grandmother tells of waking up one night to find a hooded figure at the foot of her bed. The figure flung forth and above what she describes as a cover of swirling colors. She closed her eyes and began to pray, opening her eyes to find the figure gone. Finally, as My friend and I were telling His grandmother the tale of a slain member of a satanic church in a nearby town and the cryptic epitath on his tombstone. upon finishing the recital of what was written on the stone, a living room window blew outward and shattered upon the porch. It has been many years since I set foot in that house. and as I am getting chills from writing this, I have no desire to return there anytime soon. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#333333><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usadshadows.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sad Shadows</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 103<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(7/24/02 4:21:48 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm38.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=243.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://images.honesty.com/imagedata/6/1/4/17382614.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Black Hooded Spirits and More</span><hr size=1> I am not even going to attempt to logically explain what is happening to you.<br>
This &quot;thing&quot; in black sounds too familiar to me. ( see my post under the angel of death)<br>
The black spirit that has haunted my family seems to want to warn us. <br>
Yours seems to want to harm you.<br>
Does he carry something in his hand? Just wondering.<br>
I know little to nothing about these things but I have a feeling and just for the heck of it I am going to go with it.<br>
You need to bind this spirit. You need to command it in the name of God to return to the place the higher spirits have prepared for it. you must, Command it! Don't ask it, tell it, demand it! <br>
I think your mother had the right idea with the priest but the priest had too little knowledge to deal with it.<br>
Somehow a portal was opened that let this dark spirit free. It must be returned and it must be returned in the name of God or Jesus.<br>
There is no magic to get rid of it. There is only faith. Be safe in the knowledge that God can protect you.<br>
and no I am not some bible banger <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

peace is no further away than faith.
