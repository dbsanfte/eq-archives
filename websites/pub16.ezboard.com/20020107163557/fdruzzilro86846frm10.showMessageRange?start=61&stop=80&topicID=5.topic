     First off, my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims in these detestable acts of terrorism by the cowardly. <br>
<br>
Pickelarm,<br>
   You are a complete idiot! How dare you be happy that this happened even one tiny bit. There can be no satisfaction in the deaths of innocent civilians. I don't care how disenchanted you are with the federal government. Although, you being just 18, how much ill will can you have possibly experienced at the hand of our government at your age? What of the little children that kissed their mom &amp; dad goodbye this morning before school, only to never see them again. What of the grandkids that will never be able to go over to grandma &amp; grandpa's house again? Brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, friends, etc. were all lost over nothing more than some idiotic zealot going after an institution, running over individuals in the process. <br>
Also, it's the Geneva Convention you moron! Each soldier in the military, at one point or another, gets a card with the rules of engagement on the back of it. <br>
And finally, you had mentioned (in your broken, illiterate, hillbillyish language,  you try to pass off as English) taking over oil fields so the Americans can get rich? Well you dumb ass, have you never heard of Prudhoe Bay, the North Slope, or the Alaskan Pipeline? I didn't think so! Now, take your diaper wearing, lollipop licking, cand ass back to the books to get your shit straight before you come off with another post straight out of your ass!<br>

I know it sounds bad, but I hope we bomb the living shit out of whatever country did this to us. I'm not a politically correct person at all, but I know I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of the Middle East, who are nothing but a pain in the ass for the entire planet. Props to Indecisive... I agree with him 110%.<br>
<br>
I'm not a racist, or a bigot. But I'm sick of my own country getting the shaft, being the older-brother for every god damn third-world country in the world. Let's start putting Darwin's theory of &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; to work. If those warring countries want to blow each other off the face of the Earth, by all means let them do it. Don't get involved.<br>
<br>
Oh and PickelArm... get a fucking clue. I'm sad to know I'm your age. Maybe you'll appreciate how GOOD you have it as an American when you move out of your basement and mommy and daddy stop signing checks for you.<br>

Be careful with the talk of pushing buttons and nuking the Afghani people to hell.  These are people with lives and children just like those who were murdered today.  The citizens did not initiate the attack.  They have been taught that America is evil and that it stands against their own ideals.<br>
<br>
Realize that America has, in some places, an image of being a spoiled bully which pushes its ideology on other countries; believing that it is better than all other countries and that they should all be more like the States.  Whether it's propaganda, or reality doesn't really matter.  Talk like that can only serve to reinforce that image.<br>
<br>
Don't worry that people somewhere are rejoicing.  Ignore them (and Pickelarm).  Focus on how you can help the matter where you are.  Don't get trapped in thoughts of revenge and retaliation.  War begets war; violence begets violence. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 268<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/11/01 9:22:56 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~derek/201.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: RL: Terrorist Attacks</span><hr size=1> &gt;&gt;War begets war; violence begets violence. <br>
<br>
So are you saying that we should do nothing about this? Maybe Christ had the true ability to turn the other cheek but I sure as hell never claimed to. We must punish those responsible for this horrific act and demonstrate the world our resolve, or else you'd better get used to this, because it will happen again if we show weakness in the face of their brutal act. Terrorists only respect use of force, lip service does no good. We need to hunt them, find them, and kill them. Its just that simple. I dont think some of you realize what a pinnacle event this is in U.S. history, and its potential impact on our nation and our foreseeable future. If we try to go back to &quot;things as usual&quot;, we are doomed to suffer more attacks.<br>
<br>
I think President Bush said it correctly, we will hunt these terrorists down and will not distinguish between the terrorist and the nation who harbors them. For the last 10 years or so our intelligence and special operations (aka Special forces community) resources have been sidelined, muzzled, and not allowed to really do the job they were trained for. I think that will all change after today. If you want to punish these terrorists, bring them to trial, it is not going to be done with a cruise missle. Its going to be done using our intelligence and special forces assets. Woe to the sorry MotherF****Rs that will be on the recieving end of that effort. They will be put down, or brought in.<br>

Our airports have tightened security as alot of American planes are landing here. The American's onboard that are landing here are only told about what happened as they land and are taxi'ing around. Needless to say they are all shocked and speachless, as are all Australian's. Everyone at my work place is standing around a big screen watching the news shaking their head.<br>
<br>
Seeing people jump from the World Trade Centre because they were trapped on a floor one hundred stories high that was on fire and full of smoke is heartbreaking. The latest I have heard is that this tragedy maybe the single biggest loss of life in one day for America. 21,000 dead in some war previously. This tragedy may dwarve that figure.<br>

I hope this tradegy is met head on with some cool, quick and calculating retaliation tactics that only involve the criminal terriorists that did this. I take a look at Afganistan right now and see that this is probably not going to happen  <br>

Many are pointing to Osama Bin Laden.  If this is the case, along with the known horrendous acts he has organized earlier, he reminds me of a modern day Hitler.  Just think of it this way.... How many lives would have been saved if Hitler would have been assasinated.... I really don't care if countries in the middle east find the US evil.  Guess what- before all this shit I didn't like them very much, but I felt for them when i heard of tragedies that killed innocent people over there.  These are humans just like us, lives with families, souls, and histories... <br>
 <br>
To have them rejoicing over the lives of innocents cut short, to have them rejoicing that people were jumping from unbelievable heights to their deaths, to avoid being burned alive, to have them rejoicing that the world will suffer economically, to have them rejoicing that thousands are injured, suffering, worrying, and mourning... that just to me isn't human....  To have anyone that would not find sacred the human life, especially those of the innocent.. People whos hearts were stone to all of this such as hitler, osama, and now it seems those celebrating people of the middle east are doing...   They've lost all respect and the core sense of humanity in my eyes, and this will only continue if we do nothing...  This was in no way justified, nor could it ever be. Though it might sound hypocritical to some, that kind of a behavior is a taint to the world, and the their celebration of suffering warrents them to suffer as well.  I hope swift action is taken against them, to set as an example and prevent them from doing something to this or any scale again... because you know this will keep happening again if nothing is done, if not to the US, to another country...  <br>
<br>
It simply disgusts, horrifies, and saddens me deeply.  My condolences go out to those suffering.

If you watch the news, you watch people who provoked no attack upon themselves falling out of building, running for their lives, and risking their lives to save others.  Reports are at this point over 300 fire/police officers are missing and area hospitals are at capacity.  If the impact of the plane killing the thousands of people who had just arrived to work was not enough, the planes were passanger planes, carrying more people who all died.<br>

<br>
You want to know the real deal about what poisons those Middle Eastern kids?  First of all, get your facts straight, they are Kurds, either a religous or geographical based ethnic group for people of either Turkey or Iraq (I don't know which).  The ones that are poisoning them are the damn Iraqi's!  Yes, Saddam Hussein is killing all those kids with poisoned water supplies, Serin, and other gases.  As for no media coverage, it is brought up periodically, but since Hussein does NOT adhere to UN sanctions, there is nothing we can do politically to remedy these atrocities.  Same thing with the Serbians and Bosnians.<br>
<br>
US doesn't use nerve or biological agents, it's against the Geneva Convention.  We happen to obey the Geneva Convention and are one of the few countries that do, if you don't believe it, Desert Storm was a good example.  The Iraqi prisoners were relatively well taken care of.  The pictures you saw of the captured American pilots always seemed to look beaten, hmmm...  In fact, throughout the history of US conflicts the US has, for the main part, adhered to the Geneva Convention. It's usually the other side, whoever they were, that didn't.  This is also why we have the Uniform Code of Military Justice which allows any soldier, if given an illegal or immoral order, the right to refuse such an order.  And don't bring up Vietnam, I wasn't there and neither were you, from all accounts it was screwed up and screwed people up emotionally and mentally.  <br>
<br>
Regarding Embargos: gee, you got me there.  The only real embargo in existence, that I'm aware of, is against Cuba, a communist country that allowed Kruschev to park nukes 90 miles off the coast of Florida.  It's been a standing embargo since the 60's.  However, it has not affected humanitarian aid, which we have lent in past years for disaster relief.  <br>
<br>
BTW, as it was said before, the Israelis ARE US allies.  The US was instrumental in obtaining that area of land that is now called Israel.  Oh, and Israel is NOT a chief exporter of oil, that is Kuwait, the same Kuwait that we went to war in order to liberate to its' preferred form of government.<br>
<br>
Sweat shops: that's a problem all over.  US businesses do NOT condone this and attempt to stop it wherever possible.  These businesses are usually contractors to US companies and the corporations have no idea about conditions or labor.  However, a fact you overlooked was that NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) has breathed new life into a much impoverished Central and South America, but we can't watchdog all of these companies in all those nations.<br>
<br>
As for the small Asian island, I can only think of two: the Philippines, who have their own government, and Taiwan which was a BRITISH protectorate and, incidentally, doesn't want to go back to Chinese rule.<br>
<br>
While I admire your fervent defense of your beliefs, your facts are somewhat incorrect.  Perhaps if you can produce some sources...please feel free to continue.<br>

We must use the awesome power at our disposal to see that it never happens again.  Together, we will succeed.  But I implore you all to be cautious with our thoughts and beliefs as they easily translate into our interaction with those around us. It is us, the literate, communicating populace that must advocate reason and a swift, accurate and decisive retaliation against these dishonorable cowards.<br>
That said I believe that there is no punishment to befit this crime.  Death comes on swift wings, even for the deserving.  Were there a way to transfer the pain of every person affected, it would still not be enough to punish these criminals.  <br>
Thank you for reading this, I have had a difficult time trying to work out my thoughts on this tragedy.<br>

This is a clear indicator that the WORLD (not just the<br>
US) MUST take action.  Not just retaliation on this, BUT<br>
exterminate ANY terrorist racemes that threaten any<br>
allied country in the free world.  Anger, bitterness, <br>
confused and sadness is how I feel.  I pray that these<br>
terrorist are brought to swift and lethal justice, and I<br>
hope everyone does not give unjust prejudice towards<br>
people of different cultures, simply because the color of<br>
their skin may be the same as the accused. (or rumored<br>
accused) Clear thinking, and then swift action.<br>
<br>
I will pray for all the families in the New York &amp; Washington<br>
areas, the people on the planes, and I pray for us all.<br>

<br>
Historically you are not correct. The U.S had little if nothing to do with the founding of the nation of Israel. If you want to &quot;blame&quot; a nation for this issue then you must look at Great Britain, since they were occupying Palestine post WWII and had to deal with the conflicting zionist movement and the promises they made to the palestinians. <br>
<br>
I took an entire 12 credit hour 400+ level history series on the Arab-Israeli conflict and whats going on over there is an extremely difficult situation to understand and remedy IMO. But the U.S had nothing to do with the forming of the state of Israel. They formed their state in 1948 and immediately successfully defended their fledgling nation from the combined military might of every neighboring arab nation.<br>
<br>
For a long time I have struggled to figure out where I stand on the Arab-Israeli issue. To this day all I can say is &quot;I dont know, I just know the facts&quot;.<br>

One person that I know was 2 blocks from the WTC towers when the impacts and explosions from the planes came. He was supposed to tour those buildings in the afternoon. There is nothing left for him to tour...<br>
<br>
My heart goes out to all who have suffered in any way from this horrible act and I give my thanks to so many from around the world that have offered support to the United States in this time of crisis. It is a testament to the strength of the human heart and spirit that so many people have responded with such willingness to aid in whatever way they could.<br>
<br>
&quot;Today, our nation saw evil, the very worst of human nature, and we responded with the best of America, with the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could.&quot; <br>
