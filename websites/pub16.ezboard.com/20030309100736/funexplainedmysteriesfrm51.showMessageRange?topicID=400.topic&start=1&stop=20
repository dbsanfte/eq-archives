You should try doing your own &quot;craft&quot;...  Maybe, when he has a day off, try to recreate your first date... wear something sexy, or even just make him his favorite dinner.   <br>
<br>
you can't expect things to go back to the way they were... expecially not right away.  Matters of the heart take time.  And if, no matter what you do, he still insists that there is no hope of loving you again... maybe you should try to understand that it might be right for him to move on, or take a break.  If you truely love him, you will do whatever is best for him.... remembering not to hurt your self too much in the process.<br>
<br>
Witchcraft and spellcraft are dangerous.... expecially when it comes to love spells.  If someone does a spell to make him love you again, it will only cause more harm.  Everytime he looks at you it will raise questions like &quot;does he really love me?&quot;  &quot;Am I the reason he is still here?&quot; and &quot;Is this HIS true destany, or is there something better out there that he is ment for?&quot;<br>
<br>
I am not discouraging you at any means, I am just asking you to be carefull.... And if, in the end, you decide that you still want a spell to bring his love back, just let me know... I have plenty of them. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uconspiracycorner.showPublicProfile?language=EN>conspiracycorner</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 9<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(6/30/02 5:58:02 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=400.topic&index=2>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://d21c.com/conspiracycorner/dancingalien.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: I need some help</span><hr size=1> Spells, voodoo and mumbo I think is something you would be hiding behind.

But if nothing else this will give you a laugh.  I thought I would cook a romantic dinner so we could sit down and have a talk try to resolve things in some way, either way!  Well it all went horribly wrong.  Put the dinner on, (roast duck with wild berries I picked myself), went to have a bath, no hot water. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eh --><img src=http://www.pauls-net.co.uk/smiles/eh.gif ALT=":eh"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Got changed into a nice new outfit, went to finish off the dinner ended up spilling fat all down my skirt!  Changed again, light some candles and returned to the kitchen.  When I went back to the livingroom disaster..........a candle had fallen and managed to burn his new carpet, not the best way to win back a loved one! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :cry --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/bncry.gif ALT=":cry"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
So I chickened out, covered up the burn with a rug had a good cry and put on my joggers and jumper.  Served dinner when he got home and went to bed, skipped the heart to heart because the way things were going I would only make a mess of that aswell.  However things are looking slightly rosier then before (unless He finds out about the carpet!).  What a pickle!!!!  But if nothing else I've got to laugh else I'll never stop crying!!!<br>

I have just the spell. And all you need, is a penny. Thats right, a penny. Find the oldest penny you can find, and then, do this spell:<br>
<br>
<br>
The use of a penny in this spell may need some explanation. <br>
Older pennies are made from copper, and copper is the metal of planet Venus and of the element of Water, both loving energies. That's why a penny is used here. <br>
<br>
      To smooth the path of a rocky relationship, Visualize you and your mate enjoying happy times, giving full attention to your love. Pour this energy into the penny that you hold in your projective hand. Then toss the penny over your right shoulder into a well while saying... <br>
<br>
                              &quot;Coin of the realm, <br>
                               metal of Venus, <br>
                            Ensure that naught will <br>
                              Come between us. <br>
                              Strengthen our love <br>
                              This magical day, <br>

                             And this is our way.&quot; <br>
<br>
                Note: This will be affective only when both parties <br>
                   are attempting to improve the relationship. <br>

<br>
Did you cast a “Reality Check”  spell?<br>
<br>
Well as life went on things get worse before they can get better, right?  Well went to the dentist, 2 wisdom teeth coming out, 3 fillings!  Then I was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time and got in the way of a blokes fist (not quite a double decker bus!) and ended up with the most atrocious black eye and split cheek.  And then Mr “I don’t love you” starts calling me!  Then eventually we get to the route of the problem, (that wasn’t a pun after the whole dentist thing).  He finally admitted he has a problem, (several actually but admitting one is a start!) He say’s he is an alcoholic!  He confessed that he used to drink when I went out and would hide the evidence.  He also admitted to waking up in the night to have a drink while I was asleep!  So now that we have got to the bottom of it, things can start to progress.  Hopefully my luck will start to look up.  I have always got my little dog Paddy for unconditional love.<br>
<br>
So anything interesting happening out there??????<br>
<br>
Most importantly how are you?<br>

I only know because i study psychology and sociology.  I am so glad that he admitted to you his problem.  Maybe you can be there for him like you wanted him to be there for you.  Be patient with a recovering alcoholic.  Their behavior is scethchy, and their thoughts can be horrifing.  Just don't loose your temper with him.  Alcoholism is a genetic disorder, so their are things going on inside him that will cause abraisive reactions and uncalled for behavior.   I have been through it a few times, so let me know if you need to talk.  I really do think you should give him a second chance.  You never know..... maybe this is the reward of a higher power; indulge.  You diserve to be happy.

How are you all doing?  Well I hope.  Thank you for your advice!  It is a long and winding road to recovery.  I’m learning this slowly and surely.  Each day holds a different emotion at the moment for V and I am going up and down with him at the same time.  He has been to his first AA meeting!  Bonus!  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :nod --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/nod.gif ALT=":nod"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
He didn’t like it much.  He is finding it really hard and I am finding it even harder to bite my tongue.  I want to grab him by the throat shake him violently and ask him why is he doing this to himself.  Although he is trying,,,,, he has not stopped drinking completely.  I have removed all alcohol from the house and he will still buy 4 cans on the way home from work, which although an improvement it is not the best thing he could be doing.  I don’t know really where I stand in all this!  I feel like an observer in the zoo!  At the moment I am just going to be here for him.  Be his friend first before anything else, the rest can come later.<br>
<br>
Enough of this doom gloom!!!!  Wish me luck, having my teeth out this afternoon! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Well it has been a while, sorry for that no excuse!<br>
My teeth pulling.....never happened.  It appears some things in life i can deal with, injections....i cant!!!  So i ended up having 3 fillings and he left my wisdom teeth in after all.  I hate needles, yuk!  <br>
<br>
What can i say, i have never met a nicer bunch of people, you are all so supportive and have so many kind word.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart.<br>
<br>
Back to the matter in hand.  The drink!!!!  Worst drug i think.  It has been a tricky couple of months with ups and downs.  He has had a couple of relapses but nothing we cant get over!  His family are now aware of the problem...opps....which however turned out to be a big help.  They are being very supportive towards both of us.  His mum is great because when it all gets to much i go cry on her shoulder rather then his.  It is nice to see the old Vaughan coming home, hopefully to roost!!<br>
<br>
So what have all you people been doing.  I am starting to get back into the swing of things, meeting up with an old school friend this week who i haven't seen since we were 14, oh er!!  Must get my hair done before!!!!<br>
<br>
Hope you are all well and taking care of yourselfs, I PROMISE i wont leave it so long next time.<br>
<br>
All my love to you all<br>

not to take the focus off of you, but I need your help.  I am actually confused about a similar matter at the moment.  I was working really heard on trying to get my boyfriend to quit drinking and doing drugs (nothing heavy).  He was doing really good untill we got into a fight the other day.  I realized that he doesn't truely want to quit, and that I can't make him do anything that he doesn't want to do.  I kinda snapped and told him that I no longer care what he does, and that he can do what ever he wanted.  I brought up some good points, and I know it really hurt him emotionally, but I didn't know what else I could do.  anyone have any suggestions on what I should do? <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showMessageRange?topicID=400.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showPrevMessage?topicID=400.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showNextMessage?topicID=400.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=400.topic&index=20><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/images/addreply.jpeg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.emailToFriend?topicID=400.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.threadControl?topicID=400.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=400.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=400.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm71">Promote Your Board<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm76">SHOWCASE FORUM<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">New Age<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm79">Technical Help<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm74">Admin/Mod Contacts<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm72">Staff Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesadministrationnoticeboard">Administrators Only<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm70">Recent Spam Posts<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm73">Admin Archives<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm81">The Dungeon</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm51>Witchcraft</a> <font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><a href="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.co.uk">Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> - </font><br><br><table border=0 align=center><tr><td align=center></td><td><img src="http://www.ezboard.com/image/spacer.gif" width=15 height=1 border=0></td><td align=center></td></tr></table><CENTER><!-- START BOTTOM RECREATION AD SCRIPT -->
