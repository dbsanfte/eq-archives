(Nasdaq: ADSX - news) today announced that VeriChip(TM) - a miniaturized, implantable identification chip that can be used in a variety of medical, security and emergency applications - will be featured on CNN's American Morning with Paula Zahn on January 10, 2002. <br><br>Since it was first announced on December 19, 2001, VeriChip has been covered by a range of major newspapers, television news programs, and wire services, including NBC's Today Show, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, Reuters, Associated Press, CNN-Financial News, CBS Radio, National Public Radio, BBC radio, Tech TV, the Toronto Star, among many others. In addition, a number of major media outlets are expected to carry stories about VeriChip in the near future, including CBS Weekend Evening News, the New York Times and National Geographic Magazine. <br><br>``The amount and quality of media coverage about VeriChip has been astounding,'' commented Applied Digital Solutions' Chairman and CEO, Richard J. Sullivan. ``We expected a great deal of interest, but we've been pleasantly surprised with the overwhelming excitement on the part of the media and general public. The key thing for us to do - and we're in the process of doing it right now - is to translate the enormous interest we've generated into solid business opportunities and revenue. We are in final negotiations with several potential distribution partners for VeriChip both in the United States and Latin America.'' <br><br>Richard J. Sullivan continued: ``In addition to VeriChip, Digital Angel(TM) continues to receive a high level of interest and customer orders. Unfortunately, because of the pending merger of Digital Angel Corporation and Medical Advisory Systems, Inc., I am unable to comment further due to ''quiet period`` standards. <br><br>How VeriChip Works <br><br>VeriChip is an implantable, 12mm by 2.1mm radio frequency device about the size of the point of a typical ballpoint pen. Each VeriChip will contain a unique identification number and other critical data. Utilizing an external scanner, radio frequency energy passes through the skin energizing the dormant VeriChip, which then emits a radio frequency signal transmitting the identification number and other data contained in the VeriChip. The scanner will display the identification number, but the VeriChip data can also be transmitted, via telephone or the Internet, to an FDA compliant, secure data-storage site. It will then be accessible by authorized personnel. Inserting the VeriChip device is a simple procedure performed in an outpatient, office setting. It requires only local anesthesia, a tiny incision and perhaps a small adhesive bandage. Sutures are not necessary. <br><br>Medical Device Identification <br><br>Hundreds of thousands of medical devices are surgically implanted into patients every year. Examples of these life-saving and life-enhancing devices include pacemakers, artificial joints, orthopedic hardware, heart valves, and medication pumps. After insertion, these devices often require adjustment, repair, replacement, or even recall. VeriChip, inserted subdermally just above the implanted medical device, provides patients, medical providers, and manufacturers with a rapid, secure and non-invasive method for obtaining medically critical information about the device. VeriChip is a ready source of data about the patient (such as name, emergency contact information, allergies to medications), as well as the medical device's original components, required settings and other essential parameters. Future applications may include full medical record archival/retrieval for emergency medical care. <br><br>Emergency or Security-related Identification <br><br>Personal identity verification technology has gained considerable interest recently. A great deal of focus has been trained on so-called ``biometric'' technologies - which identify individuals by their unique biological or physical characteristics, such as fingerprints, voiceprints, retina characteristics, and face recognition points. VeriChip, by contrast, relies on imbedded, tamper-proof, microchip technology, which allows for non-invasive access to identification, medical and other critical data. Use of advanced VeriChip technology means that the threat of theft, loss, duplication or counterfeiting of data is substantially diminished or eliminated. Specific application areas include: enhancement of present forms of identification, search and rescue, and various law enforcement and defense uses. <br><br>About Digital Angel(TM) <br><br>Digital Angel represents the first-ever combination of advanced biosensor technology and Web-enabled wireless telecommunications linked to Global Positioning Systems (GPS). By utilizing advanced biosensor capabilities, Digital Angel will be able to monitor key body functions - such as temperature and pulse - and transmit that data, along with accurate location information, to a ground station or monitoring facility. Digital Angel Corporation has announced a proposed merger with Medical Advisory Systems.

You know why?<br><br><--Conservative Christian with a high interest in Bible prophecey.  <br><br>In the book of Revelation, there is written about the Antichrist (I'm paraphrasing here, not doing exact quoting)... about people not being able to buy or sell unless they have the Mark of the Beast, which is his name or the number of his name (666).  Now, how is it possible for the Antichrists' people to know who is buying or selling if they had say, a tattoo?  Noooo, but our current technology makes perfect sense!  Chips like these can be implanted under the skin, (leaving a mark) and these can be programmed to track people's spending and to be keyed into their bank accounts.  Think of it, more and more of our money these days is electronic, not paper (credit cards and whatnot) and goverments are getting more and more pushy about tracking their citizens for health and security reasons.  <br><br>Why, I was shocked when watching a Nightline special...people were gathered to talk about Sept. 11 and the state of America's national security.  There was talk of a citizenship card.  On this card, some people supported having "religion" listed... (I.E. people could look at someone's card, see that they are a Muslim, and take them in for a search for fear that they were a fundamentalist).  I, of course, would be dead-set against such an idea because of the discrimination/persecution implications of it.  But, there were some people on the panel SUPPORTING It greatly!  If our society is getting that lienient about privacy issues and would even be accepting for id cards that list peoples' religion...  having a bank account chip implanted under the skin that holds records of all your financial information and stuff can't be too far away...<br><br>Eeep.  <br><br>Read the "Left Behind" series books sometime.  <br><br> <p><p align="center"><img src="http://itsuji.net/shadsie/adoptvash.gif" alt="I'm only here for the donuts."><img src="http://itsuji.net/shadsie/faramir.gif" alt="Why am I naked?"> <align="right"><img src="http://itsuji.net/shadsie/arknorthsd.gif" alt="Where's my pencil?"><br>Manbiotch battle time!

Something to keep in mind is that there are two frequencies transmitted by each satellite. One is for military use and one is for civilians (Atwill). <br><br>The military frequency is accurate to about five yards. In the interest of national security, the government has put an error into the civilian frequency so that [civilian] readings will not be as accurate. This is called Selective Availability (SA), and it is meant to keep foreign armies from using our own GPS satellites to get navigational data. <br><br>With SA, one can receive accuracy from 20 to 100 yards. Extreme atmospheric conditions (like dense fog) and obstructions (like mountains) can also lead to interference of a signal and cause inaccurate readings. Several readings can enhance the accuracy somewhat, but if you are trying to pinpoint something, such as a treasure you buried several years ago or your truck in a forrest, you will find that SA and other conditions will make your quest a long one. <br><br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>Other words, GPS has 2 main functions .. 1~ to locate your position or the position of something/ someone quickly, if they have a receiver chip (ie navigation) ..2~ to provide 'search &amp; find' information for military &amp; intelligence agencies ~ the military GPS signals being much more accurate, needless to say.. <br><br> <p>______________<BR> <img src=http://pinstand.com/pins/0595.gif ></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utowelfrood7.showPublicProfile?language=EN>towelfrood7</A> at: 4/2/02 10:58:43 pm<br></i></td></tr></table><table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showPrevMessage?topicID=81.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showNextMessage?topicID=81.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=81.topic&index=8><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/images/addreply.jpeg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.emailToFriend?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.threadControl?topicID=81.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/space/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=81.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/funexplainedmysteriesfrm35.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=81.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="unexplainedmysterieshelloandwelcomewhynotintroduceyourself">A great big WELCOME to all<option value="unexplainedmysteriesgeneralchat">General Chat<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm62">The Puzzle Room<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm71">Promote Your Board<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm39">Ancient Cultures<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm68">Astrology<option value="unexplainedmysteriesmysteriouscreaturesfactorfiction">Folklore, Myths & Legends<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm38">Ghosts & The Afterlife<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm32">Horror & the Unexplained<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm35">Other Mysteries<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm36">Outer Space<option value="unexplainedmysteriesesptheparanormal">Phenomena, ESP & the Paranormal<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm69">Superstitions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesufos">UFOs, Aliens & Abductions<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm51">Witchcraft<option value="unexplainedmysteriescommentssuggestionscomplaints">Comments, Suggestions & Complaints<option value="unexplainedmysteriesfrm67">Archives</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#6F6F6F>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries>Unexplained Mysteries</a><font color=#6F6F6F> -
