Fact: a total of 11 diferent major powers gave the U.S. total cooperation, and support (being intel and ground support)<br>
<br>
no one in there right mind would go up agenst that.<br>
<br>
This mennace is from a fairly small, yet verry well backed group of people (less than 2-300) maby backed by a few countrys, but not in a way that will be traced to them.<br>
<br>
there will be NO war.  maby a few squads of highly trained soilders will go in and take care of this problem.<br>
<br>
I got a call from a friend who was as frantic as some of the posts ive seen ... frankly it makes me laugh.  people with minimal knowledge in this area assume there will be a high scale war.<br>
<br>
think about it, the U.S. has the sympothy of 90% of the worlds super powers... we could whipe out anyone we wanted to and the world community would still be behind us.<br>

We must hit them so hard if a terrorist group every thinks of doing this they will think of how we reacted to this recent act.  It must be a massive tactical invasion on the country harboring these terrorists.  Not anything to the amount of Hiroshima.  But it has to be bad to stop this from happening again.

After listening to the stances of key senators and congressmen, as well as our president (who has done an outstanding job dealing with the situation... this is coming from a pretty objective democrat) I would not rule it out of the realm of possibility. We could, without a doubt, go to war if not only to appease the wishes of a large percentage to cause substantial damage to the terrorist perpetrator and the countries that harbor this group. <br>
<br>
That being said, there will be no draft or call to enlist. In my view this would have an overly negative effect on the situation, as well as be very unnecessary.<br>
<br>
I didn't mention this before on these boards, but a very close friend of mine from Boston University died on one of the two first planes that were hijacked out of Boston, the ones which crashed into the WTC. My good friend was murdered. People are outraged about this situation. I am upset. I have never seen anything like this before. This is, and will be, without a doubt the more enlightening time of my life. Cheers to you all - be safe.<br>

However its your duty to serve your nation in time of need. Dont worry Dinthar, if this did turn in to some war you would be going trained and knowing what to do. I know its easier for an ex-military person to say this....but it will work out for you in the end.<br>
<br>
From my professional experience I dont see this turning in to some large scale war or conflict rivaling past conflicts like Desert Storm or Vietnam. There is no large conventional enemy to fight here. Capturing and destorying these terrorist cells will be the main responsibility of our special operations command (SEALs, Delta, Army Rangers, etc) supported by our conventional rapid-reaction force units like the 82nd Airborne, 101st Air Assault, 24th Mechanized and the Marines. The worse case situation IMO, would be if we had to establish an operational foothold in a hostile nation in order to support special operations efforts in capturing and destroying these terrorist cells. Im not saying the effort will be small, but I believe it within the capability of our current military resources. I guess in the worse case scenario it could be likened to a small or limited invasion?<br>
<br>
Perhaps the whole thing could go south and we could get in to some large scale conflict in the middle east? ....but at this point I wouldnt bet on it.<br>
<br>
Also dont get alarmed when they say that some Army reserve units will be called up. Years ago, in defense planning in the face of cutbacks, the decision was made to place a lot of the support role of regular army deployment on the U.S. Army Reserve. You will see specialized units (company and battalion sized) like water puri, quartermaster, mail and postal, MP, and other more &quot;rear echelon&quot; type units perhaps getting called up. They are actually written in to the plan to support some of our full time units like the 101st, 82nd, 1st cav, 24th mech, etc etc. Its normal if some army reserve units go if we deploy some full time assets. Now if they start calling up the Army National Guard then you can get worried as most Guard units are combat arms units (Inf, Armor, artillery, etc), and you would only call them up if you were planning on fighting a very large and extended operation, or possibly garrison some posts. FYI in desert storm we only had 1 National Guard armored brigade planned to go and support the conflict, and it never made it out of pre-deployment train ups down at Ft. Polk (the confict ended before they were to be deployed). So dont get nervous all about some reserve call ups.<br>
<br>
Actually I stand a very good chance of being called back in to service because of this. We will see.<br>

Before you tell us how misinformed we are in the area of warfare and global politics, and that we are stupid to be scared; it might be a good idea to check your facts in terms of there being NO chance of war; or the US being able to wipe out anyone and still have everyone's backing. If we could do that, we would have by now. Unfortunately, what we're involved in isn't an elementary school playground spat which may be more familiar territory.<br>

How this policy will unfold is unknown, but I can forsee the agreed NATO troops pressuring governments with a history of despicable policies (i.e. Afganistan) to hand over terrorists in that government's territory. If demands aren't met, then we take out (or try to) both the government of the region, and the terrorists themselves.

The whole situation would be a lot different this time around. For starters they wouldnt have access to US intelligence resources, advisors, or military equipment like they did. Our mobility would be vastly superior to the level that the soviet forces had. Our armored forces would be much more of a challenge to the afghans than what the soviets put up against them back in the 70s. For example I dont know too many weapons systems in the Afghani arsenal that could wipe out lets say an M1a2 tank battalion on the move. Especially at the conventional level  going up against our forces. We would quickly establish air supperioty in the area of operation, etc etc. If we had to operate in hostile territory lets say in Afghanistan Im pretty confident we could do so with minimal threats.<br>

Afghanistan does not have much in the way of a modern conventional military. I dont think everyone realizes this fact.  <p><b>Belegir Kaereth'Wyn</b><BR>

Second is the statement I hear &quot;I would kill my self before I killed someone else&quot; I know you are not American Ahjess infact we have talked several times (im the old administrator) and I claim to know NOTHING about Canadian history but our freedom is built on the fact that people have died for it.  This is not a flame brother, I respect you with the UPMOST! <br>
<br>
I am 28 and overweight and I would probley get in the way but If I was called to fight on the front lines its not a question of I would like to go or not. I DONT HAVE A CHOSE, if you go to the different memorials in or country and see the ones that have died so I may live in the world I do now. I have never felt as strong as I do until I had children, my daughter will live in a land of the free where she is not scared of what may happend tomorrow.<br>
<br>
This is my opinion and I will stand by it. Before any one flames me I am not a history major nor am I military tactician. I am a person who know where I came from and I will stand with my goverment in any decions they make. People think our goverment is evil, if you would just look deeper and listen to your voice instead of everyone else and abide by our laws its NOT OUT TO GET YOU! It is a free country and our borders dont keep you in here <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

The Greatest Happiness is to scatter your enemy and drive him before you. To see his cities reduced to ashes. To see those who love him shrouded and in tears. And to gather to your bosom his wives and daughters<BR>

I know it's a bit tough for some of you folks to grasp, understand and internalize, but it's reality.<br>
<br>
The only thing we don't yet know (and by we, I mean the American public and the general population of the world) is how the US Government intends to conduct these operations from their end.<br>
<br>
Have no doubt, however, that there will be at least some ground conflict in the middle east.  It's pretty much inevitable at this point.  The Taliban has been harboring and supporting Bin Laden and several of his splinter terrorist groups, and they will not give him up voluntarily (in spite of their insistance that they would if provided &quot;proof&quot;).  We will need to hunt him down and retrieve him by force.  In order to do that we'll need to operate freely where he's at.  Afghanistan won't let us in, so we're almost certainly going to go in by force.<br>
<br>
As for potential &quot;collateral damage&quot; - I'm not concerned at all.  Any society that harbors criminals such as these, or that allows a government to rule that harbors these criminals is as guilty as the criminals themselves. <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

To be afriad to take up arms is understandable, and I hope you know Belegir is right, you will be trained and ready to defend her. I left boot camp praying for a fight and after I got it, I never wanted to do it again, until now. I am still in the inactive reserves and as soon as this starts looking like a drawn out fight, I am going to go back. Weather or not this is a Spec ops war or a ground war (that will engulf the entire middle east) remains to be seen. If this goes down in a country vs country (or really stupid country vs NATO) way The United States of America will beat the living shit out of any country or 6 countries that want to step up to the plate. Since the end of the cold war we have pushed away from the arms race and weapons of mass destruction and changed our goal to being able to fight a conventional war on two fronts, and we can. I have seen what the combined arms of the US can do, and no one on the planet can stand up to us in a old school war. Thats why the pussies did it like this in the first place. I honestly see this becomeing a matter of exectutive order 212( I think thats it) being cancelled and seeing Delta/CIA/Seal/Marine STA/Recon going on an assassination offensive. When countries won't hand people over, we replace thier goverment with one more inline with US policy. <br>
