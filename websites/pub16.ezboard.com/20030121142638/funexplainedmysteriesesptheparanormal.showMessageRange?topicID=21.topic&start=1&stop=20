After I gave my point of view, no one talked about it anymore, so I thought I would try it here.<br>
<br>
I believe that everyone is born with extra perceptions. Just listen to any young child when they talk about their imaginary friends, the scary man in their room at night, or when they just sit and talk to no one. I'm not saying that all imaginary friends are ghosts and that all their monsters are real, but how much of this is truly in their heads? Even little babies will often reach out for someone or something that adults just don't see.<br>
<br>
Why do most of us loose this sight somewhere between infancy and adulthood? We are taught at an early age that anything we see is just our imagination or our eyes playing tricks on us. We are taught to either disbelieve what we see and feel or just supress it. Be start developing our &quot;adult blinders&quot;(When we subconciously start ignoring the more unpleasent things in our enviroment. ie..ghosts,homeless people, litter, etc.) and we no longer &quot;see&quot;. To &quot;see&quot; makes us different and we are told it is wrong to be different. It can even mean you are evil, at least is some eyes. A few that do hold onto their &quot;sight&quot; are often &quot;rewarded&quot; by their parents, teacher, and/or doctors, by being drugged into &quot;normalcy&quot; because &quot;isn't that what we all want to be, normal?&quot;.<br>
<br>
I believe that we loose something very valuable through those years and by the time that most start searching for or developing what they have left it is already to late to reach their true potential. Valuable time is lost that should be used to learn how to control and develope these powers. We then often suffer from an inability to control them. With no control these &quot;gifts&quot; become anything but.<br>
<br>
I believe that we as a species need to stop believing that our science has explained everything and that anything unexplained must be wrong. We need to accept that we use only a small bit of our brain power and that some can access some parts more strongly than others. To evolve we must learn to first, accept that the power exists, and second, learn how to control it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I just want to make it clear that while I don't believe that everyone who has a mental illness or needs medication to live a normal life has their problems because of some sort of extra perception, but I believe that since these powers are not accepted by medical science that many mis-diagnoises do happen.  <br>

Knight,<br>
I couldn't agree more. <br>
People tend to fear what they do not understand so they try to explain it away.<br>
If it cannot be understood then it cannot be logical. We as a society have been taught that what is not logical is either crazy or stupid.<br>
sometimes I wonder if people even remember how to feel. I mean really feel.<br>
In a society where so much of our population is on medication for depression,<br>
I have to wonder, are feelings going down the same path as ESP?<br>
Will there someday be a message board somewhere, where people are asking if mankind ever had emotions?<br>
My father was a firm believer in ESP. He not only nurtured it but he encouraged it.<br>
We used to play card games. Not poker or go fish. He would take a deck of cards and &quot;send&quot; me the card. I would identify it. Then we would switch. We started first by just sending red or black. then the shapes, spades hearts or what ever. <br>
When we started to get good at it we named the card and the shape. Once we were up to about 40 or so out of 52.( no, I never got 52 out of 52) We moved on to pictures in magazines. <br>
Then objects. We would take balls and roll them across the floor. He told me that I could &quot;command &quot; them to stop where I wanted them to. I never got that good <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> lol<br>
 There was a time in human evaluation when we needed this instinct. there was a time before language when I think there was only mental telepathy for communication. <br>
Someday we may need it again. I know I may someday be sorry that I turned my back on this. <br>
But for now, what good is knowing that California is going to have an earth quake if you cant stop it? I have never been able to stop anything that I knew was going to happen. Maybe my fahter and I missed something, maybe we started doing all of this too late? I don't know, but I never learned that control you speak of. <br>
Many nights I have been awakened by the screams and tears of those I love, unable to reach them.<br>
Its just torture that is all it is.<br>
Or am I wrong? <br>
I don't know any more. Maybe I am just a weak person.<br>

Knight did I know you in another life or something? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  We sound alot alike. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I do everything I can do stop or ward off the esp. I don't want it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It doesn't seem to work <br>
though so Knight I am not sure if we have any choice  as to whether  or not we use it. It seems to use us once it's elevated or there or whatever you would say for having esp. Since I meditate and stuff I can't be sure what I said is true though... Because meditation will heighten awareness.<br>
So on one side I'm saying I dont' want this and the other I'm heightening it by meditating. I wonder what would happen if I stopped meditating? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I think we're born with it and there's nothing you can do about it.  I'm sure that confused everyone. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It confused me! haha<br>
I know what I mean though...<br>
<br>
Take a child with hieghtened awareness who is born into a home where things are not stable-take the same child and put them in an enviroment where everything is fine and you will probably end up with one child that has esp and the other who doesn't. In other words the child born into the home where confusion reigns will at a young age hone or keep in touch with his/her senses whereas the other one who is protected and feels that way won't have any reason to heighten there awareness. Take the same scenario and use a kid without heightened awareness and I think your going to see a whole different thing happen. Both children will be afraid or confused and both will be fine according to which home they are in. Imagine the effects on a child with esp who is born into a home where bad things are happening all the time. It wouldn't be pretty. It would depend on the child and how well he could handle the situation. Everything must come down to innate or inborn characteristics. I just dont beleive that children learn through behavioral training or conditioning...it doesn't follow and it doesn't make sense. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
 I think that all children are born with esp but it's in varying degrees. You can see it in them. Children are my thing. I love them and watch them very closely. I think we can see through them into other worlds. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I doubt most people who have kids would say that!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It's true though. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  As a matter of fact your words bothered me Knight. I see to many kids who are not taught to be creative and to think for themselves. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its sad. Toys and things like that are fine but they cant' take the place of using your mind, enjoying the world, sensing things, living so to speak. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  That's what it's all about. I am lucky enough to have a large family so I get to watch all the kids. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  haha Lucky me!! And I do watch them...that sounds crazy. I think that you can tell the more sensitive child from the child who isn't so I do beleive that we are born with a sixth/seventh/eighth/ sense but in varying degrees. It is a matter of raising that in the child as it is raising the consciousness level. Actually if you think about it there almost the same thing? Never thought of it that way before? Hmmm. Thanks! Gave me something else to think about as if I need it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

Feelings. What a great topic. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Shadow your right! And what an awful day that's going to be. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Feeling=pain in most cases. It also =Joy. Its the balance between the two that's nessasary.<br>
As much love as one can feel equals as much pain as one can feel and so on. I wonder myself where the feelings have gone too? I don't get it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
Does it all come down to a matter of acceptance. Who are we to judge anyways. I don't get that either. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Fit the status quo...no...I never wanted to be what is so called normal...who is to say what is normal? This mind set causes more pain and hurt than anything in the world. Everyone takes sides and says what is normal and none of them are normal as far as I'm concerned...but then again who am i to say? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
So I refuse to wear anything with someone elses name on it!! Ridiculous. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
I had a voice tell me to get up and go see my Aunt, Shadow. I listened and I went. She pasted away the next day. So I don't know what the answer is to your question. I am just glad I listened to the voice and went to see my dearest Aunt. I spent my life with this wonderful lady and I'm am so glad that I had one last chance to see her, hold her and tell her how much I love her. If I didn't listen I would be very sorry today. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I am sorry but it's for different reasons of course. <br>
<br>
I must go now so this won't be my longest post on record. I think that we're all born with esp! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Some more than others. Some learn to understand and control their premonitions and other factors of their 6th sense. Some are frightened by it, deny it and make it go away.<br>
<br>
Some are encouraged to engage and use their 6th sense ... while others are taught &quot;there's no such thing&quot; and, in believing that, the gift(?) leaves them.<br>
<br>
There are those, however, as reluctant as they are ... the 6th sense remains, no matter what they may try to make it go away. It is there for these people ... sometimes causing emotional and physical pain. Sometimes causing terribly frightening images of those things to come. Other times ... revealing to them images of those things that once were and explaining strange phenomena taking place in different regions.<br>
<br>
Is it a gift or a plague? I believe if one is trained to perceive their 6th sense as a part of them as a person, that they are perceiving things that many are unable, that they are NOT causing the events or other apparitions to occur, that they are Sensitive people who can help others as well as themselves ... Perhaps then the 6th sense can be seen more as a gift than a punishment.<br>
<br>
I do have more thoughts ... later maybe. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I worked with kids that had emotional disorders. that was one place that my &quot;gift&quot; was useful. I could feel what was in there heart. I used that to try to help them.<br>
Unfortunately I have no wonderful stories to tell you. Its hard to undo in a few hours a day what has taken a life time to be done. I loved my job. Until I found my self so deep into it that I was lost. I became so depressed that I could hardly function.<br>
That isn't useful to anyone <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
I have to disagree with you about one thing. You said you cant turn off ESP. <br>
I say you can at least most of it.  I have turned mine off. How long that will last remains to be seen.<br>
Another one of my many jobs was work for American it was one of them 900 numbers you call for readings. Hey it paid real well! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

Good point Dot. Viewing esp as something good and learning to understand and control it is probably the<br>
best idea. And seeing if you can help others I think is the ultimate goal of those that hear these voices.<br>
They have to be talking for a reason, no? I think so. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
I fall into that &quot;not want any part of it category&quot; I've always considered it intuition actually and never thought of it as esp really. I guess<br>
I just don't want to use that term for some reason. (that karmic report is true there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  After a while though<br>

degrees of psychic abilities too. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I saw a lamp levitate once and I still can't figure that out.

<br>
I wanted to say to Knight and Shadow that we can't really be sure what esp is for until we have learned to use different parts of the brain and build on what is known already or what gifts a person has already? It could be like building blocks. One thing leads to another and we won't know 'why&quot; until we know more about how many different paranormal abilties that there are. We can only use conjecture when it comes to talk about what other paranormal abilities that there could be. Although many gurus meditate for years on end I don't think that there ultimate goal is esp it's usually to seek a higher power. I should look that up and see if <br>
people who meditate for hours have esp and don't use it? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  It must be somewhere out there on the net! I think your right though, fear is the biggest hindrance.

Has anyone ever heard of James Von Prague? I think that's his name. He's a channeler. He started out hearing voices and now he's making a fortune off it! Look him up on the net. He knew what to do with the voices that he heard. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  He seems quite sincere though, it's wierd.

We feel too much empathy. That is one reason, whenever I have assisted in surgery, I do NOT look at the patient as a person ... but as a biological unit whose vital signs must be maintained and all procedures carried out proficiently. Then, once the surgery is over, that patient is once again is a person to me ... one with a name, family, hobbies, favorite color ... you get the idea. Had I not been able to separate myself during surgical procedures, the thought of cutting open a human, viewing their guts and ?... well need I go on <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  .... that thought would have made me so very ill and I would not have been able to serve.<br>
<br>
One thing that has always made me physically ill is to be with a person or patient who is suffering great physical pain and nothing can be done to stop it. I mean I get VERY ILL!

You say that you &quot;always considered it intuition actually and never thought of it as esp&quot;. Well, ESP means &quot;extra sensory perception&quot; ... Being able to perceive, see, or know certain things by use of senses that are above that which are commonly used. (Extra being Latin for &quot;above&quot; or &quot;in addition to&quot;.) So wouldn't intuition fall into that category if you looked at it that way? Just a thought. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I, too, believe it various levels of psychic abilities. I don't know if it is because those whose abilities are greater have mastered their gift more than those who demonstrate less ability. Hmmmm.

Now here is something that may interest all of you. My father would NOT lie to me about this either. He was once visiting a patient at a Mental Institution.

<br>
Just a little something I've noticed from my experience.. I have never met two people with the same ability. Sometimes similar, but never the same. Just an observation.<br>
<br>
As for being able to block out one's gift, I know of one great example... My cousin. A little history of us. On my mom's side of the family, my grandmother has six grandchildren. Three boys, three girls, all born two years apart. I am the oldest male. The cousin I spoke of is the oldest female. While all six of us were all raised in basically the same lousy situations, only me and her showed any true sign of a &quot;gift&quot;. But we each took different paths. While I developed mine to an extent, she completely ignores her's. She is what I like to call a true natural witch(meaning her abilities seem almost magical). Phenomenon happens to her on a regular basis, but she chooses to just ignore it and treat it as if it doesn't happen. A real state of denial. Even stranger is that we sort of cancel each other out. Neither of our abilities will work if we are close to one another. I have some stories to share, but I'll save those for next time.<br>
<br>
I just going to finish up with this... As much as I question my abilities being a gift, I don't feel that I would have survived to adulthood growing up where I did if I didn't have them. On the other hand, I think growing up there may have been easier if I hadn't been so open to everything around me there.  <p>Support the DAV(Disabled American Veterans).

I still  don't understand how she ignores things that fly around the room when she walks in.

Merc, Some doctors can be pretty frightening, but most are so needed ... especially those that are devoted to their art and their patients. I still have no idea why that man was able to levitate himself several inches off the floor while backed up to a bare wall. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
Knight, I know I've told you about my late Aunt with psychic powers. How odd that you and your cousin seem to cancel each others powers out. There must be a phenomena occurring like Jackie said ... only you two are oppositely polarized instead of positively. Strange. I find that when I was with my Aunt ... or with others of psychic abilities, for the most part, mine are heightened.<br>
<br>
WARNING! People who are sensitive ... beware. Learn to build a psychic protective wall around you to protect yourself daily. People, without meaning to, can drain you of your feelings of health and emotional well being. <br>
Ever notice that after talking to or being with someone who is physically or emotionally ill, you find yourself feeling so very, very drained while they feel better? This is not completely because of all your sympathy and empathy. It is because you are sending healing waves out to them. They are picking up and pulling even more from you than you intend to give.<br>
<br>
Mentally, put up a shield to protect yourself. You can still send out that with which you are able to cope ... but the receiver will not be able to penetrate your field and drain you (unintentionally) of your powers, thus making them better and you ill.<br>
Take my word for this. It took me years to find this out. I am so glad now that I know.<br>
You can also raise your psychic walls so that no evil can penetrate ... for those who know why I say this, you know why it is so important.<br>
<br>

Have I ever had a vision?<br>
Many<br>
The first one I had was the night my father died. I saw his death in a reflection of a car window. Odd place I know.<br>
I freaked and I demanded that the people I was with take me home right away.<br>
When I got home everything was fine. I was puzzled. then much to my horror it all happened about three hours later.<br>
Trust me I have kicked myself for that more times then I can count. I should have trusted what I saw. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Most of my visions have come in dreams. Dreams that aren't quite like other dreams. I could always tell the difference, they are more like slide shows.<br>
I dreamed (or saw) my mothers friend having a heart attack in a bath tub. I sat in my mothers living room and told this woman what I saw. Don't you know she went home and had a heart attack in her bathtub. <br>
Another time I saw a car accident, I made it a point to see the name of the road and what car it was. <br>
Again I sat there and told this person what I saw. I told him the name of the road it was going to happen on. He left my house and went home on that road. He called me from a phone both to tell me it had just happened.<br>
Why don't people listen?????????????<br>
I have to wonder, do I &quot;see&quot; these things, or do I somehow make them happen?<br>
My biggest problem is with anger. When I get angry things happen. There was a girl I worked with years ago. I couldn't stand her. Every time I walked past her something would fall. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
She was scared to death of me. I didn't like her but I didn't want to scare her either.<br>
Back to when my father died, <br>
my first day back to school, a girl told me my father was going to rot in hell. I was furious! <br>
I looked at her and I will never forget what I said to her.<br>
I told her that &quot;real soon, you are going to be laying in the darkness, trapped, and wishing you had never said that to me&quot;<br>
she was in a car accident after school that day.<br>
She spent the next 10 years, in a coma.<br>
I have never stopped wishing that I could take back my words and I have wondered if she laid in her darkness blaming me.<br>

Where to start?<br>
<br>
First off, Merc. I have had enough electricity pumped into my body that I could light up NYC. That wasn't what almost killed me. A bad allergic reaction to a nerve block did it. As it was, I lost use of both of my legs for almost two months. Had a lot of nerve problems after that. Still fall down sometimes. As for my mistrust of doctors, I have very good reason. I've been screwed over by three different ones in the past 2 years. False reports, misdiagnoses, refusal of treatment because they wouldn't profit enough from it. I could go on and on.<br>
<br>
Back to topic.<br>
<br>
Visions, I've had a few. Nothing as dramatic as Shadow. Just a few images of death in my dreams. Always right except for one... My own. Still waiting for that one to come true. <br>
<br>
Dottie, I understand very well about keeping evil out. Story for later.<br>
<br>
Okay, What can I do? Hard to explain. Best I can do is share some experiences. <br>
<br>
I had a friend that was somewhat psychic. He was also very good at astral projection. He lived two floor below me and often used that ability to see into other rooms. I scared him one day when he decided to &quot;enter&quot; my room this way. I saw him and told him to get out.<br>
<br>
Sort of a freaky thing that happened to me was after I asked another friend for a tarot reading. He was rather good at this and after a lot of urging, he finally did a reading for me. He was about through when he got a strange look on his face and turned to me and said &quot;You're not human. What the h*!! are you?&quot; After that he stopped the reading and refused to do another. He never would explain to me what he saw.<br>
<br>
One more thing before I go, Shadow, Why the question about me being a Native American warrior in a former life? Do you know something that I don't?<br>
<br>

<br>
Knight what do you mean you cancel other sensitives out? How do you cancel them out? Are you<br>
sure your cousin isn't like my niece? My neice is convinced that she's psychic and yet she has very scattered energy. She was also raised strict catholic. I refuse to think of myself as being or having any kind of psychic powers (I still look at it as intuition Dot! ) and I left the church at thirteen, I had it with them. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   I find some of these similarities here interesting...and I'm wondering how much it has to do with one percieves this so called whatever it is...actually it's natural..we just don't look at it that way. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She's also afraid of it?

sure that your cousins energy isn't just scattered and therefore you feel like it's cancelling yours out? When ever my my niece and I are together the microwave runs by itself, the lights flicker on and off, there's always something weird happening. It's ridiculous! haha It's funny though. I tried to get her to do tai chi and focus some of that energy but she can't concentrate on it. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She could probably heal half the east coast if she could focus some of that energy. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  She's something else. <br>

How old were you? I was nine and I didn't need a vision. He died in front of us.

Maybe people who have dealt with loss are more intune with death? I have to be careful what I say, i don't want to hurt you or disturb you in anyway. These visions you've had are something else. Oh brother. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Sounds like poltergiest activity when you walked past that girl Shadow.<br>
As I'm not so sure that poltergiest phenomenon exist then I would have to say that the energy you were feeling caused the things to fall around the girl. (somewhat like my niece) Why did she say such an awful thing in the first place!! Oh my. This is disturbing. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Of course you would be angry why not...it's natural I think and I sure don't blame you for any of your thoughts at that time. IF they could cause her to be hurt...I can't say. I wouldn't know. I just know that if the people who <br>
were angry could cause that kind of thing to happen did it there wouldnt' be to many people in the world. I think that anger is one of the easiest and most out of control energies that there is to use. Don't You? It's not like your setting your mind to anything it's more of a direct energy flow to the source or whatever is around you at the time. If something were to happen don't you think it would have happened then? I don't think you can be blamed for your thoughts. Everyone has thoughts and especially at a time when you are at your most fragile. People should be careful. It's to bad. But I don't think you can blame yourself because you have visions. You have opened up a whole new topic by the way...seeing into the future. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  People won't listen...maybe there not supposed to listen. I watched the movie time shifters and everything that the man did to change the future &quot;caused&quot; the future to happen. It was a good movie. Maybe you should rent it and see what it says about changing the future. Cause and effect. I wouldn't go through life causing myself anymore pain than i already have because someone effected or affected the way I felt Shadow. It's living in reaction not action. I am sorry for your pain. Peace to you. <br>

NO! ... you did not cause it to happen. It is a premonition of that which was to come. As far as &quot;wishing&quot; things on some people when you are angry ... the jury is still out for me on that one.<br>
I remember once in high school, this guy who sat in back of me in Algebra class kept talking to me incessantly and would not shut up. He got worse and worse. It was really starting to get on my nerves. I went home that day, lit a white candle (I dabbled a little back then, but no more!) and wished only that he would no longer be able to talk to me in that class and disturb me. The very next day at school, out of nowhere, he had developed laryngitis and was unable to even whisper ... for over a week! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Well, needless to say, I never did anything like that again. But, Shadow ... what I did was a willful act and NOT something said right on the spot in retaliation out of anger at what someone had said or done to me. It was more than just a wish ... it was a request on my part. I would hope and pray that you can't &quot;whammy&quot; someone by just wishing it ... Gosh only knows how many people would &quot;drop dead&quot; every day if &quot;wishing&quot; where the case. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Take heart, Shadow, it takes much more than a wish to cause something to happen to someone.

As far as what that person saw in the Tarot Cards, it is difficult to say. Perhaps that person saw a deep spirituality within you and mistook the meaning of the card for you not being human.

About your niece's psychic energy being scattered ... uh huh! I do wish she would learn to focus as you have advised her. It just sounds as though she really doesn't want anything to do with her powers ... or maybe she realizes just what type of things could happen should she harness and be in complete control of her abilities and wants nothing to do with that. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Can you blame her if that is the case? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
As far as the Ouija Board. For those who believe they are truly making contact (and BOY do I have some Ouija Board stories for you! TRUE ones!<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) with the &quot;other side&quot; ...<br>
Well, when you do summon the other side and open that door for them to communicate ... that door is also open for them to enter into this dimension or plane of existence, to stay for as long as they wish, or to simply return with a &quot;good bye&quot; indication on the board. Most don't want to stay here very long at all as they are in a far better place. But what of those who are admitted at our request who like it here better? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Food for thought.<br>
As far as Tarot Cards and Ouija Board enhancing your psychic powers ... I feel that the practice of use of Tarot can serve as a tool to enhance your abilities. As the cards reveal more and more to you and you receive positive feedback ... you begin to believe more and more in the powers you latently possess and allow those powers to surface and manifest themselves.<br>
<br>

<br>
As for &quot;wishing&quot; harm on someone, here's a thought. Shadow, with your untrained(I don't know how you train this) premonition abilities, in a moment of anger you may have accessed it and the words you spoke in anger was only your subconscious telling you the future. What you said was what your mind saw was going to happen, you just didn't realize it. With that thought, don't blame yourself.<br>
<br>
Now on to a story explaining about me and my cousin.<br>
<br>
One of her talents is with a Ouija board (especially the one that belonged to our grandmother). She was very good at contacting anyone that she wanted to that she even had the smallest connection with( ex- she couldn't talk to Elvis, but she contacted her father's, girlfriend's, grandfather.). She could sit for hours and &quot;talk&quot; with the board. You would think that with my history, I would have the same luck. Not a chance. I see the dead, just can't talk to them. Can't operate a board at all. When I would get into the same room as my cousin when she was working a board, it would stop until I left. She would sometimes ask me to try the board with her, but it would never work. When I would leave, she would make contact.<br>
<br>
Along those same lines is a story just about her.<br>
<br>
She was going to a slumber party at a friends house. Before she got there, some of the other girls were playing with a Ouija board with no success. Of course, when my cousin got there they stopped and came out and greeted her. When they all went back into the room with the board, it happened. As soon as my cousin entered the room, the viewer came off the board and flew at her. She jumped out of the way and it hit the wall behind her. Things like this were always happening to her, but she just tries to ignore them. Often even refusing to talk about them. <br>
<br>
She was even the first person to see my Doppelganger(the topic of my Halloween story in the ghost forum).<br>
<br>
As for the strenghtening of my abilities...imagine this. Say you could see ghosts in a lot of places. Say you could also sense death wherever it was possible. Now imagine that times ten. <br>
<br>
I could write so much more,but Encounters With the Paranormal is coming on.<br>

Nope....<br>

Dot my niece isn't afraid of anything. She is very sure of her psychic skills...that's what's a little confusing about her. She is an excellent palm reader and she will tell people exactly what she thinks is going to happen to them according to what she see's in their hands. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I ask her<br>
if this doesn't make her nervous..telling people stuff like this...and she says no? She is very sure of herself and her gift. It's her energy that is scattered. I was wondering how much more psychic she would be if she would control it that's all. She is not afraid beleive me. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

People who use voodoo can wish things on other people and make them happen. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  Its all in the mind. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I doubt they are having visions though. In order to see visions you have to be able to see the future which means it's already set. A lot of philosphers would agree that the past/future/present all exist at once and in essense they are right. I mean think about it. You couldn't have a future without a past or a past without a future? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :smokin --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smokin.gif ALT=":smokin"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  So all's you have is today which is the apex of the  past and the future.  Each thing is intrinsically tied one to the other. As each person is. It's cause and effect. <br>

Interesting stories Knight. Thanks,  I hope you enjoy the encounters!<br>

First I want to tell you all that you are wonderful people and I thank you for all your kindness.<br>
Merc, you said you father died in front of you when you were nine. I am sorry <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

when I was 15. Maybe there is a connection.<br>
Dottie you are a sweet heart, I cant tell you that enough times. I love you! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
Knight I am sorry that those doctors put you through hell <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
But I am glad you are OK now.<br>
You seem to have a sense for the spirit world.<br>
As for tarot cards and Ouija boards, tarot cards are a place to start, they are something to focus on and tune into.<br>
Ouija bards... I have very mixed emotions about them.<br>
Of course it cant be the board its self, there has to be a greater force that makes it move.<br>
I used to have one when I was young, it scared the hell out of me and I took it out side and burned it.<br>
Knight, why did I ask you that question?<br>
I had a &quot;word attack&quot; the other night <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
word attacks for shadow are when I get a sudden and very strong urge to write. During these things I call word attacks,I cant write fast enough words just come so fast. I don't read them until they are finished.<br>
When I was done, I read what I wrote and I thought,<br>
where the hell did this come from? Its called &quot;the warrior&quot;<br>
Then I came to this message board and I was reading your post when a little voice inside my head told me that maybe you were where it came from. If I am right you spirit has carried a lot of anger and despair into this life time.<br>
I don't think that it will ever leave you. Its your job in a strange sort of way, to always fight for justice. <br>
