When I see a message that the Dragoons are going on a rampage... There was a Cleric, a Dragoon and a monk DE! All of them where controlled by the gms.  I turned my role play flag on and got right into it. Well at first there really was nothing to it. Just the Dragoons shouting saying you good people stink...(parafrasing) yadda yadda yadda.  So I being the Netural non god worshiping Halfling that I am...took no offense. Then there was a cute bard I saw go into her DE desigues...and the Cleric saw right through it (she was green to me, cleric was blue) and he starting ponding on this poor bard.  I warned him to stop at once but he would not. I told him to go back home he would not. So he kills the bard and turns to me and tries to cast a Root spell. I laugh at him. He tried about 5 times..never once sticked.. I asked him if he was through playing?  He said &quot;Quiet little one&quot; That is when he got me ANGRY!  In a fit of rage... I swore his death at the top of my lungs... and I attacked him.. HE moved faster than Bard song!  I started hitting him. he hit me once. I then Did a Charge Disapline and got him down about halfway...when his Dragoon budy...about quarter the size of me!!! He moved so fast I could not keep track of him. He then killes me pretty quick...  So I got a rez and heading back and challanged the Dragoon to a fight one on one...with no help from his people or my people! (hey i was roleplaying!) As I shouted that...I noticed at the ledge there where about 20 people just destroying the Dragoon.. then the monk one...it was pretty sad!  Then of course the first words I heard out of someones mouth was...What did he drop?  ARRGHHHH...Only my second GM event I have ever been lucky enough to attend and to try and help out a story or what ever and everyone just has to jump on the GMs and kill them SIGH!  I at least gave them a few moments to think about attacking me.. and I tried to open up a dialog between us. LOL but that did not work... o well such is life. Is this the way all GM events are now? just everyone jumping in and killing the GMs?  Kinda sad.. anyway laters all<br>

Well when everyone was beating up on the first &quot;mini goon&quot; I am a gnome and this thing barely came up to my knee. I thew a few Ice comets at the end to finish him off. He dropped 2 longs swords sold for about 9pp each at the vendor i believe, and about 29pp.<br>
<br>
The second oen that the person above kept doing complete heals on, Well I sat there for about 5 minutes watching and laughing at the melees as he was complete healed over and over and got the timing down and when he got to about 1/3 health i hit him with a ice comet and finished him off, He dropped a black pearl choker +7dex/agi worth about 200pp i hear and some throwing stars junk and about 49pp.<br>
<br>
so it took probably around 10 level 50+ players to kill em and they froped about a total of 350pp in junk. If anyone feels robbed you can have the crappy necklace My warrior would rather wear his orc fang neckalce anyway. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=baronnofdisaster>Baronn of Disaster</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 83<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(10/22/01 8:47:32 am)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://www.agguns.com/final.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Hi Barron</span><hr size=1> DOMY!!!!<br>
