This isn't all because of the players either, because Verant keeps doing events that serve no real purpose.  Unfortunately, even when they DO plan a worthwhile event, it's not good enough for most players.  People want instant gratification, and while some really appreciate that some items and events aren't meant to be for everyone, most would rather piss and moan that they got left out, than be glad to get involved.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is that GM events get advertised too much.  The GMs/quest troupe should keep a somewhat lower profile, and just run events for smaller numbers of players who might actually try to follow through with whatever quest or task they are presented with.  Back around the Velious release, some of my guildmates and I ended up being given a set of quests to complete by a GM, who we would meet every few days in Mistmoore.  It was very cool, even though nothing substantial came of it.  Some roleplaying was required to make it fun, and because we were able to do it as a guild, it was more memorable afterwards.  Doing huge events to cater to the masses is NOT memorable, and all it does is piss people off.<br>

Any role playing is lost when we forfeit the right to attack anyone.  On blue servers, it's not possible for a second guild to defend the npcs from the first, for instance.<br>
<br>
Another problem I have seen is timing.  Gm chars show up, word gets passed around, and an hour later with 100 people watching, something happens.<br>
<br>
As alternatives, I'd ask, why don't we have ongoing, invulnerable chars, so that many more people have a chance to interact with them?<br>
<br>
Also, why not have the npc's show up, do their business, and leave.  Why wait for 12 guilds to arrive?<br>
<br>
At this point it should be obvious that npc's which pass the turing test are not really viable opponents.  So their purpose must be more related to infotainment.<br>

Several of the members of my guild were involved in a GM event a couple months ago in Nektulos Forest.  He even sent one of our rogues off on a difficult quest.  The GM returned to the forest later (in continuation of the earlier event) and invited some of our guildees on a trip over to KC.  (The three he took from our guild were all in their early teens to early twenties, and he brought them all the way to KC *lol*.)  Nobody involved in the event got any loot, but those who participated enjoyed it immensely.      <br>
<br>
Also, I remember a GM event myself in OT where the some of the dragoons were GM controlled.  I love flirting with the dragoons, but normally they just stand there doing nothing.  The only response I ever got out of them was when General V'Deers accused me of trying to buy friends for giving him a cookie!  It was a big thrill to have them respond to my flirtations for once, hehe.  (Then all the other dark elf ladies started flirting with them too!)    <br>
<br>
So loot is not always important, so long as the event is enjoyable.  <br>
