I'm a member of Coven Nex, but this post doesn't reflect the thoughts of Coven Nex as a whole or a guild. These are just my thoughts on the incident that seems to be Seekers' little attempt at ruining the reputation of my guild on Druzzil Ro.<br>
<br>
Recently, it appears that there have been some lies and harsh words floating around about Coven Nex and one of it's best members (one of Druzzil Ro's nicest and best players as well), Tioni. Everyone is probably aware of the &quot;Faydedar Incident&quot;, in which Coven Nex engaged the mob first and were kiting it around, when it was taken from us by Seekers member Ciner (who pretended to be doing us a favor by kiting it around a bit for us, and then saying he lost it and it de-popped, when he was really just kiting it around a different part of the zone for his own guild to take). Well, to make a long story short, when Seekers killed Faydedar, it turned out that Coven Nex had engaged it for so long that we actually got the experience and the kill (therefor, the ability to loot the corpse). Seekers did not like this very much, since they had worked so hard to steal the kill from us (something Seekers have become a master of), and threw a tantrum when our guild member, Tioni, looted the corpse for our hard-earned loot. <br>
<br>
Well, the sh*t hit the fan and a GM had to be called in. To Coven Nex's misfortune, the GM took the side of Seekers (since they dealt the finishing blows), and the loot we had worked so hard for was given to Seekers. Tioni, and our guildmate who had needed his loot, were given nothing in compensation. Seekers then decided to show just what immature twelve-year olds they are, and make a big deal of the incident by blatantly trashing Tioni on the front page of their website, giving her their Golden Egg Award (something done to take the load off their backs for being such social outcasts in real life, by making someone look as bad as them in EQ). <br>
<br>
Tioni, a very kind and well-meaning player, was branded a powerlooter and overall bad-player by Seekers; her reputation potentially wrecked on Druzzil Ro. Part of the purpose of this post is so that no one on Druzzil Ro falls under the impression that Tioni is a bad person. Spend 5 minutes with her and you'll wonder what the hell it is Seekers are talking about. After all, if she is a powerlooter and greedy person... doesn't that make her perfect Seekers material? You should be trying to recruit her, not trash her. She'd fit right in.<br>
<br>
I guess my overall point of this post is that Seekers need to remember that they live in a glass house. This post will no doubt be shot down and flamed by the Seekers spin-machine whose job is to patrol the message boards and justify every action they make, no matter how blatantly wrong; but I am posting it anyway. No, Seekers supposedly &quot;don't care what others think of them&quot;. They all had lots of practice being trained to say that by adjustment councellors in high school when they spent most of their time spent shoved in lockers; but the thing is, they really do care. They need new members and they need new support, because frankly, the membership of that guild has begun to drop like flies over the past month or so. Image is everything, and that is something Seekers are finding out very quickly.<br>
<br>
Seekers needs to be careful of who they single out and who they try to trash. Your Golden Egg Awards are rediculous... it's like the hooker down the street calling someone else a slut. Being called a powerlooter and bad player sounds hilarious, coming from a guild of nothing but those who fit that description. Yes, there are a few good players in Seekers (Seraphina and Aenro come to mind immediately), but the guild as a whole is nothing but a bunch of bitter, synical individuals who are taking out their personal inadaquacies in real life on people in EverQuest. <br>
<br>
With that in mind, I'll just leave Druzzil Ro with the truth. Coven Nex is the complete opposite of Seekers, and not only as a guild, but as individual players. Yes, we care about loot. Yes, we go on plane raids. Yes, we kill big scary-lookin' stuff. But one thing we do that Seekers do not is show respect towards the people on our server, and work out our disputes or scheduling conflicts in a civilized and intelligent way. No, we don't powerloot. No, we don't intentionally KS. And no, we do not disregard the happiness of others on our server for our own personal gain. Again, this is not Coven Nex speaking as a guild, but myself speaking as an individual and on how I know my guild operates. If you ever have a problem or question to resolve with Coven Nex, you won't be flat-out disrespected or called an &quot;Egg&quot;, because myself, Tioni, or anyone else in the guild has nothing to prove to anyone else. We have nothing to gain by stomping all over other people.<br>
<br>
I hope this cleared some things up and that everyone can make their own judgement about who and what they want on their own terms, and not over what is written on a website that is produced by a bitter mob of angry children.<br>

Before you start judging the Seekers guild just on one story that may or may not be true, I have no opinion and I don't believe that anyone else can develop an opinion from reading the above statement(s) without hearing the seekers side of the story. But also keep in mind that Citidal is a member of Coven Nex, so he is not impartial in the least. I feel that reputation does mean a lot on the game but find out on your own who you will dislike/respect. As of the Seekers slamin', look a cool word, your friend, you have the right to try and defend her, but as stated above you are not impartial.

If events occured as Citidal describes -and the Seekers corraborate the base facts- then I would find myself in agreement with Citidal.<br>
<br>
CN pulled the creature and did so much damage that they received the kill.  Therefore, it was their kill, unless they trained it to a Seeker.  That fact cannot be disputed.  The fact that a GM was required ot take back the loot is further proof.<br>
<br>
Next, while I agree with Cilien that 'two wrongs do not make a right' and that Citidal may be solving nothing -and in fact only inflame matters- by posting on this board, he has every right to make his case and for it to be heard.  I wish I could say that this is the first time I have heard of such things concerning the Seekers, but it isn't... One case of foul play may be suspect, but many?  The cases can only be 'lies' so many times before one wonders who is really the liar.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most damning matter is how the Seekers chose to handle the situation.  Perhaps they were justified in petitioning a GM, but posting an inflammatory article on their website is simply too poor an example of gamesmanship.  That act alone brands them as immature and foolish -even if that only be the webmaster for the site.  If I were the Guildmaster of Seekers, I would doubly ensure my guild did not present a bad image and that is a pretty bad image...  Of course, i am not the Leader of Seekers.<br>
<br>
All things said, I also commend the civil tone used.  I look forward to a formal and civil response to these accusations from the Seekers. <p><i>Venerato Quod Equitas</i>,

I'll just say that all of you here will be very disappointed with the next MMORPG, Dark Age of Camelot. Once you reach the higher levels, you must deal with this type of matter on a daily basis. DAoC turns into PVP-Team once you reach a higher level. I'm saddened to see that EQ has turned into the affirmative action game of fantasy. Hence my delving into the beta testing of DAoC and for the most part leaving EQ.  <br>

I don't think I'm getting the whole story here.  Based on the information given, Seekers failed to steal a spawn from Coven Nex yet managed to steal the loot through a gamemaster's intervention.<br>

Perhaps you yourself do not have the entire story, to which, in the form of game logs, the gamemaster surely has access.  I am not persuaded that any gamemaster/guide/admin could ever reward loot to a kill stealer.  I conclude that the gamemaster awarded the loot to Seekers based on logged information you do not have. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usaeadebedrakjharta.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Saeadebe Drakjharta</A>&nbsp; <IMG SRC=http://www.ezboard.com/ezgrafx/gicons/black_fire.gif BORDER=0 WIDTH=10 HEIGHT=10></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 30<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(2/14/01 3:27:35 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Seekers...</span><hr size=1> woot woot gotta throw my 2 copper into the pot!!<br>
<br>
all guild bullshit aside, citidal is sticking up for a friend, and he is being civil about it. props.<br>
<br>
EQchip, why dont you post your opinions on a recognizable name instead of anon? it implies alot...<br>
<br>
and one other thing... if your guild or you has a bad reputation, dont you think that says something? if clerics dont rez your members because of a guild tag, or ppl dont port you because of your name, dont you think that implies something is wrong? reputation is a major part of this game, even on the lowest levels. Such is life. i, myself will give anyone a chance, regardless of what i have heard of them or thier guild tag. but if im screwed by them in my experiences with them, they have a snowballs chance in hell of associating with me in the future. I have friends in all guilds, all levels, and all classes on this server. i dont give a rats ass if you can kill trak every thursday by 8pm or if all you can do is raid the ec orc camps by yourself. thats not whats important to me. <br>
id like to think i have a reality based outlook on game life, in that it is a GAME people, can you repeat after me? a G-A-M-E. not a life, not a religion, not any of that.and you cant even win it, because in EQ there is no end. so why try to &quot;win&quot; at everything? give it a rest. <br>

<br>
Don't have a lot to say about Seekers or Coven Nex.  Seekers have a bad rep from all the things I've heard, but I know a few seekers helped out some lowbie friends of mine that got in a jam.  Sure doesn't match their rep, and I personally think they did a pretty nice thing.  I try not to paint an entire guild with the same brush.  As far as I'm concerned, you're in the &quot;good pile&quot; until you move yourself out of it by your own actions, not just actions that someone mentions to me in passing.<br>
<br>
Same goes for Coven Nex.  Heard a lot of good things about them, they have a pretty good rep from what I tell.  I've never associated with them personally, but they also get the &quot;good pile&quot; ruling.<br>
<br>
What I do take issue with, though, is the post Vinen made along the lines of &quot;GM's follow rules, and if they GM made a ruling they made the right one&quot;.  Bah, what a complete crock of horsesh*t that one is.  I've personally encountered lame, lazy, and completely stupid GM's who made completely idiotic rulings, making it completely obvious that they don't have a single clue.  Even had one outright *lie* to me, stating that they were invis, watching a conversation between someone, and that both he and I said certain things.  I demanded to see their logs, since I had logging turned on and could prove that neither of us said the things they claimed to have seen in their vast invisible wisdom, and they quickly found an excuse to bail.  It was mighty funny when I pointed out that if they had been invis watching us, why didn't they notice that Telly had already been there 30 seconds before they &quot;appeared&quot; and had already solved the situation (to both our satisfaction).<br>
<br>
I have also seen excellent GM work.  Taliesin (sure hope I spelled that right) has ALWAYS been incredibly fair, even handed, and a downright joy to interact with, even when he either couldn't help or ruled against me.  Not once have I ever doubted his sincerity, honesty, or genuine attempt to always do things in a positive manner.  It's a crying shame we lost him to another server, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
I can count on my fingers the number of times I've actually had to interact directly with GM's, so I don't have a vast amount of experience with them.  This includes the ones caused by my own stupidity (like losing my iksar warrior quest pike... how lame can you be to do that?) as well as ones caused by the stupidity of others (like the time I was being repeatedly KS'd by some idiot wizzie, so I just started charming them back and dragging them off to a corner to kill them... they didn't like that and /petitioned me) However, GM's are just like people (and guilds).  There are good ones, bad ones, lazy ones, stupid ones, hard working ones, etc. etc. etc.  Making a statement along the lines of &quot;Bah, if the GM said it, it must be right&quot; is just plain ignorant.<br>

I was a smithing Wizard named Sumwyll, of all things, back then. Was gonna say how ya been, but obviously not well eh? Sorry to hear about the misfortune your guys experienced, but remember don't take the stuff too seriously. Playin eq is like driving your car, people think it offers them some amount of anonymity and they behave like thier true selves which is not always pretty. Just relax bro, pop a top on a brew and come bash em up with me.. fighting in ill omen currently. Hope to see ya soon.<br>
