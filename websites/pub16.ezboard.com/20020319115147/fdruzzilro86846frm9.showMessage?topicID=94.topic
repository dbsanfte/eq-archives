Make a personal decision to see if it will affect your game playing and then deal with it. I've gotten really tired of the overall attitude of people who don't play the high end game and blame US, the uber guilds for their inadequacies. I can't help going to NToV to kill dragons, it's what we do. Shall I go spam EC and take orc camps instead? Maybe I should just not raid and do all trade skills, yeah that sounds fun. I play the game to see my friends, laugh a bit and kill stuff. If my guild tag offends you, maybe you should stop playing the game and wishing you were me. I've read over and over about the 'top guilds' of Druzzil Ro and all that they have horribly done. Yes all of us. I've talked to people privately who insist that they think we are so cool only to see them bash us here in this forum. Make up your mind. If you hate the server so much because we're over crowded at the high end game, then get a char transfer. Stop blaming those who play more than you do. Stop blaming people who you don't even know. Get it off your chest at the gym or beat up your pillow.

Sure what you guys do doesnt effect the majority of people on Druzzil, at least now....but what about all the friction between those in-game who ARE currently vieing for equal raid resources? Look at past flare ups and tell me it was just about ML or Lmalla wishing they were members of Vindication, or vice versa. Thats not true. Theres some real bad apples currently driving a guild or two on Druzzil atm.<br><br>Myself personally I think its great what some of the very top guilds in EQ do. I respect them and what they have accomplished. Do I wish I were them? No. I like being who I am, and being proud of my past EQ experiences and looking forward to new ones. I mean after all this is only a game. I got a good taste of some of the high end game with my old character, enough to know that doing that level of EQ comes with both an in-game and real life price tag. So no, I will get there again if I so desire this time around. But in the meantime I will call a spade a spade and when someone acts in a very un-decent way they will probably get called on it. Which is the majority of the flack you are seeing now on this board in regards to the Vindication-FFA thing. People feel Vindication is doing something very un-decent and they are calling them on it...especially whats been going on the last day or two with the sneaky anon raids. Very lame. I think thats the real clincher.<br><br>As per the people who kiss butt in game and then come here and talk trash....well thats just someone who has no integrity. They are a waste.<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;just don't hate the PLAYERS, hate the game.<br><br>Thats like saying its the gun that kills someone and not the person who decided to aim it at someone and pull the trigger. But other than that you did make a good post and I think you made a good attempt at smoothing things over. Everybody appreciates a peacemaker, but its just that its not that cut and dry on this issue.<br><br><br><br> <p><b>Elrenn Longstrider</b><br>Ranger of Surefall Glade<br><br><i>Tolan's last student</i></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A> at: 1/19/02 9:41:20 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ukaludramaderlas.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Kaludram Aderlas</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/minisc.jpg" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 220<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/20/02 1:46:21 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> Fiz!<br><br>As you know I like you for the person you are and I have also never found a member of Hoss either KS me, camp steal me, or train me.  Never has one been rude, vulgar, or arrogant to me.  For this I would credit Hoss with perhaps being the best of the uber guilds.  To be honest I do not care where you hunt and I am glad you enjoy hunting there.  I have never had any of your people blow in on me or my members and take anything.<br><br>With that said I cannot say that of every other uber guild out there.  I have not named names in the past as I think it is pretty much pointless as the responses I get from both their members and officers is that it is only one person and not their fault.  Well if someone sends me a tells about one of my members acting up then that member gets read the riot act.  If it happens again, they are gone. Plain and simple.  This does not happen with ubers from my experience.  Generally the attitude is that they own the game.  You have no idea the number of times I personally have had people attempt to camp steal me, leap frog us, and train me.  In TD alone it was almost a daily thing to have someone from uberguildX train me because they owned an entire isle of raptors.  <br><br>I would often attempt to say I would only take the spawns they were not, but this was often not good enough.  After all they were uber and I was dirt.  I could care less about their opinions, however I do care when they train me affecting my enjoyment of the game.  I have always found it odd that the majority, but not all, of these people had a tag from what is considered an uber guild.  I would often ask them to be reasonable, but that was not possible.  I would often talk to an officer, to get told to go to helk or the ever popular &quot;it is only one member&quot; (only one member they could have a talk with at the very least.  So, in the end, it would come down to me having to call in a Guide of GM or I would have to stoop to their lvl of maturity (ie. training).  I chose the GM/Guide option and on several occassions those people would be caught violating the PnP and receive a warning.  This usually smartened them up.<br><br>The interesting difference to me between ubers and the rest of us is the general lack of concern about anyone's opinion that is not uber.  Whenever I have had trouble with an non-uber and contacted their guild I was usually met with concern and respect.  In the end almost always the person I was having a dispute with could come to a reasonable compromise.  I have never found this situation with anyone from what are thought to be uber guilds.  In their opinion they are better than I so negotiation is not an option.  Thusly I base my opinion on their own arrogance and at this point if they do not like it now I do not care.  <br><br>So again, because I consider you a friend, I apologize for generalizing and in the future I shall be more specific.  Hoss is a fine, high quality organization.  L'malla, well I know a handful of people there actually worthy of respect, however that organization is the one I have most often had trouble with.  From what I see of all the whining here by them my opinion maybe even less of them.  Vindi, well, we all know Vindi, and the worst incidents I have had were with them.  Mythic Legion, only one incident with them, nothing too bad, generally just an arrogant, petulent child.<br><br>I am a reasonable person and more than willing to help anyone.  I often lend aid even to ubers despite their poor attitudes because I am not that kind of person.  As a matter of fact I gave a couple rezzes yesterday for free, and as with all rezzes I do, I also buffed them.  Why? Well if I do not know the person they might actually be one of the gems amongst the refuse, and are thus worthy of a chance to prove themselves to be a fine person.  <br><br>In the end I could not care less where you hunt, the gear you wear, or what MOBs you have killed.  You could not hope to impress me with it.  None of the matters even remotely to me.  What matters to me is how you play the game.  How you treat others and interact with them.  Sadly it seems a general symptom of ubers that you cannot treat people with even a modicrum of respect.  Thusly I have no respect for those of you that are like this (about 80% of you). You don't care?  Well guess what?  Neither do I.  <br><br>P.S.: If I have offended anyone in an uber guild who is actually a decent human being I apologize.  However methinks you should look around more closely at your &quot;friends&quot;, that is unless you are scared what you may see.  If a retort was not wanted Flatin, I guess you should not have left the thread open. <p><img src="http://members.fortunecity.com/samslade/shadcon/Images/wizard.jpg" width="150" height="150"><BR>Kaludram Aderlas, <i>Master of Shadows</i> for the <a href=http://www.theshadowcongress.com>Shadow Congress</a>...<i>arrogance personified</i></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon3.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usomberlainwayfaerer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Somberlain Wayfaerer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 128<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/20/02 4:10:05 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=5>Reply</a>    <br>Community Supporter<br> </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> I've had my share of &quot;incidents&quot; with people who I consider to be bad players, unable to peacefully coexist with others.  Whether they be rude, blatantly disregarding the PnP or just plain mean, it is something that has little to do with the game and a lot to do with the type of person they are.  Whenever possible, I try to remind myself that someone with a bad attitude can still be an expert player, and whether you're talking about schoolyard kickball or the NBA draft or EverQuest guilds, every team wants the best players.  There are plenty of players who can act like perfect angels in guildchat, but are obnoxious and disrespectful when their guildies aren't around.  That's not exclusive to any type of guild either, large or small.  Bad people might be skilled players, and can get into the best guilds.  The problem (pertaining to guilds) is that, as Kaludram pointed out, dealing with a particular guild can have very mixed results.  I've had to &quot;put out some fires&quot; after getting complaints from people about guild members who did something that was clearly inappropriate, but that's a fairly easy task in a guild with only 30-some members and usually less than a dozen online at a time.  I know everyone in the guild, at least by name if not personally.  But in a huge guild, regardless of &quot;uber&quot; status, you might find that everyone doesn't know everyone else.  And let's face it -- EQ is a game where reputation goes a long way, but only to a point.  Once you are nearing lvl 60 and what/who you need to get what you want, the simple fact is that you don't NEED to care what other people think, outside of your guild and/or circle of friends.<br><br>The attitude of individual players is the most important thing.  Being &quot;uber&quot; is not some sort of personality disorder, nor should be be a &quot;bad guy&quot; label.  Good players and bad players alike have equal opportunity to succeed in the high level game.  It's all about how a person treats their fellow player. <p>Somberlain Wayfaerer<BR>Wanderer of Druzzil Ro<BR>Guild Leader of the Justice Knights<BR><a href="http://www.geocities.com/justiceknights/jk.html">www.geocities.com/justiceknights</a> <BR></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ualihjazanzibar.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alihja Zanzibar</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Alihjadomis</span><br>  Posts: 893<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/20/02 5:53:37 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://www.rutabaga-paradox.org/images/mullet.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> I don't hate the man, and I don't hate the guild.

People will want to push ahead, do what they know they CAN do before thinking about how it will effect others. This is where leadership is important. The leaders of a guild determine how the guild will behave. That's who the blame should go to first and foremost. That's also where the credit should go to, depending on the actions as you see them.<br><br>I do not agree with what some guilds on this server have done or will do, but I only really point blame at the leaders of those guilds. I will, though, not go out of my way to do anything for/with the members of that guild because /guildremove is not difficult to type. Anyone who stands by a guild that constantly behaves in a way I disagree with passively agrees with their guild.<br><br>As for Zerixia, I am one of those people that have counted her as a lost friend. Not simply because she is in Vindication, but because her reasoning for helping Vindication do what they did in NToV was insulting to me. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usynthehateblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synthe Hateblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/angry/demon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 35<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/20/02 11:27:02 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=12>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: ...</span><hr size=1> /buys Wavern a beer <p><b><p align=center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18464><font color=990000> Revenant of Mythic Legion</font></a></b><b><p align=center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=32817><font color=999999> Rogue of Mythic Legion</a></b></font></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=mav>Mav</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/21/02 1:12:18 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=13>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> I'm sure ppl will not take this in the context it is meant, but I mean no disrespect to anyone, these are just questions I've always wondered about and with the current situation, seems like a good time to ask the questions.  <br><br>First thing, I've been with Fiz on raids and I've been totally impressed with his attitude and abilities.  He was there to help me when I was clearly out of my league, so to say I like him would be an understatement.  However, people need to understand how things get taken out of content.  When he said &quot;I've gotten really tired of the overall attitude of people who don't play the high end game and blame US, the uber guilds for their inadequacies. &quot; I was offended.  As I read it it said I was &quot;inadequate&quot; for not being or wanting to be uber.  Maybe it's not what he meant, but it is things like that that cause ppl to look down on uber players, however innocent it was intended.<br><br>But the thing I really wonder about is all of this discussion over who did what to who and why and how they didn't follow the rules.  I guess what I mean is...are these really rules?  And its not just this discussion of &quot;leapfrogging&quot; but it goes all the way down the line.  Whether you're camping the hunter in TT or DVinn or ??? someone will eventually come in and want to do the same.  Someone will always shout out something to the affect of &quot;Everyone knows that when you are camping the hunter you have full rights on the rares and you will just have to leave or just wait until we are done.&quot;  First of all, not everyone knows.  Secondly, where are these rules written?  I have checked and checked my manual and while it does mention &quot;play nice&quot; (whatever that means, sounds like my mother talking to me when I was 5) I see nothing on specific mobs or camps with rules I have to follow.  Where this is going is, while I would never condone or be a part of leapfrogging a group like was done (If I knew I was doing something wrong that is) it certainly isn't a violation of any rules I have read.  Quite the contrary, being a role playing game, it has to be part of the experience.  Not everyone is going to roleplay an angel.  <br><br>What I found missing from the whole discussion, was what were ppl going to do about it.  Certainly name calling isn't going to change a thing.  Saying the server is going to hell isn't the answer.  And complaining that one guild doesn't recognize the rotation rules set forth by some other organization (IGB?  or what ever the initials are) solves nothing. <br><br>I think some are missing out on the excitment of a roleplaying game.  (and I dont mean you have to roleplay) but as I see it Vindication threw down the gauntlet and now its time to see how the others react.  There is more to EQ then camping for hours on end to kill some mob, loot it and start all over again.  There is interaction and adaption to changes.  [These are my opionions and I'm sorry if it sounds like they have to be yours.] But what is it about EverQuest that supercedes this?  Why does it seem like people want things handed to them on a platter and complain, rather then adapt when they aren't?<br><br>Not trying to belittle the people who got skipped over.  I would be upset as well.  I can feel their pain.  By the time you are level 2 at least 5 people have messed with you and it just grows from there.  Admittedly, losing a bat kill is not the same as losing a dragon kill, but getting screwed over is relative, regardless of the intensity or magnitude of the infraction.<br><br>I don't know, just seems like something is missing.  I would like to think the other top guilds (I hate the phase uber) are working towards a resolution and that they wouldn't want to post their plans here.  That would be understandable but I doubt if anything but the passage of time will come to fruitition.<br><br>Sorry for taking up your time.  I just wonder if I'm wrong for thinking of EQ as a &quot;fantasy land&quot; like DnD, TnT, Muds, etc. were or is it just Monopoly with swords.<br><br>Mav<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/usynthehateblade.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Synthe Hateblade</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://community.theunderdogs.org/smiley/angry/demon.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 36<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/21/02 5:41:23 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=14>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> Mav,<br><br>The IGB was a resolution that most guilds used to share the wealth of valuable mobs ingame.

The first post in this thread looks a bit arrogant.  Let's face it.  The post is loaded with insults and boasts.  A &quot;we worked hard to get where we are&quot; argument would have been much better.  But a &quot;don't hate me because I'm special&quot; argument looks arrogant and condescending.   <br> <br>I'm sure the writer didn't intend it to look that way.  He was probably upset when he wrote it and didn't stop to realise how some of his comments might offend other players.<br><br>FWIW, I really don't care about uber guilds.  I don't hate them.  I don't love them.  I have no interaction with them.  I only know one person that's in one.  This subject has no bearing on the life of my characters.  To be honest, if the moderators didn't deem this thread important enough to tack at the top of the board, I might not have even bothered reading it.  <br><br>This leads me to ask the following question:  WHY was it tacked to the top of the board?  The post is directed to people &quot;who hate uber guilds.&quot;  But you don't convince somebody that it's wrong to dislike you by insulting them and bragging about how great you are.  All that will do is make them hate you even more.  I don't think there's anything wrong with somebody posting a rant to get something off their chest.

You've been there and done that so many times that you burn the t-shirts for firewood.<br><br>Hey, Dudley Dursley wannabe, let someone else enjoy the game as much as YOU once did. (wow, a Harry Potter reference, I guess I *am* caught up on modern pop culture...)<br><br>One of the things I respect about guilds like Hoss (although there are others...)  is that they don't HAVE to chest thump about all the stuff they've done.  They just do it.  If you can't share in someone else's success, then at least be an adult and sit back and let em enjoy it.  I understand the value of keeping &quot;kills and loots&quot; on a website.  It's an effective advertisement for more members.  If you don't wanna hear about what these guilds are up to, then DON'T GO TO THE PAGE!  Take ML's website, for example.  <br><br>Here's what we kill<br>Here's how to join<br><br>That's it... NO links to the message boards or other &quot;forums&quot;.  Those are for members, and they keep it to themselves.  Honestly, since I've gone ML, I haven't looked at the &quot;main webpage&quot; since. (oops, I let the cat out of the bag...) I've seen a few other websites devoted to trashing the accomplishments of others.  Diddums not get enough attention as a child? (you know... last week?)  With the piss poor grammar and blatant homophobia, you'd think that some &quot;uber&quot; folks have some serious RL quests to complete.  <br><br>If you are one of the &quot;uber&quot; folks out there, here are a few helpful tips to prevent others from dismissing you as an immature jerk.<br><br>- If someone else talks up their own accomplishments, they're only human.  If you've done it a thousand times, just smile to yourself, type &quot;/say Hey, congratulations, that's cool&quot; and let it go.  You may come across as a semi-nice person.  If you REALLY wanna go overboard, ask em a question or two...<br>&quot;How long did ya have to prep for the Maestro?&quot;  <br>Just SOMETHING to indicate a little interest. (you can fake it, they won't mind.  It shows that you at least care about SOMETHING besides yourself.)<br><br>- If someone is acting like a jerk in your group, flames do NOT help.  Just say &quot;Thanks for the group guys, I've gotta go get my dog out of the dishwasher&quot; or some other &quot;obvious&quot; excuse.  Not only does it allow you to exit the group gracefully, but it indicates (to anyone who isn't completely self-absorbed) that you aren't having fun in this group and that you are going to go elsewhere.  It also manages to convey the idea &quot;I'm better than you&quot; without resorting to playground tactics.  Sometimes, subtlety is useful for &quot;fighting back&quot; against jerks.<br><br>- Finally, if someone is going out of their way to be a jerk to you. (KS'ing, Leapfrogging, stealing your spawns, whatever)<br><br>Ignore them.  Go about your business and don't give them the attention they are looking for.  If they break the rules, petition em and don't waste anymore time on it.  Chances are, nothing will happen except that they will get hassled by a Guide for a few minutes.  I can speak from prior experience, guides DO remember the jerks. <br><br>The short version? (why do all of my posts read like novels?)<br><br>Act like an adult and you won't HAVE to tell anyone how great you are.  People will be able to see it for themselves.<br><br>-Grimmy<br> <p><img src="http://people.atl.mediaone.net/kstallard/Pictures/grimsam.jpg"></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uamankhann45.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Amankhann45</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 91<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/21/02 2:13:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=19>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: To those who hate uber guilds...</span><hr size=1> Grimthorn now has my vote for Dwarf of the Year.

ML is like the US, they try and help out other guilds with issues(IE epic/planar pieces we have no need for, we ask if someone knows someone who needs and share the planes with others). they dont flame any guild. its against our policy, NO flames. as for zerixia, i tried to be your friend even after you joined Vindi, hell i argued in your favor in my guild. then when i ask why you are helping vindi go FFA on L`malla's turn in ToV this time when you said 'I am tired of waiting for a busted up rotation'. you also said me and my guild are jealous of you and were very antagonistic towards me. this was the second time you had basically said i fucking suck,and i was supposed to be your friend.i had got NOTHING but HATE from you towards me and my friends. hell i forgave you the first time and you apologized for being a dick. Vindi also said that they dont need anything from anybody and the next day at least once , one of our clerics got asked for a rez from one of your members.<br>NOTE: THE LAST PARTS WERE NOT FLAMES BUT STATEMENTS OF FACT,MODERATORS CAN CENSOR/ALTER TO THEIR LIKING IF THEY FEEL IT IS TOO FLAME LIKE.IT IS ALSO NOT A PERSONAL ATTACK OF ZERIXIA.SHE WAS USED ALOT IN THIS POST BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONLY MEMBER IN VINDICATION THAT I TALKED TO OFTEN ENOUGH TO GET ANY BEARING ON WHAT IS GOING ON,AND I DONT USE SECONDHAND INFORMATION BECAUSE I CANNOT CONFIRM IT.ALL THIS INFO WAS CONFIRMED BY ME TO BE TRUTH AND IS USED TO COUNTERACT SOME PREVIOUS STATEMENTS MADE ON THIS THREAD.<br><br>everyone else can read and make their own judgements<br> <p>Why bake cookies when you can steal them<BR>                                       <a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=17343> Auedaar Mystique</a><a href=http://www.ffmusiconline.com/ff6/disc3/08-Gogo.mid><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/pcs/gogo/laugh.gif></a> <BR><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18067>Jelilu Spinesplitter</a><a href=http://www.ffmusiconline.com/FF6/Disc1/11-Shadow.mid><img src=http://www.rpgicons.com/images/icons/ff6/pcs/shadow/anger.gif></a><BR></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top">  Page  <b>1</b> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=21&stop=40>2</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=41&stop=60>3</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=61&stop=80>4</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=81&stop=100>5</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=101&stop=120>6</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=121&stop=140>7</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=141&stop=160>8</a><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showMessageRange?topicID=94.topic&start=161&stop=176>9</a> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=94.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showNextMessage?topicID=94.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=94.topic&index=20><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/grunge/addReply.jpg border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=94.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.threadControl?topicID=94.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/professional/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands (Moderator only)</a><br> <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=94.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=94.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub16.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="druzzilro86846generaldiscussion">General Discussion<option value="druzzilro86846frm10">IRL<option value="druzzilro86846frm8">Raids Reservation Board<option value="druzzilro86846marketplace">Market Place<option value="druzzilro86846questsinfoandhelp">Quests, Info and help<option value="druzzilro86846frm7">Role-Players and Story-Tellers<option value="druzzilro86846frm11">The Admin Vault<option value="druzzilro86846frm12">Raid Archive<option value="druzzilro86846frm9">The Void<option value="druzzilro86846frm13">Polls<option value="druzzilro86846frm15">Gigglalot's Crap</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#CCCCC8>- </font><a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bdruzzilro86846>Druzzil Ro</a><font color=#CCCCC8> -
