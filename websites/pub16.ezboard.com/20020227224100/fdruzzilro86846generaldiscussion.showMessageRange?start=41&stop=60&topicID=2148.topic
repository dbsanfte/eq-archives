L`malla wants the IGB back and to be used. L`Malla wants rotations as well.<br>

I hope that was clear.<br>

Lets give up on the fighting here. I actually disagree with muh boss (Dlgoth) and agree that we should just choose a neutral forum. I hate EZboard, but I'm not an officer or IGB representative so it's no skin off my back. Pick a place that fills the need and no one can argue about.

<br>
All I took that to mean, was that you weren't willing to fight for your guild.  Your officers were, while you were gone.  <br>
<br>
I was extremely surprised to see your posts to the contrary once you returned.<br>
<br>
&quot;Things going back to rotations&quot;, as you put it, wasn't going to happen by magic.  Someone had to do something.<br>
<br>
ML wasn't about to sit around and let Vindication stomp on us, and we invited you to join us in fighting letting them stomp on anyone.<br>
<br>
So by your inaction, yeah, you were pro-FFA.   By your statements to &quot;adapt&quot; you were pro-FFA.  <br>
<br>
If someone comes into my house and shits all over the place, I don't adapt, I fight, is the point.<br>
<br>
ML was willing to fight, and ML has been pushing this return-to-rotation for weeks.  <br>
<br>
Now, you agree it's a good thing to do.  Do you really care if your pointer to &quot;IGB&quot; on your browser isn't the Hoss site?  <br>
<br>
It's important to ML that we not return there.  You've said you really don't care where it is, but you're goddamning here like it's the end of the world if you do.<br>
<br>
Who's the one being stubborn.<br>
<br>
And no one's trying to &quot;pit anyone against anyone&quot; Dlgoth.  You seem to constantly be looking in the shadows for ulterior motives where ML is concerned.  <br>

It's clear that a return to some kind of IGB is wanted.<br>

Rohaise created a board for that purpose, agreeing to give up administrative rights.<br>
<br>
Alihija has created a board for that purpose as well.  Alihija has even gone to great lengths to point out how this forum is maintained by reps of several different guilds making it as unbiased as possible.<br>
<br>
And yet you guys can still manage to get into a shouting match over who said what to whom way back the day before nobody cares when.  From this, only one point has been made clear to the rest of us who have read along with your little pissing match.  There are a bunch of children running many of the guilds on this server.  Immature, ignorant, bitter little children.  I mean I know that EQ attracts some immature people, but this is beyond anything I ever imagined.  (I'm fighting the urge to name names, but I don't have to.

<br>
   First off as far as L`Malla was concerned we dealt with the FFA situation best we could.  It has been stated that when you have 1 guild go FFA the rest of the guilds can't try to follow a rotation. This is true.   <br>
<br>
   As for L`Malla being pro FFA I don't think anyone in L`Malla liked the FFA environment.  As for the statements that we were sitting on the fence im not sure I agree with that.  Tell me what could have been done while you have 1 guild claiming FFA and the rest not?  We went about our business killed what MoB's were up didnt try to jump or KS anyone else.<br>
Correct me if im wrong but is this not the only thing you can do in that environment? <br>
<br>
   The only way things would get back to a rotation is if Vindi got tired of not getting spawns or they break up.  Well they seem to be disbanding so hence we look at going back to rotation.  I read a post that ML has been trying to get back to rotation for 3 weeks now, but how / what were you doing to get back to rotation?  Killing everything you could? Thats exactly what we were doing.<br>
<br>
   I really dislike the politics in the game, but we have to deal with them.  I know all the GM's / Officers stick up for their guilds and this is part of it. I know I wouldnt want Dlgoth's job dealing with all the problems.  IMO all you GM's / Officers got a hell of a load on your backs.<br>
<br>
   IMO there is no savior here ie: we did this you did that now things are better.  Only reason IGB or rotation is (hopefully) comming back is because Vindi seems to be disbanding.<br>
<br>
   Maybe things will get back to normal soon.  Everyone needs to just calm down and get together and work it out.<br>
      <br>

ML is not ruling Druzzil Ro.<br>

So i would say to find a solution ML has to give in at certain points too not just say &quot;we want this we want that &quot;<br>
No one is in the position to dictate how this will be done.<br>

If you want an IGB type board then everyone has to agree and cooperate, even if it is just the where and when. I dont see that here so far.<br>

I do not plan on registering for any new forums until agreements are reached as to how the IGB will be run from this point forward.  These discussions should not take place in a public forum.<br>

<br>
EVERYONE is going to have to compromise to what each other wants. ML coming and stating &quot;We want this or we won't play in your sandbox&quot; is no different than Vindication leaving the IGB rotation. It's one group dictating to the rest of the world how things will be.<br>
<br>
As for the whole 'sitting on the fence' nonsense, if you think this server COULD have continued to operate under a rotation while one guild simply took what they wanted, then you completely delusional. Both Hoss and L'malla understood this. I guess I don't know why ML and other guilds can't see this. It's a lot like the gun control issue. If you take away the guns from law abiding citizens, the only people who now have the guns are those who don't care about the law in the 1st place. If we stuck to a rotation amongst ourselved while Vindication ran FFA.. our rotation would be worthless.<br>
<br>
And for that matter.. how would you have 'stopped' Vindication from doing what they did? To deny them spawns or block them in game is explicitly against the EULA. So we couldn't stop them anyway, and instead chose to try and make the best of a bad situation.<br>
<br>
It seems everyone wants to return to some form of IGB Rotation. Stop dictating how things will be, start TALKING to the other guilds, and work out a set of compromises everyone can live with. It seems there are several options already laid out as a starting point. All you have to do is try one.<br>
<br>
Time to stop the dick measuring contest and start cooperating with each other to make this thing happen.<br>

All these post spewing about Pro FFA and and accusing other guilds they would let Vindi do what they want.<br>
What did ML do to keep vindi from spawns?? NOTHING <br>
This is plain bs you are bringing up, ML isnt better because you got Ntov twice in a row and Hoss L malla didnt.<br>
If you really think that then you are in for a big surprise.<br>
<br>
I cant believe how people can still follow this holier then you shit you are preaching on this board since Vindi went ffa and hoss killed the sleeper.<br>
<br>
<br>
Lets see i compare what ML did to what L Malla did after Vindi went ffa..... ML spent 23 hours in Ntov to clear it great ...L malla went to fear killed cazic killed yel and i think to remember something else but not sure there.<br>
Why are you better then L Malla if they did just the same as you???and dont tell me you wanted to stop vindi with both guilds at the same time at the same spot. Everyone here knows that working with 2 guilds on 1 mob is pretty hard and mostly end in a failure.<br>

I'm glad to see that you're suddenly compassionate for the people you were laughing at, mugging, swearing at, and bowling over just three weeks ago.  <br>
<br>
Reading the Vindication news of your mastery of Druzzil, was always the high point of my day.<br>
<br>
Feel free to continue the flames, Urgas.  I'm wearing asbestos. =)<br>

I appreciate your concern, and your sincere comments. <br>

<br>
This is right up there with &quot;Korean War Peace Talks Break Down Due to Shape of Conference Table&quot; and other blunders of diplomacy.<br>
<br>
I ain't claiming to be all-wise or all-knowing, but if Hoss won't talk on a board run by ML, and ML won't talk on a board run by Hoss, then it sounds to me like Alihja's idea is the most sensible.  Pick a Switzerland, a neutral 3rd party that everyone can trust and accept.<br>
<br>
Even adults need mediators from time to time, there's no shame in it.<br>
<br>
I've got friends in Hoss, I was *in* ML (until recently) , and I know people in just about EVERY high end guild.  You guys want the same stuff, so sit down and HANDLE it.<br>
<br>
Roh, Moose, nothing but love for you both, but dredging up the &quot;wrongs&quot; done in the past won't solve anything.  There is no moral high ground to be occupied here. &quot;All are punished!&quot; -- William Shakespeare<br>
<br>
Elidroth, I admire your drive in trying to make this HAPPEN, but I disagree with &quot;So we couldn't stop them anyway&quot;.  Prevent? no, but you could have made it very inconvenient for Vindication to go FFA, assuming that you and Hoss were interested in doing so.  Sometimes, fighting doesn't FORCE someone into a behavior, it just makes it such a pain in the ass that the other party feels like stopping.<br>
<br>
Urgas, I'm not sure what you're trying to achieve. As I said before, there is no moral high ground here, but if there was, you and your guild damn sure wouldn't be on it.  You hit one point on the head though... &quot;No one is in the position to dictate how this will be done.&quot;  Everyone has to give a little to get a little.  Vindication should have remembered that when it went FFA.  Surely you can understand that many people in other guilds resent your guild's actions.  If you are trying to be part of the solution, then you should absolutely be included in the discussions, but ranting at Baramos isn't gonna get ya much, or get you taken seriously. (not that you seem to care)<br>
<br>
<br>
Resist the urge to demand compensation for past grievances, this is the root of all broken truces. Concentrate instead on what must be done to maintain the peace.  - Some old guy... (look it up)<br>

<br>
Any way, What I want to know is what about Vindication?  Are they gone?  If not then how will an IGB even work?  This is not a flame at Vindi for FFA or anything else but are people counting Vindi as gone too soon? or even that they might not be going anywhere? <p>Cherick Bearshoulders

MD5 encryption CANNOT be reversed.  You can't take an MD5 string and convert it into what the password is, because its possible for near-infinate combinations of data to generate the same digest.  Hell, Andaas has Vegar and myself do PHP work on the hoss site because hes not super familiar with it.  Sorry Roh, Andy ain't the reet hacker you think he is.<br>
<br>
Andaas is the nicest person I ever met in EQ.  I'm sick and tired of reading this crap about him from ML.  This is the biggest reason I have a problem with ML officers in the first place.  I'm so glad I'm not an officer so I don't have to control myself.<br>

Aside on encryption: The fact that the *distribution* of the message board software uses MD5 is meaningless. It would be child's play to modify the Perl (or whatever language it is written in) to have it just not use MD5 and store passwords in plaintext.<br>
