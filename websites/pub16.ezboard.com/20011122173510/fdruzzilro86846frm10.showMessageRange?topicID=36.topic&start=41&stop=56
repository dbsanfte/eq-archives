This effort is about far more than Bin Ladin.<br>
<br>
He's the face-man of an organization that probably has 3,000 to 5,000 active members and 10 times that many supporting members. . . not including the soon-to-be defunct government of Afghanistan.<br>

I will find one though that I can use to sum up my feelings on what most of you have had to say:<br>
<br>
America has the most well equipped military force in the world, are say we are unable to get Bin Laden without blowing up Afgahistan and all of the innocent people that live there? Are you saying we can't track the movements of ONE man? You don't think very highly of America's ability do you?<br>
<br>
<br>
Tracking and killing one person can be done........but you know what?  It would have to be done on the ground........and where does that lead us?  That leads us to sending aluminum, flag draped caskets back home to their parents.......to their children........to their wives......more of our boys killed for their country, because the citizens of their OWN FUCKING COUNTRY didn't have the balls or guts to stand behind them...........you guys bitch and moan about &quot;killing more innocent people&quot;..........I say tough shit.  Kill them all, and let God sort them out.  You guys want targets singled out and killed with one bullet?  Then you grab your gun and go do it, don't expect others to put their lives on the line doing something so stupid as singling out military targets..........at least from the air we can knock the shit out of them with little to no losses to our men.  It enfuriates the hell out of me to see people whining and complaining about civilian losses in other countries....those of you that claim to have served, you were probably in the admin field I'm guessing..........writing nice stories for the base paper and stuff.......if we &quot;take it easy&quot; on them, and make this conflict like a ping pong tournament, we WILL have heavy casualties, and then what?  MORE TERRORISM!!!!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!  Dead soldiers=less protection.........you guys need to get with the program and back the fuck away from your monitor......it's eating what's left of your brain cells...........<br>

<br>
that country that we are currently blowing the everloving snot out of is almost 3/4 made up of people that feel and support the same feelings as bin Ladin...and are shooting back...for this alone THEY AS WELL ARE THE TARGET....these people wether lead by bin Ladin or Mickey Mouse are quite capable of committing much more than what has been done...bin Ladin acting as a leader...if he wasn't it would be someone else.<br>
<br>
don't forget these people are firing back....and don't forget that we are giving food to those few people that don't support those intentions<br>
<br>
the target is terrorizm and terrorists...we must remain as we have as always OPEN and FREE...to do this we must do what we can to stop people from using that to their advantage<br>
<br>
We are an OPEN and FREE country....BUT....We are also BIG, STRONG and Prosperous........<br>
<br>
America is willing to help almost any group of people on the face of the earth as long as we agree with their intentions...<br>
<br>
Murder is defined as killing directly for no reason...Killing for war is not Murder....no where near .... if we don't stop or kill them they will not hesitate to elimiate us...if we don't stop them in their tracks they will be able to target much, much more than 2 towers filled with people.....so when you say Murder be sure what you say....<br>
<br>
if i were to kill my neighbor for no reason that IS murder<br>
if i were to let someone kill more people than i now in one day, have some ability to have an effect to them, and not do anything to allow them to continue that is Stupidity....<br>
<br>
I have never and hope to never attempt to shoot or kill any person in my life...but if a person shoots my mother or my sister or my dog even... and take a position to kill the rest of the family i have left i will take action against that person before they can do it<br>

I'm sure everyone here has heard of the infamous Ladi S. temper. Here's ya chance to see it and if ya don't wanna see it? Close this browser window, NOW.<br>
<br>
Coronado? Go fuckin get laid. You definately have way too much testosterone building up, you need to release it. If ya ain't got the money to hire a hooker, lemme know. I'll gladly donate some of my VETERAN'S DISABILITY check to you.<br>
<br>
Not once in any of my posts did I say that we should NOT erradicate the force behind the WTC AND PENTAGON tragedy. Yea, you heard me. PENTAGON. Remember? That place with the big fuckin HOLE in the side of it? MY military brothers and sisters dead simply for being there?<br>
<br>
Guess what, jerk off? I WAS NOT ADMIN in the military. Sure, I had a day job. But my nite job was the Auxillary Security Force. It was runnin around with a BIG BAD FUCKIN SHOTGUN IN MY HAND, ready to kill, maim and destroy ANYONE who threatened my MILITARY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.<br>
<br>
You completely missed the entire POINT of the reason I posted here. I agreed with the idea of blowing the ever living SHIT outta the assholes who did this to MY AMERICA. THE ONLY THING I ASKED FOR WAS A LIL THOUGHT BEFORE ACTING.<br>
<br>
I don't want some ne'er-been-laid-asshole-with-too-much-pent-up-jism-in-his-system runnin around wreaking more havoc than is NECESSARY. There comes a point and time when we all need to sit back and THINK before acting.<br>
<br>
Think it, plan it, execute it. Simple enough.<br>
<br>
When we made our mock-up plans for defending our base, we planned what to do and how to do it. When we made plans to INVADE our very own base, we THOUGHT about it, then did it.<br>
<br>
One of my jobs in the military took me to a building that was created for one purpose and one purpose only. Planning wars. Did you know that the entire WWII was PREPLANNED? The only thing we did NOT expect was the hit on Pearl Harbor.<br>
<br>
That's right, asshole. WE KNEW WHAT WE WERE DOING and I am proud to say that I was there to see some of the GREATEST military minds in my day gathering to plan for future events.<br>
<br>
I saw people of damn near EVERY NATIONALITY on earth gather for one reason and one reason only: PLAN SOMEONE ELSE'S DEMISE.<br>
<br>
Don't you EVER denounce me or any of my military brothers and sisters again. You may or may not have been military, I don't know, but you do NOT know who you are speaking to nor do you know who you are addressing.<br>
<br>
I've seen my share of horrors, others have seen worse. When we ask for thought before execution, we know why we ask. We know what will come from it.<br>
<br>
Again, pardon my temper. Pardon my insolence in daring to think that I could speak for more than myself when I post this. <p><center>Ladi Sarinja<br>

I've heard a lot about what it's like to be in the military and how hard it is, etc. but I've never lived the experience so I've got a lot of respect for our soldiers, marines, navy, air force, etc.<br>
<br>
Just my 2cp, but I think it is a lot easier to lay off on sending in the ground troops who have to be the ones to pull the trigger; and just de-personalize it all and hit the big red button and blow Afghanistan off the face of the Earth, and hope to God that you'll be forgiven for that action. <br>
<br>
Again, I'm not a soldier so I have no first-hand knowledge of the technicalities of it all; but from a psychological standpoint, I think hitting the &quot;Nuke&quot;-button is easier than having to stand face-to-face with the enemy and shoot him. <br>
<br>
It seems live one of those tough choices: Spend precious time and money seeking out a cure for the cancerous tumor in your arm... or just amputate the entire limb? If you &quot;cure&quot; it, great... but there's the chance that the cancer has already spread. And who knows? It could pop up in your lungs in a month or two. It's a really tough decision, I think.<br>

If they do that, I will back them 100%. Guaranteed. Take that to the bank and cash it in, it's golden. <p><center>Ladi Sarinja<br>

Well I grew up in the street of Brooklyn, where everyday the simple task of walking down the street to go to the store was an adventure.  I grew up at the height of the crack epidemic.  Turf wars, guns and drug gangs were the norm.  Would I kill if necessary... Hell yes.  Would I have the courage to shoot a man, woman or child in the face if I had to?  Sadly.... Yes.  I'm not proud of this at all.  This is pretty shameful that I would do something like this if I felt I had to.  I want to be a good man, and this isn't the mark of a good man.  Would that now be something to be proud of if it was a country? Life is very special, and it only takes ignorant-backwood-assholes like you to not see it and start a World War.<br>
<br>
Now I ask you this, most of the people that I know that have lived through war, agree with the idea that killing innocent civilian should be avoided if possible.  You seem to think that it should be a requirement.  Jackass.  If the folks that have gone through hell feel that we can do something other than bomb civilians, why do you think we should?  Come out of your trailer park home and see the rest of the world.  America isn't the only place on the map.  The world is filled with people that live, love, feel pain and sorrow, have children and something watch them die.  You seem to think only Americans have these feelings, but all you do is reveal just how ignorant you are by what you say.  You somehow think America is so righteous... but have you ever asked the people that have served this country do they feel that way?  They know America has tons of dirty little secrets.  The politicans have bad reputations for a reason.<br>
<br>
Do I feel it's ok to see American soldiers die?  Nope.  But I'd rather see a MAN die instead of 100 innocent people.  Maybe you see a difference between Afghan people and American people, but I don't.  We are all people.  You say they hate America.  Well they have good reason to harbor those feelings.  Yeah I heard what the President said about the &quot;attack on Freedom&quot;... that's bullshit.  Think for yourself for a sec..wait... you're too stupid for that.  Well read a ... oops!  Another avenue you can't explore (I hear RIF works).  Well there must be something you can research to find out some info that isn't given on the idiot box.  Find it, and learn.<br>
<br>
In spite of all of that, I still love this country, and I wouldn't want to leave it.  Even so, I refuse to believe everything they tell me.  Don't forget, this is the same country that told Black people they are less than human.  This is the same country they nearly extermination the Native American for the good of said country.  This is the same country that placed thousands of Asian Americans in concentration camps during WWII.  This is the same country that trained many of the Bin Laden's associates in the art of assasination.  I refuse to blindly accept every tid of information that the American government and media gives me.  If America can target a person's home, and kill their family, without harming anyone else, (those that know will understand) we have to ability to target only the things that are necessary to bomb.<br>
<br>
I'm gonna close this now.  Please go back to the Trail park and watch Jerry Springer.  At least you could feel at home.<br>
