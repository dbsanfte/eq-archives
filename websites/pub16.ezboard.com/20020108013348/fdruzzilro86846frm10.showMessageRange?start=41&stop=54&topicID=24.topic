The US has had embargoes against Cuba for how long? And Castro doesn't look any thinner.  Typically, the leaders live comfortably and then blame the &quot;embarger&quot; for the suffering of the people, getting the people's support.  That's one reason why very poor countries have enmity towards the US - propaganda has told them that the US is partly responsible for their conditions.<br>

Probably not. What about the bishop of your local diocese?  If not, why would the Pakistanis know who all the Taliban are?  This is a loosely organized theocracy scattered across the whole nation.  They may have some uniformed troops - those would be the easy victories. But if you stay long enough to actually try to find all the terrorists, the uniforms would quickly be hucked in favor of unconventional warfare.<br>
<br>
These people have experience in unconventional warfare.  They put a lot of hurt on the Spetznaz - some pretty elite troops - who were willing to take measures a lot more brutal than any American commander would ever be allowed to take.<br>
<br>
An all out land war would be an amazingly bad idea.  Negotiate with the Taliban to put Bin Laden on trial in the world court. Put a bounty on his head. Even send in some assassins and kill him.  Do the same with his lieutenants.  Please don't kill thousands of young American men and women in a land war that cannot be won. <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>

They Muhjahadeen are bad boys, I will give you that. Last time we tried to win a war with out the people, we lost, I will ceed that aswell. You ever think that the brutality of the Speznas are what made the Afganies fight like they did? Force will end this, but we need to get to the point where force needs to be applied. I have nothing against Afgani people or any other people for that matter. I am pretty sure most of them have nothing against me. They hate the Taliban for the most part, but they have little control over it (cause they don't hate them enough). We don't go in old west like, guns a roaring. We go in to Pakistan, hook up with the people at the refuge camps, make some friends with the TWO MILLION people who have fled Afganastan and the Taliban. We Talk with the NA make some friends there aswell. We fight on our terms not theres.<br>

sorry about all the flack I tossed your way. I was a bit fired up earlier. I wholeheartedly dont agree with you, but nonetheless I was pissed off when I posted.<br>

You know, comparing the problems the soviets had in Afghanistan to problems that we are likely to face is well, logical dont get me wrong, but more like the comparisons the experts made between Dien Bien Phu and Khe Sanh....they had LBJ so scared he had a mock up made of Khe Sanh in the Whitehouse basement. But as history proved the two battles, while looking similiar on the outside were actually very different under the surface. Same thing in Afghanistan. There is a huge difference between what and how the soviets fought there and how we would today. The differences are significant. We would have more air mobility, better and faster striking capability, better intel, better logistics, and be more resistant to the weapon systems the Afghani's deploy, than say the soviet military circa ~1975 was. Plus a key to understanding their experience there was the fact that the soviet effort in Afghanistan was heavily dependent on the roads for movement, logistics, etc etc. The Muhajadeen was a perfect match to waging a guerrilla war against a road bound foe. Not to mention their anti-armor and vehicle weapons were much more effective against the front line soviet armor and armoed vehicles used in that era.<br>
<br>
 I dont think there will be a large ground war in Afghanistan, but I do see a sizeable U.S. ground presence etsablished there (or in the region) in order to support our special operations which will undoubtedly be the teeth of our war against the terrorists in the region. I think if it did indeed develop in to a ground war we would have much different and better results than the Soviets did.<br>

Oh yeah, the Spetsnatz and Soviet air assault operations in Afghanistan were hugely successful. The Soviets simply didnt have the resources at the time to carry them out at a level that would have destroyed the Muhajadeen. The #1 thing they were afraid of _were_ the soviet spetsnatz. These guys would come in on them unseen, unknown and would kick the everliving shit out of them. And also remember this was all done and carried out with circa~1975 military hardware, intelligence gathering capability, etc etc. For instance, you ever seen an MLRS in action? Its called the grid square killer, because it can take out, utterly destroy anything in a 1k by 1k square. The Iraqis were panicked by it, calling it the &quot;steel rain&quot;....thats just an example. What I'm getting at is while on the outside there maybe some comparisons made between the Soviet action in afghanistan in the 70s to 80s and a potential modern day U.S. one, it would be a very different situation this time around.<br>

<br>
Who are you?  President Bush incognito? Or maybe Colin Powell?  No wait - your rigorous and highly analytical posts on these military matters betrays you - you must be Guderian or Moltke or perhaps Klausewitz.  Or are you Napoleon?<br>
<br>
If you are going to argue with me give me some actual points to discuss, rather than vague allusions to greatness.  A good first step would be to watch Belegir and learn from him.<br>
<br>
<br>
Belegir&gt;We would have more air mobility, better and faster striking<br>
Belegir&gt;capability, better intel, better logistics, and be more resistant to<br>
Belegir&gt;the weapon systems the Afghani's deploy, than say the soviet<br>
Belegir&gt;...<br>
Belegir&gt;carried out with circa~1975 military hardware, intelligence<br>
Belegir&gt;gathering capability, etc etc. For instance, you ever seen an<br>
Belegir&gt;MLRS in action? Its called the grid square killer, because it can<br>
Belegir&gt;take out, utterly destroy anything in a 1k by 1k square.<br>
<br>
I have passing familiarity with current military technologies.  That being said, I think they are largely irrelevant.  There is no known technology for figuring out which villager is a peasant and which one is the enemy.  You could ask the villagers - but they won't tell you, because if they do, the enemy who you miss will torture the villagers to death after your unit moves out. In another post you said the standing Afghan army is very small/non-existent - absolutely right.  They do have, however, a large body of men who are well trained in unconventional warfare. It doesn't take any technology to create a toe popper or a punji stick, and there isn't any good technology for detecting them.<br>
<br>
<br>
Belegir&gt;I dont think there will be a large ground war in Afghanistan, but<br>
Belegir&gt;I do see a sizeable U.S. ground presence etsablished there (or<br>
Belegir&gt;in the region) in order to support our special operations which<br>
Belegir&gt;will undoubtedly be the teeth of our war against the terrorists<br>
Belegir&gt;in the region.<br>
<br>
If we focus on limited operations to take out key targets (although I would like to know how you propose identifying those targets), with only a holding action for a small base of operations that is completely militarized and not in a significant population center, then there is some chance of success. If we do attempt a full scale ground war we will be SOL precisely because the enemy will become invisible.  Even if you could eventually find all of the enemy, the American will would crumble after the first few thousand casualties.<br>

If somehow it did then you'd all better start cutting your throats now because then we are doomed to an enemy that currently doesnt have the means but certainly has the will to destroy us. Wait til they do get the means then it will be bye bye.<br>
<br>
I dont think this is going to be a pacification of the populace like we did in Vietnam. We will identify our targets beforehand, we will know what we have to destroy in order to complete the mission in Afgahanistan and then we will go in at lightning speed and take them out. You need to remember people like Colin Powell are watching over this operation. If you ever read about Powell the one thing he has is a lot of criticism for how we fought Vietnam. The mistakes we made there will not be allowed to happen again. I think perhaps if we fought some long duration ground war in Afghanistan then perhaps we may have to deal with the problem you suggest. These guys cannot play the role of the rice paddy farmer forever. When they move, or as President Bush calls it, &quot;when we get them running&quot; we will come in and get them.<br>
<br>
Now from a purely conventional standpoint I think there would be considerable difference between our experience and the one the soviets faced in the 70s to 80s.<br>
<br>
The terrain is rough, thats a given....but honestly for this type of operation, or for putting troops on the ground it is more favorable than the jungles of vietnam. Our strengths-air support (mobility and ground support), technical intelligence, concentration of firepower, are in more favorable terrian in Afghanistan than they were in the deep jungles of Vietnam. In afghanistan you have cover, but you dont have concealment. In Vietnam you had an abundance of concealment. I'll chose anyday to put my enemy behind a big rock and know hes there, rather than take away the rock and make him invisible.<br>

What about the people of Troy (wiped out)?  War is an ugly thing, but pacifism isn't a relevant argument to this case.  While I am not ready to completely dismiss pacifism, I think it is very clear that in cases like this philosophical pacifism is nonsense.<br>
<br>
Getting back to the original thread - it seems that the calls for war and strong action are increasing in pitch, not decreasing.  I was very disheartened (but not surprised) today when a radio program hosted by Judicial Watch had one of their commentators saying something to the effect of, &quot;well, we can either continue to follow a policy of appeasement with the Palestinians, or we can use a military solution to get rid of them...&quot; These words were very chilling - if such genocidal attitudes are becoming en vogue then one really has to ask if we are on the side of the angels or not. <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>

I think this has the potential to loosely become a cultural war between the West and the Islamic world. For example I think theres a lot of islamic leaders who shake our hands and take our aid packages but secretly cheer the actions of Bin Laden and what his terrorists stand for. Thats just my own .02, but I really think we are going to find that Bin Laden and the radical islamic terrorists had a lot more support in the overall Islamic world than we ever suspected.<br>
