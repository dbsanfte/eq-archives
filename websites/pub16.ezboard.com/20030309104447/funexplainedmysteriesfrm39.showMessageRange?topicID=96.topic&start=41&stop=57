Self replicating?

This sounds a lot like an excuse for not having any &quot;evidence&quot; available.  Once again, you attempt to discredit my &quot;regular sites&quot; without any proof of error whatsoever.<br>

You are the one who is saying the sky isn't blue.  The onus is on you.<br>
<br>
Now lets take a look at your logic.  I say the earth is old because there is years upon years of study and facts to support this, but I am to admit I am wrong because there is limited evidence that the earth is young.  Let me get this straight, I have 100 pieces of evidence that is squashed by your 10 pieces.  If your 10 pieces cancel out my 100, how come my 100 dont cancel out your 10?  I'll tell you why, you are only interested in being right.     <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=neonurd60>neonurd60</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 114<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/1/03 7:15:42 pm)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> <img src="http://unexplained-mysteries.netfirms.com/pi04.gif" align=absmiddle>  Re: The Creation of Mankind</span><hr size=1> It has always seemed to me that Creation and Evolution are the same story told by two different people, a poet and a scientist. This does not devalue the work of the poet, since poetic truths are always true, and scientific truths merely await the next decimal point.<br>
<br>
Another thing to consider is the rarity of  fossils in the first place. Something very special has to happen to cause on to come into being and to last for millions of years. Of course, if all dead bodies fossilized, the earth would be nothing but one big boneyard.<br>
<br>
But fossils are there, and, if nothing else, they tell us that life was not always as it is. Why there are sudden changes is not completely certain, but potential new forms are always present, and will spring forth as if miraculously, if the situation is favorable.<br>
<br>
One possible factor I have seen discussed is a sort of modular mutagen, that can plug itself into different genes and produce different effects, &quot;locking&quot; itself into place only if the result is successful enough to breed.<br>

<br>
A community &quot;backs your views&quot;. &quot;accepted as fact&quot;, &quot;taught in schools&quot;.<br>
<br>
Basically you are saying that the mob rules.  You have not claimed that your beliefs are supported by specific evidence, but have given innuendo that there is this big chunk of unnamed evidence that somehow proves evolution is a fact.<br>
<br>
I say &quot;hogwash&quot;.  <br>
<br>
Here is the challenge.  I have claimed nothing as fact, but have challenged something you have claimed fact.  That lays the burden of proof on you, sparky.<br>
<br>
I'm not going to bother to reply to &quot;I don't have to prove anything because more people think like I do&quot; nonsense.  I'm not going to reply to &quot;you have to prove things, not me&quot;.<br>
<br>
My position is clear.  If you cannot support your &quot;fact&quot;, then quit calling it a &quot;fact&quot;.  It's that simple.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :mcool --><img src=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/unexplained.m/smile/mcool.gif ALT=":mcool"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#484848><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/bunexplainedmysteries.showUserPublicProfile?gid=mrchef>mrchef</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#6F6F6F>(2/2/03 5:11:17 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The Creation of Mankind</span><hr size=1> You say &quot;mob rules&quot;.

<br>
&quot;...you have given innuendo that there is this big chunk of unnamed evidence that somehow proves evolution is fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
Do you live in a cave?  This evidence is called Biology, Anthropology, Paleontology, Cytology and Genetics.  You got me.  It's all innuendo.  It's all Hogwash.<br>
<br>
I hate to say this Sparky, the burden of proof is on you.  If there is evidence that Evolution is wrong, lets see it.  One of the biggest problems with people that dont find evolution palatable is that they are unable to prove that its wrong, they want us to provide further proof that it's right.  Nothing, ever, has been shown to contradict evolution.  Never, ever.<br>
<br>
Evolutionists may have an incomplete puzzle, but anti-evolutionists have Nothing.  Their whole arguement is based on the missing puzzle pieces.  Well, Matt, unless you or some other zealot is going to get out there and do some work, you'll never have anything but rhetoric.<br>
<br>
Evolution is scientific fact.  Unless you know something that the rest of the scientific world doesn't.  <br>
<br>
It's that simple.<br>

This dont sound like friendly debate to me. <br>
I'll just say this: evolution is just a theory, albeit very good and convenient (in that it fits what we know, im not dissin evolution, i believe it). <br>
<br>
As it is just a theory, it will always have holes, or opposing arguments. Something like evolution cannot ever really be conclusively proved, as (at present<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) we cannot time travel.<br>
<br>
Religion is kinda like a theory too. It has many opposing arguments (i'll admit, i find them convincing, but thats not my point<!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/emoticons_classic/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> ) but ultimately we cannot prove that god does not exist, we can only believe it.<br>
<br>
Also, if you dont take the bible literally to the word, but instead use it as a kinda template, it can make more sense, which is why there are religious scientists.<br>

Matt's is based on Faith. And I have absolutely no problem with that.  I believe there is a God, I have absolutely no proof, but I believe.<br>
<br>
I also  believe in Evolution.  In this case however, I believe because there IS evidence.  And whether Matt choses to believe it or not is irrelevent in my eyes.  When He tells me there isn't or there is contrary evidence, I would like proof.  And since my belief is based in on science, I dont think I'm being unreasonable.  He has not offered proof, has said he wont, and insists that I prove my point over and over again.<br>
<br>
I'm the name dropper, I'm avoiding giving proof, I'm close minded.  These are Matt's only points.  Well, Magus, to be honest, I'm just Disgusted.<br>
<br>
One last point, I dont want to get into it again but...  Capital &quot;T&quot; Theory in science and small &quot;t&quot; theory in regular usage are two different things.  Evolution and Relativity ARE proven. The fact that we haven't found transitional fossils or have the technical know-how to time travel (which by the way the Theory of Relativity does not say is possible); neither are proof of the given Theories being wrong.  Some religious fanatics only hope we believe they are.<br>

<br>
No, evolution has not been proven.  Period.  There is great debate WITHIN anthropology.  How about the debate on whether australopithecines are apes or ancient humans? <br>
<br>
To make matters less believable for the evolutionary camp, is the fact that they were willing to fabricate stories to make things fit.  For example, Java man.  This turned out to be poor science.  Bones collected from as far as 45 feet away from a femur were attributed to the same creature.  It was later dismissed, but it had taken a long time to say that they had it wrong.    <br>
<br>
I'm not trying to flame anyone here, but lets realize that until there is *proof*, both sides are in fact relegated to faith.  <br>
<br>
Here are some quotes and references:<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr>&quot;It is, however, very difficult to establish the precise lines of descent, termed phylogenies, for most organisms.&quot;<br>
(Ayala, F. J. and Valentine J. W., Evolving: The Theory and Process of Organic Evolution, 1978, p. 230)<br>
<br>
&quot;Undeniably, the fossil record has provided disappointingly few gradual series. The origins of many groups are still<br>
not documented at all.&quot;  (Futuyma, D., Science on Trial: The Case for Evolution, 1983, p. 190-191)<br>
<br>
&quot;There is still a tremendous problem with the sudden diversification of multi-cellular life.  There is no question about that. That's a real phenomenon.&quot;   (Niles Eldredge, quoted in Darwin's Enigma: Fossils and Other Problems by Luther D. Sunderland, Master Book Publishers, Santee, California, 1988, p. 45)<br>
<br>
&quot;Whatever ideas authorities may have on the subject, the lungfishes, like every other major group of fishes that I know, have their origins firmly based in nothing.&quot;  (Quoted in W. R. Bird, _The Origin of Species Revisited_ [Nashville: Regency, 1991; originally published by Philosophical Library, 1987], 1:62-63)<br>
<br>
&quot;The main problem with such phyletic gradualism is that the fossil record provides so little evidence for it. Very rarely can we trace the gradual transformation of one entire species into another through a finely graded sequence of intermediary forms.&quot; (Gould, S.J. Luria, S.E. &amp; Singer, S., A View of Life, 1981, p. 641)<br>
<br>
&quot;It should come as no surprise that it would be extremely difficult to find a specific fossil species that is both intermediate in morphology between two other taxa and is also in the appropriate stratigraphic position.&quot;<br>
(Cracraft, J., &quot;Systematics, Comparative Biology, and the Case Against Creationism,&quot; 1983, p. 180)<br>
<br>
&quot;Most families, orders, classes, and phyla appear rather suddenly in the fossil record, often without anatomically intermediate forms smoothly interlinking evolutionarily derived descendant taxa with their presumed ancestors.&quot; <br>
(Eldredge, N., 1989, Macro-Evolutionary Dynamics: Species, Niches, and Adaptive Peaks, McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, New York, p. 22)<br>
<br>
&quot;Species that were once thought to have turned into others have been found to overlap in time with these alleged descendants. In fact, the fossil record does not convincingly document a single transition from one species to another.&quot;<br>
(Stanley, S.M., The New Evolutionary Timetable: Fossils, Genes, and the Origin of Species, 1981, p. 95)<br>
                               <br>
&quot;Many fossils have been collected since 1859, tons of them, yet the impact they have had on our understanding of the relationships between living organisms is barely perceptible. ...In fact, I do not think it unfair to say that fossils, or at least the traditional interpretation of fossils, have clouded rather than clarified our attempts to reconstruct phylogeny.&quot;<br>
(Fortey, P. L., &quot;Neontological Analysis Versus Palaeontological Stores,&quot; 1982, p. 120-121)<br>
<br>
&quot;Indeed, it is the chief frustration of the fossil record that we do not have empirical evidence for sustained trends in the evolution of most complex morphological adaptations.&quot;<br>
(Gould, Stephen J. and Eldredge, Niles, &quot;Species Selection: Its Range and Power,&quot; 1988, p. 19)<br>
<br>
&quot;The paleontological data is consistent with the view that all of the currently recognized phyla had evolved by about 525 Ma.  Despite half a billion years of evolutionary exploration generated in Cambrian time, no new phylum level designs have appeared since then.&quot;  (&quot;Developmental Evolution of Metazoan Body plans: The Fossil Evidence,&quot; Valentine, Erwin, and Jablonski, Developmental Biology 173, Article No. 0033, 1996, p. 376)<br>
<br>
&quot;Many 'trends' singled out by evolutionary biologists are ex post facto rendering of phylogenetic history: biologists may simply pick out species at different points in geological time that seem to fit on some line of directional modification through time. Many trends, in other words, may exist more in the minds of the analysts than in phylogenetic history. This is particularly so in situations, especially common prior to about 1970, in which analysis of the phylogenetic relationships among species was incompletely or poorly done.&quot; <br>
(Eldredge, Niles, Macro-Evolutionary Dynamics: Species, Niches, and Adaptive Peaks, 1989, p. 134)<br>
<br>
&quot;The Eldredge-Gould concept of punctuated equilibria has gained wide acceptance among paleontologists. It attempts to account for the following paradox: Within continuously sampled lineages, one rarely finds the gradual morphological trends predicted by Darwinian evolution; rather, change occurs with the sudden appearance of new, well-differentiated species. Eldredge and Gould equate such appearances with speciation, although the details of these events are not preserved. ...The punctuated equilibrium model has been widely accepted, not because it has a compelling theoretical basis but because it appears to resolve a dilemma. Apart from the obvious sampling problems inherent to the observations that stimulated the model, and apart from its intrinsic circularity (one could argue that speciation can occur only when phyletic change is rapid, not vice versa), the model is more ad hoc explanation than theory, and it rests on shaky ground.&quot;  (Ricklefs, Robert E., &quot;Paleontologists Confronting Macroevolution,&quot; Science, vol. 199, 1978, p. 59)<br>
          <br>
&quot;Few paleontologists have, I think ever supposed that fossils, by themselves, provide grounds for the conclusion that evolution has occurred. An examination of the work of those paleontologists who have been particularly concerned with the relationship between paleontology and evolutionary theory, for example that of G. G. Simpson and S. J. Gould, reveals a mindfulness of the fact that the record of evolution, like any other historical record, must be construed within a complex of particular and general preconceptions not the least of which is the hypothesis that evolution has occurred. ...The fossil record doesn't even provide any evidence in support of Darwinian theory except in the weak sense that the fossil record is compatible with it, just as it is compatible with other evolutionary theories, and revolutionary theories and special creationist theories and even historical theories.&quot;  (Kitts, David B., &quot;Search for the Holy Transformation,&quot; review of Evolution of Living Organisms, by Pierre-P. Grassé, Paleobiology, vol. 5, 1979, pp. 353-354)<br>

<br>
<!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><strong><em>Quote:</em></strong><hr><!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Chromosomes.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> This is the most inexplicable difference of all. Primates have 48 chromosomes. Humans are considered vastly superior to them in a wide array of areas, yet somehow we have only 46 chromosomes! This begs the question of how we could lose two full chromosomes--which represents a lot of DNA--in the first place, and in the process become so much better. Nothing about it makes logical sense.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Genetic Disorders.</strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END--> As with all wild animals (plants, too), primates have relatively few genetic disorders spread throughout their gene pools. Albinism is one that is common to many animal groups as well as humans. But albinism does not stop an animal with it from growing up and passing the gene for it into the gene pool. Mostly, though, serious defects are quickly weeded out in the wild. Often, parents or others in a group will do the job swiftly and surely, so wild gene pools stay relatively clear. In contrast, humans have over 4,000 genetic disorders, and several of those will absolutely kill every victim before reproduction is possible. This begs the question of how such defects could possibly get into the human gene pool in the first place, much less how they remain so widespread.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><strong>Genetic Relatedness. </strong><!--EZCODE BOLD END-->A favourite Darwinist statistic is that the total genome (all the DNA) of humans differs from chimpanzees by only 1% and from gorillas by 2%. This makes it seem as if evolution is indeed correct and that humans and primates are virtually kissing cousins. However, what they don't stress is that 1% of the human genome's three billion base pairs is 30 million base pairs--and to any You Know What that can adroitly manipulate genes, 30 million base pairs can easily add up to a tremendous amount of difference.<hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--> <p><!--EZCODE BR START--><br /><!--EZCODE BR END--><br>

You actually went out and took a look at some good science sites.... and found nothing that refutes evolution.<br>
<br>
&quot;Comets could have seeded life on Earth.&quot;<br>
<br>
So What? How does this disprove or even bring into question evolution?<br>
<br>
&quot;Before the Big Bang&quot; <br>
<br>
 Another gem.  This has a  lot, wait... Nothing to do with evolution.<br>
<br>
&quot;Discoveries Breath New Life into Human Origins Debate&quot;<br>
<br>
I hope you noticed that the debate in question is not whether the Theory of Evolution is correct or not.  The debate is WHERE man began to EVOLVE.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once again Matt, you have nothing to back your views.  You even tried this time!  And still Evolution stands intact.<br>
<br>
ChargerFan, you dont have to worry about &quot;flaming&quot; or offending me.  Your posts were interesting and I'd like to comment on them.<br>
<br>
Java Man.  Whether an honest mistake or an outright lie.  It's immaterial.  Certainly the simple fact that you are a scientist does not imply that you are a paragon of virtue.  The beauty of science is that we continue to look for evidence regardless of what one scientist says, and if he is found to be a fraud he is outed and labelled as such.<br>
<br>
Australopithecines:  Where does the Theory of Evolution say that we will immediately know the origin and answers to every question we have?<br>
<br>
Your list of quotes are important for all Evolutionists and anti-Evolutionists to read and understand.  Not one of them questions the Theory, they only lament many of the same things I've discussed.  The unfortunate, but reasonable, lack of a complete fossil record, the lack of understanding of the Process of evolution (how does it happen? is it happenstance or is there and outside stimulus, like a Comet or a climatic change).  <br>
<br>
The last quote is the most interesting.  The fossil record is compatible with Dawinian theory, other evolutionary theories, even some &quot;special&quot; Creationist theories.  If the fossil record is to be considered &quot;proof&quot; of Evolution (any evolutionary theory)  then it can ALSO be proof of some Creationist Theories (the ones that claim God created the World with fossils already in the earth.)   I have no problem with this, the fossil record is only one piece of the puzzle, there are others as previously discussed.  If it's proof of &quot;special&quot; Creationist Theories then it is also proof of Evolution.<br>
<br>
It is important to note here that Creationist Science, Intelligent Design and other Creationist theories are not taught in school.  Why is that?  (this is where I suprise all (2) of you)  It isn't ommitted because of a lack of evidence - Intelligent design makes sense in many ways, it takes into account much  evolutionary evidence and for the most part adheres to many scientific facts.  It is not taught in (U.S.) schools because of one of the principles that the U.S. was founded on.  The seperation of Church and State.  The &quot;guiding hand&quot; in the the aforementioned theories is &quot;God&quot; and the Supreme Court of the U.S.  banned it from the Class Rooms solely on that account.<br>
<br>
Now for Lloyd Pie's astute observations.<br>
<br>
Chromosomes:  The number of crhomosomes a particular organism has does not corelate to superiority.  It's basic biology.  Futhermore, he's not making any point regarding Evolution.  Simpler is  often better.<br>
<br>
Genetic Disorders:  I for the life of me cant figure out what he is getting at.  Contrary to what Mr. Pie would have you believe, in the wild, albinism greatly affects a chimp's or any animal's chances at reproducing and passing on the gene.  While young he is at a much greater risk to predation, as an adult he will not fit the criteria that males or females will be looking for in a mate.  It is INCREDIBLY rare to find an albino of any animal in the wild.  The ones we see are bred in capitivity.  Humans, have a large base of genetic disorders.  So?  Oh I see, he wants to know why a genetic disorder that causes death before reproduction is still around.  I guess the logical question is why doesn't it just disappear once every one who has it is dead?  Well Mr. Pie may want to look into something called Dominant/Recessive genes.<br>
<br>
Genetic Relatedness:  Only someone who know's very little about evolution will try to prove something by the 2% difference in code between man and some apes.  If you know evolution, you know that man did not evolve from apes.  Yes we have a common ancestor, and that is representative of the 98% of our code that is the same (some 2.94 billion pairs).  Which is ofcourse why we are so similar in appearence.  And yes the 2% difference does represent 60 million base pairs.  Which also explains why you dont mistake an ape for a human and take her to the prom. (Apologies to anyone who had a realy ugly prom date.)<br>
<br>
Mr. Pie is doing something that has been going on for years - throw out a bunch of misinformation about a topic knowing that the general public doesn't understand the topic well enough to see through the gobbly-gook.  Sadly, its very effective, many people would rather just believe what ever they are told, than look into it and see if it holds water.<br>
<br>
Matt, all I'm asking for is proof that evolution isn't fact.  You, at one time claimed you were privy to this information.  I asked to see it, and so far you haven't produced anything.<br>
<br>
(HINT: if you just come out and say that it goes against your religious beliefs, and that you have Faith that evolution is wrong, contrary to mounting evidence...  I will have no response other than.  &quot;Good for you, there is nothing wrong with having Faith.&quot;)<br>

Creationism is but religion, based on myth and nonsense, subjective and unprovable.<br>

Evolution is a fact, observable and indisuputable.  How it works is where theory comes in, as is right and proper under science.  As new evidence arises, theories are alttered to fit them.  That's how science works.<br>
