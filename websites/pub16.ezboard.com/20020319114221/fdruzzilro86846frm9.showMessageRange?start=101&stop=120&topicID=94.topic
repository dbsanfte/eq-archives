&quot;You want respect[...] Having the best loot creates a certain standing in the community&quot;.<br>
<br>
Respect is about a lot of things.  <br>
<br>
To you, respect may be about playing well as part of a team to kill things which are hard to kill, or it is about having the best loot in the game, or maybe it is about being able to log in earlier than others to kill something before them, or maybe it is about having the ability to play 60 hours a week vs. someone else's 30 hours a week.<br>
<br>
Respect can be about other things too. For instance, respect can be gained or lost by the company one keeps.  You keep company with people like Ciner, supposedly a representative of your guild, where the best he can come up with in this series of posts is threats. You keep company with a guild that went FFA with no warning, leapfrogging another guild in the process.  You keep company with a guildmate who trained a NToV mob out of NToV. You keep company with a guild where a large portion of the people in it would typically respond to this post with profanities or l33t speak.<br>
<br>
Everyone has their own set of reasons for granting respect.  You deserve some respect because you can put words together in a fashion that doesn't make a literate person cringe.  You and your guildmates deserve some further respect because you play the game relatively well. Not great - great is killing Tunare without exploits and before SoL and all its enhancements came out. Great is killing AoW for the first time on any server. Great play is guilds like FoH and Afterlife. But Vindi does have good play, so they do deserve some respect for that. But you lose a lot of respect because of the company you keep. And a lot of your guildmates deserve almost no respect because the attribute of skilled play is far outweighed by being immature, illiterate, and inconsiderate.<br>
<br>
Fizbain, Tarissa, and Elidroth:<br>
<br>
Killing Ventani was a server first and you did it with what I understand to be a comparatively small number of people. That shows skill and normally would deserve respect. However, that action deserves little respect because you did it while all the other warders were dead.  You could just have easily tested and demonstrated your playskills by leaving another warder up while killing Ventani.  Before you flame me for saying this, remember your own officers' positions on the IGB a few months back about releasing the Sleeper.<br>
<br>
P.S. (Vain attempt to be on topic) I don't hate uber guilds. I despise certain members of some uber guilds, and think at least one uber guild personifies the worst that EQ brings out in people. Tarring all uber guilds as bad would be stupid.  However, that doesn't mean when any particular uber guild acts poorly that they should not be criticized for it. <p>Juergen/Enki/Wagner, Proud Member of the Valiant Elite<br>

To be honest with you, if CO was capable of doing it, we probably would.  It had to happen sooner or later...<br>
<br>
I don't agree with the FFA on uber mobs tho.  As a guild who is getting very close to being able to take on these critters without help from others, this just adds to the difficulty.  I would have much rather asked for a few &quot;advisors&quot; from a guild like Hoss to accompany us on a SCHEDULED uber mob take down than have to race their whole guild to it.  At the stage we would be in when we were able to take it down, we clearly wouldn't stand a chance against a guild who has been doing it for some time.  This, to me, takes away from the fun and excitement of smackin around these end game mobs.<br>
<br>
I don't think any guild on this server can honestly say they haven't dreamed of &quot;Waking the Sleeper&quot;.  It's not the uber guilds that make people angry (jealous is probably a better word), its the dorks that play the game.  The people who have no respect for anyone else.  They haven't changed from when they were level 5, its just that now they are level 55+ and have made it into the end game and uber guilds.  They were dorks then, and they still are.<br>

<br>
That is only speculation on your part. And you know what? If you don't have the playtime that's YOUR problem, not mine. Why should someone feel guilty for having more playtime and killing mobs? This is like the old cliche class envy argument. I don't think you understood my point. People that play the game the way I stated do not really give a rats bunghole of your feelings or if you even respect them. Some people (god forbid) play the game to kill really big uber mobs, deck out their char's, and just screw around and have fun. People need to realize that not all EQ players are created equal. If your an adult and your trying to be uber or want equal share of loot (notice the word &quot;adult&quot;) you must realize your trying to compete with high school kids. You can't guilt trip these poeple into handing you free loot. You need to call in sick and kill shit or keep your trap shut.<br>
<br>
      Notice I mentioned high end mob killing community. This is (like it or not) an upper class of EQ. These people don't care if &quot;Power of Friends&quot; respects them or not. Has equal playing time or their fair share of loot. Why don't we just all give newbies FBSS, yaks ect as a lvl 1 welfare payments to make an equal playing field? Since some newbies have more playing time it would be unfair for those with less to be left in the dust. This entire argument in context to a video game is absurd and should be ridiculed as such. EQ is all about loot. Either you have it, or you don't. Either you can kill big shit, or you can't. I'm talking about people that shape the game, the way it's played, why expansions have certain material. SOL? Designed for mid-level play and guess what? It's a total bust. Eq lives off of the high end community. it keep players playing because younger players see that loot, and want it for themselves. So they work for it. <br>
<br>
      This all ties into respect. I respect progression. Loot shows your progression as well as level and skill. What mobs you kill show progression as a guild. Thinking someone nice for doing a good deed is not respect. People are confusing respect with thinking kindly of someone. I can hate someone and still respect them as a player. I respect Ciner for a few things. He says what he has to say in the open, he works his ass off to lead a guild and doesn't take any shit from training VE members who &quot;make threats&quot; in /shout. Though this is like the abortion issue where your not going to change anyone's mind I'll say it one more time. Vind didn't leapfrog NTOV. You can't camp and still own a spawn. Cheesy is open to debate, but there was definetely no leapfrogging. <br>
<br>
      I don't want you to think I don't understand your position. I do, but we're talking about a video game here. Finding reality offensive won't make it go away. Either accept it and take the game and your role in it for what it is, or work and change your situation if your unhappy with it.<br>

<br>
We realize that. Its pretty obvious.<br>
<br>
There's a correlation youth and anti-social behavior. E.g. when kids get their first teeth, we teach them not to bite. Most kids are still learning what's appropriate and what isn't.  Saying one is in high-school is an excuse for anti-social behavior is rather silly, there are plenty of youngsters in EQ that act reasonably and rationally. Being in high-school might explain it, but it doesnt excuse it. Anti-social behavior is supposed to be pointed out and corrected, not glossed over or rationalized.<br>

<br>
My main point was to make the argument that such a definition of respect, while it may work for you, is overall a pretty poor definition of respect.<br>
<br>
For you, killing uber mobs and progressing is the most important thing in the game, so you grant respect based on it.<br>
<br>
For me being literate, considerate, mature, logical, not-cheesy, etc., are all either as important or more so than having nice loots, even in-game, particularly in that in EQ having nice loots in-game is most strongly correlated with having the ability to play 60+ hours a week, living on the east coast, and being either in middle school, high school, or undergraduate in college.<br>
<br>
I understand you think such attributes, in-game, are meaningless. So we understand each other.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why you are here. If you don't give a damn what &quot;Power of Friends&quot; and the rest of the community thinks about you, don't care how you are perceived vis-a-vis the other attributes I mention, and think being associated with illiterate, illogical, immature people is perfectly a-ok, why are you here?  I give a damn about all these things, that is why I'm here. What about you?<br>
<br>
If its &quot;just a game&quot; as so many of you keep arguing (perhaps to yourselves?), why do you keep posting about it here, trying to justify your actions to the community at large? <p>Juergen/Enki/Wagner, Proud Member of the Valiant Elite<br>

Me, I work full-time, am on-call 24/7 and have other pursuits that keep me busy.  Would I like to see more of EQ than I have?  Sure I would, but I simply don't have enough time in the day to do everything I want.  It's certainly no fault of anyone else if I can only play a couple hours a night.  The only common ground that most EQ players share is that they are paying to play a video game.<br>
<br>
It's no different from two kids at a video arcade.  Both come in with $10 to play a game.  One kid has an hour to play, the other has all day.  The kid who only has an hour can't &quot;beat&quot; the game or get the highest score, if the other guy is equal in skill and has more time.  Should the kid who has all day, who is plugging quarters into the machine, feel responsible that the other kid only has an hour?  Nope.  Now, if I had eight hours per day to play EQ, or could guarantee that I could stay up all night to show up for a raid, I'd probably be looking to join a guild where my time commitment could &quot;give me more EQ&quot; for my ten bucks a month.  But I can't put that much time into it, and it's nobody's fault.<br>
<br>
My only argument would be with those who view inability to dedicate time to the game as being synonymous with lack of skill or lack of - for lack of a better word - *worthiness*.  Every player should have the opportunity to see all of EQ, if they are willing to make time to do it.  Unfortunately, there are those players who feel that they are superior to others simply because they can devote more time to the game.  That's not superiority, it's availability.  The player who can only play on weekends is just as *worthy* of getting his epic and wearing full Velious quest armor as another player who can work around-the-clock to achieve the same goals, but time limitations are going to be the deciding factor.  Hell, look at the druid epic quest when first introduced -- there's something that half the server population is probably familiar with.  It was literally a matter of having someone sit in TD for hours or days, and start calling people so they could leave work to come home and log in.  Hahaha, good luck, right?  Well, there's your risk for reward.  They fixed that, so it's accessible to more players now, but some mobs in game SHOULD be that rare, and SHOULD require coordination and dedication to being in the right place at the right time.  If you don't have that kind of availability, then you aren't going to be there and you aren't going to kill the mob.<br>
<br>
By definition, FFA means that whoever shows up with a strong enough force has &quot;rights&quot; to a mob, even if someone else entered the zone first with intent to engage the mob, right?  See, even the IGB was slanted against smaller guilds who may have been quite capable of killing some of the mobs on rotation, because they had to somehow prove their qualifications to other players, players who themselves were (IN SOME CASES) only able to kill the same mobs by virtue of availability.  So FFA changes nothing, speaking in terms of ex-IGB guilds vs. non-IGB guilds, because if you weren't on the IGB rotation, you weren't considered *worthy* of taking a shot at a particular mob.  The problem is that EVERYONE is *worthy* of trying their hand at a particular mob, and that some players felt that they could come up with requirements, agreed upon by a small percentage of the player base, that dictated who was worthy of engaging those mobs.  That's really not fair, but of course life isn't fair.<br>
<br>
Availability might dictate that a particular guild could only take out a specific mob if they had outside (non-guild) help, which in turn meant that they weren't &quot;qualified&quot; for inclusion in the IGB rotation.  Even if they were able to engage the mob with sufficient numbers, but got wiped out anyway, availability might prevent them from performing a timely CR, let alone engaging the mob a second time.  Availability might mean that they have to give up and leave, because they just can't take another shot before going to work or going to bed or whatever.  Should availability dictate whether or not a player or guild is *worthy*?  Nope, definitely not.  But is availability a FAIR factor in who can engage a mob, any mob, by description of FFA?  Sure.<br>
<br>
Everyone, every player and every guild, can be measured in two ways: capability and potential.  Most guilds are not capable of NToV, but they may have the potential, as they are advancing as time goes on.  Many players CAN'T finish their epic, because they or their friends/guildmates aren't available to do it, but on an individual level they potentially may be willing to make time if they were part of a guild that could help them.  Other players do NOT have that potential, because they won't or can't make time, but they often get into guilds with like-minded players who are happy with reaching more modest, realistic goals.<br>
<br>
If more people set realistic goals, and were happy with reaching those goals, I guarantee that we wouldn't have nearly the amount of disagreements and open hostility that we currently are seeing on our server.  We're all kids in the same arcade, all with pockets full of quarters, but some of us don't have as much time to play as others, and need to be happy with a more modest score.  It's more fun to reach goals and advance when you can, than to set impossible goals and only get mad when you fall short.<br>

Nice broad brushed statement about everyone you think I know in EQ. This is like me saying all of VE are a bunch of HOT training, newbie no skilled dickheads. Don't like that? Then don't do it.

There is a word for this, it's called fascism. Look it up. You ruin any argument you make when you talk of respect , then disrespect an entire guild you know nothing about.

You make excellent points. I think your absolutely right. The problem I've stated from post one is this. People that don't understand this &quot;availability&quot; issue and try to mold EQ into their own selfish version. Then trying to force this on other players who have every right under verants own rules to play the game the way THEY want. I'm just explaining the way it is. I've said it before, I don't really agree with all of it but it's reality. You cannot remove the competitive edge from a video game to create socialism. It's madness. Does this mean people should act like jerks and train each other to get mobs? ofcoarse not. You can act civil, (contrary to the propoganda here) and play FFA. It's been done here and is done every day on many other servers. EQ can be a very personal game to people. I understand this. I do not think it's healthy though, It should be a release from RL. The problem is, people are trying to merge RL issues (time, kids, work) and make everyone else notice this and conform to this within a video game. This is wrong. People do not have any right to do this and it's selfish. I am glad you understand this basic truth and can respectfully &lt;-----hehe ) make nice points.<br>

As long as, that is, they play within the rules, they are entitled.... just like when driving on the freeway and in a congested lane there is no LAW that requires you to let someone from another lane in, who has their turn signals in... let them find another fool to let them in...got mine and I am keeping it!  Perfectly legal....but<br>
<br>
I do have to wonder how all these advocates of &quot;I got mine and I am gonna do what I want and the hell with you....&quot; would have sounded if THEY had started on a server full of &quot;uber&quot; guilds/players with the very same attitude?  Though I am certain it will be denied, I strongly suspect that many would be shouting &quot;UNFAIR&quot; at the top of their lungs, especially if mom or dad had told them they could only play Everquest 5 or 6 hours a week.  As usual it depends on whose ox is being gored.  Haven't we seen that over the breadth of these threads already a few times?.....  In the form of.... &quot;Well that isn't OUR style or what WE prefer, but if we didn't, then THEY would and THEY are worse so we hadda!&quot;  Isn't there an implicit message there of &quot;and then THEY would have something WE don't cause we played NICE...so we won't play nice.&quot;...  Just an observation.<br>
<br>
Second point...where in the Sony rules or elsewhere are we constrained by the term &quot;adequate force&quot; or its synonyms?  I see it quoted so often and going hand in glove with how FFA fits into the rules... I.E. &quot;The first group/guild into the zone with 'adequate force' gets to go after the mob/drop/zone/quest, in priority over someone else who might have had it planned or had some people there first.&quot;  It seems like an in-advance defense for taking over something....  &quot;Well gee, yeah they were there first but not in 'adequate force' so we went in.  If we didn't somebody else would have.&quot;<br>
<br>
A lotta rules lawyers in here like to quote Sony rules as justification for their actions, or at least permission.... and I am certainly among them...  so where in the rules is &quot;adequate force&quot;?  Seems to me that is a matter of personal perspective.... if my 1st level rogue bank mule thinks he has figured out a way to take out Naggy solo, then until he fails, in his mind it is &quot;adequate force&quot;.  We have recently heard of large guilds going in to take on _______ (fill in the blank God/mob/scenario) and getting badly thumped.   In retrospect, they didn't have adequate force, did they?  So if a new guild, the Firiona Vie Chamber of Commerce (I really do have to form that!) decides it has a new unique approach to taking on the Plane of Intelligent Purple Cockatrice [Cockatrixes?  LOL](or raiding the CSHOME zone) with a group of 6 - 46th levels...then they are adequate force until they get spanked....or in that case lay an egg.<br>
<br>
(BTW I would LOVE to see an &quot;Uber&quot; Guild pull off a succesfull raid on CSHOME...that would be a one time event I could really get into someone pulling off  LOL)<br>
<br>
So unless that term really is part of the rules somewhere, lets let it fade away.<br>
<br>
I LOVE this game...I LOVE mysteries...I LOVE the hints about opening new zones and finding new transport mechanisms and I LOVE interacting with new people and old friends and new friends.... I love finding loopholes and easter eggs...I love buffing and twinking newbies unexpectedly....there is a LOT I love about this game  and I HATE the LDs and Error 1018 etc that have kept me from playing much the last week.... and yes I enjoy much of the discussion and back and forth in here, and I enjoy sometimes &quot;taunting&quot; in here as much as I like having the tanks taunt a mob off my poor Cleric after a CH.<br>
<br>
Yes I think some of the actions I see being talked about may diminish my options and pleasure in &quot;the end game&quot; but yes I think those people who do/did them have the &quot;right&quot;.  Doesn't mean that I or anyone else should stop trying to steer things in a direction they feel the game should go.  And as much as people may hate it, or be bored by it or turned off by it, all this discussion has had some positive suggestions, and just the venting is healthy, a lot better option than training someone in rage.<br>
<br>
It certainly has helped me in my quest to decide IF I should guild, and if so where and with whom.  Some of my posts may well have &quot;blackballed&quot; me from membership in some guilds, and some of the posts here have also persuaded me that I probably WON'T seek membership in certain groups, but I remain open minded and enjoy the process, just maybe not as much as the game.<br>
<br>
And for Big Fat Albert's benefit:<br>
1.) Just cause it's your right doesnt make it right<br>
2.) Who screams depends on whose candy it is.<br>
3.) What the heck is adequate force?<br>
4.) Let's raid CSHOME.<br>
5.) Gotta love the game.<br>
6.) Talk good!<br>

Zoulle, you replied to a strawman. To whit:<br>
<br>
* I've already said some Vindi are literate etc etc, and NEVER said that ALL Vindi have the faults I described.<br>
<br>
* I never said that ALL the people you associate with are immature etc. What I said was, &quot;a lot of your guildmates...&quot; have these faults. Just look at the &quot;niggaz&quot; thread on your own boards for a good place to start. You proud of that thread?<br>
<br>
* I never said you were not entitled to an opinion.  I ASKED why you where bothering to post here, since you don't care about what people here think.  You are evading my question with these totally off-topic accusations of fascism.<br>
You: &quot;I think you don't matter!&quot;<br>
Me: &quot;Then why are you talking to me?&quot;<br>
You: &quot;You are a fascist trying to censor me!!!&quot;<br>
<br>
* As to knowing nothing about Vindication, I know plenty - everything from Ciner's (Vindi GM?) post that he would try to prevent VE from getting any uber again (gee, real mature officers there - someone criticizes you then you threaten them) to Vindi leading the way to FFA to Vindi being cheesy (your word selection not mine) re:NToV to &quot;Niggaz&quot; threads on your boards. That's just the tip of the iceberg too.  I know one other thing too - Vindi has some people who would otherwise be pretty decent sorts, except for the fact that they are a member of a guild that does this sort of stuff.<br>

<br>
ya know, he didn't say they should wait for him.<br>
<br>
Consider this.<br>
<br>
Guild X has lots of people, lots of loot, and lots of techniques. they are hardcore players who, for one reason or another, have a lot of time to put into EQ.<br>
<br>
Guild Y is composed primarily of casual people, and they're getting pretty strong internally, but most of their players have fulltime jobs, heavy course loads, or children.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guild X and Guild Y are both part of a larger reservation system (think d-ro, not IGB). Guild X has a LOT of reservations that go up on this board, and Guild Y has a signifigantly lesser amount.<br>
<br>
Both guilds respect each other's reservations.<br>
<br>
Guild X won't be forced to &quot;wait&quot; for guild Y, for several reasons. X can reserve whatever they want, whenever they want. So can Y. X's overall number of mobs might be slowed by the prescence of Y, but that would be the same under FFA, assuming Y was able to get mobs.<br>
<br>
Now, under an IGB situation, which is a strict rotation, Guild X loses a LOT of time by the presence of guild Y.<br>
<br>
<br>
kinda complex, but I think it makes sense..  the answer here is to have respect for what another guild has announced their intentions to raid, to post your intentions (even if there is a lot of them!) and for all members of a reservation system like that to respect the system.<br>
<br>
that WORKS. we've seen it on D-ro, where Guilds like CN, IG, et, al (Tier 2 guilds) reserve things like PoG, PoH Plus Inny, or other higher level encounters, and guilds like Leauge of People, and Rutabaga Paradox (Tier 1 guilds) reserve places like The Hole, or PoH w/out Inny. <br>
<br>
I think that having guilds like Vindi, Hoss, ML (Tier 3 Guilds) using the same reservation system would be VERY beneficial. This would allow the Tier 3 guild to aviod conflicts with other guilds, and the Tier 2 or even Tier 1 guilds to profit by contracting for assist services in appropriate places (Fr'instance, TV could contract with ML to clear floor one of PoH, and then bring in a couple assist groups from ML, clear floor two, and TV gets the drops, and then TV assists with MLs takedown of inny, and has a chance at some Inny drops, and also learns strats and tactics).<br>
<br>
<br>
now, this requires some manpower for people to run the calendar, providing date-sorting capabilities for various posts. <br>

So your saying since you consider yourself far more intelligent then everyone else, mature and far more worthy of receiving loot for doing absolutely nothing except whining for a handout? It's childish to want to play the game how I want to and not how grazel, in his infinite wisdom and supreme ARROGANCE deems I should? You don't even make any good points, you just bitch and complain that people are better than you at a video game because you work 60 hours a week. Instead of addressing time, you try and corner it into childish behavior. Wake the fack up man. On top of this, you sneer at people who god forbid, don't give a rat's ass about your personal life and won't make sacrifices in their playtime to accomodate the all knowing arrogant ass grazel. <br>
<br>
Kok, I'll say it one more time. Do not expect everyone to want to play by those rules. You should not make RL issues an issue within an online video game and use that as an excuse to dictate what can be killed by who and when. It's wrong. I understand your position, I even sympathize. But this system trivializes encounters and turns them into nothing more  than a loot collection with no risk/reward factor period. Yea, it would be nice if everyone had the best equip, were all lvl 60 and time/RL wasn't a factor. But you as a person/player must make these sacrifices to better yourself within EQ. Not expect the entire server community to make sacrifices so kokuten can be better at EQ. Grzel, in his supreme arrogance thinks this is the case. and if you don't agree with him, your a childish, greedy loot whore who won't share the wealth because grzel works for a living and those anti social , basement living high school uncivil, l33t speaks jerks have a free ride time wise to kill all the mobs first. Life sucks.<br>
<br>
Thanks for being polite though Kok, I sympathize but will never agree to a welfare system within a competitive online video game. There is no point in playing if progression is based on pity and not accomplishment.
