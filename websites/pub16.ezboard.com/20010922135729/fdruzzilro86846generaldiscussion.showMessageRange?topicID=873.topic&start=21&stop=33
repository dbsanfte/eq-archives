Your either in an &quot;uber&quot; guild, which most define as a large guild hellbent on conquest, or your in a smaller family guild.<br>
<br>
  Whats unfortunate, is that people seem to think that it MUST be one or the other, it can't be both, nor can it be anything else.<br>
<br>
  I play this game for many reasons.  I've made some great friends in it, and even though I've watched many of them retire, I've made new ones along the way.  I also play this game because I'm always interested in seeing what else is out there.  There are mobs that I haven't killed yet, zones I have yet to visit, etc.  I enjoy tackling new challenges and progressing as a player and as part of my guild.<br>
<br>
 I also enjoy just hanging out with my friends and goofing off, doing silly stuff, etc.  I try to keep my priorities in game in check though, especially when I have a guild to run <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I feel there is a time and a place for everything.<br>
<br>
  The problem is, when people move into these larger style guilds, they're not ready for the change.  I notice that individuals seem to make it harder on themselves then it needs to be, or they sometimes don't seem to see the whole picture so to speak.<br>
<br>
  I experience this problem here and there, I'm sure you saw it during your time in Coven, etc.  People arn't used to being in a larger guild, a guild where they now have to give a little more effort then their previous experiences.  When their asked to do things, they get defensive, and half the time for no good reason.  For example, I recently made a &quot;motivational&quot; post on my guild's message board about pushing to 60.  Basically saying &quot;hey, you wanna do this and this?  Well you've gotta do your part, get your levels, attend those raids for practice, etc&quot;.  Of course, this set a few people off.  Typical &quot;don't tell me what to do&quot;, &quot;I hate exping so why should i bother leveling&quot;, &quot;oh we're not a family guild anymore&quot;, etc.  Well lets see, what have you been doing all this time playing eq?  Hey look at that, gaining exp, raising your level, and hanging out with your friends!  But now that I'm saying that you have to do the VERY THING you've been doing, I'm wrong? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
  Then there's the other argument of &quot;we're not a family guild anymore&quot; or &quot;I'd rather have a family style guild&quot;.  What is and what isn't a family guild?  Last I checked, 30+ people getting together to help one or two members just to see that one member further their character sounds pretty family-ish to me!  Goofing around in guildchat, having fun, etc.  Thats what a guild is all about.  Being with your friends, having a good time, and as you grow &quot;stronger&quot; (hate using that word, especially in a thread like this) getting together and using cooperation coupled with your skills to tackle the next big bad guy.<br>
<br>
  As for the politics, well, generally their you or your guild's own fault.  What causes these politics?  Usually it's people that MUST be first at something, or MUST compete with the other guy.  It starts out between guild to guild, and then it comes a part of your own guild, unfortunately.  In my opinion, it's STUPID.  You know why you don't see L`Malla pushing to do this and do to that like some of the other guilds?  I SIMPLY DON'T WANT THE HASSLE!  I PREFER to be a step behind a few other guilds, it's MUCH easier to get things done and still enjoy what your doing, not having clashes day in and day out.  Sure they're going to happen, but not as much.  <br>
<br>
   When the politics come inside the guild, it's generally due to one main factor.  PEOPLE ARE ALL DIFFERENT!  Some people enjoy being quiet, some are loud and obnoxious (in a fun way of course), some enjoy competing with their fellow class members, some HATE competition.  Some feel there should be a natural order to everything, some just wanna sit back and enjoy the ride.  People seem to forget that the person next to them (in game of course!) probably doesn't have the same outlook as they do.  So rather than analyzing the situation and taking a step back, they throw a fit because the outcome of whatever situation wasn't to THEIR liking.  <br>
<br>
  It's unfortunate that people forget that real life values and feelings and what not are right there and a part of their in game experience too.<br>
<br>
<br>
  Ok ok, I'll shut up now.  I've TOTALLY taken over this thread and derailed it horribly, and I've babbled on long enough, probably changing the topic three times or so <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> .  I just read Kocho's post and a few things popped in my head that I wanted to say.

Now granted, there will be plenty of people who are totally different from my example, but it does apply in a lot of cases.<br>
<br>
I've had PCs around since I was 12, bought my first 2400bps modem in `92 (I was 16 or 17), and due to an interest in RPGs and wargames, became fairly active on bulletin boards.  I met Syrana and Dikina from Rutabaga Paradox, who were both sysops on one such BBS.  I had a part-time job, but when I got home, I typically stayed up until 2AM playing games, chatting or posting on message boards.  I also started my own BBS once I had a faster modem and extra PC, sometimes staying up all night and sleeping in class the next day. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
After college (`95), I got a job as a PC technician.  I signed up for Internet access, and spent a ridiculous amount of time on IRC or surfing the web, or playing whatever game I had taken a liking to.  I was on the road a lot for work, and found that I couldn't cut it on 4 hours of sleep, so I had to reduce my online/gaming time.  I also was in a band that kept my weekends tied up.<br>
<br>
About a year and a half ago, the sinister force known as Dikina, with cohorts Ephany and Dulasa (ROOTABAGA!) invited me over to do some network gaming.  I discovered a game called Tribes.  Instantly, I was 17 again, up until dawn, screaming bloody murder at my monitor.  Then Ephany unleashed upon myself and the rest of our armored legions a mind-numbing demon known as EverQuest.  My girlfriend (a rogue as luck would have it) slipped something into my Hawaiian Punch that influenced me to go buy a new PC and spend countless hours in Norrath.<br>
<br>
Sooner or later, I was at the point I had been earlier, where I just couldn't justify the sleepless nights of EverCrackin', and had to make time for other priorities...work, family, other hobbies, the usual.  So while I still play on a regular basis, it is usually 4-5 hours per night or less, maybe double that on Saturdays.  Plenty of time for some adventuring, but not enough to pull all-nighters.  Would I like to spend more time playing?  Absolutely!  Can I do it?  Not a chance.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to comment one way or another on maturity vs. age, because I know 12-year-olds who are phenomenal gamers and can spend every waking moment in Norrath.   I know folks my age and older who can play at work, throughout the day if they wish.  And honestly, if I could, I probably would.  And if I did that, I would be at a higher level (with multiple characters), have better equipment, and be at raids one after the other.  On the other hand, if my RL friends didn't play, I would play less than I do.  If my girlfriend didn't play, I'd spend less time at it.  So for the guilds who can band together the people with that kind of time to dedicate to the game, more power to you.  And if you can get a lot of RL friends together to play, that much better!  <br>

It's just hard to do that sometimes. :P <p>Somberlain Wayfaerer<BR>

For me the age thing doesn't matter a whole lot, but the few instances where I've been apalled at the behavior of some players where they were downright obnoxious I soon learned that they were 12 and 14 years of age. Which lead me to forgive them immediately because they were so young and had alot to learn yet. While I know some young ones that act more mature than some 40 year olds, I am content to be in a guild that are full of 20-30-somethings. <br>
<br>
As for time a person can spend playing as related to their age, I think if a person wants to play bad enough they will find the time. The bards on my site have discussed what they've given up to play EQ - skipping classes, dropping out of school, quitting their job, getting dumped by the girlfriend or alienating their significant other. Myself, I'm a 28 year old, and found time to play 60-80 hours a week without it affecting my job or personal life too much, but now I've decided to rearrange my priorities.<br>
<br>
Politics<br>
Politics are something you'll find in every guild, I know that. Its not one person's fault, or the guild's fault, its just an inevitable factor of getting a group of people together, and it can be stimulating or healthy, or stressful and immature. Like Dlgoth said, its the mixture of different people with different personalities and different goals, its bound to create interesting discussions and arguments. Although I do think its important to promote the healthy politics in every way possible, in your charter, setting good examples, and rewarding the players that abide.<br>
<br>
Greed<br>
I consider myself in the top 5% of the most generous and &quot;nice&quot; people you'll find in EQ. So my personal struggle was always to find a healthy balance between the material wants and the &quot;family atmosphere&quot;. As a bard, I really didn't need anything but a nice drum, but even if I was a warrior type, I would still be the same way, greed is not in my vocabulary. I just want to make sure no one thinks I retired from EQ because I didn't get something I wanted, which would be so unlike me.<br>
<br>
Uber Guilds<br>
And its not just Coven who had politics and material wants. If you remember I posted to L'Malla asking about the &quot;atmosphere&quot; and the guild leaders all told me that material wants typically preceed everything else, unfortunate, but true. But I do believe this is what you will find if you want to call yourself an uber guild. If you're not all about becoming uber, then you're more about having fun or playing in a more relaxed format, which isn't too &quot;uber&quot;.<br>
<br>
Dream Guild<br>
I often found myself chasing after a &quot;Dream Guild&quot; which never existed. I also posted this places under my twink bard name, asking if it existed. But there is no such thing as a dream guild, because no one wants exactly the same thing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm dead tired, I went shopping all day. I wish I could stop posting so much, it really wastes alot of time, doesn't it? But part of me wishes that my boyfriend would go on travel consulting again, and that I would get laid off from the IT industry, and then I could play earnestly again. But those are not good wishes, are they? <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

<br>
Upper Teir - Hoss and Vindication.  Not exactly the same accomplishments, but very similiar guilds IMO.  Both do uber stuff with few people, and have very knowledgable and skilled players with excellent equipment.  Considering Vindication is a pretty new guild I don't think they have any server &quot;firsts&quot;, but they have done some pretty cool things, like clearing ST up through the 2nd warder with Hoss.  <br>
<br>
One teir below - ML and Seekers.  Very large guilds with high quantities of 60's, similiar accomplishments.  Both on dragon faction, both farm ToV semi frequently.  Both killed Trak, cleared VP up to PD (think seekers has, know ML has), Dain, Zland/kland, etc.<br>
<br>
One teir below them - CN, L`malla.  Both large guilds, CN was the 4th guild on the server to kill VS, L`malla was the 4th to kill trak, etc.  Both do ToV, similiar size, main difference is Vel faction.<br>
<br>
One teir below them - VH, IG.  Semi recently reformed guilds, average in size, up and coming.<br>
<br>
One teir below - TR, VE, and the host of other guilds that farm planes. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ugarmwer.showPublicProfile?language=EN>garmwer</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(6/22/01 8:06:20 am)</font><br>    </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: what are the top ten guilds on druzzil ro?</span><hr size=1> To be honest I would list a top 10 guilds on our server but to be honest I havent really thought about it much I have been in only one guild with any of my char and it wasnt anything special I basicly built there website and then had guild chat which is why I quit.

<br>
<br>
I like to keep things simple. K.I.S.S. (for all you military types out there). I'm not in to splitting hairs, I'm a simple guy.<br>
<br>
I see 2 real divisions in high level guilds and their prowess on Druzzil Ro:<br>
<br>
Tier 1: HOSS, Vindication, Seekers, L'Malla, Coven Nex, Mythic Legion<br>
<br>
Tier 2: Valiant Hearts, Valiant Elite, Imperial Guards, Twilight Requiem, Rage of Fire, etc etc (there might be another guild or two im missing?-Asian guilds? KOTBS, etc)<br>
<br>
<br>
All are high level guilds. All can really do some cool stuff, but there is a definite breakdown between them. You have a more capable tier that has already done Trak, VS, numerous newer Boss Mobs in Velious, has a lot of epics and tends to be higher level on average. The second tier can do older dragons, the planes, and have begun equipping their members with epics, but tend to be lower in level on average and still have to do get Trak and VS under their belt.<br>
<br>
And remember the only thing constant about guilds in the higher stage of EQ is change =). <br>

<br>
And while all the guilds pass up on 425 Dains knowing they can't kill one, it's like a feeding frenzy on a 350 dain.. Oh wait.. Mythic Legion is the only guild to kill the last (4) 425 Dains &quot;in house&quot; in fact last 425 dain was done with 54 people. Hardly &quot;lemming style&quot;<br>
<br>
All the talk about &quot;doing mobs in guild only&quot; from Hoss, Seekers, Vindication, Mythic Legion... The only guild to do it now is Mythic Legion and the up and coming guilds.<br>
<br>
I'm in none of the guilds mentioned above, I just find it funny that they talk trash to and about Mythic Legion, cry like a bunch of sissies about First on Server yet now they can't even do zones or Gods alone.  Mythic Legion can, and will never need to &quot;team up&quot; to enter a zone or kill a God..<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: BTW who gets to say Server First on ST.. Hoss or Vindication?<br>
