The first sightings set off a wild search by police, state troopers and authorities using helicopters and night-vision equipment.&quot;<br><br>&quot;With families instructed to stay indoors, sharpshooters killed the roaming Siberian on Wednesday night.&quot;<br><br>&quot;An autopsy showed the animal was desperately hungry and hadn't eaten for two days. But the animal bore no markings. Owners of Six Flags Great Adventure amusement park and safari, which is nearby, said its nine tigers are accounted for.&quot;<br><br>Police then suspected another local private preserve, the Tigers Only Preservation Society, owned by Joan Byron-Marasak, &quot;known locally as the Tiger Lady,&quot; which &quot;is licensed to own 23&quot; tigers.<br><br>&quot;Federal, state and local officials executed search warrants and reported counting only 17 tigers on the grounds of the private Tigers Only Preservation Society.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Byron-Marasak -- who has denied that the dead 431-pound cat could have strayed from her 12-acre Ocean County preserve -- insists she owns 20 tigers and that three died last year of old age. She blamed poor record-keeping for the discrepancy.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Authorities yesterday said Tigers Only has a spotless record and that their inspection yesterday (January 29, 1999) -- involving a dozen officials from four agencies -- found the animals well fed and cared for.&quot; (See the New York Daily News for January 30, 1999, &quot;Escaped tiger mystery,' by Ralph R. Ortega and Owen Moritz.)<br><br>The first sighting took place early Wednesday afternoon. &quot;A woman on Wright Debow Road just north of Route 195 in the sprawling township called police at about 1:40 p.m. so say she thought she saw a tiger in her backyard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Officers found large paw prints in the woman's yard -- and at about 5:30 p.m., one spotted a large animal nearby.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Police shot the tiger with tranquilizer darts but the drugs weren't enough to stop it. They were worried they'd have to shoot to kill.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tiger experts from nearby Great Adventure Wild Safari Animal Park were helping state police and Jackson Township cops to capture the animal.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But Great Adventure says its nine Siberian tigers are all accounted for, and the tiger belongs to someone else.&quot; (See the New York Post for January 28, 1999, &quot;Cops tail tiger in Jersey&quot; by Bill Sanderson, page 12.)<br><br>&quot;State police officers killed the animal after tranquilizer darts missed their target.&quot;<br><br>&quot;During the height of the tiger scare Wednesday, authorities visited the Tigers Only Preservation Society but hurriedly left the grounds when they got word over their radios that the tiger had been spotted nearby.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Another Fish, Game and Wildlife official, Rob Winkle, said that one officer saw that part of Byron-Marasak's fence 5-to-6 foot wire mesh fence was down,&quot; which led police to suspect the Society of being the tiger's place of origin.<br><br>&quot;'Her outer-perimeter fence was not adequately maintained,' Winkle said, 'Part of her fence was down.'&quot; (See the New York Post for January 29, 1999, &quot;Cops eye cat-lovin' 'Tiger Lady' in Jersey scare&quot; by Maria Malave and Gersh Kuntzmann, page 3.)<br><br>Ms. Byron-Marasak has repeatedly denied that the tiger killed Wednesday came from her private preserve. <br><br>Not only is the tiger's point of origin a mystery, there appears to be a discrepancy in the paw prints. They were first identified as coming from a female Siberian tiger with a weight of 350 pounds, while the animal shot and killed was a male Bengal tiger weighing 431 pounds.<br><br>&quot;'If it's not hers, whose is it then?' said Pat Hart, who lives down the street.&quot;<br><br>&quot;'I don't feel safe living here, knowing there's a possibility that one can get out,' said Suzanne Fiorello, a mother of two who left Brooklyn for Jackson Township,&quot; located about 60 miles (100 kilometers) south of New York City.<br><br>While police searched the woods of Jackson Township, another strange big cat incident took place on the other side of the continent, in southern Oregon.<br><br>&quot;Several cougar sightings caused officials to post warnings throughout the town&quot; of Shady Cove, Oregon (population 1,351), located on Highway 62 approximately 36 miles (57 kilometers) east of Grants Pass.<br><br>&quot;Concern was piqued Monday (January 25, 1999) when authorities trapped a cougar under a deck near the Rogue River. Residents were being asked to accompany their children to and from school buses. Joggers and walkers were urged to use extra caution.&quot; (See USA Today for January 29, 1999, page 11-A.)<br><hr></blockquote><!--EZCODE QUOTE END--><br>..meeeooowww!! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> :<br><br>~~~ <p>::: That's just typical!
