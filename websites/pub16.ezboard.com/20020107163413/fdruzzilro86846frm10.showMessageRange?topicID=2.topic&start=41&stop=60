Eventually when you've been hit in the head enough, you learn not to do that which gets you hit.  If you don't, you keep getting hit.<br>
<br>
In this case, we keep killing terrorists until they get the point that we will not allow them to intimidate us anymore.  I doubt you'll see an american hostage situation for the next several years, we're too damn pissed off as a country to sit still if they tried to hold us hostage as individuals.<br>

<br>
So, you are a young woman who just broke up with her boyfriend.  As it turns out, he's a bit more violent than you'd anticipated (as your black eye and broken arm prove).  Still, you stood up to him and kicked him out, but he threatened your life: &quot;I'm gonna kill you, bitch!  You can't do this to me!  You haven't seen the last of me @##^&quot; and so on.<br>
<br>
So, you sneak out of the house and trot on down to your local American gun shop to buy the great equalizer.  Sadly, you live in one of the backwards-ass, hyper-liberal, brain-dead states that has a required &quot;cooling off period&quot; for gun purchases.  You sign all of the paperwork, you pass the &quot;instant&quot; background check, proving that you are neither a criminal or insane, and then you go home, hoping the new locks and the Louisville Slugger are enough.<br>
<br>
The next morning your neighbor calls the police because he sees that your front door is busted in.  He reports that he thought he heard a muffled scream in the night, but he was too groggy from a night out drinking to be sure. . . of course, your estranged boyfriend, although drunk, wasn't too groggy to beat your skull in with HIS baseball bat.<br>
<br>
Too bad you couldn't really protect yourself.  You must be crazy.<br>

No, we have a known terrorist and murderer that's still wanted for several prior incidents.  I don't see the problem here.<br>

The problem I do see, however, is that the governments of the world have yet to freeze his and his families assets completely.  His family is worth an estimated 30 billion dollars.

<br>
This is not a criminal case. This is war. You kill your enemies in time of war, and thats what must be done here. You dont haul these terrorists into a courthouse. You leave their corpse to rot on the field of battle. Perhaps Osama Bin Laden would be nice to haul in to a U.S. court, but honestly I think we should just cut off his head and mount it on the torch of the status of liberty ..... to show to all the rest of the radical islamic militants that we will be coming for them too. Folks, this is going to have to be a war of eradication, the days of &quot;clean by the book&quot; operations are over. To destroy these guys we are going to have to be willing to roll in the dirt a bit, get pretty damned nasty, be willing to take some casualties, and deal with some unsavory people. But this is a very winnable war, it will just take time and resolve. But if you want to instead sit around and intellectually debate and argue the rights and wrongs and morally what we can do in this &quot;war&quot; then you are cutting your own throats because these people are extremely base, barbaric, and very willing to do _whatever_ it takes to kill YOU. The only way you stop these type of people is to kill them, kill them, kill them, and to make such a horrible example of them that future terrorists decide to take up a different occupation in life. It ain't pretty, but it has to be done. This is something like a war of survival between two seperate cultures, the western culture vs. the islamic one, or in better terms the radical islamic one they believe in and are greatly jealous and upset that it has been eclipsed by western culture throughout the last several centuries. In a war like that you take off the gloves, its kill or be killed.<br>

  Belegir, <br>
<br>
  I will have to respectfully disagree with you that this is not a criminal case.  The acts committed were a violation of both US and international law.  I will add that I have no military or political background, my education is in criminology and psychology, and I view the world through the filters created by that knowledge.  <br>
 <br>
 I will also disagree that the debate of the moral and ethical nature of our actions holds no value.  A formal declaration of war requires debate by our elected officials.  If we are to do this thing, then let us do it as our founding fathers intended.  <br>
<br>
 As I stated to Lannella, I respect your views as well. I, however, lack your moral certainty that the loss of more innocent lives is acceptable.  It does not mean I love my nation any less.  It does not mean that I am any less willing to lay my life down in its service or met an armed and aggressive enemy with force.  It means that I am unsure that killing innocent members of a repressed society is just.  I hope you will allow me this moral conundrum.  <br>

<br>
Are these people going to respect your laws or any established laws when if they were to win this conflict or fufill their goal of destroying the United States? Also many of you who are not American probably primarily see this as a terrorist vs. the U.S. issue, however it is not. We are simply the vanguard, the protector, the strongest bastion of western civilization in this day and age. If they were to succeed and we were destroyed you'd better bet they would continue to direct their war against the other western nations and peoples. This is more about the struggle of radical islam versus the west than it is of simple terrorists versus a nation they despise.<br>
<br>
Radical Islam needs to be eradicated. Plain and simple. They are the ones who have been responsible for almost all international terrorist attacks of the last 25 years for one reason or another. They are the ones with a dedicated agenda of bringing down the western nations, people, and civilization starting with the United States through terrorist operations.<br>

Here is the most relevant article, in its entirity.  Incidentally, Macleans did this entire issue without advertisers so as not to detract from the subject.<br>
<br>
Maclean's Magazine - Sept 24/2001<br>
<br>
&quot;THE SPIDER AT THE CENTRE OF A DEADLY WEB&quot;<br>
His bearded face flickered across television screens mere hours after the attack, his name repeated as the single most likely suspect responsible for so much death and destruction.  Even prior to Sept. 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden - a 44-year-old Saudi-born multi-millionaire and international terrorist - was America's most wanted man.  Today, he is the world's.  Although in Western eyes his name is synonymous with evil, he possesses near-mythical status among disaffected Muslim activists as the sharpest thorn in the side of the United States.<br>
<br>
Born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in 1957 to a father who would become one of that country's largest and most influential construction magnates, bin Laden lived an early life of privilege.  But in 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, he left Saudi Arabia and used his considerable wealth and connections to help arm and aid the country's mujahedeen guerrillas fighting the Soviets.  For a decade, with every shipment of medicine, troops and guns he brought into the war effort, his influence and stature grew.  The Afghani rebels were also backed by the United States, which funnelled $3 billion into the conflict and trained mujahadeen fighters.  According to some reports, the CIA may also have helped train bin Laden and his fighters in terror techniques.  But bin Laden did not look upon the United States as Afghanistan's - or Islam's - protector.<br>
<br>
After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero, and became an outspoken opponent of the royal family's rule.  He fled the kingdom for Sudan in 1991 in the wake of the Persian Gulf War, considering the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia - home to Islam's two holiest sites, Mecca and Medina - an affront to his religion.  Since then, bin Laden has openly advocated the removal of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia - and the destruction of Israel - and has issued calls to Muslims to &quot;kill Americans and the Jews.&quot;  In 1994, Saudi Arabia withdrew bin Laden's citizenship, exiling him permanently.<br>
<br>
Since 1996, bin Laden has operated from several bases in Afghanistan.  Through his network of supporters knows as Al-Qaeda, he has been connected to terrorist activities in Africa, the Middle East and the United States, where he is believed to have been behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, which left six dead and injured more than 1,000.  he is suspected of financing guerrillas in Somalia, Algeria, and Bosnia.  And members of Al-Qaeda boast of killing American soldiers on a UN peacekeeping mission in Somalia in 1993, simulataneously blowing up U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and crippling the USS Cole last year.  The U.S. state department ahs labelled bin Laden &quot;one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world.&quot;<br>
<br>
Yet with every terrorist act and every failed attempt by the United States to capture and kill him, bin Laden's stature swells.  &quot;He's the man who can take on the Great Satan and win,&quot; said on Middle East intelligence expert.  &quot;Because so much publicity has been given to him, he comes off as a folk hero.  The kids like him.&quot;  In the wake of last week's horror, finding the elusive bin Laden may not even be the West's most difficult task.  Negating the myth and neutralizing his supporters could prove much harder.

  We will have to disagree on the War&gt;Law philosophy. I place a higher value on the Law then just about anything else.  I agree with you that those who committed this act must be stopped. That the radical Islamic movements must be stopped.  I will however disagree that the loss of innocent lives should not be regretted and considered diminishing to us all.  I will spare a tear for the innocent lives on both sides that will be harmed by what is to come.  It is of course your right to disagree with me.  <br>

Been like that since day 1, and any attempt to reverse that or put your stock in law, will get you killed in the end. You become mighty at war, then you become mighty at establishing and setting up your laws. You cannot have laws where you lack the ability to enforce them.<br>

Therefore, when a government that sponsors, feeds, houses, and takes pride in terrorists, they are outside the framework of &quot;international law&quot; since they never agreed to it in the first place.<br>
Recognizing this big picture will hopefully change the minds of these pro &quot;pacifists&quot; and &quot;legal approach&quot; people. We dont live in a bubble. Ghandi succeeded because he was ousting control of a government that wasnt prepared to annihilate him and all his followers. We dont have that luxury here. Civilians wont be targetted by US military troops, this is a war of small wet ops, and pressuring governments to do their own damn job, namely: Stop harboring terrorists or become a target themselves. <p><br><b>Lilhaer Blackdagger</b>

&gt;Eventually when you've been hit in the head enough, you learn not to &gt;do that which gets you hit. If you don't, you keep getting hit.<br>

&gt;In this case, we keep killing terrorists until they get the point that we &gt;will not allow them to intimidate us anymore.

Israel and the intifada would seem to be a real-world example of this strategy being tried (and not working). <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>

If you ask the IRA at what point they were most fearful and most hindered by British efforts against them, it was during the 70s when SAS agents were put in Northern Ireland looking like the common joe, and simply given a list of names, 72 hours, and told to kill as many people on that list as they could in that time period. At the end of 72 hours they were taken out of the area. This was a very successful operation until some members of the Labor party and others starting throwing fits about it. They were taking out all sorts of IRA cell leaders and footmen. And the IRA for the first time was scared shitless because they didnt know if the damned milkman was going to step inside their house and put a bullet in their brain the next morning. <br>
<br>
Let me take you to another point in history. Know how we put down the Philipino insurrection at the turn of the century. Well lets just say if we had the media coverage we do today people would be upset at the U.S. Marine Corps for what they did in the Phillipines. But ya know what? It was A.) neccesary for the insurrection to be put down, and B.) what they had to do in order to do it. They were fighting rebels, insurgents, terrorists, whatever you want to call them. You dont get results from those types by being nice to them and taking the moral high ground. Its ugly, but sometimes its what you need to do in order to win, secure peace, or simply protect your nation, family, and way of life.<br>

I'd love to be pleasantly surprised and see the U.S. exhibit backbone and stomach.  However, I'm so disheartened by recent history (the last decade or two) that if Vegas was accepting bets, I'd put some money down on us giving up after a few hundred/thousand soldiers die in some remote location over a period of months/years.  This is what prompts me to look for (and argue for) other solutions.  Spending a few hundred million for a bounty to have Osama and friends brought to justice, dead or alive, is one that is cheap (compared to any real military effort) and more likely to succeed if my impression of the lack of stomach on the part of the U.S. is correct. <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>

Putting money out on the streets in hopes of getting Bin Laden reminds me of the days that Rome started to allow the Germanic barbarians to fight their battles and fill the ranks of the Roman armies. Its a sign of weakness and decay when one is not willing to fight their own battles for survival.<br>
<br>
I understand your feelings of disappointment with some recent past conflicts in which we were engaged. Yet I simply cannot agree that that we would not be willing to do what must be done because of the price to be paid. In true times of need our country has quite a steel resolve. The ghost of vietnam was finally laid to rest during Desert Storm. Also dont let the lack of resolve demonstrated during the 2 terms of the Clinton administration effect your opinion of our determination during a time like this. This has been THE biggest attack on America since Pearl Harbor. I think you will see a similiar effect this time around too.<br>
<br>
This has nothing to do with any of this post but if you want to know who I feel has clearly addressed and explained the situation at hand, it is Benjamin Netanyahu, ex-Israeli prime minister. I have seen him talk twice so far on this, today he was before a house select panel and what he said was poignant and brilliant. I think it would be wise if we listen to what he has to say in terms of what all of this means.<br>

He is absolutely right about the issue of legalisms in a practical sense.  In a political sense it is important, however, to at least give lip service to institutions such as the world court, etc.  I'd be just as happy if the CIA covertly assassinated Bin Laden &amp; friends or put out the bounty on his head through middlemen, paid for in gold.<br>

I think your analogy to the Roman decline is, sadly, all too accurate - which is why I suggest these methods.  Better to use the less vocal, indirect approach, than to brashly try the direct method, then run home with your tail between your legs, failing visibly and dramatically after such big talk. <p>Enki/Wagner, Officer of the Valiant Elite<br>
