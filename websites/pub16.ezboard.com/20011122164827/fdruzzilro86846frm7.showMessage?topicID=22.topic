Except her name wasn't Jennifer, but none of that really mattered, because he called her Pumpkin.  In return, she called him, &quot;Snuggliewuggliesniggliewiggliehoneylambpootiepie&quot;  and this gave him a sour feeling in his stomach whenever she said it.  <br>
<br>
Here's why:   He already had an inferiority complex due to the fact that  he was short.  She never knew  if it upset him or not, since he always wore a permanent scowling expression on his face.   She would pick the worst times to use this pet name.  <br>
<br>
For instance, there was that weekend rendevous they had in Halas. They stopped at a little tavern for hot cider.  He excused himself to go see a man about a horse, which is a funny saying because nobody knew what a horse was.  Certainly, he didn't know what a horse was and he doubted anyone else knew either.  When he got back, he found his seat at their table had been taken by other patrons in the bar.  Two of the Yerfacin brothers had moved in on Pumpkin.   It was Illkick and his twin brother Illsmash.  They were showing off to Pumpkin, by chugging mugs of ale and competing to see who could belch the loudest.  <br>
<br>
Was she giggling?<br>
<br>
As he rounded the corner, the giggling stopped abruptly.  Pumpkin stood up with a dignified expression as she wiped the smears of blue paint from her left cheek and shouted, &quot;Thank Tunare you're back, my Snuggliewuggliesniggliewiggliehoneylambpootiepie, these horse's arses can't keep their paws to themselves!&quot; <br>
<br>
Right about then it got very quiet in the tavern.   You could have heard a pin drop.  <br>
<br>
Here's the scoop:  <br>
<br>
You see, none of the people in this tavern knew what a horse was either, but they knew what an arse was and they knew when they thought someone was trying to talk over their head.  If there's one thing a barbarian hates, it's to be reminded that he's stupid.  Add that to the fact that up here in this neck of the woods, you have names like Facesmasher and Bloodyfist, and anything less means you arre probably a pansy arsed fuzzy woodland animal loving treehugger.  One look at the little short guy with the tree pajamas said it was so. The long silence was finally broken, with the sounds of beer mugs clinking down and tables and chairs being moved.<br>
<br>
&quot;Uh, Pumpkin?  Get your purse, honey.&quot;<br>
<br>
 She could have stopped right there, but she went on, &quot;Now you're going to get it!  My boyfriend is going to kick your arse!&quot;<br>
<br>
There comes a time in every young man's life when he must stand up and be a man.  To answer the call of testosterone and fight!  This was not one of those times, as it appeared that Pumpkin had already pushed a table over  and punched Illsmash in the groin.  I'llkick promptly delivered his foot to Pumpkin's face, knocking out her two front teeth.<br>
<br>
I'llsmash dropped to his knees and began to cry.  If you've never witnessed a bawling barbarian, let me tell you that it's a pitiful sight.  <br>
<br>
Pumpkin snatched up her purse and beamed a winning toothless smile at our young treehugging hero, &quot;I donk kink ger awe any WUTABAGAS hewe!  I'sh gok mah pursh, lesh gek oush osh here,&quot; and further added, &quot;Mah Shmuggwiewuggwieshmiggwiewiggwiehommeywambpoopiepie!&quot;<br>
<br>
With a gust of wind and a sparkle of violet disco action, they created a mystical portal and winked out of sight...<br>
