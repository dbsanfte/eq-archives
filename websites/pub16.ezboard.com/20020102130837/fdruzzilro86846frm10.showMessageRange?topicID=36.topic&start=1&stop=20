How many of ya that are arguing back and forth about blowin the ever-livin shit outta some country/person, etc... have ever been in the military?<br>
<br>
How many of ya have held a gun in ya hands that can take the head completely off of a persons' shoulders? How many of ya have seen that happen?<br>
<br>
How many of ya have lived o'erseas and had the locals so furious at the American Gov't or whatnot, that the base was locked down with some pretty nasty guns pointed at anyone who got too close?<br>
<br>
How many of ya have seen the above and been so scared that ya didn't want to leave the base to drive home? And when ya got home, how many were so frightened that ya couldn't get yaself out of the house the next day to make the scary trip back to the same base with the same lock down and security?<br>
<br>
Finally, how many of ya have seen all this in a country that was supposedly PEACEFUL? A country that ISN'T on the news every nite? A country that is much like Switzerland in it's lil quiet shell?<br>

I am definitely not what one would consider a &quot;hawk&quot; and I am certanily not trying to pick a fight here, but turning the other cheek in this instance will only get us more of the same.<br>

There is no justification for murdering innocent people... period.<br>
<br>
Saying that 7,000 innocent people were killed here, does NOT make it ok to kill 1 innocent person anywhere.<br>
<br>
As for Ladi's point, if you've never experienced the horrors of war, then it's pretty easy to say &quot;let's kill em!&quot;  This isn't a made for TV movie, this is real life.  Real people are going to be killed.  You can't apologize for accidentally killing someone and there isn't a way to make it right.<br>

you want our govt to take innocent lives away?  even if it is collateral dmg, or however you spell that,  it would be ok since american lives were lost<br>

what i mean is without proof... innocent till proven guiltly...or does this only apply to those fortunate to be USA citizens?<br>

Give me proof (evidence) that these &quot;perpetrators&quot; are the cause of this injustice done to the American citizens and i support a &quot;war&quot; wholeheartedly<br>

I do want to say i want to support our troops in all circumstances, cause well i, and most of everyone who will read this post has brothers, sisters, and friends in the service<br>

I saw a man who lived though a grenade blast treated at my post with a sucking chest wound because the only thing that saved him was the fact he was carrying his baby, and parts of said baby where stuck in him after the explosion, and the worst thing I ever saw was in a hole in the ground out side the city of Pasjaine.

Furthermore no one wants to see that anywhere in the world<br>

this is 2001, the USA believe it or not rules this world, when will We take responsibility?  How far away are we from world citizenship?  how far away are we from making this a one world govt?<br>
<br>
when will we establish an unbiased one world economy?<br>
<br>
USA: 5% of the world population<br>
USA: 90% of the worlds moneys<br>
<br>
We as Americans are not better than the the rest of the peoples that populate the earth, and we do not deserve better, we are on a equal par in the eyes of god, i hope that someday, prolly far away, that all can be called world citizens, with international morality, world citizenship, one economy,  one people<br>

This is war.<br>
<br>
We don't yet have the capability to target individuals in most instances.  We don't yet have the capacity to even know who's guilty and who's innocent all of the time.<br>
<br>
We DO know, however, that Osama Bin Ladin was the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks against America.<br>
<br>
We DO know that he has been very outspoken about killing Americans.<br>
<br>
We DO know that the Taliban has harbored him for the past 10 years or so and that they are protecting him now.<br>
<br>
We strongly suspect that he masterminded, or at least supported this latest attack.  I believe that our government has proof.<br>
<br>
This attack was an act of war.  There is no other way to interpret it.  There is no way to back down from that aside from pure, unadulterated cowardice.<br>
<br>
War is not pretty.  Nobody should have to go through it.  But when it comes time for it, it has to happen.<br>
<br>
A war was NEEDED to stop the Nazis from slaughtering millions.  It happened and it was effective.<br>
<br>
A war was NEEDED to stop the Japanese from raping, torturing and murdering their way through the pacific rim.  It happened and it was effective.<br>
<br>
A war was NEEDED to stop &quot;ethnic clensing&quot; in the balklands.  It happened and it was effective.<br>
<br>
A war was NEEDED to beat Saddam Hussain back out of Kuwait.  It happened, and it was effective in that goal, at least.<br>
<br>
In each and every one of those conflicts there were civilian casualties.  Sadly that's just the way war goes.  The only good thing that can be said about war today as compared to then is that the technology has improved enough so that we can significantly decrease the number of civilian casualties, as the more recent conflicts proved.<br>
<br>
Of course, we are fighting an enemy, in this case, that thinks nothing of hiding behind women and children to protect themeselves.  They think nothing of putting &quot;human shields&quot; around their military installations.  They consider it normal to manufacture chemical weapons in the same factories they make baby formula in. . .<br>
<br>
Don't for a second believe that if we just ignore this it will go away.<br>
<br>
Don't for a second think that these folks would be done if we pulled all of our troops back home.<br>
<br>
Don't for a second consider our support of Israel a factor, or our embargo of Iraq the deciding point.  We could stop both and still be subject to these attacks.<br>
<br>
We are at war, and we cannot half-ass or peacenik our way through it or we've lost before it starts.  And losing this war will result in civilian casualties that haven't even been hinted at thus far. . . <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

America has the most well equipped military force in the world, are say we are unable to get Bin Laden without blowing up Afgahistan and all of the innocent people that live there?  Are you saying we can't track the movements of ONE man?  You don't think very highly of America's ability do you?<br>
<br>
As for the comments about what they will or won't do...  Do you know what they are angry about?  Do some history on what America has been doing over in the Middle East.  Do some research on Palestine and Israel.  Do some research instead allowing the media to inform you.  I'm not backing Bin Laden or any terrorist, but they are angry for a reason, not just because they hate Freedom. <p>Tettsuo Otomo<BR>54 Grasshopper of the Lost Circle<BR>Druzzil Ro</p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/utettsuo1.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Tettsuo1</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/white_fire.gif" BORDER=0> at: 9/27/01 4:13:31 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/unumenorean.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Numenorean</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_ball.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Druzzil Ro Member</span><br>  Posts: 319<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(9/27/01 4:33:36 pm)</font><br>    <BR><img src=http://w3.one.net/~derek/201.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Just my 2cp</span><hr size=1> Ladi,<br>

Put me down as yes for all of your questions. Fear is natural, it is healthy, however letting it take control of your actions is an entirely different thing. Did I have fear with some of the things I did in the military, yes. Did I let it control me or my actions, no.<br>
<br>
I still think we should do what it takes to eliminate worldwide terrorism, no questions asked, no two ways about it. We are talking basic survival here.<br>

There are Terrorists all over the world, and if I was part of a group right now I would be messing my pants. We Know for sure that bin Laden is a terrorist. SO, with a war on Terrorism, he his screwed weather he did this or not, tough dodo, he should have been a contracter like his daddy. The people that loved us (well for the most part) in Kosovo, the KLA or UCK depending on where your from, where classified as a terrorist group before they became our buddies. After we saved their asses and try and bring peace, they invade Maceadonia, a very peaceful country screaming &quot;Greater Albainia&quot;. The madmen that did this are not happy unless they are fighting someone, thats a terrorist group standard, the UK could ceed Northern Ireland to the Country of Ireland right now, and there would be PIRA members in Wales blowing shit up yelling free our celtic brothers. They wanted a fight, they came looking for a fight, they picked the biggest kid on the block and sucker punched him, know thier going to get punched back, and we will knock there dicks in the dirt. <br>
As for shooting a woman holding her baby, its not on the top of my list of shit to do before I die, but if it comes down to her child not having a mother, or mine not having a father,(Ie, Somalia/gunman behind a human shield) well, Daddy is coming home, and I would try to take him though the head.<br>

<br>
Then you say that. Ya know... I am NOT against blowin the shit out of someone. I am NOT against retaliation for the many INNOCENT LIVES that were destroyed (either by death or aftereffects) in the WTC atrocity. Hell, I didn't spend my years in the Armed Forces for nothing.<br>
<br>
I want the person that did this to pay. I'm just askin everyone to think about what they might be doing to:<br>
<br>
1. The civilians caught in the cross-fire.<br>
2. The many lives in the military that may be lost in your war.<br>
3. The many lives that will be affected by the lives lost in your war.<br>
<br>
By all means... I think bin Laden should be nuked to Pluto. Sure! Go for it! Send in all the military that is gnawin at the chains that bind them (at this time) and let it be done. Or, do as Tettsuo recommended and gut the bastard. Let him sit for a few days watchin his blood drip onto the floor. Make him sit his last few days in pain and force him to think about what he has done.<br>
<br>
But before you sit here in judgement, I beg of you, think about it.. Think about what you are starting. Think about what you may be doing.<br>
<br>
If I was still in the Armed Forces, I would be gnashin my teeth, waitin for the signal to go put a hole in bin Laden. But, my rational mind begs me pause to ensure that I don't cause any more pain than is necessary. By that, I mean the ones that are civilians and did not get a choice in the matter when the decision was made to (attempt) to destroy our country.<br>
<br>
We are older and (hopefully) smarter. We have more toys of destruction than ever before. We have trainin and schools that can help us minimialize this. Instead of sayin, &quot;Clear the country-side of all life&quot;, tryin thinkin up ways to sneak attack and eliminate.<br>
<br>
Long and drawn out paragraphs that basically say, &quot;Kill the Terrorist Asshole and try to preserve all other lives.&quot; .... if possible.<br>

<br>
Proof?  You want proof?  YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE PROOF!!  Hehe.  Seriously, the government of the United States doesn't really owe you an explanation.  Sorry, friend, but if they believe that they have sufficient evidence, and they are willing to share that evidence as needed (and informing the American public isn't really needed at this point in time), then they should go forth and do what needs be done.  No, I don't blindly trust my government, but I also don't feel the need to shackle them with the crippling effects of being a book open to the world.<br>
<br>
Tettsuo - If the American military or intelligence infrastructure could locate Bin Ladin, he'd already be dead.  They can't yet, but they are trying.<br>
<br>
As for whether or not we should/could &quot;murder&quot; people to rid the world of this evil?  If it has to happen, then I say so be it.  I don't want it, but I don't see any way around it under the current circumstances.  We had to &quot;murder&quot; civilians in both world wars and several conflicts before and since in order to prevent worse in the long run.  Freedom has a price.<br>
<br>
Ladi, I'm with you.  I can't join up or I would.  I've tried (albeit not recently) - And I feel for every innocent life lost and every soldier that might be.  I do, however, see the potential for greater good in spite of the short term losses we will all inevitably face.<br>
<br>
This has to be done.<br>

Here's the thing, Tet.  I don't fucking care.  Really.<br>
<br>
They can have whatever reason they want (and I really do have a firmer grasp upon the history and dynamics than you seem to think), but it will never, EVER justify what they did.<br>

How do we know every facet of the man's life if we are unable to locate him?  We sure do know alot about a man we're unable to locate.<br>
<br>
2.  I'm not justifying their actions.  The murder of innocent life is just as wrong for us to do, as it was for them to do.  Don't be a hypocrite.  The door swings both ways on that statement.  You're justifying the murder of their people, but when they bombed us it's not justifiable...hmmm.<br>
<br>
3.  Whiny shit?  If that was directed at me... LOL!!  If any of my RL friends saw that, they'd bust a gut laughing.  Do you know what it like to get put in handcuffs for something you didn't do?  Sucks don't it.  Imagine getting you legs blown off for something you didn't do.  That would only create more Bin Ladens in the world.  It'll only create more hatred towards America.<br>
<br>
4.  In every other war, America knew who they were attacking.  They had absolute proof that an entire country was the problem.  But how do we deal with a group that doesn't represent the entire country?  The people that live there do not support Bin Laden or the Taliban.  So who are we bombing?  It's not like they're all sitting in one area of the country waiting for American forces.<br>
<br>
5.  Has anyone every considered the terrorist that live in America?  We haven't even wiped them out yet, and we plan to wipeout terrorism on a global scale?  Sounds dumb don't it?<br>
