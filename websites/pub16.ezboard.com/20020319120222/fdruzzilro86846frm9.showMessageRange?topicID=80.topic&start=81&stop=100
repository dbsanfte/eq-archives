<br>
I like your posts. I will freely admit that 90% of you guys dont even know me. Even though i am lvl 53. I have played this game for a year and a half. Been on a few dragon raids and helped guilds on a few cleric rotations etc. I cant say I have seen a lot of the game but, I do regularly read these boards. <br>
<br>
But enough about that. I think that Kal is right. I dont know if Vindication closed their membership, but I think it is the attitude that uber guilds have developed that might have helped spawn this. <br>
<br>
For example I was formerly the guildmaster of Obsidian Circle of Power, a small guild that was around for a year. When I disbanded the guild, I went to seek a uber guild that would take me. Since I am not lvl 57 ( the lvl needed to carry the small coffins since I am a necro), guilds didnt need me. I went to Hoss, Valiant Elite, Mythic Legion, and several other guilds only to be told I cant join their magnificent guild. I feel as though I am a good player, and one of those people that tries to help out a lot. Most people that have met me or know me generally feel that I am one of the good guys. <br>
<br>
But all these guilds that basically laughed at you when u applied might have it kick them in the ass now. Vindication might get all those people that originally had intentions to help a guild. Thus their power will expand. Now this is hypothetical (or however you spell it) but I think this looks tempting to all those people that got rejected by the other guilds. It would almost seem fun to get in a guild that is just going to get whatever it is they want. I know that if I joined a guild like Vindication, now just bare with me about this for one sec and look at it from this point of view, that I could say, &quot;Hey guild, I need my eye of Innoruk for my epic.&quot; And they would have no problem assembling a mass of people to get it! Ya know, since they are all so &quot;bored&quot; anyway... LOL.<br>
<br>
Might open a guilds eyes up to be a little nicer to those people outside thier little &quot;click&quot; that were attempting to just move on. Could be a good lesson for Uber guilds to learn, by losing the potential haughty attitude.<br>
<br>
Anyway, dont take me wrong. I am not saying I am siding with Vindication. I am also not saying that everyone is wrong. <br>
I, too, believe in rotations as it makes total sense to be able to have a chance to get what you want like everyone else.....<br>
but everyone else that is in an uber guild... You, know, the ones you get refused admittance cuz you are not of sufficent lvl in their eyes.  Catch my point?<br>
<br>
I dont even know what this IGB thing is. My friends tell me its a special club that only Guildmasters and officers of uber guilds get to see. I assume it is some board or something but oh well. <br>
<br>
Also, I feel that this is all a massive form of discrimination. Unless Vindication violates any rules set forth by VERANT, NOT DRUZZIL RO, then I think they have every right to do and act as they please. If /anon is what they want to do, then so what? It is their guild. /anon is a command allowed by EQ. Just because most guilds decide not to use it as much as they do dosent make all these guilds right and them wrong. Hell, if I was making the move as guildmaster of Vindication, I would want my men/women to be anon too. If the guild is self-sufficent, then revealing your guildtag is only going to elicit the &quot;childish&quot; responses from everyone that they claim they are above on these boards. I wouldn't want my guild to have to be harrassed either. <br>
<br>
I would like to thank Crystal Oracle, led by Vildaen, for accepting me in their guild. Since all the &quot;uber guilds&quot; refused me, I had nowhere to go. Fortuantly, CO, was kind enough to grant me admittance. <br>
<br>
So, just look at it from that point of view and sit back and reflect for a bit. I am not promoting Vindication and their beliefs, cuz to be honest, I dont know what they are. I may be wayyy of base with what they are trying to do. But, I think Druzzil Ro should step back for a minute and just take a deep breath and just be a little bit open minded and just reflect upon these issues. <br>
<br>
I wish all guilds luck and well on their upcoming decisions. All I hope for is that this dosent sever Real life friendships and that everyone remains civil to eachother. We are still all people. Just look at this as a pretty good chess move. Now its ur turn!  =D <p>Alitor Lifestealer<BR>

What we can do is keep playing by the rules with each other and try to limit the damage that Vindi causes us. I spoke today at some length to Zylark, one of the DRo guides. He informed me that it wasn't a new gm that made the decisions in North Wing but was in fact Bogell. I was told to email Bogell who would return an email with the reasons for the decision that was made. <br>
<br>
I read here some conflicting reports tho, that it was not in fact Bogell. Well, what we need then is proof of who it was and what he did. One person went so far as to say he had screenshots of the events and things said. I ask from you please bundle all the proof together and email Bogell, and anyone else you can think of. If this is a problem go ahead and email the details to me (msg me in game and I'll give you my email addy) and I will make sure the right people (Every damn last one of em) gets a copy of the info. We can't sit back and wait for a solution to come forward, but we may unfortunately be limited in what actions we can take. <br>
<br>
This is a time when we all have to play to the letter of the law to make sure they get no ammunition to use against us. On the other side of that token tho, they will need to be careful what they do around us. Petition and report are two commands we need to be prepared to use and use as frequently as necessary. But also make sure we have our logs turned on and take screenshots if we have to. Proof is important, more so when it involves a Gm playing favorites.<br>
<br>
I do apologize for the length of this post, unfortunately I have too much to say and can't seem to find a way to say it quicker.<br>
<br>
As for people in vindication, if you happen to read this, it won't matter to you but I won't be doing anything for any of you in the near future. No, it doesn't matter who you are or your personal opinions of this ffa nonsense. You wear the tag so that makes you part of the problem. It doesn't matter if a man stood as a guard for the Nazi's or if he was one of their killers, by wearing the badge he takes responsibility for all their crimes. You always have a choice even if the choice sucks. A man puts a gun to your head and says rape that woman or I'll kill you, you have a very horrible choice to make, but if you are a person of moral worth you take the bullet. Very extreme examples and way more serious than a game (I can't really think of any other analogies at this hour of the morning), but you can't sit here and message that you are not responsible for your guilds actions. Remove the tag if you don't agree with what they're doing... be a man.  But don't ask me to not judge you by the actions of the guild you belong to.<br>
<br>
Good Luck to everyone that has been screwed by this. My guild was one of those. We lost our chance at Tormax tonight, a fight we looked forward to all week. There will be other fights tho, we are not going to stop trying just because a few are trying to make us miserable, we are stronger than that.<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your time<br>

In the time before Luclin everything was rotation based.  When Luclin came around everything pre-luclin was rotation based and everything in luclin was ffa.  Ok so with respect to high end content maybe 50% was on rotation and 50% was ffa.  Regardless I think this will make the game more interesting to say the least.  Anyone who is whining about this needs to realise that 90%+ of the other servers are ffa and this druzzil-ro experiment has failed.  So its a game and if you dont like the server move to a different one.  Better yet, try to get Verrant to change their policy to suit your desires... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/umythusmistwalker.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Mythus Mistwalker</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 6:04:54 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=90>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://1stfistoflight.com/html/images/forum/avatar/022.gif WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication declares FFA</span><hr size=1> been a few threads about one guild showing dominance and deciding there own rule on other servers, perhaps this is vindications idea at taking a shot at &quot;ruling&quot; so to speak.<br>

If you were planning on doing something that took even a little bit of strategy, wouldnt you want every advantage that you could get? Everyone now is going to be like, Oh, I wonder what Vindi is up to...w/ anon, you gonna have to wait till they stike to find out.<br>
<br>
But lets not kid oursleves here. This isnt the first time that one guild hasnt respected a compromise on Dru Ro (The IGB or Dru Ro reservation). Hect, Vindi wasnt the only guild walking all over another group of people on Fri night.<br>
<br>
Let me explain.<br>
<br>
I planed a Fear run for Fri the 18th so that myself and a few friends could attain epic drops that we all needed. The people who were to recieve epic drops dont often get a chance at these particular drops because it requires for us a full on run. So I planned all week, had at least 24 people commited to goin, many of whom are my friends from IGB related guilds.<br>
<br>
Only one problem. The sceduled patch for Tues did not occur. So, the CT rotaion on IGB fell to Fri because he was last this past Fri. Turns out NI was up for their 1st time on CT. Well I contacted both Lylala and Lacroix in game and was told that since they had not done Fear in so log, they had some antsy wizzies and chanters. They intended on doin epic mobs on Fri along w/ CT and that it was bad timing for me and my group, too bad. <br>
<br>
I asked numerous times for them to reconsider, to work a compromise, but alas my request was ignored. Actually, on their boards, where some of the discussion took place, they threatened to steamroll my group if they werent getting what they wanted. Seriously, check it out..eqinvictus.com And Lacroix told me they respect Dru Ro net reservations. Please.<br>
He aslo said that IGB &gt; Dru Ro. Whatever. Guess you can imagine I cancelled my run so I would not put my friends into an awkward situation.<br>
<br>
Sound familiar? If you ask me, which you havent, the Dru Ro community has alot of good things going for it. But it also has some negatives too that need to be adressed. The IGB is good when used wisely and just. IGB used as a sword to get what you want is like a FFA. Its wrong.<br>
<br>
FFA isnt the solution.<br>
<br>
What we have now isnt working either but its a hell of alot better then FFA. It shows that e the Dru Ro community at least try and respect our peers, even if e do drop the ball once in awhile.<br>
<br>
It doesnt appear that Vindi will go back to being IGB just from Deadsouls post. Doesnt look like there is anything we can do about it.<br>
<br>
Or is there?<br>
<br>

I agree completely.  Vindication deciding to go FFA on everything isn't going to affect the large guilds much, who've been at this for years.  Vindication may be better in the end for this action or they may regret it.  The small and medium sized guilds will probably be missing out the most on all the fun of attempting/destroying the end game encounters, though.  That bothers me. <p><b><p align=center><a href=http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=18464><font color=990000> Revenant of Mythic Legion</font></a></b>

Be lucky they followed the rules you wanted them to follow for so long.<br>
<br>
Now, if Vindication came in and started to kill your uber mob after you were in the zone and started clearing to it, THEN you have a right to bitch.<br>
<br>
Hoss can't do shit until after 9:00pm EST.  FFA would screw us.  You don't see me whining about it.<br>

Instead of complaining, how about you get your butt in gear and adapt the changes in your evironment?  There is NOTHING stopping your guilds from organizing and killing mobs before vindication does.<br>

Oh, and the views expressed in this post are solely my own, yadda yadda.  Don't train my guild members and send them nasty tells just because of my post like you all do to Vindication, thanks.<br>

Vindi decided to go FFA which means we dont accept any IGB-rotations, we found out some of ntov was up, so lets kill it.<br>
<br>
When i entered the zone, there was only me and another l'malla guy in zone. So after we got ~15pl in zone we started to clear flurry drakes, there was still only like 3 l'malla ppl in zone, and they didnt do anything but following us with their CoH mage. After an hour or two we are finally through all this junk so we can get to some dragons, we are about 30 in zone ready to kill, l'malla is still doing nothing but following us around, apparently they got a few members from ML to come safe them.<br>
Then for some reason they call a GM, not sure what their intention was with that, make us leave the zone when its 100% clear we have the force to kill dragons and they dont?<br>
I guess an officer from each guilds is talking with the GM about the issues, and lets see what it ends up with by looking at what was said in /ooc and /shout.<br>
<br>
Athelan says, 'Do I need to explain it to all of you?'<br>
Athelan says, 'So'<br>
Athelan says, 'If they kill vyemm first'<br>
Athelan says, 'They are ready for Vulak'<br>
Athelan says, 'and waiting on you'<br>
Athelan says, 'If you kill back 5 you re ready for vulak and waiting on them'<br>
Athelan says, 'chop chop!'<br>
<!--EZCODE BOLD START--><b>  Athelan says, 'Your not in the wrong here'<br>
Athelan says, 'But they arent either'</b><!--EZCODE BOLD END--><br>
Athelan shouts, 'If ML/Lmalla Can clear Vyemm and the drakes up to Vulak then they are entitled to him when Vindi clears back 5'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'If Vindi clears back 5 and clears to vulak and is waiting on ML/Lmalla to kill Vyemm then Vulak is theres'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'Both of you have rights to this zone and have earned what you are killing'<br>
<br>
Not a bad deal for l'malla eh? They gotta kill 1 dragons while vindi has to kill several dragons to get Vulak.<br>
<br>
Auedaar shouts, 'mr gm, wouldnt that count as leapfrogging?'<br>
Auedaar says out of character, 'since lmalla killed all the other dragons thus allowing VD to get in to ToV'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'Explain how Lmalla logging last night and loggin in as Vindi clears flurries already in the zone is leapfrogging?'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'Was Lmalla already here killing flurries? Did Vindi CoH in front of them?'<br>
Auedaar says out of character, 'i am arguing that the situation where vd gets back dragons and Lmalla gets vyemm and the first person to be done gets vulak basically sets up a leapfrogging contest'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'Stop talking and kill and earn your vulak'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'And before I get any lip, let me note i was Teliesins, and Xzotts supervisors'<br>
Paperr shouts, 'hoooooo and that means to me?'<br>
Paperr shouts, 'what?'<br>
Athelan shouts, 'Means you got a dragon to kill'<br>
<br>
After this we kill the dragons and clear to Vulak as what was our part of the deal, before ML/mallas combined force of 70+ ppl has engaged Vyemm... Somehow they fail, and flurry pats is spawning meanwhile, making their CR almost impossible. For some reason Vyemm is running forth and back at their CR spot, and ofcourse they accuse us for training them.. But if that was the truth im pretty sure you would see a few vindi members warned, since there was both GM-Bogell and GM-Athelan in the zone watching what was going on. After a long and messy CR from l'malla/ml we start to clear the flurry pats and drag their corpses in safety, untill the GM just asks them to log out for 15mins while we clean up Vyemm and all the pats near their CR spot. Either some of them missed the tells, or refused to do it, thats why they got ported out by the GM's.<br>
<br>
There was no KS'ing, there was no leapfrogging.. and as you can see we followed the GM/Verant-rules which is the same as FFA. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/uteutebod.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Teutebod</A> at: 1/19/02 10:39:18 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/ubuazagbonesteel.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Buazag Bonesteel</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_lightning.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Newbie</span><br>  Posts: 24<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 10:38:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=101>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Vindication declares FFA</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE QUOTE START--><blockquote><b><i>Quote:</i></b><hr> Does anyone else find it funny that half of the people that are bitching and moaning about FFA in this post will never see any of these mobs?

I'll be the first to admit that I spend way too much time playing this game.  I am a powergamer at heart.  I play and push to excell and that is enjoyable to me(most of the time:P).  Does this make me inherently better than the person who only plays a few hours here and there?  The person who is level 30 but has spent hundreds of hours working on trade skills? No way.  Treat people like people.  In the long run it does more for you <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I saw very little &quot;bitching and moaning&quot; actually.  What I do see is a lot of people voicing their opinions.  Calling it bitching and moaning because those opinions differ from your's doesn't change that.<br>
<br>
That said...it is my opinion that although my guild will probobly be hurt by this as we are mostly people who work and rarely get started til 9-10 est, this isnt neccesarily a bad thing.  This server badly needs a split and maybe this will begin to faccilitate that.  Having an actual system where we could plan ahead a bit was nice.  Lots of people don't play EVERY day.  Being able to know if one day was more important than another because you were up for Tormax helps when you really need a significant turn out for said mob.  All good things come to an end however. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#112512><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub16.ezboard.com/urease.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Rease</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Big Nastah</span><br>  Posts: 54<br> <font color=#CCCCC8>(1/19/02 11:07:04 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub16.ezboard.com/fdruzzilro86846frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=80.topic&index=102>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> bleh</span><hr size=1>                   If your going to tell a story then tell the whole story Teutebod.  I am not sure how yo got a gm in your pocket but just about everything he did was absolutely one sided.  We had Vyemm perfect he was dying and drakes mysteriously came out of nowhere.  Flurries and something else...the flurry was no where near the time it was supposed to pop.  It either a) came early (impossible) or b) was trained on our casters(entirely likely considering that we were trained subsequently three times on our cr).  You say that you helped us with cr and stuff like good little boys and girls.  Well first off the gm said you had to help, secondly I doubt you did very much for us considering we would not accept help from such petulant babies as yourselves.  Then after Deadsouls(who is all of a sudden a tov newbie altho he has been a part of countless raids there) trains us repeatedly the gm says that we have to leave because Vindication is ready to take on Vyemm roflmao.  Where the f00k did this clown come from my lord that is the single most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of.  He then proceeds to tl to bind our non kos cr people and clerics.  You gimps decided aary was down so you could easily get in and take the wimps that were left exluding Vyemm who is supposedly tough but well frankly he seems like a gimp to me as well.  You are immature little brats no other way to say it.  I am sure you think that if everyone boycott's any and all associations with you that you will be fine because you have porters on other accounts and clerics to rez ya but you reap what you sow and it won;t be so easy you can just trust me on that.  Watch what happens when other guilds with more members and more dedication (read: not lootwhorish children) bring the thunder on your prepubescant little asses.  I know I know you are not all children but ya sure acted like it and sometimes actions speak louder than the facts in a given situation.  <br>
            Linlainu, and every other sheep who was just supporting their friends!!1! you can all kiss my ass although I am not a friend to many of you it is your loss.  You followed through with your azn pride homies of whatever you clowns now call yourselves so you reap the benefits and negative side effects just the same.  I relish the challenge with you clowns because I am smarter than you and I belong to a better guild with much better people on the whole.  We will overcome you silly little clowns in every way possible.  I cannot wait to see your whining posts when L`Malla, Mythic Legion, and every other guild from the smallest to the largest on the server just absolutely obliterates the idea you came up with and  thought would net you more mobs.  You are now outcasts congratulations and when your little world comes crashing down have fun server changing to find a new identity because on DRO you might as well not exist.  I wish you all the luck in the war AZN homies or whatever you want to be called but I am afraid it is now the time for the better guilds to show you just who is who.  <br>

Just have a few comments.<br>
<br>
You guys all act as if all the mobs shal now be killed by vindication. This is quite untrue. If you get there and kill the mob first, congrats it is yours. If you have 50 people waiting to kill that mob and are activly going to try and take it down, we will not leap-frog your guild and take the mob you've been trying for 2 hours. If a mob is up and only 5 people in a zone and we have the force to kill it, we shall kill him if we wish to.<br>
<br>
This will affect perhaps none of the guilds that frequent this site, including your giggalot, your kael arena is safe. (and i'm quite afraid of your kick my ass in RL comment haha) Ragefire is needed by 0 of our clerics, maybe a twink but only 1 comes to mind. I do not see the ragefire rotation being thrown away simply by our going FFA. I do remember actually my ragefire taken by NK when i was up for it. I didn't like it but there is NO moral claim that i could ever make against them, they had every right to rage as i did. I camped rage again and he was killed within 30 minutes of being up. I didn't come here to bitch out NK, i couldn't care less it happen that's all. I just made sure i'd get the next one and i did. <br>
<br>
The GM that was there in my opinion was fair. He set up rules and he enforced them. He was NOTthere to enforce IGB, IGB is MEANINGLESS, anything you have to claim it has any form of power has zero weight. He was there to enfore PNP, that is what GM's do in these situations. The back 5 dragons, Jorlleag, Lady Nevedaria, Zlexak, Cekenar, and Sevalak were all killed BEFORE Lord Vyemm was atempted by L`malla + ML we were waiting on these guilds to kill thier mob so we may kill Vulak, which we had won by killing the back five. The GM saw that ML and L`malla did not have the people to kill Lord Vyemm and we were given the go ahead. Vulak was aggro'ed once by our guild. A member of our guild went LD and walked LD straight into Vulak and aggro'ed him and died. This was not intentional, and quite accidental. You may ask the various clerics we rezed for ML, malla only one i remember off the top of my head is jixi. We did not purposely aggro vulak ever. The GM was enforcing the rules, which were obviously not in favor of L`malla as they failed Lord Vyemm and lost thier chance. Your maturity you try to show that Vindication lacks, lets perhaps remember the the fact that the guild L`malla got a WARNING, meaning 1 more warning you will be disbanded as a guild. A warning because you flat out insulted, demeaned, and ridiculed the GM that was staying 2 hours overtime because of this, for doing his job. Great job guys, shouting in ooc we want to email your superior, he IS the superior. <br>
<br>
On the note of not giving vindication members a port or rez. Do whta you want, and judge me by my guild tag. You must be the same one that does not pick me up for a taxi ride because i'm black, or the one that makes a rude look at someone shopping in your store because they look indian. I find it quite hypocritical in this and i highly doubt i will ever really get refused a port because of my guild tag. If i do i won't care but get another one elsewhere, your ignorance is not important to me. I'm not going to stop rezing people in the zone just because we are FFA, omg does that mean i can become the asshole i really wanted to be. Our guild contains the same mixture of people every other guild has. From age 15 to 30+ <br>
<br>
On a side note, finally someone, Uumdano realizes that there is a point to going anon, besides the customary &quot;ashamed of your guild&quot; jokes. Too bad the rest just can't figure out anything intelligent when they make those comments. When you decide to go off in ooc you are not making us look bad but yourself, though i admit sometimes humourously lol. <br>
<br>
As for my personal feeling on FFA, frankly the communist form of IGB of equallity is just BS. There is a reason communism fell, it was flawed. There always will be guilds at the top and guilds at the bottom. IGB made this game so entirely boring. What's on the menu today? This game is about having fun and IGB really did just make killing large mobs not fun. It must be greed though, it has to that's a much more evil thing so lets just say that's what the reason was. Do we like new items, yes just like you. Was greed our motivation, no. You may not wish to believe this, once again I dont care. My friends are not going to change after this and i don't expect them to.  These are soley my views, not shik's ciner's or deadsoul's or Vindication's. Only thing that really bothers me in game/life is ignorance, granted some of it can't be seen right away it still sounds stupid when others that know what's going on read it. <p>Kryai Soulcarver
