circa 1986. I think I was in college back in BC, Canada. A friend of mine invites me to go with him to Vancouver (1 hr away) to look at a motorcycle he was thinking of buying. We arrive at a marina and we look around a little bit. We see a real buxom blonde strolling out, looking like a model. We find the yacht we were looking for, apparently where the model was leaving. The boat's name is the Grand Marnier and is owned by Brian Henderson of the rock bands, Chilliwack and The Headpins. (Chilliwack had been a huge Canadian band, and Headpins had had a couple of #1s)<br>
My friend, incidentally, didn't buy the bike and (unrelated) tries to kill his parents and sister (succeeded with the mom) for the insurance money. Two accomplices were guys that I used to play AD&amp;D with in high school.<br>
========================================<br>
Next:<br>
*Around 1991, I visited the Caribbean island of Dominica and met the Prime Minister.<br>
*High school, ~'84, I won a national contest to win an autographed poster of the Parachute Club on &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot; (with T.D.Mulligan, not that flakey Stu Jeffries jerk)<br>

<br>
I know the Amazing Jonathan. Well ok we are not like best friends or anything but, he really helped me with my act I do. and I almost opened for him once.<br>
<br>
I was on the show Breakfast Time on FX years ago.. With Tom Bergeron...Met Stan Lee!!!!!!!!! I had to run to the store down the street from the studio and picked up an Xmen comic just for him to sign it! he was a great guy.  I met Travis Weliver from the show NYPD Blue. it was funny we had no idea who he was!  And really I still dont LOL... and a fold musican Peter Case. He was cool as well. But Tom Bergeon (Hollywood Sqares now) was an amazing down to earth guy.  Let us sit in his office, and just hang out for a half hour or so.<br>
<br>
I might &quot;crossing fingers&quot; get to open for Lenny Clarke in November...if I get the gig I will post the info for you new englanders who can get to the show!<br>

He was at a party I was at with my fraternity. He is a senior in his last semester at UT-Austin right now.<br>
<br>
I've also met Jenna Bush, a sophomore at UT-Austin, at a joint party that we Lambda Chi's and the Theta girls (her serority) put on. She was cool but pretty frickin' drunk. There were no secret service agents around her though, but that was before the WTC attack. Since then, the Theta House has been monitored constantly by agents. <br>
<br>
Anyway, those are my only &quot;brushes with stardom&quot;.<br>

He was waiting for his ride to the east bay to do the HBO &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; show he was on for a couple of seasons between coaching gigs.  He was reasonably nice, if a bit bothered.  His hair never moved but he did sign an autograph.<br>
<br>
I went to college at UCLA, but was born and raised in New York.  I took a lot of cross country trips with famous folks, most of whom I never &quot;met&quot; since I didn't want to bother them. . . I remember Corbin Bernson from one flight (this was when he was still starring on LA Law) looking like he'd been chewed up and spit out twice.  Sweats, unkempt hair, unshaven. . . very recognizable nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Speaking of UCLA, I was a contemporary of Troy Aikman.  He visited my Dorm floor once or twice to, uh, &quot;study&quot; with a girl living there. . . she studied with a lot of the atheletes. . . he was a prick.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Football, I'm a huge 49ers fan and season ticket holder.  I've got a nice picture on my desk of my wife and I standing between Jerry Rice and Steve Young.<br>
<br>
When I moved off campus I lived in a building where the apartment above mine was owned and occupied by Christian Slayer (only a couple of loud parties, but a lot of funny answering machine messages).  I also met my wife while living there! <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
I remember Paul Newman from another flight.  I waved at him when passing through first class and pointed him out to my mom at the baggage claim at JFK (he was being mobbed by autograph hounds at the time)<br>
<br>
I once flew from Boston to a small airport on Long Island (Islip, for those who care) and saw the band &quot;Twisted Sister&quot; collecting their gear.  They were in full costume, if you can believe that, and were mobbed by fans.  I remember this event pretty vividly since my mother, always the brazen New Yorker, actually went up to one of the band members and asked him &quot;who are you?&quot;  I still cringe when I remember that.<br>
<br>
I saw Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek) at LAX waiting at my gate for a prior flight.<br>
<br>
I flew inter-island in Hawaii with the guy that stars in &quot;Coach.&quot;<br>
<br>
I flew back East with Ronnie Lott on the flight he took to his Football Hall of Fame induction.<br>
<br>
In spite of all of those encounters, however, I guess my real brushes with &quot;stardom&quot; come from my family.  Tina Louise, Ginger from Gilligan's Island, is a distant cousin and has been at a few family functions.<br>
<br>
Bobby Slatyon, the Pit Bull of Stand-up Comedy (do a web search for his credits <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :p --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":p"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  ) is my cousin (Dad's sister's oldest son).  I wouldn't call us close (he's quite a bit older) but we have &quot;hung&quot; a few times.  He keeps surprising me by showing up on various shows or movies without ever letting anyone know (he's in Bandits, for instance, and hosted the Comedy Central Reel to Reel about the movie.  He guest spots on HBOs &quot;Mind of the Married Man&quot; from time to time as well. . .) <p><b>Filo</b> <BR>

<br>
Sean Bean is a really good actor. One of my favorite British actors. Sharpes was a great series.<br>
<br>
I went to High school, graduated with, and was friends with Dana Stubblefield...all pro defensive tackle for the San Francisco 49'ers. You didnt mess with Dana, he'd flat out kick your arse. People from other schools knew that too. Great guy to go out partying with. Good guy.<br>
<br>
I once got to talk to Al Gore who was observing a military exercise I was partaking in. He asked me questions about what took place and I explained. Mildly impressed.<br>
<br>
Ran in to Katie Holmes and three of her friends at a bar in Cincinnati 2 years back. Talked to them, all of us got a little drunk, got in a argument with them, but one of her friends went home with one of my friends. LOL go figure.<br>

Flashback- 1991: a couple months before the World Series:  <br>
<br>
There I was; sitting in the second row off of the first baseline in the Metro-Dome...  Chuck Knoblauch hit a pop fly.  It was easily caught by a Detroit Tiger who's name escapes me.  &quot;NICE ONE CHUCKIE!&quot;  I yelled as he paused halfway between home and first.  <br>
<br>
It was at this moment, that my fabulous brush with fame occured.  Chuck Knoblauch of the Minnesota Twins turned around, looked right at me, and flipped me off.  <br>
<br>
I turned to my friend and said, &quot;Hey!  I just got flipped off by Chuck Knoblauch!&quot;<br>

Brush with Fame No 3:<br>
I once sat in a room with a bunch of Science fiction writers and talked to them until 4 a.m.  One of them (the most memorable) was Stephen Brust.  He was the author of Taltos, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Orca, and the Pheonix Guard series of books. (and a whole slew of others) Err... he had bird on his shoulder, and he played the guitar and sang.  He was very opinionated, but gave decent advice on writing, publishers, and literary critics.<br>

     <br>
I have met (for all you Freestyle freaks) Johnny O, Cynthia, Coro...sooo many and sooo long ago i cant seem to recall them all.<br>
     <br>
For you house freaks im old friend with Keith Litman and for the Euro house freaks im old friends with Harry &quot;Choo-Choo&quot; Romero<br>
     <br>
Oh and one time when i was working at the Go-Go bar that I used to manage Bobby Brown walked in for some drinks and ended up hanging out with the other managers and myself at a local club after we closed<br>
      <br>
I have also met models/actresses and actors from the &quot;adult entertainment&quot; world, the two nicest ones were Ron Jeremy and Rebecca Wilde <p>Gain An'Sydnor <br>

We had a delay mid-air and he strolled up and down the aisles playing his mandolin and singing. OK I for one am not into bluegrass music but my Mom had a whole herd of cattle.  That same summer I met the French Mickey Mouse on my 16th birthday. My parents took pictures. (and no they will not be posted!) <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :rolleyes --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eyes.gif ALT=":rolleyes"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  I thought other kids got cars for thier 16th birthdays??<br>
A few years later in 1996 I met Henry Rollins at a coffee shop where I hung out all the time while I was in college. (it was next to the concert hall) The coffee shop had a habit of continuously playing whoever was playing that night. I was walking to the coffee shop and I saw him sitting outside on the patio by himself. He got up walked inside and told them to &quot;turn that off and play something else.&quot; I walked by as he sat back down and I turned to him and waved and said &quot;Hi!&quot; like I do everybody else there. He just looked at me funny and sipped his coffee. <br>
A few weeks later at the same coffee shop I met KMFDM, they looked just like all the other freaks I hung out with then.<br>
They didn't do much but sit there and look wierd, but then again so did everyone else.<br>
Then in 1997 I began working with a Musical Equipment retailer. I met RATT (they looked Ratty but hey I got free tickets and a kiss on the cheek...could've done without the kiss). I also met U2 there. They were asking questions of my manager...wanting to know if everyone who worked there were musicians. My manager said &quot;Yep even our cashier.&quot; (that's me) Then they asked me what I played. I said (or I think this is what I said to them) &quot; I've played flute for 10 years, taught myself piano, take voice lessons weekly,compose music and write songs.&quot; (I probably just drooled and mumbled)WTG ZOL (more free tickets and kisses <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  whoooooo)<br>

I got to meet Peter Steele of Type O Negative. The man is godly, with the most insane physique I've ever seen on a man heh.  He was so tall, I only came up to the bottom of his chest (He's about 6'7&quot; and I'm 5'5&quot;). I met the singer of Galactic Cowboys that same night.<br>

I used to be very into Christian music in high school and college (I still listen to it), so I met alot of Christian Rock bands back then as well, (Barren Cross, Mortal, Bloodgood, Petra, Newsboys, DC Talk to name a few). <p><p align="center">
