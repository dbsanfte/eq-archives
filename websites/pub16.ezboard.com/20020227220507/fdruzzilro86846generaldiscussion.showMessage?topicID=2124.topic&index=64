We never tried to wake the sleeper.  We left another warder up the ONE time we tried the 4th.  You seem to have missed the distinction.  We also only made one attempt, not 4-5 over 2 nights (or whatever the number of times).  So Roh has no reason for a hanky, thank you very much.  We in ML have no jealousy on waking the sleeper, because we simply saw it as a selfish and stupid move and would never had done it. <p><p><p align="center">

<br>
Just because other servers have selfish jerks running the show, doesn't mean we have to accept that ours does. In addition, we have the power to do something about it. The only question is our resolve to do so.<br>
<br>
Wars over spawns way back when created tensions, problems, inter-guild wars, and mayhem. <br>
<br>
This is why rotations began in the first place. <br>
<br>
This is a Good Thing. (TM) <br>
<br>
Forming an alliance with like-minded guilds, who think it's wrong that selfish dickheads who care only about VOP and phat lewt and would trample everyone else, is in the best interests of our guilds, and the best interests of the server. <br>
<br>
There was nothing &quot;ballsy&quot; or &quot;gutsy&quot; about what Vindication did in ToV to L`Malla, after they for months reaped the benefits of IGB rotations, rebuidling their guild whose membership dwindled to around 10 people.   <br>
<br>
It was simply cowardly, selfish, and wrong. They not only accepted the implied social contracts of the IGB, they embraced them. <br>
<br>
Their attitude that &quot;VI says it's OK&quot; is just evidence of an immature leader, and mindless followers who have so much time invested in VOP, that they don't care about ethics and honor. <br>
<br>
Yes, ethics and honor do exist, even in a virtual world. <br>
<br>
The question is whether we, as a group of guilds, were willing to do something about it. <br>
<br>
The answer for Mythic Legoin was yes - we planned to fight tooth-and-nail against Vindication, and attempt to return the server back to a fair rotational system, using NToV as a lever. <br>
<br>
The idea was that there would be successes and failures, to be sure, but there is no reason for any of us to accept what Vindication did to L`Malla, and thus the server.   <br>
<br>
FFA is a poor option for the Old World. Luclin may be another story. <br>
<br>
In any case, bottom line is that ML will continue to endeavor to keep a rotational system going, and welcomes all guilds who wish to participate and abide by it. <br>
<br>
This doesn't mean a smiling, greedy, backroom handshake, where ML, Hoss, and L`Malla get together in a back room, with cigars, and say &quot;screw the rest of the server - we'll take what we want and agree to share NToV.&quot;<br>
<br>
This means all guilds.  There is no reason at all, in my mind, other than selfishness, for us not to behave like adults, smile at the other guilds on the server, and say &quot;Good luck on X, &quot; and even help them when it comes down to it.  <br>
<br>
Guilds like IG, VE, TR, NI, and all the rest deserve the same chance to learn and grow as the rest of us, and there's nothing wrong with the concept of an honorable set of rotations to keep peace on Druzzil.  In fact, DRo guilds should be proud of the example they set to the rest of the dog-eat-dog servers.<br>
<br>
We already have a structured, fair way of including every capable guild into a rotation, that is a proven, workable structure.<br>
<br>
There is a system in place.  We all know the representatives of the other guilds.  <br>
<br>
ML is calling for the same thing we did on the earlier incarnation of the IGB, and that is a return to rotations for all guilds, not a select few. ML is calling for a neutral site for the IGB, as well, not the Hoss site.  Say what you will, there is a subtle political advantage to hosting an IGB site, and I'm sure Hoss is aware of that.  We want everyone on equal footing.<br>
<br>
We don't intend to trample on the smaller guilds' right to progress (as was obviously the intent of FFA explicitly noted by Ciner) by saying 'Ok, rotation on ToV N and FFA on the rest.&quot;  In my opinion, asking for that rotation is just indicative of greed of larger guilds people not getting their &quot;chance&quot; at ToV and shows hypocrisy when the other, smaller guilds, are saying precisely the same thing about, say, CT, or Dain.  Doesn't feel good, does it.<br>
<br>
The &quot;little guys&quot; deserve their chances, too, just like the &quot;big guys&quot; got theirs.<br>
<br>
To those who think ML is just trying to &quot;get the most we can in an FFA situation&quot; I can assure you we're not.  <br>
<br>
If we agreed, even today (that means Hoss, L`Malla, ML, and the rest) to go back to IGB rotations fairly, in a NON-EXCLUSIONARY way, ML would be happy to hop in last place in the first set of NToV rotations.<br>
<br>
If the leaders of the other guilds are tired of FFA, if they want this NToV nonsense to stop, all they have to do is contact each other, and reps of ML, to get it started.<br>

You can always tell the real Baramos by holding Luclinite in front of him.  If he begins to melt, it's the real Baramos, so please put the Luclinite back in the lead container.  (Alternatively, expose him to a blonde female woodelf, and if his right leg starts thumping, it's Baramos.)<br>

One nice thing about the real Baramos, is that he's invulnerable to flames, an asset on boards such as these. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

We complain about your loot and you complain about our killing of the sleeper.  Its all opinion, yet you feel you have the right to do it to us and not us to you.  Just seems a bit odd.  On a side note, I don't really care about your loot, just using it to make a point.<br>
<br>
Also I'm curious why the IGB has to be 100% what you guys feel it should be while other guilds will have to compromise to what you suggest, you are immovable and unchanging.  That would seem like you are in control.  Just curious why you guys will not budge to anything but you want, I mean we all have our opinions and are never going to agree, so compromise would be the best solution.  Like I'm all for an IGB type thing if it was stricter and limited spawns.  Stricter doesn't mean FU small guild NO CHANCE FOR YOU.  Its open to everyone.  Only thing is you will be penalized for failures and have to prove your worth to get a shot.  That's not really selfish IMO.  Calling that selfish is sort of like saying that every team in the NFL should make the playoffs and teams that don't adhere to it are selfish and we will not respect you.  I mean you have to be successful to advance to the higher end.  Just by stating it and not proving it should not entitle you to everything.<br>

Fact is.. ToV is big enough for more than one guild to operate in without stepping on each other's toes. ML &amp; Hoss proved that today in the North Wing, and IG was in HoT killing Dozekar.<br>
<br>
We killed 3 North Wing dragons (Eashen, Lady Miranella, and Lord Kreizen) that spawned last night and camped out for the evening. ML setup to take Aaryonar this morning. Nothing wrong with that at all.. since we weren't setup for Aary. So we killed the other 8 dragons (Jorleag, Lady N, Zlexak, Cekenar, Sevelak, Lord Koi'Doken, Dagarn, Lord Vyemm) that were up at the time, but at NO TIME was there any contention for spawns. We could have pulled Lord Feshlak, but instead headed the other way and killed Lord Vyemm.<br>
<br>
There was ZERO public channel guild bashing, ZERO arguments over mobs, and basically both guilds just stayed out of each other's way. There was ZERO leapfrogging over anyone. Just 2 guilds doing their own thing.<br>
<br>
So please.. stop trying to fan the fires..<br>

Aye, was nice and very business like.  For some reason we couldnt remove our collective heads from our asses when trying to kill Feshlak and kept loosing our tanks...would get ugly from there.  Every guild has its moments and that was one of ours.  Aary went down like DRoplayers mom when offered some ho-hos.  <br>

<br>
I dont like guild politics never did but all I want to say is this and this is not a flame at all but comparing waking the sleeper to our loot system is just outrageous considering our loot system only affects the guild not anyone else, where as waking the sleeper has in a sense robbed the rest of the server that hasnt set foot in ST yet from ever seeing the Warders.  As for me I dont have my key yet but I will probably get mine eventually just to see the zone and help others get primals.  Unfortunately I will never come face to face with a warder.<br>
<br>
As for the IGB I fully support it.  I see it as this, the up and coming guilds dont have what the ubers have yet and that is experience killing the mobs that we do.  I think the IGB would greatly benefit the server in that everyone capable gets a fair shot to learn their own tactics on a mob and if there is a wipeout they can try again the same day without another guild breathing down their neck waiting to kill that mob. It lets the others get their $10 a month worth out of the game.  If you were paying more to play then them sure you should have more of a right to mobs then them but you dont. <p> <a href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=20012">Lavidicus' Gear</a><br>
