Yup. Santa Claus and his reindeer, aka the Ancient Cyclops.  I needed a pair of jboots for my new melee main and I was overjoyed to see him.<br>
<br>
He’s near the northern Derv camp when I catch up to him – and hola!  Alone.  I snare him and drop my nastiest dot on him and am kiting him around as I mem other nasty spells (I didn’t expect to be in combat) and one of the times I glance down at my spell book, I look back up to notice that the AC has suddenly gathered a train of PCs.<br>
<br>
There’s a Barbarian and an Ogre now attached to the AC, decking him from behind as I kite him around.  I /ooc “Please don’t KS me. I engaged him first.  I have a dot on him and he’s snared and well agro’d.”  No answer.  I send a /tell to one of the people that is attacking him.  “Yo, I have a dot on him. Agro’d him before you were on the scene.  Please don’t KS me”  No answer.<br>
<br>
Well, as luck would have it. I got the kill and looted.  Barbarian and Ogre retreated and didn’t say a thing.  So being the smartass I am, I started chiding them over /ooc “Guess the winds of justice blew the correct direction this time.  Too bad for you sorry-ass Ksers.”<br>
<br>
Of course there’s a million people hanging around in Sro looking for the same guy.  And this starts a huge spammy discussion over /ooc. Some are arguing that the AC is FFA – apparently confusing that concept with the fact that Ksing has nothing to do with FFA. Some are laughing at me because they incorrectly think that since I am complaining, I got KS’d.  Some are wondering why a 56 Druid would be worrying about getting KS’d.  But the vast majority were telling stories about the last time they got KS’d while killing the AC.<br>
<br>
Here’s what I want to know.  Is the AC some special case where people throw fair play, Veriant’s rules, common courtesy and social norms out the window and trample each other to get the lucky charm?  I’ve never thought that FFA meant trample anyone in your way, even if they’re already killing it.  <br>
<br>
I mean, sure, if you’re kiting the mighty Lodizal around with a single druid in an attempt to buy some time for your guild to gather and then another guild gets the numbers first, engages and kills him. Then sure, that’s fine.  You cant kill Lodizal with a single druid, he’s FFA, and it’s unfair to think that you can lay claim to him by simply kiting him around.<br>
<br>
But if someone is in the process of KILLING the AC – a soloable mob.  Is it ok to just run up and try to KS them?  Is the AC some special case where that’s suddenly ok?  I hear this crap every time I run through Sro. “Someone Ksed me – get off the AC.  I engaged him first!”<br>
<br>
What recourse would I have had if I had been Ksed?  What would the GM’s do and how would I prove that I engaged him first?  I'm guessing they'd make us roll on it.<br>
<br>
All I have to say is that greed makes people ugly.  And the jboots quest should be changed or removed from the game altogether if this kind of thing is going to continue to be the norm.<br>

The GM/Guide has to WITNESS the act of KSing in order to punish.  And due to the extreme rarity of the AC, it will always be a one time KS and they will never be able to do anything.<br>

<br>
Yes they were trying to KS you. I've played EQ since day 1. Ever since I have played the AC in Sro has been known as an FFA spawn. Doesnt mean its ok to KS the AC though. There is a definite difference.<br>
<br>
Although back in the day of uber banded armored rangers, warriors in bronze, and the almighty death combo of the PGT and Dragoon Dirk, the AC was respected as a camp. But that day and age has come and gone a long time ago =/ ....currently it is FFA...but a KS is a KS is a KS.<br>

<br>
Great. If this is true, then it totally explains why there's so much blatant KSing of the AC. People have learned that they can get away with it because there's little or no chance a GM will look into it.<br>
<br>
I guess the best you can do is make sure that even if you're just running through Sro, have those nukes mem'ed.  And if you do get KOSed, make sure do a guildstatus on the person that jumped you.  Thats another avenue to take your complaint.<br>

Kaludram is kinda right. However that's not Verant's official statement. To Verant's rulebooks, AC is same FFA mob as anything else. However, since it's such a popular spawn, they are guaranteed to get a petition on every AC pop, and now they just ignore those complaints. Grounds for ignoring? You cannot prove them KSing you. <br>
<br>
When my ex-main needed jboots, I was checking SRO spawn quite often. I only decided to call my guild to help me with camp (I was 28 back then) only when I didnt see random level 50 druid farming rings for MQ profit or for Twink_986294.<br>

OOT is much better place. This is respected regular camp, since AC pop spot is always same. If someone decides to be a real ass, they can invoke PnP, but nobody would really do.

I'd also be a jackass since even I can afford a couple of plat to buy a DF belt when someone else can get xp for it.<br>
<br>
GMs won't do much over camp stealing other than a little mediation but, as Trem said, KSing can only be dealt with when there's either reports or they see it themselves.<br>
<br>
So, yes, everything *is* FFA until it's been engaged and *then* it's owned (till next spawn).<br>

Everything else in between is social courtesy and pseudo-political. <p><A

     I've hung around South Ro quietly waiting for the AC many times and either found a named in it's place or had a guild pop up and beat me to it.  That camp is a real bummer in my opinion, so I just gave up.<br>
<br>
     I thought the AC ring was a no drop item though?  Is it possible to hire some big guns to catch it in their spare time and pass the ring over if it's not?  Comparing the lower priced horses vs speed of Jboots I'd rather pass the money over to some guys that may enjoy it instead of that NPC horseseller who would just take it out of the economy anyway.  <br>

Yeah Gary Grobson (Daegarmo) is a moron, no doubt about that. However I always cock an eyebrow at guys who like to play female characters in the first place. /shrug<br>
<br>
Gary Grobson is one of those guys who Verant needs to replace, because their attitude IMO does more damage than good to their game (same situation as with Abashi, etc etc).<br>
<br>
Through all the changes, expansions, and etc I always wondered how the turds managed to stay on at VI and even rise in position and responsibility? <br>

The AC ring is ND.  But it's an allowed multiquest.  In other words, my druid puts the ring on Hasten Bootstrapper and hits 'accept'  Then my lower level warrior does the same with his 3250 gold and Shadowed Rapier.  And voila, the warrior ends up with a shiny new pair of jboots.<br>
<br>
So yes, you can get help. And there are even SOBs that SELL multiquests of it.  I always ask how much whenever I see someone auctioning. Average seems to be 18k. Pisses me off to know that people sell them.  I mean, if I didn't need the jboots, I might kill the AC.  But the multiquest would then go to a good friend -- not sold.<br>
<br>

I agree. Crappy camp.  I've been lucky and never had to camp it.  Both times I've bagged the AC, I've simply been running through Sro to get somewhere else.  The first time, I literally ran into him and agrod him before I realized what was up.<br>
<br>
If I were going to actually camp the AC, I would take a few days of vacation or call in sick and do the OOT AC camp.  The SRo one is just to cram packed with morons and KSers.  Imagine how angry you would be if you finally found the AC, engaged him and were killing him when a bunch of people jump in KS you. 20x less likely to happen at the other camp.<br>
<br>
If you are going to do the Sro camp, use as it as a chance to master tailoring.  EK is always much more desirable for Spider Silks.  But Sro has its fair share of both spider silks and HQ Cat pelts.  Terrorantualla silks too.  Because by killing all the spiders, you will most likely spawn him.  And before long, the AC too.<br>
