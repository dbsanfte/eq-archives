(the kind who sends out random tells to ppl for money/equipment)...<br>
<br>
Would you WANT to know if one of your guildmates is doing this?<br>
<br>
I believe that most beggars are actually secondaries, usually pseudo-anonymous ones, and not actually new to the game at all.  After all, how many people new to the game know how to go anon and know the terminology like &quot;pp&quot;?<br>

<br>
Personally, I still give beggars the traditional &quot;old man&quot; story, about everything being uphill both ways..<br>
<br>
&quot;When I was your age boyo, I killed wisps all the day long, just fer smithin money! Then I smithed with me drinkin water, and run about thirsty-like until I sold me a bracer!&quot;<br>
<br>
Ahem....ok so that's a true story, but it sounds grandpa-esque enough to use on the beggin' types so I do.<br>
<br>
Anyway, beggars. They're out there, always going to be. Some days I ignores em, some days I lambasts em, some days I wonder how it is that these people can type but they cant scrape up 10pp for spells. <br>
<br>
What I sez iz, you hate em, you see. You borrow a bud's wizard, you offer said beggar a ride for some plevel fun, and you drop em off in Hate for their fine rewards....Arrrrrr. That'll learn em, and if it doesn't, well it's still good for a chuckle.<br>

(discuss)</span><hr size=1> <br>
     This has been a question which has existed for years, and is resolved in different ways which depends on the person who is being begged.  Having a begger in a guild is even more difficult to deal with because they are part of your family.  Guilds like TR, Hoss, Mythic Legion, etc. don't have beggars.. they have &quot;achievers&quot; who have earned themselves a place in these guilds.  Beggars seem to quickly learn about guilds, and which ones have the &quot;PhAt LeWt&quot; but find they must settle for a starter guild.  Beggars join these guilds with mostly one thing in mind - shortcuts for personal advancement.  It's always me, myself, and I for them and when approached about their consistant nagging for items they respond with the classic, &quot;But you are so much higher lvl and you have TONS of stuff to spare&quot;.  When nobody has or offers anything they respond with, &quot;This guild SuXxOrS!!  I know a guy in TR who got a free Fungi Tunic from Ratman!  They give stuff like that out every day!&quot;.  Often when you offer to help them quest for items they respond with, &quot;Quest?  That's so Boorrrinngg!! Plevel me Plz!!&quot;.  LOL  I had this experience in a starter guild I was in a year back.  (No, I wasn't the beggar)<br>
<br>
     Ok ok, I'm going to stop it here because I'm sure Alihja is already wondering why I'm &quot;Beating a Dead Horse&quot;(tm) when it's not even the thread topic. heh  <br>
<br>
     Solutions imo<br>
<br>
     1.  If the beggar is a close guildmate and shows some promise go ahead and water the seed a little.  Do this only if their requests are within reason, i.e. being under lvl10 and needing food, cloth armor, etc.  Teach them about the game, skills, and EQ etiquette.  Do NOT Plevel a begging newbie, PERIOD.  Bats, snakes, and silver pieces build CHARACTER.  Long hours of hard work, frustration, and eventually success help teach newbies the whole idea of Everquest.  It also teaches them to respect the TR's, Hoss's, etc. by placing things into perspective.  <br>
<br>
     2.  If the beggar is NOT a guildie, follows you around N. Freeport (or any beggar spawn ground) nagging for PP, just ignore them until you are finished with what you are doing and leave.  If they send you a rude /tell, then just /ignore them.  Don't argue with them because they are already frustrated and usually are looking for someone to unload their anger on.  Beggars beg because they are impatient.  They usually aren't going to be persistant if you simply ignore them and wander off like some NPC in Thurg.  <br>
<br>
<br>
     Lastly, there are the TRUE newbies who quietly beg but really don't know that they are begging.  (Or how famous beggars are in Everquest)  You can often identify these people in the game by the ones standing in front of you for 5 minutes not saying anything.  (Most likely at home fumbling through the Everquest book trying to figure out the chat command)  In this case it's up to you how you wish to assist them.        <br>
<br>
     I guess I'll conclude with a positive story I picked off the net some time ago.  It's about a persons experience with a true newbie.  Here it is:<br>
------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Hey all,<br>
I want to share with you an EQ experience I had last night.<br>
<br>
I was in Rivervale making hundreds of heady kiolas, in prepration for some tailoring work, when a &quot;can you help me please?&quot; appears in my chat box. My first thought, of course, was that the person wanted a port (im a druid) - I am normally more than happy to port people, but I was well into making heady kiola's and really didn't want to break my rythym (I needed 320 of the damn things  ) - if you have ever done much trade skill stuff, you will know what I mean. My usual good nature won out though (heh  ), so I turned around, ready to do a port.<br>
<br>
Standing in front of me was a naked level 1 halfling warrior. My next thought, of course, was &quot;damn beggars&quot;. I didn't say that though, and asked this person what I could do for him. <br>
<br>
&quot;Where do I go to kill things?&quot;, he asked. I was a bit shocked, I'll admit - it's not the sort of question I get asked alot these days. <br>
<br>
&quot;Misty Thicket is where you should be hunting, as a level 1 halfling&quot;, I replied.<br>
<br>
&quot;How do I get there? And are there dragons there?&quot;<br>
<br>
After explaining to him that no, there were in fact no dragons in Misty Thicket (&quot;says dragons on the box&quot;) and SoWed him and said &quot;Follow me, friend&quot;. When we got to the Misty Thicket zone, he mentions &quot;I just bought the game.&quot; Instantly, I go into massive help mode - I have a huge soft spot for true &quot;newbies&quot; to Everquest (not your beggar types, but your real, &quot;hey-what's-this-game&quot; type newbies). True to form for most computer game players (myself included  ), he hadn't read the manual, so over the next 2 hours or so, I explained to him the very basics of the game (how to attack, how to set up hotkeys, /loc, how to get his newbie tunic, how to train skills, etc, etc) and then took him out to Misty Thicket, threw a few buffs on him (no damage shield though  ), and helped him get to level 2. He may have only been killing what most of us regard as newbie &quot;yard-trash&quot;, but he was *loving* it.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm the man! I'm the bat, wolf, rat and bixie killing man!&quot; he declared at one point .<br>
<br>
As I helped him, and answered his questions, it occurred to me, for the first time in a very long time, that EverQuest is a bloody hard game to get started in.<br>
<br>
I have been playing for almost two years now, and have spent 18 months playing Sorran and over that time have learnt so much about the game, that I almost take that knowledge for granted. Answering this newbie's questions really slammed home how *vast* this world of Norrath is. I took pause and sent a silent /salute to Verant for this extraordinary creation. Many of us may question many of their decisions, but the fact remains, regardless of your specific complaints or concerns, there exists a truly magical world at the heart of it all. It is breath-taking in its scope and granduer - once in a while, take the time out from your xp camps or raids to &quot;smell the roses&quot;. I got a chance to look at Norrath through the eyes of a newbie last night, and it blew me away all over again.<br>
<br>
Most of us can never again experience that true moment of newbie-wonder, not even in another game. We know too much about MMORPGs work now - no matter the game, we expect there to be a &quot;newbie&quot; period, we know there will be &quot;spolier&quot; sites to get info from, we know there will be certain classes/skills/items that will be better than others, we expect hackers/cheaters/scammers, and so on. The creatures, the game mechanics, the environment may all be totally different from game to game but, at their core, they are all the same - they are all MMORPGs. For those of us already playing them, we can never again be a true newbie.<br>
<br>
For me, Everquest is my first MMORPG - I clearly remember my wonder as I ventured beyond North Qeynos for the first time and into the Hills of Qeynos - I was awestruck at this *huge* zone (hah!  ), amazed at the sunsets behind the hills, terrified of following the road deeper into the Hills. I can still appreciate the visual splendour of the world of Norrath, but I am far more jaded player than I was 2 years ago.<br>
<br>
I am a level 60 druid, wearing nice gear, proudly wielding my epic weapon, and lucky enough to be in a great guild that is currently exploring the &quot;end-game&quot; of Everquest as it stands at the moment (North wing of the Temple of veeshan, Sleeper's Tomb). I have a lot of fun, and get to fight some pretty nasty creatures. But you know what? For two hours last night, I envied that level 1 halfing warrior, taking his very first steps into Norrath. I mourned for the loss of my MMORPG &quot;innocence&quot;.<br>
<br>
So again, /salute to Verant for letting us all into Norrath (and /bonk for the silly decisions of course  ).<br>
<br>
And /salute to that halfing warrior who let me share in his first steps into Norrath - you may have thanked me for my help, but I am far more indebted to you than you can imagine.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

Back on Sol Ro when I had my own guild We found out we had a beggar amidst our ranks. After talking to him briefly I decided to boot him. Beggar gone, problem solved. FYI this was back way before Kunark came out, when level 35th+ was considered &quot;higher level&quot;.<br>

Beggar: &quot;Do you have any lootz you don't need that a mage can use? Or just some plat so I can buy my spells?&quot;<br>

I think it's to the guild to be careful when they recruit someone. If you take the time to get to know someone before recruiting him/her, begging will not be a problem. <p><font face=verdena>Gwynet Woodsister, Hierophant<br>

It's meant to apply to begging in guildchat, but over time has gone on to include begging from non-guildies too.  Rampant begging eventually will result in removal; we have guild rules posted on our website, and all new members agree to those rules when they are invited.  We use a sponsor system, so I usually leave it up to a new member's sponsor to kindly remind them of the rule...but if an officer decides that it's time to remove the offender, I leave that up to them.  Needless to say, it hasn't happened recently.  Had to make examples of a couple of people, but that fixed the problem!<br>
<br>
I love helping true newbies, even if they need hours of hand-holding, but the first thing I tell them is not to beg.  I also watch for how well a beggar seems to know their EQbonics... if they seem too loot-savvy, they get nothing but a /glare from me.<br>

Well my guild (Crystal Oracle) has a clause in its charter that seems to take care of most of the nonsene. Here is the clause..<br>

I started this topic up as I was going thru Cabilis with a monk alt, and having strangers beg at me.  The most interesting one was a guy who was guild tagged, and said his guild &quot;didn't give a f*ck&quot; about being a beggar.  <br>
<br>
I wouldn't tolerate a beggar being in my guild either.<br>

I would like to say that I enjoyed reading your post.. are you a riter for readers digest or something?  unlike most posts I read this was NOT a waste of 2 min of my life that I wanted back.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I still remember being in qeynos hills at lvl 6 and accidently destroying my sword ... shouting &quot;please help me with a sword... i lost mine..&quot;   some kind sould went into surefall and got me a rusty 1h .. I was sooooo happy.. <br>
<br>
then when I ended up with a piece of armor in every slot (except range) I thought &quot;I cant get any better,  I filled it all up&quot;  lol   man was I wrong. <p><href="http://www.boomspeed.com/jgable/baronjgablefinal.JPG">
