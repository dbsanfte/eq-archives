The following is taken directly from the Phoenyx Press Kit circa 1990, and does not necessarily reflect what the artists are currently doing.  It is presented for historical purposes only.<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="p-bar.gif">

Heather Alexander ... a fiery, redheaded, multi- instrumentalist with a commanding stage presence and mesmerizing voice ... formed Phoenyx in early 1989 with classically-trained electric violinist Cat Taylor. After playing music together at California's Renaissance and Dickens' Fairs for five years, the two formed Matrix, an electrified folk band, but disbanded it after two years when Alexander and Taylor wanted to go further afield, while the other members were headed towards stricter tradition. Although they knew they wanted to combine their varied talents in a more dynamic format, incorporating both their knowledge of traditional music and Heather's more phantastical original music, it was not clear what form that would take.<BR>
The answer started to emerge when [Larry] the O answered an ad placed in a local music magazine. Adding to the pot his years of experience in rock, jazz and electronic music (as well as quite a few unorthodox and definitely non-traditional ideas of what to do with their music), the three began developing their ideas while searching for the perfect guitarist. A few months later, fate intervened when a stand-in guitarist fell from a tree. Heather and Cat's scheduled appearance with him at a Scottish &amp; Irish festival thusly became a duo. This valiant (if somewhat sparse) performance inspired guitarist Mark Ungar to introduce himself. After a night of music-making in a San Francisco attic, they were all hooked. Mark's technical prowess on his instrument was the result of extensive rock-and-roll experience and he blended a sure musical ear with the high-voltage touch Alexander, Taylor and the O had been looking for.<BR>
The now  four-member Phoenyx began intensive rehearsal and performances, frequenting clubs that specialized in both the folk and rock-and-roll formats and consistently winning converts from both genres. In a matter of weeks, the O, a professional sound engineer, took the band into the studio, and they produced a four song demo tape which has become a hot item among their fans. <BR>
In February of 1990, just over a year from the start of Heather and Cat's search, Phoenyx became complete with the arrival of bass player John Land. Land's appearance coincided with the completion of recording two new tracks, one of which being "Yo Ho!", which appears on Keltia, Dirty Linen's compilation tape.  That summer, the band returned to the studio and recorded seven more tracks to complete their first album. Keepers of the Flame, an exciting 64-minute tour de force of Celtic rock produced and mixed by The O and entirely self-financed, was released on cassette in December of 1990 and on CD (with a 12-page lyric booklet illustrated by Alexander) in early 1991. Since that time, KOF has garnered radio airplay and critical applause in reviews from the U.S. and abroad. Phoenyx has also made numerous radio and television appearances in addition to their regular performances in the San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas.
