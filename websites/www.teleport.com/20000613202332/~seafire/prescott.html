<FONT SIZE=+2>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>tephen</FONT> (rhymes with "<EM>teffen</EM>"), aka. <FONT SIZE=+1>Ra-Vin Graph,</FONT> set his feet on the path to becoming a cartoonist while still a youngster in California.  His first attempts (which he describes as "<EM>poop</EM>") were met with no enthusiasm, but he still kept plying his crayon.<P>

Nearly thirty years later, he was accosted by yet another in a long line of intense redheads, following what he considered a rather lackluster musical performance.  Confused and dazed, he spoke with her at length about music, artwork, performance, life, the universe and everything.  As dawn broke, he realized that he had just reach a turning point.  Dreams of the <EM><A HREF="hlands.html">Heatherlands</A></EM> began dancing in his head, and soon began taking form on paper.

Since that time, he has drawn several one-page strips (including 
"<A HREF="graphics/smooch.gif">The Smooch</A>," and 
"<A HREF="graphics/pest.gif">Pest Con-troll</A>"), collaborated with 
<A HREF="phil.html">Philip R. Obermarck</A> (as colorist) on a button 
("<A HREF="button.gif">Jammin'</A>"), a bookmark 
("<A HREF="graphics/bmark.gif">Leap Frog...?</A>"), a brand new picture
 entitled "<A HREF="graphics/pub.jpg">A Night at the Pub</A>", and 
 several future projects.  His current projects include illustrations and an album cover for Heather Alexander's <EM>Midsummer</EM> (album and songbook), advertisements, and an upcoming collection of his work.<P>
