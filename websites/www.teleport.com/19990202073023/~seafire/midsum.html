Midsummer was Heather's first solo album, released only on cassette and recorded in her home studio.  After the dissolution of Phoenyx, she began performing solo in pubs and coffee houses.  After being asked for the umpteenth time if she had an album for sale, she decided to record one.<P>
On a decidedly limited budget,	Heather chose the home studio solution as the most cost effective.  This choice restricted her to using only four tracks for the greatest sound quality.  Thus, the arrangements remained very basic, mostly relying on voice and guitar, with one or two instruments backing her.<P>
In order to achieve the fullness and variety in the arragements that she wanted and still stay within budget, Heather ended up playing all the instruments on Midsummer&#139; guitar, fiddle, bodhran, keyboards, bass and, of course, vocals.<P>

Midsummer is currently in a limited release, and there are plans in the works to re-issue a new<BR>
recording on cassette and compact disc.  The new version would include all the original songs, plus several bonus tracks never recorded previously.
