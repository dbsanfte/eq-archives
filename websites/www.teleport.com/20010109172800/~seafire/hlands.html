<FONT SIZE=+2>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>he</FONT> <FONT SIZE=+2>H</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>eatherlands</FONT> were created in 1992 by <A HREF="prescott.html">Stephen G. Prescott</A>.  After speaking with Heather for hours on end, he began conceiving the idea of Heather as a 'toon.  From that seed, the <EM>Heatherlands</EM> sprouted&#139; peopled with elves, f&aelig;ries, trolls, and hundreds of heretofore unknown creatures, life in the <EM>Heatherlands</EM> is never dull.<P>

Although it often proves a challenge, all the Heathertoons are designed without dialogue.  The language of the Heatherlands is music and laughter, and to convey this, Stephen has opted for a visual  storytelling style that creates a magic all its own, bypassing conventional language barriers.  The Heatherlands has become a living breathing entity, growing from that one thought into a complex land of unexplored horizons.<P>

<H2>Denizens of the Heatherlands</H2>
<H3>Heather</H3>
Heather is the only human in the Heatherlands.  Her singing and fiddle playing can charm the best of the beasts. <P>

"There are times in Heather's songs when she creates a bellylaugh and a gentle tug in your heart at the same moment.  This is the essence that I have tried to capture in my '<EM>Heather</EM>.'  She neither rules nor is servant to the Heatherlands, but exists in harmony with them.  Wherever Heather lands from her flights of fancy are the Heatherlands."<P>

<H3>Mimic</H3>
Mimic, a marshmallow-monkeycat (or MMC for short), is a recurring character in the Heatherlands.  He was conceived by Stephen as a sidekick for Heather&#139; someone to help her into and out of trouble.  He first appearred in the strip "<A HREF="graphics/smooch.gif">The Smooch</A>" and is featured on the Heather Alexander button, "<A HREF="graphics/button.gif">Jammin'</A>".  His curious nature is well demonstrated by the fact that he is the only member of his race to have contacted humans, so far&#138;<P>

<H3>Frogs</H3>
The frogs in the Heatherlands come in a wide variety of sizes, from tiny to titan.  Most of them are not too bright, but they enjoy being helpful.  Often their role is to act as transportation, a job they do well, without complaint.<P>

<H3>Other Creatures</H3>
There are many other chartacters in the Heatherlands waiting to be discovered.  They are a strange blend of traditional mythos and Stephen's personal interpretations of both phantastical and "real" beings.  His characters contain as much energy and are as rich and varied as the songs and music that inspires them.<P>
