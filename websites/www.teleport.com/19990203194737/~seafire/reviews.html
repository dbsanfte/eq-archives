<FONT SIZE=+2><BLOCKQUOTE>T</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>hose</FONT> yearning for a hint of the sounds of Phoenyx, the now defunct Bay Area band Alexander led, are sure to be delighted with her latest release.  Not so much a rockin' album, Wanderlust focuses on wandering minstrel-type tunes and stories that rarely fail to delight, especially with that incredible voice and wild fiddle playing in the forefront.  Though there are few traditional tunes here, most of the material (written by Alexander) is Celtic in style and rivals many Celtic artists for capturing the legendary nature of the Emerald Isle.  Rob Wullenjohn (Tempest) plays bass on most of the cuts and Lief S&oslash;rbye (also Tempest) appears occasionally for a flute interlude.  Alexander is equally adept at guitar, fiddle, mandolin and various percussion.  An exceptional album. (JM)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><EM><FONT SIZE=+1>ROCK AND REEL MAGAZINE</FONT></EM>  -- (UK) -- Spring 1995<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><BLOCKQUOTE>S</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>an Franciscan</FONT> Heather Alexander ex Phoenyx vocalist has created a considerable reputation as  a solo artist since Phoenyx's demise.  &quot;Wanderlust&quot; is her latest solo effort.  With members of Tempest along, its West Coast-Folk Rock par excellance.  &quot;Harvest Season&quot; shows her strong gutsy vocals while her fiddle, mandolin and bodhran ably support her guitar work.  More acoustic in style than the Phoenyx electric days, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, &quot;Stable Boy&quot; and &quot;Faerie Queen&quot;, the latter a 7 minute epic, all possess a bountiful energy and enthusiasm.  &quot;Wanderlust&quot; shows how much Heather Alexander has developed in the last 5 years.
