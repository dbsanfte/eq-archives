<H2>&quot;'Cause I'm the Author, thats why!&quot;
</H2>Against my protests, I have been forced by friends and family to include this page here.  In order to make it easy, I will list the things I am known for and talk a little about them:<P>

Sorry kids, you're too late.  Heather and I met in 1979, were married in 1986, and plan on sticking together for many moons to come.<P>

Often people come up to me and ask me if I am &quot;The Phil&quot;, by which they mean, am I the one that Heather is always talking about from the stage.  Yes, that's me.  Which leads me to:<P>

<H3><A NAME="2">Lyricist</H3></A>

If you ever bothered to read the credits to Phoenyx' &quot;Keepers of the Flame&quot; album (assuming you have one), Heather's &quot;Midsummer&quot;, &quot;Live&quot; or &quot;Wanderlust&quot; albums, or had the privelege of seeing Heather live, you've probably heard my work.  I have had many songs published, including:
<UL><LI>
Creature of the Wood (Keepers of the Flame)<LI>
Stormbringer (Keepers of the Flame)<LI>
Tomorrow I leave for Battle (Midsummer)<LI>
Courage Knows no Bounds (Heather Alexander, Live!)<LI>
Faerie Queen (Wanderlust)<LI>
Wanderlust (Wanderlust)
</UL>

<H3><A NAME="3">Computer Nerd</H3></A>

Oftimes people see me at Heather's gigs with my nose buried in my trusty little laptop (an Apple Powerbook 180c, if anyone cares), and assume that I am just some dweeby dork who isn't worthy to bask in the glow of Heather's smile.  Well, tough!<P>

I have found that I am able to get more work done (and I'll explain what I mean by &quot;work&quot; in a moment) at Heather's gigs, than any other time.  This is because the work I do at there is primarily Heather-related.  After doing the 8-hour day thing as a Computer Hardware Technician, I have very little time to do the things that give me joy (and can talk about in public).  Therefore, I work at Heather's gigs, so I don't have to work when we both have &quot;free&quot; time.<P>

<H3><A NAME="4">Web Author</H3></A>

If you haven't gotten the idea yet, I was the one who created these pages, from the text to the graphics.  I got into Web Authoring by making a sidestep from graphic design.  I am willing to do so for others as well.  Contact me via email at <A HREF="mailto:seafire@teleport.com">seafire@teleport.com</A>.  By the way, I did most of this at Heather's gigs (nyahh).<P>

<H3><A NAME="5">Graphic Designer</H3></A>

Another thing I do for hire (and for Heather) is graphic design.  I combine text with pictures for posters, postcards, flyers, cds, cassettes, brochures, advertisements, and damn near anything else.<P>

This past year has seen the beginning of a continuing collaboration between myself as a colorist and <A HREF="prescott.html">Stephen G. Prescott</A> on numerous projects in the SF/F vein.<P>

My credits include:<P>
