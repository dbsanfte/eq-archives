(415)485-6788  106 Elizabeth Way, San Rafael, CA 94901<P>

An aboriginal of the San Francisco Bay Area since 1967, Mark plays acoustic
and electric guitars, mandola, violin, electric bass and sings, working in
the idioms of rock, blues, psychedelia and Celtic traditional music.  He took
advantage of his early childhood in Chicago, home of the blues, by learning
to play guitar from a white lady* on TV.  He went on to study music at
University of California at Santa Barbara.  Equally at home on stage or in
the studio, Mark and his compostions have appeared on several albums.  He was
a member of the legendary Celtic rock band Phoenyx, and techno/pagan/sci-fi
band Annwn, as well as touring Germany with the super-corn folk group
Shanachie.  Mark also performs regularly with Irish singer-songwriter Kevin
Brennan and his popular Claddagh Band--Van Morrison's daughter Shana's
back-up band of choice.  His own band is the eclectic electro/acoustic
Conundrum, straddling the fence between acoustic trio and Celtic rock
quintet.  Conundrum features wild-eyed fiddlers Alison Bailey and Cat Taylor.

	<EM>"I 'd like to play every kind of music that can be played on the violin."</EM><p>
So states eclectic electric and acoustic violinist Cat Taylor,  and she seems to
be well on her way to that goal. Educated classically with a BA in music from UC
Santa Barbara, she played in many show orchestras before learning Irish fiddling
during her extended tenure with the Renaissance Pleasure Faire. Going electric
came next with the semi-electric Irish folk band Matrix.<P>

 	The lure of rock and roll beckoned and the Zeta electric violin assisted
in her transition, first for three years with pioneering Celtic Fusion band
Phoenyx, then exploring more traditional rock and roll roots with
blues-funk-folk-rock band Amazon Queen, funky, modal, gypsy jazz with Go Van
Gogh, and Celtic rock with Stone Fiddle.<P>

	Expanding her horizons even further included a week in Nashville at Mark
OConnors first annual fiddle camp studying everything from jazz to Texas Swing
and studies with jazz violinists David Balakrishnan and India Cooke.<P>

	Cat currently performs in the Celtic-based acoustic trio Conundrum, which
is constantly expanding both its musical boundaries and its personnel, Haunted
By Waters which mixes Celtic, Middle Eastern and other world-beat influences in
a kind of electric tribal, trance-dance groove, and the continuing adventures of
the increasingly funkifying Amazon Queen.<P>
