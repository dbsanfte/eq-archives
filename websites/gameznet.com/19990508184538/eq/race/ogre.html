<p>Ogre's can be summed up in two words: Brute Force. Ogre's are not the smartest race in
the game, and they certainly are not the most attractive but they make it all up with
brute force and strength. Ogre's are by far the biggest brutes in the game which naturally
makes them a fine race for a <a href="../class/warrior.html">warrior</a>. They can also be
a <a href="../class/shadowknight.html">shadowknight</a> or a <a href="../class/shaman.html">shaman</a>. <br>
<br>
As warriors they really have no equal. One could argue that a <a href="troll.html">troll</a>
makes the best warrior because of their natural regeneration. However the strength of an
ogre by far exceeds even a troll. Regeneration is great at lower levels and it remains
useful even at higher ones. However at higher levels there are items which are attainable
which will allow you to regenerate naturally. While ogre's will never regenerate faster
than troll's it is a trade off. Ogre's when teamed with a cleric to heal them are a more
powerful warrior, however if solo is your thing then a troll would probably be more to
your liking. <br>
<br>
As a shadowknight ogre's are an interesting trade off. They are of course not going to be
the best of spellcasters(but then again neither is a troll) but their size and strength
can cover the warrior end of things. Also as with a troll their natural ability to slam
gives them an extra attack even when they are using a two handed weapon which is a luxury
that most shadowknights do not have.</p>

<p>If you want to be a shaman I would suggest being a <a href="barbarian.html">barbarian</a>.
