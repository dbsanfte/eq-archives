     name is BattleDragun, I am a level 48th Barbarian&nbsp; Warrior on the Team
     PvP server Vallon Zek. I have had great&nbsp; success in pvp with over 500
     pvp wins(chasing person from&nbsp; zone) and 109 confirmed pvp
     kills(screenshots taken of death&nbsp; or faction hit). I've been asked
     many times how to pvp as a&nbsp; warrior, but its just too long to explain
     the intricacies of&nbsp; the class and most of the skills with warrior pvp
     comes from&nbsp; trial and error. Hopefully this Guide will help the
     future&nbsp; warriors out there.<br>
     <br>
     PvP with a warrior is one of the hardest pvp classes&nbsp; and requires
     more skill than any other class. It is the same&nbsp; with all pure melee
     in pvp, but warriors do not have the&nbsp; little safety options that
     monks(mend, safe fall) and rogues(hide) have. With the innate ability to
     resist magic,&nbsp; tons of hit points, and a large assortment of
     gear&nbsp; available, a well equipped and played warrior is one to be&nbsp;
     respected. Before I get into specifics, the best friends of&nbsp; a pvp
     warrior are<br>
     1) Pumice stones<br>
     2) Journeyman boots<br>
     and&nbsp;<br>
     3) Magic resistance equipment.<br>
     <br>
     Now why I say pumice stones, is because they are the number 1 means of
     keeping a warrior alive. If a warrior gets rooted, snared, or darkened,
     they are pretty much easy meat. But with a pumice stone, you can remove any
     type of magic based debuff/effect/buff from either your target or yourself.
     Journeyman boots are very important to 1) outrun<br>
     pets and 2) keep up with casters that have journeyman boots and to outrun
     those that don't. One of the most useful items in the game for PvP as they
     have a instacast. And for Magic resistance equipment, its very useful in
     pvp. If you cannot be rooted, stunned, snared, blinded, or mezed, you
     cannot be killed unless you stick around. Now into class specifics.<br>
     <br>
     Priest classes:<br>
     <br>
     Druids- To fight them, unload a full pumice stone to destroy all buffs that
     they have on, including SoW, thorns, wolf form, hp buffs, str buffs, and
     the such. When this is done, recycle your pumice stone for a new one. If
     the druid snares you, target yourself and pumice it off. If you get doted,
     target yourself and pumice it off. If you know you are gonna be fighting a
     druid, Load up on the heat resistance gear, but make sure to get at least a
     65 cold resist(for the level 49 ice spell). Most of the druid nukes are
     fire based, so if you can resist these and pumice off the dot's and snare,
     a druid is a easy opponent to take out. When the druid see's he is gonna
     loose, he will most likely&nbsp;&nbsp; cast SoC and run off, once it is
     casted, you have to quickly pumice his SoC and finish him off.<br>
     <br>
     Shamans- As with druids, start fight with full pumice, and use pumice stone
     to get rid of DOT's that are magic based. With shamans you want to load up
     on the cold, poison, and disease resist(malosi series is disease based). A
     buffed shaman CAN out-melee a warrior with heals and dot's, so make sure
     you have pumice to removed buffs. For the deadly envenomed bolt, you can
     get some counteract poison potions from a friendly alchemist for around
     15-20pp each. When the fight is going bad, the shaman will most likely SoC
     away like the druid, pumice it off and finish the shaman.<br>
     <br>
     Clerics- If you haven't noticed a pattern, open the fight with a full
     pumice to remove all buffs. For a cleric this is important that you do
     this. A cleric can add around 30 ac and up to 1k hp's at level 49 to his
     stats with buffs alone. That's a lot of damage that you don't have to do.
     With clerics, go ALL magic resistance gear. If you get around 100mr, a
     cleric will do little to no damage with DD's, stuns and roots will be
     resisted. Key thing for fighting a cleric is you must interrupt his heals.
     If he goes invulnerable and tries to run, you cannot do damage, but you can
     stun him to keep him from making it to the zone line with bash or slam.
     Clerics are one of the hardest classes for a warrior to kill, but it is
     possible.<br>
     <br>
     Pure caster classes:<br>
     <br>
     Wizards- As with all classes, start the fight by unloading a full pumice
     stone and cycling out for a new one. The key to fighting a wizard is to
     stay on him. His nukes are strong, but have a 5-6 casting time. The key is
     to have high enough magic resistance to resist the stuns or bonds of force.
     A stun from a wizard will give him enough time to get<br>
     a ice comet off, and post expansion 2 fast casting fire based DD's. If
     fighting a 49+ wizard, cold resist is a must. Ice comet HURTS. But for
     wizards, go with Magic as most important resistance, then cold/heat,
     depending on level.<br>
     <br>
     The only way for a wizard to flee is through shadow step or gate, if you
     can interrupt his spells, the win will almost always be yours. If a wizard
     does get a shadow step off on you, use your bow as a locator. With the bows
     in everquest, if you are facing in the general direction and within bow
     range, firing the bow will point you in his exact direction.<br>
     <br>
     Magicians- Mainly Magic based nukes, but have fire based bolt spells that
     hurt. A way to dodge a bolt spell is to always keep the pet between
     yourself and the caster while it is being casted. Magicians however can
     beat warriors easily by turning the pet on the warrior and running around.<br>
     <br>
     This is where Jboots come in handy as you are able to outrun the pet. Note:
     Because of a change with dispel magic, never, EVER dispel yourself with a
     pet on you. If you do, the pet because &quot;rogue&quot; and no longer hits
     for nerfed damage. That pet that was hitting you for low 30's will now be
     hitting you for low 50's. The only thing a pet has over a warrior is auto
     tracking, otherwise a warrior is better than a pet in pvp, pets hit for
     maximum of around 36, with bloodfire and amy whip I'm doing a maximum of
     high 40's, low 50's.<br>
     <br>
     Necromancers- Open up fight with a pumice to get rid of buffs, a necro with
     DMF is hard to hit, but remember with a pet and a ton of dot's,
     necromancers are the warriors worst nightmare. To fight necro's load up on
     the poison, magic, and heat resistance. If high enough you can resist all
     his deadly dot's and DD's. Pumice stone can get rid of darkness and blood
     line of dots, but a counteract potion is needed for the poison line, also
     must pumice yourself and the caster if he hits you with vampiric embrace or
     bonds of death. The disease line of dots are near useless as it takes
     forever to do actual damage, so it isn't that important to invest in
     disease resist or counteract disease while fighting a necro. Stay on the
     necro while fighting him, use your bow to keep him on target and to
     interrupt spells, same with all casting classes. The hard part of fighting
     a necro is his life taps, if you cannot interrupt them, you cannot win.<br>
     <br>
     Enchanters- They are ALL magic based. If you cannot be mezed, stunned, or
     nuked, you cannot be killed by this class. A 100+ MR is required to resist
     their spells. Tashani series is poison based, but is near impossible to
     resist. Use counteract poison to remove tashani series. Interrupt his gate
     spell and with a high MR, will be a easy kill. Use a pumice stone to remove
     all buffs and to remove all debuffs that stick on you.<br>
     <br>
     Hybrid classes:<br>
     <br>
     Bards- They are just annoying, songs are unpumiceable, and can easily kite
     a warrior. Use your bow to wear down the bard if he tries kiting you, or
     just run out of song range and wait for him to come back. Warrior will
     hands down beat a bard in pure melee. Wearing Magic resist gear and AC gear
     is a key for victory.<br>
     <br>
     Rangers- A more pvp oriented druid type of class. Open fight with pumice to
     remove buffs. Resistance's needed are heat for the rangers fire based DD's
     (ignite, call of flames) and magic (snare). If they try to kite you, use
     your bow to wear them down, in pure melee, your hp's and ac alone should
     ensure you the win.<br>
     <br>
     Paladins- Open fight with a pumice stone, clerical buffs might be outdated
     for the level, but can still add a few hundred hp's to the class. Unless a
     paladin has a top of the line weapon (planar or high level kunark) a
     warrior can beat a paladin in pure melee. Must interrupt the heals, and LoH
     can be a pain. If magic resist is high enough, you will resist all stuns
     (need 70 or so MR), but AC and interrupting heals is the key to killing a
     paladin.<br>
     <br>
     Shadow knights- Open fight with pumice stone. Magic resistance is a key to
     fight the shadow knight class, If the dot's don't stick, they can't kite
     you. And harm touch can be resisted with high enough MR. Shadow knights,
     like paladins, cannot out melee a warrior, and must rely on their damage
     spells to win. With life leach and harm touch, a 50+ shadow knight is very
     deadly, a warrior can loose 2 bubbles of life in a few seconds. Shadow
     knights do get shadow step for a escape spell, so to ensure victory, it
     must be interrupted. AC and weapons are the key to beating a shadow knight.<br>
     <br>
     Pure Melee:<br>
     <br>
     Warriors- Not much to do against one. You have 2 options. Going toe-toe and
     seeing who has the better equipment, and that person will win. Or you can
     dance around, using your fps skills, connection, and equipment to ensure
     the win. &quot;Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee&quot; is a good way
     to describe how to fight melee Vs melee. Its more like a boxing match when
     you dance around. AC is king.<br>
     <br>
     Monks- Monks are masters of straight up melee damage. Get your AC as high
     as possible and try to dance your way to victory, standing toe to toe with
     a monk is asking to loose. Mend is your worse enemy, and fists and kicks
     will hurt.<br>
     <br>
     Rogues- Pretty easy targets, masters of the dance of blades. Never leave
     your back open for a backstab, without them, a rogue is a weak warrior.
     Keep a Counteract poison and a pumice slot ready for a rogue who uses magic
     and poison based poisons. Also need magic resistance around 60+ to resist
     the procs that rogue weapons have. If you get darkened by a rogue's SBD,
     pumice it off, or you will get backstabbed as you cannot maneuver fast
     enough.<br>
     <br>
     General tips:<br>
     <br>
     Bow- Can be used to help keep your target at center of screen, can also
     wear down running opponents, and can interrupt spells.<br>
     Jboots- Can outrun pets, and can overcome running opponents that do not
     have them.<br>
     Pumice stones- Can remove all magic based buffs, debuffs, dots. Open ALL
     fights with a full stone, sold for around 18pp depending on faction and cha
     at a potion shop, one located in every city.<br>
     Slam/Bash- Always use it in pvp until kick-stun at 51. Can momentarily stun
     running caters and can interrupt casting.<br>
     Weapons- Against casters who like to run and cast, a high damage weapon is
     wanted. When they stop to try to cast a spell, smack them once or twice,
     slam to interrupt and they will run again. While they run your weapon will
     recharge. Against melee's or casters who stand toe-toe or don't run that
     far off. Use 1h'ers as 2h'ers will have to high a delay to interrupt
     casting or to low a damage output to bring in the win.<br>
     <br>
     Hope this bit of information helps all the future pvp warriors out there.<br>
