      <BR><BR>The new Plane of Hate is now available on all servers! <BR><BR>The 

      Plane of Hate is an old favorite of many players, and we were careful to 

      retain as much of its old charm as possible (and all of its old quests). 

      At the same time we created all new geometry for the zone using our newer 

      tools and newer design ideas. Old and new players should find this zone to 

      be a lot of fun and a fair challenge. Remember, the price for the Fuligan 

      Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half. <BR><BR>** Veksar ** 

      <BR><BR>Veksar opens on Stormhammer! <BR><BR>Yes, the long-lost ancient 

      city of the Iksar has been discovered. If you?re brave enough, foolish 

      enough, and if you can hold your breath, you may be the right hero to 

      explore Veksar. Good luck! <BR><BR>** Changes for New Players ** <BR><BR>- 

      Maps for Newbie Zones for all Players - One of the biggest hurdles that a 

      new player has to overcome is learning their way around. For those of you 

      that may have started your first character in Neriak, you?ll know what 

      that was like. In order to help out the new player, we?ve enabled the Map 

      window to make it available to all players if they are in a "newbie? zone. 

      <BR><BR>- Context Tips - In order to provide helpful information at the 

      time a player needs it, we have added several context tips. These tips 

      will pop up when a player uses a certain feature or a specific event 

      occurs. We hope this will help our new players to more easily understand 

      the gameplay and controls for EverQuest. These tips may even be useful to 

      long time players. However, if you wish, you can choose to turn off any 

      specific tip, or turn off all of the tips using the check boxes in the 

      Context Tips window. <BR><BR>- Improved Help Information - The in game 

      help files have been improved. They now contain much more information. 

      Hopefully most questions you have about the game can be answered using 

      help. <BR><BR>- All New Characters now start with a weapon skill - In 

      order to help the new player that might forget to train with their weapon 

      before heading out to defeat their first enemy (and even for those of us 

      that have been playing a while and still forget to do this), all new 

      characters now start off with a skill of 5 in their primary weapon 

      <BR><BR>- Taunt no longer requires training - Similarly, Taunt now works 

      without being trained. Characters still start out with a skill of 0, but 

      the skill can increase with use. <BR><BR>- Packet Loss Meter is now Off by 

      default - Due to the fact that the packet loss meter is often confusing to 

      new players, it will be off by default. You can toggle the packet loss 

      meter using the F11 key. <BR><BR>- New Message to prompt new players about 

      the Help button - We?ve added a chat message that appears when a level 1 

      through 10 character logs in that tells them to click the "?" button on 

      the Window Selection toolbar if they need help. <BR><BR>** Spells ** 

      <BR><BR>- Divine Intervention Fix - Players have been reporting that 

      Divine Intervention was not updating the hit points for the character 

      every time when cast, causing characters to die even though the spell 

      seemed to have saved them. We have been unable to reproduce the issue 

      specifically, but we have made some changes that should fix the problem. 

      Please use /bug with details of the incident if you continue to see this 

      problem. <BR><BR>- Bard Epic Animations - Bards will no longer play 

      instrument animations when they have their epic equipped. No more stabbing 

      yourselves in the head with your sword instead of playing a flute. 

      <BR><BR>- Healing Messages now include the name of the healer - In order 

      to make it clearer who has healed you, we have changed the message that 

      you receive when healed. It will now include the name of the character 

      casting the healing spell: "Bob has healed you for 300 points of damage?. 

      <BR><BR>- Call of the Hero works in PoW - We have removed the restrictions 

      to Call of the Hero in the Plane of Water. In this particular zone we 

      don?t believe that the use of this spell needs to be restricted. <BR><BR>- 

      Fear Spell bug fix - Players have reported that when a player character 

      was affected by a Fear spell cast by an NPC, they would see the character 

      running away but the person affected would not actually flee. <BR><BR>- 

      Snare Line bug fix - Fixed an issue that was causing the Snare line of 

      spells to fail on an NPC that is under the effects of a Fear spell. 

      <BR><BR>- Trickster?s Augmentation group only - We changed Trickster's 

      Augmentation to be group only to prevent folks from using it to ?grief? 

      other players. <BR><BR>- LD Enchanters no longer cast Mem Blur - 

      Enchanters that go linkdead were sometimes casting Memory Blur and similar 

      spells on their enemies. This could cause rather unpleasant results for 

      his group or raid when the NPC suddenly had a fresh hate list. Linkdead 

      enchanters will no longer cast Memory Blur spells. <BR><BR>- Blizzard 

      animation fix - Blizzard was causing a casting animation to go off with 

      every wave, even if the caster was sitting. Now Blizzard works like most 

      rain spells, and only triggers a casting animation when first cast. 

      <BR><BR>- Locked Spell Gem fix - We fixed a bug that was causing the use 

      of a right-click item to refresh the spell gem in the first slot 

      instantly, but if that spell had a long recast it would render it useless 

      until the spell was forgotten and memorized again. <BR><BR>- Mark of Kings 

      upgrade - In order to make this spell more appealing then its lower level 

      counterpart, Mark of Karn, we have: increased the duration from 3.5 to 4 

      minutes, reduced the casting time from 3 to 2 seconds, reduced the mana 

      cost from 170 to 75 and made the spell slightly less resistible. <BR><BR>- 

      Gravel Rain can now be cured - With its very long duration (30 minutes) it 

      was a bit difficult that this spell could not be removed before the 

      duration was over. This is now a curse and can be cured. <BR><BR>- 

      Summoning a horse in bear form no longer causes you to lose the ability to 

      cast spells for a while. <BR><BR>- Rathe?s Son - The innate ability of the 

      focused version of this pet is now less resistible. <BR><BR>- Child of 

      Bertoxxulous - This 65th level Necromancer pet has been given a boost. Its 

      offense has been increased to be in-line with that of the Legacy of Zek, 

      and it now has the ability to use a power that is essentially the same as 

      the spell Banshee Aura. <BR><BR>- Spirit Call - These pets were running 

      away from enemies when at low health. Pets should be far more loyal and 

      willing to risk themselves for their Shaman friends, so we?ve fixed it so 

      that Shaman pets will no longer run away. <BR><BR>- Vampiric Embrace - 

      We?ve corrected a bug with this spell that would prevent the character 

      from casting for a couple of seconds after the proc went off. <BR><BR>- 

      Stun Spells - The message on many stun-type spells have been changed to 

      more accurately portray their effect on stun immune creatures. <BR><BR>- 

      Mana from Buffs - we have increased the maximum amount of mana that can be 

      gained through the use of buff spells. <BR><BR>** Items ** <BR><BR>- 

      Zoning and losing your buffs - There has been a long-standing problem that 

      could cause all of the buffs to be stripped from a character if they zoned 

      with fewer hit points than they had bonus hit points granted by items. For 

      example, if your character had only 10 hit points left when zoning, and 

      had an item that granted +15 hit points, all of your character?s buffs may 

      have been stripped when you completed zoning. We have fixed this bug. You 

      should now retain your buffs in this situation. <BR><BR>- GM Baking Spoon 

      - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmaster?s Baking Spoon was not no-drop. This 

      allowed players to give out an unlimited number of 100% weight reduction 

      bags. This obviously was not the intention for that item, so we have made 

      the Grandmaster?s Baking Spoon no drop on Firiona Vie. <BR><BR>- Wooden 

      Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped. It couldn?t before. 

      <BR><BR>- Adjutant Saber - We removed the secondary notation on the item, 

      since it was only usable by Shadowknights and Paladins, who couldn?t use 

      it in their secondary slot anyhow. <BR><BR>- Cloak of the Dar Khura Hero - 

      The effect on this item was listed in the database as the wrong effect 

      type. The effect is now permanent. <BR><BR>** NPCs ** <BR><BR>- NPCs 

      returning bags empty - NPCs that return items that they do not need were 

      returning all containers empty, regardless of what was inside the 

      container. NPCs that refuse unusable items will now also return bags with 

      their contents intact. <BR><BR>- NPCs returning multiple items - If a 

      character gave an NPC multiples of the same item, the NPC would only give 

      back one of them if he did not want them. We have fixed this so that now 

      those items will be returned. Such items will be stacked on your cursor. 

      Just click the item that is on your cursor into your inventory and the 

      next one will appear on your cursor. Keep clicking them into your 

      inventory until you have them all back. BE WARNED that any of these items 

      that you have not returned to your inventory will be lost if you zone or 

      go linkdead before you get them back into your inventory. <BR><BR>- The 

      Spirit of Rage - This undead gorilla is now flagged as undead. <BR><BR>- 

      Solusek Ro?s Guards - These guards will be much more attentive to their 

      lord and will aid in his defense. <BR><BR>- NPCs healing too much - We 

      have corrected a bug that was causing some NPCs to regain hit points when 

      they turned to run away. The affected NPCs will be of all sorts and in 

      many zones. <BR><BR>- Giant Yellow Jackets - The chance to find a thorax 

      on the corpses of these creatures seemed too low, so we have increased it. 

      <BR><BR>** Zones ** <BR><BR>- Veeshan?s Peak - We have changed this zone 

      to make it more appealing, particularly for those playing with one or two 

      groups. We have removed the restriction against using gate in this zone 

      and modified the zone population. Over all, the zone will be better to 

      play in. <BR><BR>- Acrylia Caverns - We have fixed an issue with the first 

      two seals that was causing the door to the 3rd seal to open without the 

      3rd seal spawning, and without the events being completed correctly. Now 

      the door will only open under proper win conditions, and whenever the door 

      opens the 3rd seal should be available. <BR><BR>- Plane of Nightmare - We 

      have changed the logic for entry to the Thelin Poxbourne event in Plane of 

      Nightmare. When you talk to Thelin, he will now remember your raid and 

      only allow those of the same raid into your maze. Only three groups 

      maximum will be allowed through the portal into any one maze. If your 

      group is not in a raid, he will allow three non-raided groups through into 

      the same maze. If there are three non-raided groups in the maze and you 

      try and get a fourth through, he will act as any other raid would and tell 

      you that he has already let enough people in the maze. <BR><BR>- Planes of 

      Water and Fire - We have changed some of the spells used by the 

      mini-bosses in these two zones. They should be a little easier to resist 

      now. <BR><BR>- Halls of Honor - We have removed a recently added summoning 

      ability from NPCs. We have introduced a less intrusive method of 

      preventing the ability to use area of effect abilities on huge groups of 

      NPCs in the zone. <BR><BR>- Bastion of Thunder - The tower bosses will now 

      be dropping some loot every time (rather than sometimes not dropping any) 

      like the other Planes of Power bosses <BR><BR>** Quests ** <BR><BR>- Added 

      Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors - This is an item needed for a quest 

      that was unavailable. <BR><BR>- Officer?s Cloak - If you have combined 

      your Officer's Cloak in the Security Satchel or you wish to upgrade to the 

      new Officer's Cloak of Service, speak with Scout Derrin in Grimling 

      Forest. <BR><BR>-The Skull of Torment quest - This quest, in Kurn's Tower, 

      should now work. <BR><BR>** Alternate Advancement ** <BR><BR>- Elemental 

      Form - In order to make the Magician Elemental Form abilities a bit more 

      useable, we?ve reduced the reuse time from 72 minutes to 15 minutes. 

      <BR><BR>- Alternate Advancement timers - We fixed a bug that allowed AA 

      timers to be reset early. <BR><BR>- Mass Group Buff - We have made this 

      ability available to Beastlords. <BR><BR>** Miscellaneous ** <BR><BR>- 

      Characters getting stuck in the world - We have fixed a bug that would 

      cause a character to stay in game for extended periods of time after going 

      linkdead. This bug was causing people to receive a 1018 error because 

      their character was still in the world and could prevent them from logging 

      back in for a long period of time. <BR><BR>- Big Dwarves - Fixed a bug 

      that was causing Dwarves that had their size increased twice to start to 

      see the insides of their faces while attacking. This was making even the 

      stoutest Dwarves a bit uncomfortable and self-conscious. <BR><BR>- Tread 

      water animation fix - We corrected a bug that would occasionally cause the 

      treading water animation to stop animating. <BR><BR>** Interface ** 

      <BR><BR>- Hit Point percentages display in windows - The Target window, 

      Player window and Group window now display hit point percentages. This is 

      something that many player created interfaces use and, considering the 

      popularity of this feature, we?ve decided to add it to the default 

      interface. In the Target and Group windows, the hit point percentages will 

      disappear if the appropriate target/groupmate does not exist <BR><BR>- 

      /report - We updated the text message given when you use the /report 

      feature to better reflect what text is actually attached to the report. 

      <BR><BR>- More Tips of the Day added - We?ve updated the Tips of the Day 

      with more tips and cleaned up a few spelling errors with the existing 

      tips. <BR><BR>- Combining Stacks of items - Attempting to combine stacked 

      items in a container will no longer work. The items must be separated 

      first. This change will prevent items from being lost due to accidentally 

      combining with them stacked. A dialogue will pop up, warning the player to 

      separate the objects. <BR><BR>- Bankers no longer take items - In order to 

      help prevent people from losing items by giving them to their banker 

      instead of putting them into their bank, players can no longer attempt to 

      trade with bankers. A message will tell you to right-click the banker if 

      you wish use your bank. <BR><BR>- Guild Management - The Guild Management 

      window will now take your setting for "show offline" into account when 

      first displaying the window. The delimiter used in the file created when 

      the "Dump" button is pressed has been changed to a [Tab] from a comma, as 

      commas were causing confusion when used in the public and private notes.

      Developer's Board:<BR>

      <BLOCKQUOTE><BR>There are a lot of people watching the progress being 

        made towards the Plane of Time. With the first guild reaching the plane 

        last night, I wanted to talk a little about an issue they had. 

        <BR><BR>Some of the folks that recently completed The Rathe Council 

        encounter were unable to enter the Plane of Time. The requirements for 

        entry are complicated, and those people simply missed a step in the 

        quest that gains them entrance (just an NPC that they needed to talk 

        to). We've talked to them and explained what they missed, and they have 

        been able to gain entry by completing the missing step. <BR><BR>However, 

        we are going to modify the quest steps a bit to make them simpler so 

        that this shouldn't happen in the future. <BR></BLOCKQUOTE></FONT>

        we appreciate your participation. I'm impressed and pleased by the 

        number of people that have shown interest in playing on the new server. 

        This should afford an opportunity for folks to resurrect old

        you are the community for your new server. Have fun.<BR><BR>I've been 

        getting a lot of questions about when the server will open. I can't tell 

        you that exactly, but we will be opening it up shortly (or as the
