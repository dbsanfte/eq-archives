     Enchanter Guide, Pt. 1<br>
     <br>
     Perhaps one of the most misunderstood (as well as underestimated) classes
     in Everquest is the enchanter. In a system where the major theory of battle
     is kill or be killed, we play a vital yet subtle role in a group or guild.
     We are at the same time extremely flexible, yet very fragile. Before we get
     into specifics, let's see where exactly the Enchanter fits into the combat
     equation...<br>
     <br>
     The basics of EQ combat are deal damage and prevent damage. The two common
     forms of dealing it are melee and spells (nukes or DoT). The common form of
     preventing it is healing. Since the enchanter can't heal, and has very weak
     damage dealing ability, our talents lie in elsewhere: both controlling a
     fight, and shifting the odds in our favor. Controlling a fight is perhaps
     one of the most difficult and rewarding roles in the entire game.
     Everything from spell choices and personal stats up to the moment you
     choose to cast can influence how effective you are at controlling the ebb
     and flow of battle. Common &quot;crowd control&quot; spells are the
     Mesmerize series, Stun series, Memwipe Series, and the most fun (and
     dangerous) of all, the Charm series. As for shifting the odds of battle, we
     offer a large range of buffs and debuffs, from the infamous Clarity and
     speedup buffs to our nasty stat and speed debuffs. Filling in the gaps of
     our repertoire are a grab-bag of utility spells like Illusions, animations,
     invisibilities, sight and travel enchancements and the like. I'll try to
     cover our ability to buff and debuff first.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Shifting the Odds:<br>
     <br>
     Where most classes excel in dishing out and preventing damage, the
     Enchanter helps to add more of the former and prevent less of the latter. A
     few key spells, then we'll get into how and when to use them.<br>
     <br>
     1. AC series - this series includes spells like Haze(4), Mist(12),
     Cloud(20), Obscure(29), Shade(39) and Shadow(49). These are fair Armor
     Class buffs, but not often used, since a cleric's AC series will overwrite
     them. Use them on yourself and pet when soloing, or in a group without a
     cleric or paladin handy.<br>
     <br>
     2. Stat Buff series - this is a variety of stat boosters, but should not be
     overlooked. Spells like Strengthen(1), Sympathetic Aura(20),
     Augmentation(29), Insight(39), and Brilliance(44) make up the meat of this
     series. The Charisma boosters are VERY critical to your crowd control
     ability, so always keep your best one up during any combat. Although Shaman
     and to an extent Druids get better pure stat buffers, only Enchanters can
     boost Intelligence and Wisdom, so these become fairly important in giving
     your healers and casters an increase in mana supply. Augmentation is nice
     when no shaman are around, or you want an edge solo; it'll make you harder
     to hit, which means harder to interrupt, which is a good thing. Then
     there's clarity (a.k.a. crack), which isn't a specific stat booster, but
     increases mana regeneration by a few magnitudes depending on your level.<br>
     <br>
     3. Debuff series - the debuff series is perhaps our second most efficient
     use of mana during combat outside of crowd control. Some examples are
     Weaken(1), Languid Pace(12), and Disempower(16). These drop your opponent's
     stats, making them easier to hit as well as doing less damage to your
     tanks. Slowdowns like Languid Pace(12) and Tepid Deeds(24) slow down your
     enemy's attack rate, which is critical in reducing damage. Use both
     whenever possible, but keep in mind they won't stack with the similar
     series Shaman have. I've seen many an Enchanter NOT use these spells,
     because there's no glaring evidence of how effective they are (read: tanks
     can't see it in the numbers) but they're worth every mana point. Use them,
     especially the slowdowns.<br>
     <br>
     4. Speedup series - by far the most powerful buff in our arsenal, as no
     other class comes close to our ability with them. Spells like
     Quickness(16), Celerity(39), and Swift Like the Wind(49) make this series
     our trump card in shifting the odds. Shaman get the same series later on,
     but cap out earlier than an Enchanter. Your tanks will love you for this,
     so try to keep it on them at all times. Also works very well on a pet
     during soloing.<br>
     <br>
     5. Rune series - this series is a mixed blessing, and includes Rune 1
     through Rune 4. Don't get me wrong, they're great spells, as they are one
     of our only forms of pseudo-healing; but the cost can be prohibitive,
     especially for Rune 1 and 2. They add a nice damage shield to players when
     you know a tough opponent is coming up, and they can even be used in a
     pinch to save someone's life if a cleric isn't paying attention or is out
     of mana. Tip: in a hairy evac situation (Guk, Solusek B trains come to
     mind) when your gater is being hit, here's an Ubertaunt - rune yourself
     then the gater. All mobs will switch to you (yes, you'll get beat up soon)
     but it will buy that druid or wizzy the few vital seconds they need to get
     the evac off.<br>
     <br>
     Use of these spells is fairly self explanatory; some you use prior to
     combat, some during, some in-between fights. Don't underestimate any of
     them, and don't forget to keep that Charisma buffed!<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     Crowd Control:<br>
     <br>
     This side of Enchanters is by far the most exciting, rewarding, and
     efficient aspect of our class. The only way to get good at controlling is
     to start using it regularly, as with experience comes insight into how mobs
     work and how you can prevent disaster. Some of the ways we can control
     fights is by making mobs &quot;off&quot;, stunning them, and controlling
     them via charms. Expecting a pull of 2 mobs and 5 came? &quot;No
     problem!&quot; says the experienced controller.<br>
     <br>
     1. Lull series - this line includes spells like Lull(1), Soothe(8), and
     Calm(20). Very important at low levels when pulling camps and multi-mob
     arrangements is common, don't hesitate to use them. Cast this series on
     mobs you don't want to aggro (attack you), starting from the closest mob
     and working your way back. Done properly, you can keep a nasty 5-mob camp
     down to single pulls.<br>
     <br>
     2. Mesmerize series - this is it ladies and gentlemen, the bread and butter
     of controlling. This lineup includes everything from the basic single-mob
     Mesmerize(4) to AOE shut-downs like Blanket of Forgetfulness(49). The basic
     premise of this series is turning a mob &quot;off&quot;, or otherwise
     making it incapable of fighting, casting, or even moving until it takes
     further damage. Charisma drastically effects how often your Mezzes will
     stick to a mob, so keep it as high as possible at all times. There's
     nothing worse than having a nasty mob slice you up because it resisted your
     initial Mez, so stack the odds in your favor whenever possible. More on how
     and when to use this line below.<br>
     <br>
     3. Stun series - this series includes everything from Color Flux(4) to
     Color Skew(44), and consists of AOE stuns. Be VERY careful when using this
     series, it's a double-edged sword. On one hand you can keep a mob from
     attacking every few seconds by a quick stun, allowing someone to heal or
     step back. On the other you can kill yourself by recklessly using it when
     your group is sorrounded by mobs that aren't mad at the tanks yet, or
     consider a stun more of a threat than a warrior's presence.<br>
     <br>
     4. Root series - I know quite a few Enchanters who don't bother to keep
     root loaded in their spell sets, but it's a good idea to keep one up at all
     times. I've lost track of how many times I've saved my own or another's
     skin using a root, buying enough time to step back or run away. Spell need
     may dictate you swap it out, but I regret the times I went to cast it and
     found a debuff or nuke in it's slot. In this series are constant upgrades,
     from the simple Root(8) to Paralyzing Earth(49).<br>
     <br>
     5. Whirl series - a distant cousin to Root, Whirl til You Hurl(12) and
     Dyn's Dizzying Draught(29) are nice to have, but hard to justify taking up
     a spell slot with. Both spells completely hold your opponent against it's
     will, during which time it cannot cast, move, or attack, regardless of any
     damage it's taking. Both spells are susceptible to breaking from someone
     stunning or bashing the mob, and both have an indefinite duration, meaning
     they may last under a second, and they may last many seconds. Personally, I
     can't justify using a slot for these spells when I can stun or root in
     combination (both much faster casting, too); the exception is when I must
     try to keep something from casting at all costs. In these instances,
     &quot;accept no substitute&quot;.<br>
     <br>
     6. Charm series - charm is a very powerful weapon, but must be used with
     good judgement. Included are versions from Charm(12) to Allure(49). It can
     completely turn the tide of battle, or it can get you killed faster than
     any cleric can heal. Charisma directly effects how often this spell takes
     hold, and how long it lasts, so once again keep that Charisma up. A basic
     rule of thumb is to charm only when your group is severely outnumbered and
     must have an ally, or you're lacking tanks; in most instances, you want to
     charm the weakest opponent (ie. lowest /con) in order to keep the charm as
     long as possible. Tip: Invisibility breaks charm, but most chanters know
     that. =)<br>
     <br>
     To cover every crowd control strategy would not only take up way more pages
     than I care to write, it wouldn't help much; the best way to get good at
     controlling is to get into messy situations on purpose, and do it. Think
     you know everything about controlling at 50? Try bringing one tank and one
     cleric to break up a tough spawn like the Froglok Lord or King. Still not a
     challenge? Solo them! =)<br>
     <br>
     The basics of control start in good communication. I can't stress enough
     how much easier things become if you and your puller set guidelines for
     mana checks, multiple pull signals, and the like. Make sure you know which
     mobs you'll be facing, the order that they're coming in, and whether or not
     any have been aggro'd beyond &quot;seeing&quot; the puller.<br>
     <br>
     Next comes a few decisions. As any good strategist knows, your best bet
     during the fight is to put all your tanks on the toughest mob, and remove
     it's damage potential as soon as possible. This leaves you with the job of
     mesmerizing (when I mention mesmerizing, I don't mean the literal spell,
     I'm referring to whatever your current version of it is) the weaker mobs
     and making sure your guys are only dealing with 1 attacker at a time. But
     that toughest mob is not always the one you want to drop first in a
     controlled environment. For instance, if your puller brings a
     &quot;tougher&quot; mob with low resistance, and a weaker mob with almost
     full resistance, you need to point out this exception to your group, and
     work around it. Shut down that tough one with a mez, and let your tanks
     switch to the weaker opponent who would normally resist your mezzing and
     probably chase you all over after the first resist. A good habit to get
     into is runing yourself prior to the pull; this gives you a few more
     chances to get off a second mez if a mob resists the first one and turns
     aggro on you. As for which version of the series to use, that's entirely up
     to you, and should be dictated by how fast you can react, how good your
     &quot;bodyguards&quot; are (more on this later) and what level you are. The
     lesser versions cast faster and have shorter duration, the stronger ones
     cast slower but last longer. Also, make sure your group knows not to DoT or
     otherwise damage anything you're going to turn off; DoT put on before a mez
     will wake the mob up as soon as the next &quot;tick&quot; comes, and you
     can bet the mob will be coming after you first.<br>
     <br>
     A good strategy is to use a &quot;bodyguard&quot; system to keep you alive
     during heavy controlling. Pick a tank (paladins make the best, due to
     stuns, root, and healing/lay hands) and a cleric that you trust to keep you
     alive no matter what. Both of them can use stun spells to buy you time if a
     mez or charm fails, both can try rooting as a secondary attempt, and the
     paladin can always taunt or get the mob's attention with a quick slash or
     bash. Make sure your bodyguards know what you're trying to turn off and
     whether or not you're going to get hit if something wears off.<br>
     <br>
     The AOE stuns Enchanters get can be used in primarily two ways: self
     protection and taking away damage potential. They're a real life saver when
     a mob is aggro on you, and you need a quick moment to get off another mez
     attempt or a root/whirl. Also, use stuns to generally keep a mob from
     attacking, by using it every time it cycles around again. They take very
     little mana, cast quickly, and your tanks will thank you for it.<br>
     <br>
     That's about it for the basics of control. Hopefully I'll get around to
     writing a control guide for more advanced enchanters soon, which will
     include tips for the higher level zones, dragons, planes, and the like.
     Until then, keep your wits about you, a trusted paladin at your back, and
     your Charisma as high as possible. =)<br>
