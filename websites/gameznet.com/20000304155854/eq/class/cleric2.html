            a) Melee effectively during your career <br>

            or&nbsp; <br>
            c) Nuke within a group !&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            No kidding - you will NOT be doing this in a group and soloing as a cleric is PAINFUL
            except against undead and even that usually doesn't compare to grouping.. This guide hopes
            to explain why. Read on if you do want to make LOTS of friends, role-play and get to see
            all the hotspots in the game with many people making sure you see it safely... Hopefully
            balanced, this will both help you choose the class with a long term view and appreciate it
            more if you play another class.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Playing the Cleric Class</strong></font><br>
            <br>
            In short , the reality of playing a Cleric is that we spend almost all day<br>
            sitting in front of our computers, looking at the lovely meditate button or<br>
            nearest corridor after level 35 (hmm - Ed) this will consume , by level 40+ 95%<br>
            of your time. No joking.&nbsp; Clerics heal and buff others. Period. Harsh maybe ,<br>
            and believe me it does cause long bouts of &quot;why did I pay money for this ??&quot;<br>
            sessions as we watch Monks get lavish praise for a perfect pull , fighters get<br>
            praise for a 150 damage critical and wizards &quot;oooohs&quot; at the latest ice comet.<br>
            The flip side of the coin is rather brighter however and to me more than makes<br>
            up for this.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Heals </strong></font><br>
            <br>
            This is the reason why you clicked that button back at the creation of this<br>
            current incarnation. With heals , we can extend the lives of those that protect<br>
            us. By healing them , these other warriors reward us with lots and lots of<br>
            experience. We are the masters of the heal bar none. Without&nbsp; our healing groups<br>
            can take an area's mobs carefully , slowly and with many worried glances. WITH<br>
            our healing , multiple pulls scare us marginally less , big monsters are faced<br>
            with courage and and control is brought to the situation. Warriors feel secure<br>
            and fight confidently until the awful cry of &quot;CLERIC OOM - BEWARE!&quot;.&nbsp; A
            short<br>
            step away is the responsibility that can easily be ours - &quot;To run or not to<br>
            run&quot;. When we start to get low on mana, it can more often than not be our<br>
            responsibility to cast that last heal after shouting &quot;RUN&quot; or &quot;HAG TO
            ZONE&quot; (<br>
            used in Guk for a laugh!). Superior heal after 40 outweighs the other classes<br>
            significantly. The joys of Complete heals with a warrior friend after 40 is<br>
            immense especially as you try to get more and more efficient by casting the<br>
            spell later and later ( this will either make you famous or infamous VERY<br>
            quickly ;) Heals make you friends as you are in a prime position to save the<br>
            life of a PC nearby. Do this if you can as this is what we are clerics for ...<br>
            We also have a chance to consider the tactical side of our fights when necessary<br>
            while we sit down and wait for that mana to return.<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Buffs</strong></font><br>
            <br>
            Our AC and HP spells may not be as original sounding as that of shamans etc and<br>
            to be honest shouldn't be seen that way. Buffs extend the time between heals as<br>
            the warriors can take more damage and therefore dish more out. Regularly buff at<br>
            LEAST the primary tank in your group and you will do much better. You can add<br>
            600+ HPs to a PC at the higher levels&nbsp; (a massive amount and at least 5 hits<br>
            from some of the mobs you take at this level !!!). Buffs also makes you friends.<br>
            Cast it on a newbie as you pass and you will make friends in the world.&nbsp; The AC<br>
            does make a big difference to the survivability of the tanks , so use everything<br>
            you have on them. As for symbols , if your rich - use em. If your not - don't<br>
            but get some cash soon. I have close friends who know to get the jaspers<br>
            themselves for the spell , meaning that we are both happy&nbsp; ;) the perfect<br>
            answer..<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Soloing </strong></font><br>
            <br>
            This is not our forte. We are down longer and have less chance of killing things before
            running out of mana. OK , with our HPs we can take a few taps from the mob, but to be
            honest you would have to be very lucky to kill something after running OOM.&nbsp; The
            exception to this ( soloing that is)&nbsp; is undead. Killing these can be effective but
            to be honest I think we're better off getting company and using our classes strengths to
            combine with others to speed our way through the levels.<br>
            Duetting on the other hand with a warrior is totally different. Find a place where you can
            pull one or two at a time without interruption, and you have the perfect combo for power
            leveling. With a warrior you can heal buff and assist him while he absorbs all that damage
            to the maximum benefit to both , just don't get involved in more than you can chew off ,
            and root it when it runs ;)<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Raise the dead AKA Anon time</strong></font><br>
            <br>
            We are abused more than any other class. Big words , but you expect to pay up to 2 PP and
            more for a SOW , 10PP or more for a teleport&nbsp; - can anyone tell me why people expect
            to be able to ask for an exp resurrection, get it and say &quot;thx&quot; and walk away!!
            This recovers at least a few hours(days at 49)&nbsp; gametime and also gets warriors back
            to the scene fast but is EXPECTED of a cleric. Don't get me wrong ( I.E. rant time) I will
            help a mate any time any place anywhere - my group - those fighting the same mob as my
            group included,&nbsp; which is WHY I played a cleric , but now I stay anon so that only
            those that know me would ask me , therefore reducing the time I spend sitting reading a
            book while staring at the screen every now and then ( with the sound up just in case)
            waiting for that 500<br>
            mana to return. I pay by the minute and want to get something for my time online, even if
            it is only a promise of help in the future.... £300 sterling per Qtr is a good reason for
            saying &quot;No&quot; to all the requests when trying to get a group in a zone...<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Recommendations</strong></font><br>
            <br>
            Find a partner: Assisting others is how we earn our bread and butter. Buff heal another
            and he will get you the wins you crave in this type of MUD.<br>
            <br>
            Find a group: For the same reason as above, just with more bad guys at once ;)<br>
            <br>
            Find a lot of bad guys! Because the bad guys want to give you all their loot -<br>
            otherwise why would they keep coming back ;) Just remember to stand BEHIND the warrior!<br>
            <br>
            Do NOT get the Cleric armor: Because it sucks ( sorry Verant). Bloodstained, Enameled ,
            mithril and gator stuff is far better at getting you to that peak - 200 Wisdom ( ALL THAT
            MATTERS when you are a cleric ;)<br>
            <br>
            Get used to sitting down...<br>
            <br>
            <font color="#FFFFFF"><strong>Conclusions and insights</strong></font><br>
            <br>
            We have the honor of being at the same time one of the most important member of<br>
            any group and also the most overlooked/taken for granted.&nbsp; Any&nbsp; group focused on<br>
            minimum downtime and maximum bang per HP will want a cleric there so the<br>
            fighters can fight , the nukers can nuke and so on.&nbsp; Sitting down constantly is<br>
            the order of business for us clerics to make the best use of our mana and fight<br>
            on that little bit longer. We enhance the group, allowing a much greater range<br>
            of opponents to be tackled. This is what it means to be a cleric , so if this<br>
            appeals , then you are on the road to a very rewarding time!<br>
