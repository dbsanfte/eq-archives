            Monks are in the long run, the most effective pure melee class
            available, though many players aren’t in it for the long run, so
            they may go for pure warriors or paladins who can dish out much more
            damage earlier in level than a monk can. The use of your body as a
            weapon can be an advantage at earlier and especially later levels as
            you need no fancy 2 handed monstrous blade to damage enemies,
            although you will be outdamaged for most of your levels in one
            stroke. This doesn’t mean that you are completely under hitting,
            it means that it takes a very high level monk to pull off hits for
            double 60s like big swords are known for; however, instead of 2 hits
            a round for massive damage you get in 4 or 5 attacks in a round for
            respectable hits that may not inspire awe like a slash for 80 does -
            but it adds up very quickly.</font>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Monks
            are also badly hindered in armor choices that limits us greatly in
            lower levels especially. Cloth armor is lightweight and will give
            you some ac before you seek out some pieces of leather or woven and
            then mesh. Mesh is a staple of monks for standard armor, and then
            the magical pieces of special armor that higher levels will
            eventually begin to gather themselves in.&nbsp;</font></p>

            class is decked out with many special skills and the special attack
            that is used together with our typical punches and jabs .</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            skill that allows us even at low levels to get more than the one
            punch in a round. It will not work very well until around level 15,
            which is when warriors get Dual Wield anyway, but it is a nice skill
            to start training before it gets very useful.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            monks only way of healing themselves besides bind wound. It will
            give about 25% or 1 bubble of health on a success no matter what you
            are doing at the time when you use it. It is a risky skill to use at
            lower levels in a fight because it tends to backfire and hurt you
            occasionally, though after the low 20’s it works very reliably and
            I haven’t failed once for about 10 levels .</font></p>

            Bind Wound</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            like every other class’s skill, it reduces down time like mend
            does but cannot be used efficiently in a battle.</font></p>

            damage during a fight throughout all levels.</font></p>

            this is a GREAT skill now that they have fixed it and the skill
            works properly. From high distances a monk can just glide over rocks
            and dunes and mountains and not worry about damage at all.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is your first special attack in a series that starts with Round Kick
            and ends with the impressive Flying Kick. It is very useful as it
            adds another attack to your arsenal, though it has a slower cycle
            rate to use it during a battle. Your special will almost always do
            more damage than a punch when landed correctly.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            actually never even picked this skill up, it seems like a waste of
            points to me, but it is supposed to let you get through areas
            undetected. I am a little less cautious than that and prefer to
            barge in and use Feign Death (One of the BEST skills we ever get) to
            get through mobs of creatures basically unhurt. Basically.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the second special attack of yours that will replace Round Kick.
            It is MUCH better as it recycles about twice as fast as Round Kick
            and does as much or better damage when trained.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Used
            to block attacks and it is gotten at around the same time as Dodge
            begins to work. Block however is a much more useful skill and works
            to avoid attacks more often than Dodge will.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            level 15 the monk’s whole concept changes to as intended. You
            don’t do as much damage a hit but you start getting off 4 hit
            combos and avoiding hits at the same time. Double attack will help
            you get in another hit or hits after your Dual Wielded punches and
            Tiger Claw strike.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh
            yeah, now this is a SKILL. It won’t work much before you practice
            it constantly, so practice it CONSTANTLY. As your skill goes up you
            can begin to pull and avoid mobs you don’t want to pull with FD.
            It can also drop you in the middle of a fight to wait for a heal
            instead of running about panicked and probably dying. It may seem
            cowardly to stop helping the group when you are about to die, but
            waiting for a heal helps them more than just dying and not being
            there for them. Section at the end of guide about all the uses I
            have found for FD.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
            next attack to take the place of Tiger Claw. It recycles at the same
            rate but does more damage and hits more often, more like an upgrade

            another upgrade on the strike series of attacks. This works so much
            better than Eagle Strike it is truly something to look forward to.
            Max damage on this changes with strength obviously but I can expect
            a hit for 40 with it occasionally.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            a neat little skill, it is quite useful because all of the mobs for
            levels to come do not use magic weapons typically, so disarming that
            fine steel scimitar can tip odds in your favor because a mob will
            hit for less damage without a weapon. Unlike monks.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the awe inspiring final manually used special attack to take the
            place of Dragon Punch yet again. After this you will keep this to 50
            so no more hassle in training a new attack every 5 levels that
            doesn’t hit well at all at first. I recommend keeping a LOT of
            practice points open for this when you hit 30, it is a very
            difficult skill to use properly until it is a higher skill. It is a
            damn spiffy looking attack and hits for massive amounts of damage
            then you are used to doing. The only drawback is that it recycles as
            fast as Round Kick did, so much slower than the strikes would, but
            still a great skill when you see how much those level 50 monks do
            with it.</font></p>

            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another
            automatic used skill like Dodge and Block. It has you avoid an
            attack but with a catch, it allows you another attack as a counter
            strike even as you don’t take damage. Nifty.</font></p>
            <p align="center" style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those
            are the monk’s impressive array of skills, now PRACTICE them as
            much as you can.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strength
            - It involves how much you can hold without being encumbered,
            although this does not matter to a monk as even over 15-17 pounds is
            about as encumbered as you want to get ever. It also deals with max
            damage for hits, which is a good thing to have, but not as important
            for monks as it is for other melee classes.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stamina
            - Deals with the amount of hit points gained each level, it is
            roughly 1 hit point a level for every 5 points you have in stamina.
            Nice to have as well, but not important especially as you are
            avoiding hits instead of merely having more hit points to be able to
            take it.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Agility
            - Now here is where you drop a lot of effort on. Agility is what the
            monk does best, avoid damage. It directly relates to ac and the
            chance to dodge, block, riposte, dual wield and double attack
            successfully. So, this is one of the PRIME requisites for a monk to

            - Here is the other most important statistic for a monk. This stat
            helps you hit more often, hit better ac, and the amount of attacks
            you get in as well. You miss less often with Dexterity, and with
            Agility they miss more.</font></p>

            - I would say it is completely useless but you penny pinchers may
            want items to help reduce item costs from merchants. The only thing
            I ever buy or bought is food and drink though.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also,
            as a monk the human screen will dictate how much points you get to
            spend besides your base stats. It is always 20 points that I
            recommend be split between Dex and Agi depending on what you want
            more out of your character. I think 10 10 is good for both though,
            and seeking out new agility and dexterity increasing items are a
            favorite pastime of monkeys.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            now to how to play a monk. As if you didnt know already.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            monk is a tank. Pure and simple, though albeit not as brute as a
            buff warrior or a paladin. We have and get no mana or spells. We do
            however pick up all these skills and magic attacks to compensate. We
            specialize in smaller attack damage that adds up (until a higher
            level when we really start to DISH damage instead of nibbling at hit
            points really fast). A weakness however, is that they decided to not
            give us taunt whatsoever. The best we can do to get a mob off a
            spell caster or healer is to smack it around as hard as we can until
            it turns to us. Flying kick is also a skill that works just as well
            as taunt when used right. If you take into account when a mob is
            casting or turning and then interrupt it with a well timed flying
            kick for 70 damage they tend to get a bit pissed off.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We
            average less hit points a level then a warrior or any ogres or
            trolls as well naturally. Our style is not to get more hp’s to
            take more damage, but to take less damage overall. A monk's special
            skills and abilities need to be practiced and learned so they can
            hit harder, more effectively, or save your life in a pinch. Like
            when to use mend, when to use feign death, how to pull a single mob
            out of a cluster conveniently.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            tend to get some weapon envy - for me it is 2h slashers that hit so
            nicely - that nice shiny Gigantic Zwiehander or Dark Reaver that
            swipes mob’s heads off so cleanly. Weapons are to be envied
            naturally - that’s why I play a little Sk just so he can wear
            plate mail and slash things in half for fun. But even though we CAN
            use 1h and 2h blunt weapons, it isn’t worth it at all. Our weight
            is an important factor, and I guess you could dual wield 2 screamers
            if you wanted to your attack would be down and damage as well as
            your dodge block riposte skills from how heavy they are. As long as
            you keep your hand to hand and dual wield skills maxed out, it’s
            fine to try out maces and stuff until you decide that they just
            really suck. Truly.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Basically
            though, you need to learn how to play a monk for yourself - I can
            say though, that in the long run, a monk is the smack down pure
            melee class. Sorry guys. ,</font></p>

            Fun with Feign Death -</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FD
            is really a very good skill that so many are envious of. It can save
            your life so much that it can seem like your best skill, and it may
            be - besides your attacks. Feign Death is just a skill that makes
            mobs think that you are dead, thus avoiding you - it has limits
            though as all skills do. First, feign will NEVER work if it says
            ‘Azuris has fallen to the ground’ or whatever your name is. That
            means you failed and you might as well get up and run like hell
            again until you can try again. Also, if you feign when your melee
            attack is on, even though it says it turns your attack off, it
            automatically fails you - so you need to go through a quick process
            of turning off attacks to FD reliably. Now, I am not sure if this is
            a myth or not, but it really seems to work more often if you turn
            your back and your attack has been off for more than just an
            instant. Soo, turning off attack and running away a little ways
            seems to help odds of them believing it.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            have also come to believe they use a saving throw a la AD&amp;D
            systems, to make sure the mob doesn’t think you are faking it. I
            see a difference also in how smart the mob is, obviously none of
            them are very smart, but the casters, and more intelligent of
            creatures like an Inferno Goblin Priest will just go about nuking
            you while you lay there, though a same level Inferno Goblin Champion
            - which is just a melee mob - will believe it almost always. So it
            deals with casters and levels most noticeably.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Feign
            Death Pulling -</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            trick deals with when there is that annoying cluster of mobs that
            you can’t take all of at once, so here is a way you can get them
            one at a time if you are careful. Have your pull spot reasonably far
            away, like around a few corners and far enough away that they
            don’t sense you automatically. Determine a target you want and
            have everyone else assist on it, then run off from your group - or
            if you’re solo - and smack it around for a few hits and
            immediately run back. DO NOT get all of them to your pull spot where
            your group is, just enough space so they won’t know when you get
            up again. Sooo, while they are all clambering after you trying their
            best to eat you, you simply fall down, and they will confusedly
            stand there for a little while. This takes some patience, but soon
            after, they will climb over your body and move back to their spot,
            and here’s the best part, ONE AT A TIME. So, when the last is
            still standing on you, wait for it to walk back a ways and then nab
            it before it’s comrade’s notice at all. You can take them best
            one at a time, but I think it is possible to get 2 3 at a time if
            you want as well - just be careful, because it isn’t often that
            your party members can FD with you - so don’t get them killed.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Feign
            Death Kiting -</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is a very difficult maneuver that takes a lot of practice and it
            doesn’t work on many types of mobs. It works very well on giants
            and other extremely slow stupid types. This isn’t pure kiting as
            you aren’t leading the mob around stupidly, but I couldn’t come
            up with a better term for it, so…</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            trick is to spot a large preferably red mob alone that you can pull
            to a spot near a zone. I like the spot in oasis next to the south ro
            zone for sand giant killing, myself. So if you can spot one, hit it
            and run (Sowed ALWAYS) and get back to your spot as quick as you
            can, then feign. As soon as your FD pops back up stand and whack it
            in the back as it starts to meander away and fall down as fast as
            possible, like instantly. At first if you aren’t used to doing
            this and can’t try fast enough they will get a very painful round
            in on you and it won’t work if you can’t hit it without being
            hit, so buffs and Sow are a MUST. You can keep trying until you have
            gotten the rhythm and if you get good at it, the kiting gets very
            easy and basically boring. And by the way, solo exp for red mobs is
            really nice exp .</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Feign
            Death Passthroughs -</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Often,
            mobs around your level as you do this and not really high (and not
            casters a lot of times) have no idea that you are still alive after
            you have FD’ed and gotten away if you do it out of their sense
            range. So, if you have just run really quickly through an area full
            of spawns of creatures around your level and then feigned with all
            of them over you, as they return to their spots, often they still
            think you are dead and leave you alone since you are away from them
            still. Needing to get past an area of spawns this is an option, to
            just run through, take the damage and then wait for them to leave as
            you lie there.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            does NOT work on everything, for example giants, guards, griffins,
            and other higher level mobs always know when you have gotten up, so
            if you let them run off for a while you can run and then feign again
            before they get to you.</font></p>
