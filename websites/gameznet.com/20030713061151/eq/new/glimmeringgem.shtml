      <P>You say, 'Hail, Seana Marsinger' <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'Hello, 
      my name is Seana Marsinger. I am here representing my loyalty to the 
      League of Antonican Bards. It matters not to me whether you support the 
      League or loathe it propaganda is not my objective. Everyone must find 
      their own truths in this life path, so says Quellious. To business then, 
      are you [familiar with the Plane of Hate?]' <BR><BR>You say, 'I am 
      familiar with the plane of hate' <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I 
      need someone that has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. 
      My brother and I have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings 
      for years. Being raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality 
      towards all people, yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not 
      allow us to let him go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my 
      paranoia may prove useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of 
      Tranquility and New Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple 
      [piece of intelligence] that may conceivably upset the entire balance of 
      the Pantheon and have most dire repercussions here in Norrath.' 
      <BR><BR>You say, 'what piece of intelligence?' <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger 
      says 'An old friend of our father's in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been 
      very busy sorting out the information that is coming to him in droves. The 
      first clue came from Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces 
      from many travelers moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, 
      and somehow the Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been 
      out of their grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from 
      Innoruuk. I am afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I 
      do not believe that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in 
      time to warn people of the dangers.' <BR><BR>You say, 'why are you alone?' 
      <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting 
      Jusean with all that needs to be verified and ensuring that the League's 
      network contacts are all still viable. They will need to stay there in 
      case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the 
      residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it 
      as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest] 
      you?' <BR><BR>You say 'Yes' <BR><BR>Stefan Marsinger says 'I believe it is 
      safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel 
      to the Plane of Hate and observe the revenant, the ashenbone drake, and 
      the loathing lich. They seem to be the main practitioners of your art in 
      the least dangerous area. My interaction with these creatures has been 
      mostly at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. 
      If you survive long enough to uncover some type of signet that proves you 
      have been studying these creatures, and truly wish to aid with this cause, 
      bring it to me along with some vampire dust and a diamond. I can craft you 
      protective item and may have some further work for you to do.' 
      <BR><BR>Turn in Signet (off Revenant, 
      Ashenbone Drake, Loathing Lich), Vampire Dust, Diamond. <BR><BR>Reward:&nbsp; <BR><A

       <BR><BR>Second Quest: <BR><BR>You say, 'what work?' <BR><BR>Stefan 
      Marsinger says 'Wonderful. Return to the plane and continue your studies 
      of the demons of magic. With the new information you have brought I 
      believe we have a good framework of reference for the lower rankings of 
      these beings, however there is another echelon of power that I will need 
      to be familiar with. Seek out the minions of magic that seem to take Dark 
      Elven form. These would be the sages, warlocks, and sorcerers. All of 
      these creatures should be within your area of study, but take care! You 
      may even find some that follow your particular discipline if that makes 
      you more comfortable. Make sure to keep your protection with you at all 
      times. Some of them should have a kind of etched sorcerer's crest 
      symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some hatebone drake bones, 
      along with your Gem of Sorcery. If you succeed in this task you are more 
      valuable than I could have imagined, and I may need your skill with a 
      final reconnaissance errand.' <BR><BR>Turn in Etched Sorcerer's Crest (off 
      Sage, Warlock, Sorcerer of Hate), Hatebone Drake Bones, Gem of Sorcery. 
      <BR><BR>Reward:Gem of Enchantment <BR><BR>You say 'what final task?' 
      <BR><BR>Stefan Marsinger says 'In my personal studies I have heard rumor 
      that there are four archaic tomes that contain some of Innoruuk's darkest 
      secrets. I cannot ask you to uncover all four, I am not even certain that 
      they exist. The Concordance of Black Magic, Teachings of Innoruuk, Book of 
      the Dead, and Applications of Suffering are the fabled tomes. If they do 
      indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The 
      tome that I do seek will most likely lie in the hands of one of Innoruuk's 
      own advisors, and they seldom seem to leave their studies. It is possible 
      the Prince of Hate himself holds the tomes close. Find me the Concordance 
      of Black Magic; return it to me with your Gem of Enchantment and your work 
      is finished.' <BR><BR>Turn in Concordance of Black Magic, Gem of 
      Enchantment. <BR><BR>Reward: <BR><a href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/item.php?id=14919">Gem of Conquest</a></P>

      the plane of hate' <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'Good, I need someone that 
      has a bit of an eye for how things should look up there. My brother and I 
      have been studying Innoruuk and his intricate dealings for years. Being 
      raised in New Tanaan may lend us certain neutrality towards all people, 
      yet the values our parents have instilled in us do not allow us to let him 
      go unwatched. In fact, I have begun to believe that my paranoia may prove 
      useful not only to the League, but to the Citizens of Tranquility and New 
      Tanaan itself as well. We have received a simple [piece of intelligence] 
      that may conceivably upset the entire balance of the Pantheon and have 
      most dire repercussions here in Norrath.' <BR><BR>You say, 'what piece of 
      intelligence?' <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'An old friend of our father's 
      in Qeynos, Jusean Evanesque, has been very busy sorting out the 
      information that is coming to him in droves. The first clue came from 
      Kardin Nillic in Gunthak, and then in bits and pieces from many travelers 
      moving through Qeynos. Piracy on the seas has grown, and somehow the 
      Broken Skull Clan has gained power that should have been out of their 
      grasp. Our informants there say that it can only come from Innoruuk. I am 
      afraid that the Plane itself has shifted with this power. I do not believe 
      that we will be able to uncover all that we need [alone] in time to warn 
      people of the dangers.' <BR><BR>You say, 'why are you alone?' 
      <BR><BR>Seana Marsinger says 'Our parents are back in Qeynos assisting

      case we must get the word out quickly. I do not believe that any of the 
      residents of Tanaan would approve of our little quest, and would view it 
      as biased. Thus we are here alone. Does this type of project [interest]

      safest if you study those who have similar interests as yourself. Travel

      hate and spite golems. My interaction with these creatures has been mostly 
      at a distance, and I am not as familiar with them as I would like. If you 
      survive long enough to uncover a minor signet that shows you have indeed

      vicars, templars, and high priests. Make sure to keep your protection with 
      you at all times. Some of the priests should have a kind of crest 
      symbolizing their rank; bring me this crest and some vengeance dust from

      they exist. The fabled writings are the Tome of Dark Healing, Teachings of 
      Innoruuk, Book of the Dead, and Applications of Suffering. If they do 
      indeed exist and you manage to find them, you are far grander than I. The
