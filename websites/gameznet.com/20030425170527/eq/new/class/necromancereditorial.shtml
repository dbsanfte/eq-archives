     following article was submitted by Ayama:<br>
     <br>
     Necromancers, after all the changes made (most especially the pet weapon
     delay &quot;fix&quot;, noted with derision by most mages and necros as a 'nerf')
     what are our strategies now? This is purely my own personal opinion, how
     *I* play, I'm sure that there could be any number of improvements but this
     method of play means I am alive and gaining experience. Necromancers have
     (or are about to) gained and lost several old strategies and gained new
     ones, both when grouping and when soloing. I won't list &quot;we used
     to&quot; items, merely what we can effectively do now.</font>
     <div>
      <font size="2">
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Group
      tactics for the high level (44+) necromancer:</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Here are
      spells to use and why:</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Drain
      Life: Emergency life restoral. Plain and simple, you got hit one too many
      times but are (hopefully!) no longer being attacked, heal thyself.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Direct
      Damage: Outdoors, Ignite Bones. Indoors, anti-undead spells in Lower Guk,
      or stay with IB. EXCEPTION: Necromancers effectively have no DD spells in
      Solusek B. See below.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Life Drain
      DOT spells: Slow, but effective at restoring life at a far more mana
      efficient rate than using Drain life, excellent at countering the effects
      of Pact of Shadow and Mana Creation DOTs. Basically you should always have
      this effect up--remember, if there is another necromancer (you are 45 and
      he is 49) you can only have ONE of these doing damage (though you will
      both get life) so let the higher-level necro cast his first.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Mana
      Creation Self-DOT spells: Better than clarity when in non-stop combat.
      When combat is not nonstop and mana regeneration is not a priority you are
      doing something wrong or are in a relatively &quot;risk-free&quot; zone.
      Basically you should always have this spell up, getting mana constantly.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Venom of
      the Snake: This is your primary offensive spell, and in conjunction with
      your pet is your real damage contribution to the party: 540 damage in 30
      seconds. NOTE: Now you know *exactly* when your spell has worn off. Use
      this knowledge wisely!</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Asytole:
      In a group environment, this is your secondary offensive spell. Be careful
      when you use it, it REALLY makes them mad (STR, AC are lowered, and it
      does 540 DD over 60 seconds) which can get you dead in a hurry. Note it is
      *very* similar to IB in terms of damage/mana ratio, so I see many
      necromancers use IB instead. Don't make the same mistake! You are *not* a
      burner. Even our primary feeding ground (Lower Guk) our anti-undead spells
      take 1-2 bubbles of mana to kill one mob, same in our secondary feeding
      ground (OOT) as we can not effectively do enough DD quickly enough with IB
      (long recast delay) nor can we survive ANY mobs &quot;anger&quot; at us
      for trying to kill them so quickly no one can pull them off us without
      doing quite a bit of burning themselves, in effect saving us by putting
      themselves at risk. This effectively excludes most melee types from the
      short list of people that can immediately pull a mob off of us and onto
      themselves.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Augment
      Death: This spell makes your pet far more effective. Keep it up--I did
      some checking, and only SLTW (49 ench spell, high mana cost with a high
      recast time as it wears off quickly) can do what this does--don't ask
      anyone else to speed buff your pet for you. Soon this will not wear off
      every other fight so it need not always be memmed.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Pact of
      Shadow: An excellent spell, this slowly heals a PC or a pet for 350 damage
      over 30 seconds or so, being able to cast it every 12 seconds means for 10
      mana you can really pump out the healing. Of course, it takes this healing
      from your life bar! This is where trust and group tactics both enter a
      higher level. Did you know that using this spell does *not* put you on the
      mobs agro list? Here is how I understand healing agro to work: Mob does
      300 damage. Cleric removes that damage. Cleric gets beaten on. Necromancer
      removes the damage, slowly over time (think like this: Necro Heal DOT is
      equal to Necro Damage DOT in agro list as Cleric Direct Heal is to
      Wizard/Mage Direct Damage) and does not ever get attacked for it. This is
      critical in places like lower guk, where you absolutely can not let your
      cleric die but must absolutely have healing available at all times. Which
      is where our strategy comes into play. YOU become the healer, in effect,
      of EVERYONE else in the party except yourself. As you should have
      1200-1400 HPs with the appropriate cleric/druid buffs on, the Cleric can
      instead heal you when your life drops to 200-300 with 1 CH and he will
      NEVER get attacked. This means the Cleric can, if needed, STILL do
      emergency healing on other party members, and keep buffs up, without the
      usual problems where they run out of mana or get beaten on by a mob, heal
      themselves, and get beaten on AGAIN. It is *very* critical you make the
      cleric understand. Most of the high-level clerics sitting in lower guk
      that I have grouped with on Povar are absolutely delighted--they can keep
      almost FM, and only need to watch MY life bar unless something like the
      Frenzy, Hand, or Lord pops (they simply do too much damage for us to keep
      up with all the damage but do NOT stop healing!). In Sol B or in OOT the
      mobs simply don't DO enough damage to outpace our heal. Anything past
      Kobolds in Sol B, like the various spiders and giants, will do so much
      damage you would have to die several times to keep even 1 person full. So
      you need not try--most people going into these areas are in a large raid
      anyway and there are either enough clerics or you are all dead anyway.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Screaming
      Terror: An excellent spell. Use it, even WITH an enchanter in the group.
      Its a short term mez, with a memory wipe built into it. This spell has
      limited use in OOT, where the Seafuries just shrug it off--so don't
      bother. However, in Sol B or Lower Guk, it works just fine. Here are times
      when you using this spell can be *very* effective. Enchanters mez breaks
      on a mob, the rest of the party is fighting a named (say Frenzy) and
      really can NOT break off to assist, and the Enchanter can't get a spell
      off to nuetralize the mob. Cast ST on it. Most times it will work. Many
      enchanters say to me &quot;don't cast that spell I can't override
      it&quot;. To which I reply: STUN THE MOB. This breaks my mez, and gives
      you the time needed to re-mez it. All ST is in this situation is breathing
      room for your enchanter. I highly recommend that in Lower Guk you go
      nowhere without one, or you will find YOU are required to mez. You CAN do
      this, but you aren't very good at it, and if you fail to mez one it jumps
      right on you. Where else is this spell useful? Why, to wipe the hate list.
      Most people don't think of this, and watch their poor burner or enchanter
      get hacked to pieces. You HAVE cast VOS on the mob, no? You DO have a pet
      on it, no? And its STILL going after your wizard, cleric, enchanter, etc?
      Cast Screaming Terror on it. You'll mez it for a second, and most likely
      wipe its agro list. Suprise, YOU are the first to damage it (DOT+Pet) so
      it beats on your pet until the melee class(es) beat on it enough for the
      mob to switch to them. It works well, try it.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Darkness
      line: I use engulfing darkness--most fights don't last so long that the
      spell will wear off (clinging darkness is too short, dooming and up cost
      too much mana). Explain to your rangers, druids, mages, and wizards; to
      NOT root or snare. Why? Darkness wears off after a set period of time.
      Once on, it doesn't &quot;break&quot; until its time is up (60 seconds).
      Snare overrides Clinging and Engulfing, Dooming and up overrides snare.
      Root overrides both. Most 40+ mobs break snare and root in seconds. So
      don't bother to use them unless you are *pulling* with it (usually a
      ranger with snare). Once in your designated &quot;we fight here&quot;
      area, stop casting (Mages: Get anything but an earth pet unless you don't
      have another pet for your current max pet level--we DO know Mages have a
      hard time getting all 4 pets for their level, right people? Well you do
      now!) root and snare UNLESS you see the mob running off (meaning Darkness
      wore off at a bad time) once its been beaten to low life. In case you
      don't know, Darkness is the same as snare except &lt;A&gt; its a DOT [the
      lower 2 don't do alot of damage], and &lt;B&gt; cannot be broken--so it
      slows the mob just as effectively as snare/root but won't
      &quot;break&quot;, just wear off. Many times, if you have a good group
      killing things efficiently, you don't have the mana to spare for this
      spell so let the rangers/druids cast snare--if they flub it enough times
      your group will usually help them figure out what they need to do (casting
      snare once at the beginning of a fight does NOT mean the mob will still be
      snared at the end of it).</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Scent
      line: I don't usually use these spells, however in the following
      situations you SHOULD. Lower level Mages (fire), Shamans (disease, poison)
      and even lower level Necros (fire, disease, poison) are having a hard time
      getting their spells to 'stick' or are getting alot of full/partial
      resists--help your party out. This is a very good resist debuff (25-29) on
      Fire, Disease, and Poison resists which should allow your party members to
      &quot;get through&quot; where before they would not. NOTE: For some
      reason, when this spell is RESISTED, you become #1 on the agro list for a
      moment. Doesn't take long to get the mobs off, just keep that in mind.
      When its not resisted they don't seem to care.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Covetous
      Subversion: You have mana--fill up the others who don't. Most critical are
      your CLERIC, then your other casters. You can get your Cleric out of a
      mana-low and give your other casters a needed boost when everyone else is
      full or just alot higher. Always let people know when you are approaching
      FM so they know you have mana to give. I usually swap out Augment Death
      with Covetous Subversion as needed.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">So there
      you have it, where to use spells and why. Now, when grouped with certain
      classes here are a few tips:</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Shaman:
      Have the Shaman cast VOS. Why? He most likely has it memmed, and knows how
      to use it. If he can't get it to 'stick', then help him out with Scent,
      less resisted than his resist-debuff. Regen/Chloro. Get it, keep it, love
      it. Effectively keeps the damage from our Mana Generators to a minimum.
      Not as effective when Lich is up (you'll be turning it on and off far more
      than Call of Bones) but still, ask that they keep it up at all times. Ask
      for STR+AGI buffs for pet at all times. SOW if outside.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Druid:
      Same as the Shaman, except you'll have to do the VOS, and Druids only have
      a STR buff. Wolf form? I guess. Doesn't do much for us, honestly--but I
      have jboots, many newer players wouldn't (and in lower guk SOW is a moot
      point anyway). Explain Darkness so they know when and when not to snare.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Cleric:
      Explain Pact. Make sure he/she understands they are responsible for
      keeping you alive. Let them know exactly how many HPs you have PER bubble
      so they know what to cast and when. Let them know when buffs are
      going--without their buffs you have effectively 1/4-1/3 less HPs with
      which to pact.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Enchanter:
      Explain you'll ST *only* mobs that attack them directly, and how they can
      break your mez (if they don't know yet) to implement their own. Ask them
      to clarity you at any time you are not in skeleton form (enchanters are a
      good reminder that you aren't, they clarity you and you refresh it). Note:
      Clarity and Call of Bones/Lich do not stack, with the Necromancer spell
      taking priority. The two lower versions it works in reverse, with Clarity
      overwriting them.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Wizards:
      If they nuke too early (it happens) ST the mob immediately. Saves them the
      damage they'd normally get. Always make sure the Wizards/Druids/Rangers in
      group KNOW who has the slow/stop duty.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Rangers:
      Explain darkness if you are going to use it, otherwise just nag them about
      keeping it up at the *end* of the fight. NOTE: Rangers can't take damage,
      so expect to have to heal them several times in a fight. In all cases, ask
      them NOT to taunt--it just makes things worse.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Warriors/Paladins/SKs:
      If they are getting ripped up, calmly ask them to stop taunting. Say this
      &quot;My pet can die and I can just get another&quot;. If that doesn't
      convince them to stop, take it to tells and explain it during a non-combat
      situation.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Mages:
      They can summon you weapons for your pet. Saves you the effort to carry
      some or give your pet some from Mobs. They have pets that are slightly
      worse than yours. Explain darkness/root problems, if they don't have a 44
      or 49 non-earth pet accept the limitation and use the max pet they have.
      However if this is the same mage you grouped with a month ago and he STILL
      doesn't have a 44/49 non-earth pet tell him off--lazy mages need a good
      kick to get motivated and get those other pets!</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">Rogues:
      When the Rogue (and the rest of the party) can't get off the Agro list of
      a mob hes really hurt then ST the mob and hopefully the Rogue will back up
      for a breather.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">At 44+,
      with the overcrowding, you'll find places to get experience in a good
      group is not easy, so being as useful as you can and knowing your
      strengths is a big plus. Lower Guk Dead Side and Ocean of Tears Seafury
      Island are the places to go for the high level necromancer. At 47+ you can
      go to the planes, but don't expect to gain experience there (they're just
      places for high-levels to die and lose exp but maybe gain great items).
      Lower Guk Dead Side you are more effective with some really good loot, but
      Ocean of Tears Seafury Island is better cash and experience--not to
      mention generally safer. So LGDS is your &quot;primary&quot; feeding
      ground, with OOTSI your &quot;secondary&quot; feeding ground.</font></p>
      <p style="margin-left: 8; margin-right: 8"><font face="Verdana">In OOT at
      49+ you don't have to do much to kill a Seafury. At 44-48 you do. So 49+
      is a solo experience, just as lower guk can be (most popular place in
      lower guk for the solo 49+ necro? Reanimated hand.) though if you want
      good loot you'll group. 44-48 you must if you want a decent shot at
      survival. I personally prefer a Shaman to pair with--you both get about
      the same experience in OOT as you would solo since your pet isn't taking
      his chunk anymore, and with just 1 other person you do well. And Shamans
      just complement you perfectly.</font></p>
