            <td>This guide was user submitted. It was submitted by Alasdair Allan aka Eduin(Tarew

            <p>What&#146;s that you say. King of the fighters? A shaman? Aye, let me explain&#133;</p>
            <p>Which class can melee blues solo above level 40, get back up and ready to fighting
            within a few minutes and also be able to choose to run and kite the mob to death with DoTs
            or DD or even root and nuke the mob should the need arise if things go poorly?</p>
            <p>Only one - the Shaman..</p>
            <p>But you&#146;re taught differently, you&#146;re taught to be a good little priest and
            sit reading your book, meditate, jump up and heal, or buff, or maybe they&#146;ll let you
            cast a spell on the mob itself (a de-buff naturally, don&#146;t want the Shaman to get to
            hurt it).</p>
            <p>Settle down, I&#146;ll go over the details of how I see the Shaman class. Much is
            contrary to what you have heard elsewhere, much is little understood by those who
            aren&#146;t high level shamans because they simply don&#146;t experience the Shaman&#146;s
            point of view.</p>
            <p>Firstly, I will outline the main &quot;lines&quot; of Shaman spells - every spell they
            receive falls within one of these categories and to be honest, the mix of these changes
            only slightly throughout the Shaman&#146;s career. However the way they are used <b>will</b>
            change, and often. However, even despite this there are only three overall eras of the
            Shaman&#146;s life. The beginning (levels 1 to 19), the middle (levels 20 to 33) and the
            ascent to higher power (levels 34 to 50).</p>
            <p>The second part will deal with those levels as I outline the ways I enjoy to play. Now
            not everyone will have the same likes and dislikes as I do. I play for maximum fighting
            and uptime, to be always involved in the action. It would be very boring if I didn&#146;t
            get that chance. The shaman <b>can</b> play in the ways you have seen described as a
            &quot;reservist&quot;. But they are <b>so</b> much more that you are greatly limiting the
            experience you can have.</p>
            <p>But as I said, its just my opinion.</p>
            </font><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">The Spell Lines<font SIZE="2"><i></p>
            <p>Utility</i></b></p>
            <p>Great fortune gives the Shaman a raft of abilities that will not be directly combat
            related, but serve a purpose. As well as the basics - gate, bind and summoned vitals
            &#150; the Shaman gets Levitate, Enduring Breath and a host of other spells that make it
            enjoyable to be self-reliant. But with the except of root/enstill these are not for
            combat.</p>
            <p>However this isn&#146;t the best part, the combination of Cannibalize (level 24) and
            Regeneration (level 24) or Chloroplast (much better &#150; level 34) give you an inbuilt
            mana stone and the closest you will get to the much demanded Enchanter spell Clarity
            (speeds mana recovery) this side of signing for the yellow robed team.</p>
            <i><b><p>Damage over Time (DoTs)</b></i></p>
            <p>The great combat strength of the Shaman are their spells that hurt a beast over time.
            These are your best, most mana efficient ways of hurting a beast. And they are
            unparalleled. Although a Wizard&#146;s Direct Damage will do as much damage at similar
            levels in a shorter time, your DoTs keep you in that ball-park. Only the Necromancer can
            get close (and many of the spells are shared).</p>
            <p>Use your DoT spells, use them often. Test them on yourself, (one at a time only
            please), and see how fun your damage can be. You think you&#146;re going to be left behind
            when you hit 49 as a Shaman, then they hand you Ice Comet as a no quest needed, 42 second
            DoT!</p>
            <i><b><p>Pets</b></i></p>
            <p>This is the final great spell line of the Shaman. However, you need to work damn hard
            to get there. Your pet makes you extremely independent of other players and the need to
            group but also adds a great deal at higher levels. This marks your ascent to power and
            although the strength of the earlier pets is often a dis-appointment to some Shamans, they
            <b>are</b> effective even then and will only become better and more use later on.</p>
            <i><b><p>Debuffs</b></i></p>
            <p>And now we have the really good lines out the way, the middling ground can be examined.
            The problem with the debuff line is that you only have one effective spell &#150;
            Togor&#146;s Insects at level 39. That&#146;s it. The disempowerment line (which
            supposedly reduces mob damage inflicted) is negligible in combat. The Malaise line (I
            refute Verant&#146;s incorrect spelling) is <b>always</b> more trouble than it is worth
            (using it to get a mob that resists your DoT or DD spells find the Malaise itself
            resisted!).</p>
            <p>But that one spell is a beauty. Togor&#146;s Insects <b>will</b> reduce mob damage in
            combat by apporixmately 60% because it will slow the mob&#146;s attack speed on an
            effective basis to the way a mob would slow a Player Character. This is <b>very</b>
            unusual but its effect is great. The earlier spells (Drowsy, Walking Sleep and even
            Tagar&#146;s Insects) can be useful but their mana (and more importantly time) requirement
            often makes them of little use.</p>
            <i><b><p>Nukes</b></i></p>
            <p>Some people rate the Direct Damage of the Shaman. I do at times, it has its use and can
            be used to overlap the damage from a couple of DoTs to ensure that <b>very</b> few other
            players can outnuke a Shaman. Its useful - nothing more.</p>
            <i><b><p>Healing</b></i></p>
            <p>Again its useful and for a few levels you will be pretty reliant on it. But in healing
            you aren&#146;t hurting and in not hurting your requiring more heals in the combat.
            It&#146;s a self-defeating circle for all but a few levels. Moreso, below level 19 you are
            <b>killing</b> your party trying to heal. Firstly you don&#146;t have the mana, secondly,
            the level 1 HP buff Inner Fire is twice the healing spell that the level 1 Minor Heal
            spell is (20hps for 10 mana compared to 10 hps for 10 mana). And Inner Fire&#146;s ratio
            (20/10) even beats the level NINE spell Light Healing (40/25) for post combat recover.</p>
            <i><b><p>Buffs</b></i></p>
            <p>And here at the end of my scale of usefulness. Buffs.</p>
            <p>But, you say, the Shaman is the king of buffs. Yes they are, by far. However buffs are
            generally useless. And its related to the design of the game. Verant coded a game where
            numbers weren&#146;t going to be vital. Sure they are <b>nice</b> and at higher levels (34
            plus) have a noticeable benefit but overall this line is the biggest drain on a Shaman and
            the biggest waste of time.</p>
            <p>Example. Level 1 Shaman buys Strengthen. It adds 10 strength to the PC. All the tanks
            you group with say, &quot;strength please&quot;. Ask them why? They will say, &quot;so I
            can do more damage&quot;.</p>
            <p>THE STRENGTH BONUS DOESN&#146;T KICK IN UNTIL LEVEL 20!</p>
            <p>In the main for at least 33 levels, Shamans are asked to buff and the <b>only</b> thing
            that is doing is adding to downtime. The buffs are not equivalent to the damage a shaman
            can do in melée. The only thing that has happened is the group needs to wait for the
            Shaman to recover (downtime) or fights without them and takes more damage (downtime).
            It&#146;s a no-win situation.</p>
            <p>Shamans are the king of buffs. They get some nice ones at higher levels (Talisman
            &#150; the stackable HP buff and Dexterity &#150; which I will explain later). But for the
            majority of your life they are a pointless waste of resources that people expect. Be
            strong. Say NO! Explain why.</p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER"></font><b>&nbsp;</p>
            <p ALIGN="CENTER">The Three Ages of Shamans</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
            <p>Often, the Shaman guides break the class down much close than three levels. And there
            is a lot of justification for that. The role of the Shaman can change greatly at each
            spell rank as they balance their strengths against weaknesses.</p>
            <p>However, I&#146;ve found that there really are only three portions.</p>
            <p><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The Early Days</b></i></p>
            <p>NEVER EVER heal in combat until you are level 9. NEVER EVER EVER cast Frist Rift in
            melée. And always think to yourself &quot;I am a tank which can heal up <b>after</b> the
            fight and nuke a <b>runner</b>&quot;. Because that is what you are all the way to level
            14.</p>
            <p>Its amazing to watch the number of new shaman that seem to think a Frost Rift for 12
            damage is better than a cracked staff thwack for 13 when the cracked staff delay is
            quicker than the spell refresh and will <b>never</b> get interrupted. But you will see
            them.</p>
            <p>The problem with Shaman at this stage is that they think caster. And they aren&#146;t.
            Certainly there are some nice touches. At level one a Burst of Flame will pull a mob to
            you saving the aggravation of trying to intercept those non-aggro mobs, Inner Fire lets
            you heal up pretty quick after a fight. A player who has been a mid-level hybrid fighter
            would fine this role suitable. Know your limits, understand that your spells won&#146;t
            get you out of them and heal up <b>afterwards</b>.</p>
            <p>You may as well not bother with the buffs. They aren&#146;t worth the paper they are
            printed on. Debuffs the same. Your DoTs can add some bite but generally fights will not
            last long enough. And of course you have a very good DD at level 14. But only at level 15,
            when you get channelling, can you then rely on it.</p>
            <p>This can be a fun time for a Shaman. The levelling is fast, the close community in
            Halas and Everfrost is welcoming and you don&#146;t actually have to leave the &#145;frost
            at any point in these first 18 levels (theoretically you could stay in the Frost to level
            50 but that would be an incredibly slow and tedious path).</p>
            <p>The only tough part is deciding whether to stay exclusively to the Tundra or try your
            hand at Blackburrow. I have always followed the former. Blackburrow is one of those places
            that can be impossible to play for vast periods of time. But it is the place to earn
            money. My philosophy, however, is that you don&#146;t need the money. A Shaman is happy in
            patchwork and a cracked staff to level 20 (although personally I have a fondness for the
            big two handed war-hammer sold in Halas Magic Shoppe &#150; meticulous saving with an
            untwinked character can see them gain this at level 12 from Tundra loot alone).</p>
            <p>You don&#146;t have to stay in the Tundra there are a lot of places that you can level.
            But the community in Halas, as I&#146;ve said, is close. I have always found this
            comforting &#150; almost its own little world away from the horrors of Greater Shoutdark
            or the Camping Camps of Ro.</p>
            <p>Whatever you do, enjoy it, play your &quot;hybrid fighter with a nice sting in the tail
            at the end&quot; to level 19, grab your new Healing spell and head out for wilder game. Or
            not depending on your choice.</p>
            <i><b><p>The Trying Middle Times</b></i></p>
            <p><br>
            Hell on earth this is. For myself, a player who likes to be in action and combat and have
            as little downtime as possible this level range is quite awkward. And you will spend a lot
            of your gaming life in this &quot;hole&quot;. But the Shaman <b>is</b> still effective
            &#150; the problem is it will cost you in downtime until level 24. As you had to trade off
            money against fast levelling in your Early Life you now have to trade of fun for quicker
            levels.</p>
            <p>I chose fun but there is no need to. For only five levels between 19 and 24 (when you
            get regen and canibalize) you can sit with your face in a book, popping up only to heal
            and occasionally DoT a mob. Hit 24 and again you can cannibalize effectively and greatly
            reduce the downtime if you want to burn and melee &#150; something you can still do so
            rather effectively. Depending on group balance you will always find times at this level
            that you are forced to be the main healer or even on occasion (past 24) the nuker if your
            group needs burns.</p>
            <p>The Shaman can do a lot in this time. But it can do nothing well. In a group a Shaman
            will always be wanted but often it can be a rather boring existence. Of course this will
            depend on you, some people will enjoy this. Play what you enjoy first (remember I&#146;m
            no god who must be obeyed rigidly, I just enjoy my class). If that is your priority you
            will get a lot out of the Shaman.</p>
            <p>However there is an alternative &#150; kiting.</p>
            <p>Well kiting is a touchy subject. Some people hate it, others love it. Some people will
            go from level 9 to 50 on their own kiting. Even some Shamans who can solo more effectively
            at certain levels without kiting!</p>
            <p>Its possible. It works. It can work well. Some mobs give really good solo XP (Wooly
            Mammoth &#150; calves and adults, Griffawns, Scythe Beetles. Some mobs give atrocious solo
            XP (all other Griffxxxs, all other Beetles).</p>
            <p>A simple drill. A Shaman can kite (some) adult mammoths at level 19. Just use DoTs,
            count to 42 or 120 depending whether it is disease of poison and re-apply. SoW lasts ages.
            The problem is you <b>will</b> get resisted (guard them) and sometimes you run out of mana
            (you need a &quot;track&quot; &#150; work out a path you can run, then meditate and count
            the meditation &quot;ticks&quot; before you have to run again without the mob catching
            you).</p>
            <p>But go elsewhere the kiting is far easier. Often you can do it with Direct Damage nukes
            and kill the mod faster but have a longer meditation afterwards.</p>
            <p>Is kiting the answer to powerlevelling?</p>
            <p>Yes and no. A good group, at any level, fighting the right mobs will <b>always</b>
            level faster than a solo kiting the best mobs they could be kiting. However, groups break
            up, are imbalanced, take time to form. A whole host of delays and problems can affect
            groups. This isn&#146;t the case for kiting. All you need is you and a med full of mana.</p>
            <p>So experience is faster grouped. But kiting is easier to get going. Swings and
            roundabouts. If you play 24/7 and you&#146;re just racing to 50 &#150; kite. If you
            aren&#146;t and know some good people then group. I find it fun to stay in one area for a
            good number of levels and get to know the people there. It makes forming a good group very
            fast and reduces some of the possible drawbacks that can keep a group player from
            levelling faster than a kiting player.</p>
            <p>Eventually you will hit 24 and a new Direct Damage and DoT spells. Then 29. New DoT,
            new Greater Healing, Inviibility and Ultravision (how did I manage without it!). Then
            finally you will hit 34 and the game will change forever. And how&#133;</p>
            <i><b><p>The Ascent to Power</b></i></p>
            <p>A high level Shaman is the strongest battle class in the game. There, I&#146;ve said
            it. Sure the wizards and Druids can use travel spells but that doesn&#146;t help them when
            a mob pummels them into the ground in less than 20 seconds. A Shaman can stand up to that
            barrage, hit the mob with a big drowsy, find the mob is already on its pet and then just
            apply a couple of DoT spells to help his friend finish the job.</p>
            <p>Or a Shaman can go out looking for bigger game, fine a giant at level 34 and kite it.
            Either DoT or DD or, best of all, nuke it to half then come near your pet and circle as
            your furry companion finishes off the mob that won&#146;t stop chasing you (an acquired
            technique which is great when you feel like being on your own and still noticing
            experience gain).</p>
            <p>Or a Shaman can group and in that group they can do anything, melee, heal, nuke, DoT,
            debuff. Use their pet (it makes no difference to experience gain &#150; in fact its so
            much faster usually that you get lot more experience). You name it the Shaman can do it.</p>
            <p>There is no competition for the all around ability. Other classes show more strength in
            each area (except the buffs which are now actually useful <b>in moderation</b>) but none
            can cover all the bases in the way the shaman can. You are not a tank &#150; you
            can&#146;t touch their ability at doing that. You&#146;re not a mage you can&#146;t really
            get the mana to the sort of level where you can nuke again and again and again.</p>
            <p>But you are a tankmage. A battlewizard who can cover any part of a fight, from pulling
            to healing you can fill that role (although you are <b>far</b> more effective using Togor
            instead of even <b>needing</b> a heal).</p>
            <p>This portion is the easiest for a Shaman. For sheer speed of levelling you will want to
            go to Nagafen&#146;s Lair (Solusek B renamed) but you could also group up in Lower Guk or
            perhaps go solo (near the edge of either) or out in the plains on the giants, most of
            which will be blue to near level 50.</p>
            <p>I personally recommend Solusek B. Again it&#146;s a place that builds a community like
            Everfrost or (in my time in the mid levels High Keep although I hear its not as friendly
            today) as the place is not rich with easy campable items (there are a few but if you need
            them you get them quickly). You might also find a group to go deep, into the mouth of hell
            where the Fire Giants and Lord Nagafen himself can be found.</p>
            <p>Regrettably a Shaman has yet to solo Lord Nagafen. Very disappointing.</p>
            </font><b><p ALIGN="CENTER">Overall</b><font SIZE="2"></p>
            <p>To finish (and therefore not really a summary) a few words on stats. The Shaman needs
            two. Wisdom, for mana and Dexterity, for channelling.</p>
            <p>Most casters don&#146;t realise the importance of Dexterity to channelling. Shaman, who
            have a good dexterity buff at higher levels see it plainly. When you add 40 to your Dex,
            your ability to cast through hits rises dramatically. For a battle mage this is vital, you
            must be able to cast DoTs and DD through two or three hits. With high Dexterity you can.</p>
            <p>For any new Shaman the recommendation I would make for the bonus points is 25 to Wisdom
            and 5 to Dexterity.</p>
            <p>However, and this is theory, for a <b>twinked</b> Shaman. I would suggest 25 Dexterity
            and lots of plus Wisdom items as the twink. Why? Well plus Wisdom items also tend to add
            mana as a bonus over and above the mana that the Wisdom adds anyway. Dexterity items
            don&#146;t?</p>
            <p>So say you want to add 25 points of dexterity and 25 points of Wisdom. Adding 25 points
            in Wisdom items is probably good for 40 mana. Adding the 25 dex is good for 0 mana
            (remember this is in addition to the mana wisdom adds). So by putting the points in Dex
            and using plus Wisdom (and mana) items, the Shaman has more overall mana than one who has
            the higher base Wisdom but has to sacrifice clothing slots for Dexterity items.</p>
            <p>It&#146;s a theory and I would be interested in finding out from anyone who does this
            the benefits. They would have excellent channelling right from level 15.</p>
            <p>In closing, I want to re-iterate. More than anything have fun with your Shaman. They
            are the most rounded character in the game and therefore capable of giving a lot in return
            for your time. The ability to always be involved but also save the day with a heal or a
            nuke is something that I have enjoyed constantly and still do.</p>
            <p>These are all my thoughts, they aren&#146;t gospel, you may read it differently. But as
            far as I can tell this is based on real game experience. And its fun.<br>
