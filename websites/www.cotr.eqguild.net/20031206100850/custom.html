	    <FONT SIZE="2"><!--begin text_1-->Well, here's the thing... you don't. Someone has to power-level you. You need a friend who will take time out (a high-level friend) spending time healing and buffing you or to have two accounts on two computers and the coordination to heal, buff and stay out of the way while your character kills the MOBS and advances at a blistering rate. Druids are the only pure power-levelers..... though you can use a Cleric, Paladin to some extent or possibly a Monk to feign pull or a Shaman for super buffing. And this works? Gimme a break! You are better off twinking (twinking is taking a low-level character and loading them up with high-level gear) a character and just going along at the normal pace (but stronger and faster than others at your level).<br><br>Here's a good method: create a strong base character, use a higher level character of your own or a friends to get her twink gear (try the fungi tunic for starters...it will run you about 30-80K on most servers since it's been nerfed to an extremely rare drop) and a good weapon. Then just play the game. You will advance. Don't die. Play. Be smart. You will sail through you teens and twenties and thirties and when you are in the forties, group, get exp and good loot and enjoy the money rolling in. <br><br><!--end text_1--></FONT></P>

<B>What about the first 10 levels??</b><br><p align="left">They are the easiest. Here's why:<br><br>- Characters no longer lose experience for death below level 11 <br>- Characters now begin first level with a stack of 20 food and drink <br>- Items no longer appear on a corpse if you are below level 10, they reappear with the character <br>
- When a character "dings" level 10 you will be informed that your items will now be on your corpse <br>
- New resurrection, evacuate and corpse summoning spells have been added at lower levels <br>
- We've moved the newbie bind points closer to where characters first start out, not outside in their newbie areas <br>
- Halflings and Gnomes have new classes available to them: Halfling Rangers and Paladins as well as Gnome ShadowKnights and Paladins. All of the necessary NPCs and items should be available for these new classes.<br>

		<FONT SIZE="2"><!--begin text_5-->In Padrino's guide he suggests that you try all of these goofball quests like the Bone Chips Quest or the Fire-Beetle Eye Quest. Do not waste your time. You will do the same amount of leveling at the same amount of time just by logically advancing in the game (meaning from West Freeport killing rats to East Commons killing spiderlings and wolfs bears and rattlesnakes, to West Commons to killing asps, lionesses and Dervish, to Befallen (for a whole host of MOBS at various levels) etc.). As long as you are twinked (and that is the key) you will burst through your first ten levels like a rocket. <br><br>The game is not designed as a solo game and really isn't much fun if you play it that way. ( I personally sometimes enjoy playing solo, but that's what I have a Druid for.) Still, it is possible to play solo, particularly if you play a Druid, Necromancer or Monk. You can't actually power-level yourself though. You can give yourself better odds by twinking yourself out with great gear but the process of leveling is just as time-consuming (particularly in hell levels and as you gain levels). <br><br><!--end text_5--></FONT>

	       <FONT SIZE="2"><!--begin text_4-->Everyone wants to know where to go and what to hunt. Here's a list of places you can go that are divided up by level. Now remember, if you ask a dozen people about what the best place is to go at certain levels...you will get a dozen different answers. Everything here is a complication of my opinion, the opinions of my guild-mates, friends, things I've read on fan sites, on bulletin boards and people who have written to me.<br><br><b>Level 1-5:</b> the newbie zone wherever you happen to begin<br><br>Kill everything in the zone until you are level 5 then move out into the world.<br><br><b>Level 5-8:</b> East Commonlands <br><br>
Some folks say EverFrost is a good zone for this level or even Steamfont. It really depends on your race. You can't beat the safety level however in that there are plenty of Inns and guards to run to if you get overwhelmed. I leveled every single one of my characters in East Commons... The orc camps rock...<br>
<br>
<b>Level 8-12: </b>North Ro<br>
<br>
You can do really well in North Ro killing dervs, scarabs, spiders and snakes for quite some time but you can also try Sister Island in the Ocean of Tears (if you are an evil race and don't mind losing wood elf faction), as well as Steamfont and Everfrost. Befallen is not unheard of at these levels (in a group at least or just the first level.) <b> we also do our powerleveling sessions here for levels 13-20.</b><br>
<br>
<b>Level 12-15:</b> Oasis, West Commonlands, Unrest<br>
<br>
The world is really opening up to you now, get into Befallen, go to Oasis and kill orcs, try Unrest and get rid of the yard trash (beetles, jackolanterns, zombies). In Everfrost try the mammoth calves or more orcs. There are areas on Luclin too which are good for this level like Hollowshade Moore (which is best with a group), Shadeweavers Thicket (Vah Shir newbie zone) and the Paludal Caverns which is right off of Shadow Haven.<br>

	       <FONT SIZE="2"><!--begin text_6--><p align="left"> <b>Level 15-18:</b> Oasis of Marr, Lake Rathetear & Rathe Mountains, Crushbone, Lake of Ill Omen<br><br>Try Aviaks in Lake Rathe and crocs, caimans and orcs in Oasis. Crushbone gets better at higher teens and early 20's. Once you are around level 20 there will be places to go on Luclin and in Kunark as well as the rest of the world. Lake of Ill Omen is awesome exp killing sabertooth and sarnaks.<br><br><b>Level 18-22:</b> South Karana, Highpass Hold, Lake of Ill Omen</b><br>
<br>
Splitpaw is good, treants, orcs in Highpass Hold and you can even stay in Lake Rathe or Oasis into your 20's. Then definitely head out to the Lake of Ill Omen in Kunark where you can go from 22 to 30. There are also several places on Luclin like Echo Caverns or the Grimling Forest which although small and a bit dangerous can offer great experience. Evil races can head to the Warsliks Woods in Kunark and group together in The Overthere. (Warslick woods has some of the same loot at the giant fort that FM has at a lower level).<br>
<br>
<b>Level 22-30:</b> Castle Mistmoore, Lake of Ill Omen, Highpass Keep<br>
<br>
You can even backtrack a bit through places like Unrest. It used to be that once you hit level 30 you will enter your first hell level and want to make sure you are making informed decisions on where to hunt. <B>That hell level no longer exists</b><br>

You can also hop back to Castle Mistmoore, clear out Crushbone, visit Splitpaw and of course venture into Upper Guk and Solusek's Eye. Most of these places though you should have a group.<br><br><b>Level 35-40: </b>Butcherblock (if you don't care about dwarf faction), City of Mist</b><br>
<br>
Be warned though in regards to the City of Mist, you will need a group to go in further than the entrance. You can kill dwarves in Butcherblock, but honestly I like the little guys and could never do it. There are places on Luclin, in Kunark and even Velious that are available to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 40-50:</b> Permafrost, Timorous Deep, DSP<br>
<br>
Solo Spirocs in TD and kill Ice Giants in Permafrost for good loot and lots of platinum. You can group just about anywhere in the world now. With groups you can go to Lower Guk, Kedge Keep, Crystal Caverns in Velious and all of the planes on raids.<br>
