<P>Hello! I have a friend who spent about 2 years playing Everquest frequently, compiling knowledge, and testing out different areas to level in.&nbsp;He&nbsp;has managed to get his high elf enchanter from level 1 to 34 in 7 days recently because of&nbsp;his knowledge of the best places to level in the game! Just 7 days. On top of&nbsp; THAT,&nbsp;he got his jewelcraft skill from 1 to 250 in just 2 DAYS!!!!!<STRONG>&nbsp;<FONT color=#336600>This will show YOU how to do it TOO!</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>Read on, grasshopper...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Section 1 (Misc. Starting Strategies for Each Stat.)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;<STRONG>Strength:</STRONG></FONT> As a caster don't mess with strength. Your points are better spent on intelligence or wisdom. For all melee classes, (bard, ranger, rogue, paladin, shadow knight, warrior, monk, and beastlord) I recommend that you put all of your starting bonus points into strength. Strength increases your ATK rating, which is how often you hit mobs, whether or not you hit for full damage, and how much your max damage is. For example if you compare 2 bards with the same equipment, of the same level, and one has strength 70 and the other with strength 160, the first bard (with the low strength) will hit in a string of 8 attacks for 22, 12, 9, 3, 17, 21, 10, and 13. The second bard, (the one with high strength) will likely hit for more damage each hit, and a higher maximum damage, like 20, 25, 28, 19, 20, 15, 27, and 29. See the difference? The strength bonus effects many factors, like how often you successfully hit, how high your maximum damage is, and also high strength keeps you from hitting for those wimpy 7 damage and 5 damage combat rounds. It makes you buff. lol. Also you can carry the heavy armor required for tanks. Oh and also, the higher your strength the higher you learn many of your offensive skills, like piercing and 1hs 1hb and so on... Caster classes don't need to worry about strength. Trust me.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;Stamina:</FONT></STRONG> As a caster I might put some points into stamina. Stamina affects how many hit points you have. It gets more noticable at the higher levels. Many a good tank has told me that he had wished he'd put 5 or 10 points into stamina when he created, along with strength. I think someone told me that each stamina point is about 5-7hp at the higher levels like 55 through 60. The extra hp would make it worth putting 5 or 10 points into stamina if you are a melee class. Also effects how long you can hold your breath underwater.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;<STRONG>Dexterity for Casters:</STRONG></FONT> Dexterity is supposed to be a very good stat for <BR>casters. I have heard that it effects spell fizzles and how often your spells are interrupted, but I can't say I've seen proof of either.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Dexterity for Tanks:</FONT></STRONG> Dexterity directly affects how often your magic weapons process their magical effects. For example the bloodpoint spear is <BR>does a 60 point lifetap when you get to level (50 I think?) The higher your dex, the more often it procs that effect, hence more damage. Supposedly dex also effects how often you hit, I have heard. I have also heard from a few people that high dex on a warrior effects how often he scores critical hits in combat, and crippling blows when severely wounded.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Dexterity for Bards:</FONT></STRONG> If you see the line, "A missed note brings JohnQbard's song to a close" that is because his dexterity is bad, I think. I seem to remember reading somewhere that it makes your songs last longer.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;Agility for Tanks:</FONT></STRONG> Agility affects how often you are hit in combat, and it <BR>gives you a small ac bonus. Many believe that this is more important than <BR>strength, but I don't think the benefits are that great. At high levels, you get maybe 3 armor class for every 5 agility. Nothing special. The armor class bonus helps you get hit for less damage, but it's not worth the loss of strength if you're debating putting points into agility instead of strength when you create a new character. I mean it's nice to get hit less. Very nice, but strength is nicer.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000066>&nbsp;<STRONG>Agility for Casters:</STRONG></FONT> Agility is nice for a caster to keep you from getting hit. It depends on whether you'd rather get hit slightly less often or you'd rather have your spells be interrupted less whether you choose this over dex or not. Personally, as any caster I would choose dex.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000066>&nbsp;Intelligence:</FONT></STRONG> TANKS leave this stat for the casters... Intelligence is the prime stat for Necromancers, Magicians, Enchanters and Wizards. You should put all your points into intelligence if you are making one of these classes. Intelligence gives MANA! Mana is the most important thing for the <BR>above listed classes beyond the shadow of a DOUBT! Trust me on this one, guys an gals, mana, mana, mana, mana... MANA! You should aim for 200 intelligence if you can. After 200, the mana bounus is negligible, unless they changed it. If you have any bonus points left over, put them into dex or agility, whichever you prefer, unless you are an enchanter. Read the charisma section to see why enchanters should pick charisma instead. Intelligence also effects how fast you raise many skills, like jewelcraft, swimming, pottery, many of your spells, and most trade skills.</P>
<P><STRONG>&nbsp;<FONT color=#000099>Charisma:</FONT></STRONG> Charisma is only important for Enchanters, Shadow Knights, and Bards. Bards have many songs which mesmerize opponents, charm them, or make them flee in panic. Charisma effects both how often these songs are resisted, and possibly the duration of these songs. Enchanters spells are the same. They cause a mob to be either charmed, mesmerized, or terrorized. For a Shadow Knight, one of his most important strategies is to cast terror on the mob to make it run away, then ensnare it so it flees really slowly, then send in your pet to hammer at its back while you hammer at it some, too. So as you can see charisma is important for all three of these classes. Maybe put 5 or 10 points into charisma if you are any of the three. Now that I think of it, Necromancers use this fear-snare tactic as well, so you may want to try charisma for them as well.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;Wisdom:</FONT></STRONG> Wisdom is the primary stat for Druids, Clerics, and Shamans. It is also a secondary stat for Rangers, Beastlords and Paladins. Wisdom simply affects how much mana you have. As a Druid, Cleric, or shaman, put all points into wisdom, because it's your main source of mana. If you have points left over, put them into stamina agility or dexterity. As a Paladin, Ranger, or Beastlord, put about 5 or 10 into wisdom. Wisdom also effects how often you succeed at trade skill attempts which keeps you from loosing money on failed attempts to make those velium blue diamond bracelets which sell for 2k with a cost to make of about 1k per attempt.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Section 2 (Group levelling spots and strategies.)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P><FONT color=#000066><STRONG>&nbsp;Levels 1-5:</STRONG></FONT> I'm a creature of habit, and I don't know much about levelling in places besides my favorites. At these lower levels, even if I'm an iksar or an ogre, I tend to leave my home ground and go to West Freeport to level, even though the guards are dangerous if you don't know how to avoid them. West Freeport is a great place to get from level 1 to 5 in about 1 or 2 hours. Make sure you bind at the gate because if you get killed you go all the way back home, and that's never good. If you don't want to go all the way to Freeport because you are new to the game, or because you're afraid of getting killed along the way, each starting city has newbie mobs outside it <BR>for you to level on from 1 til 5.</P>
<P><FONT color=#000099><STRONG>&nbsp;5-11:</STRONG></FONT> If you are in the East Commonlands area, fight rattlesnakes, pumas, leaf scarabs, woodland lions, and lionesses. Good for solo or groups. Once <BR>you get to level 7, group at the orc camps in East Commons for some decent loot and exp. If you are in the Kelethin/Gfay area, go to orc hill once you hit level 5, and kill orc centurions that wander outside Crushbone, then at level 7 go inside Crushbone and join a group.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>11-14:</FONT></STRONG> Northern Desert of Ro. There are three Dervish Cutthroat camps in this zone. Try to get into a group at one of these. Even if you have to wait 10 or 15 minutes to get into a good group, the experience is good. Paludal Caverns is also good from 11 to 14 if you can find a lowbie group there, or <BR>solo very well.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;14-17:</FONT></STRONG> Orc Highway in Oasis!!! Awesome Experience! Join a group fighting the orc warriors that wander here. I got my enchanter from 14 to 20 in 1 or 2 evenings. The experience is as I said, really good. Paludal Caverns also is good from 14 to 17.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;18-28:</FONT></STRONG> Paludal Caverns! This is a no-brainer. Join any group there fighting <BR>recondite bandits and you're in for extremely fast levelling .If you don't have Luclin, stay at Orc Highway til 20, then move on to Highkeep. My enchanter levelled in Highkeep, and got from 20 to 34 in about 3 or 4 days. <BR>Lake of Ill Omen is pretty good, but nothing compared to those two. Lake is only good til about 30, but Highkeep is good until as high as 39. The best <BR>spot to level in Highkeep is the Warrior room, so if you hear someone shouting "war room needs more" send them a tell, because that exp is the best in the zone. Once you get to about 34 or 35 you will need to move on to raider room til around 39, but the spawns there are slow, so if I were you I would move on at 34 to the next secion of the guide.&nbsp; Loot is really good here too. The only drawback to Highkeep is that it is really overcrowded <BR>most of the time so you'll have trouble getting a group during peak times. If you have Luclin, you should be leaving Paludal caverns for highkeep at about 27 or 28, then leaving Highkeep at 34 or 35 for...</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000066>&nbsp;34-40:</FONT></STRONG> Ulthorks in East Wastes. Excellent exp from 34 to 44. Also, Sol A! Very hard to get a group in Sol A, but it's the best exp in the game from 30 to 44. Fight the gnomes and clockwork gnomes. Bad faction hits with the gnomes of Norrath, so check to see if you need them for your epic or other <BR>quests before killing them. Also try Dawnshroud peaks or maru seru grouped. Great Luclin experience bonus.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;40-50:</FONT></STRONG> Dreadlands is pretty good, fighting the giants, Drachnids, and the Drolvargs in groups. DL will take you all the way to 50. Karnors, attached to Dreadlands, is better than Dreadlands from 45 to 50.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;50 to 60:</FONT></STRONG> Many many places to group from 50 to 60. Many good loots in all of them too. Howling Stones (Charasis) is probably one of the best, but Sebelis is pretty good too. Another good place to level from 50 to 60 is Velketor's Labyrinth. I have been recently told that Scarlet Desert is the best exp in the game from 50 to 60, (on the moon of course), but I have also heard many people rave about Maiden's Eye and Fungus Grove. (Also on the moon.) Planes of Power has many good places but not sure where yet because I don't have the expansion yet. I hear that Plane of Justice is possible to Solo, and with Dire charm I'd say it would be very good. </P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Section 3 (Enchanter Group levelling tips.)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#000099><STRONG>Rule number one for an enchanter...</STRONG></FONT> When you aren't casting a spell, sit <BR>down. You regen mana much faster.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<FONT color=#000099><STRONG>Rule number two...</STRONG></FONT> If you join a group, make sure the other members are no more than 2 levels higher than you up until around level 30, when you don't want to group with anyone more than 4 or 5 levels above you. This gives you more experience per kill. In Paludal Caverns, the mobs give such INSANE experience that it doesn't really matter, but other zones, yes follow this rule for max exp gains. If you can group with people LOWER than you, DO IT. One of the golden rules for levelling ANY class.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000066>Enchanters are very important to any group.</FONT></STRONG> They can mesmerize mobs at level 4, and root at level 8. Both these spells are essential in keeping adds under control. (An add is when more than one or two mobs attacks the group.) If you root it to the ground, your tanks can just move over to where it can't reach them, but most tanks are big and dumb so you have to tell them right after you root the mob... (Tell your group members on the group channel something like "An Orc centurion has meen ROOTED! Back away!") Mesmerize is pretty useful as well, but like root, you have to tell the tanks when you mezz a mob so they don't smack it and knock it out of mezz right after you cast it. A good thing to say to the group right before you mezz an add is this, "MEZZING an orc warrior!!! DON'T BREAK MEZZ!!!"</P>
<P>&nbsp;If you find that a mob resists your root or mez, USE TASHAN (level 4). <BR>Tashan lowers a mob's magic resistance so that your spells have a better chance to land.</P>
<P>&nbsp;At level 12 you get languid pace (30% slow), and Ebbing strength (25 point strength debuff). Use these spells religeously on every mob your group encounters. A slow mob hits your friends less, so you are kind of like a cleric or druid because the tanks have more hit points left at the end of a <BR>fight. Keep in mind that Shamans do get better slows that enchanters, so if <BR>there's a shaman in the group let him take care of the slows for you. If <BR>they aren't doing their part to slow the mob, tell them this, "Slowed mob + Hasted tanks = DEAD MOB." That should get their attention and they should start using their really powerful slows on the enemies. If they're the main healer don't even bother asking them to slow mobs just take over for them, because they are the lifeblood of the group.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;At level 16 you get Breeze, quickness, enthrall, and esmerization...</FONT></STRONG> EVERYONE WILL LOVE YOU NOW!!! Lol. Cast Breeze on all the casters in the group. It makes their mana regenerate faster, meaning more heal spells for the clerics druids and shamans to save the tanks with, and more direct damage spells for the wizards and magicians. Necromancers like breeze too. Of course you can breeze yourself so you get more mana to cast slows and strength debuffs on mobs, also more mana for mezz and root. Quickness is a haste spell, so your tanks attack the mobs 30% faster. When the mobs are slowed by 30%, and the tanks are hasted by 30%, can you say DEAD MOB? I knew you could hehe. Enthrall is the next in line after mesmerize. It has a longer duration so you don't have to cast it quite so often on the mobs you mezz, so you can ditch mesmerize and start using enthrall now. Mesmerization is a research spell that's kind of hard to get, but it mesmerizes all enemies in an area, so if you suddenly see 5 new mobs attacking the group, you can mezz them all at once with this one. Just have to be careful not to be too close to the group of mobs you are mezzing with mesmerization because it hits you too, and you become mesmerized if you're not careful.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>At level 20 you get Feckless might and Tashani,</FONT></STRONG> another strength debuff like ebbing strength. I believe it debuffs their strength by 20, just like ebbing strength, and they stack on top of each other so you can cast them both. I personally had a hard time slowing each mob and then casting ebbing strength on them, THEN casting feckless might, so I usually just used slow to conserve mana for mezzes after this point, only strength debuffing them <BR>when I had extra mana... always try to save up plenty of mana for roots and <BR>mezzes so you can save your groups butt if they get in trouble. I can't stress this enough that you should save plenty of mana for mezzes and roots. Yes root is still a good spell. It always will be because it cannot be broken as easily as mezz. Also Tashani is pretty good. It's an upgrade to Tashan, which doesn't really work as a magic debuff anymore at level 20, so it's good that you get an upgrade. :)</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;24 is another pretty good level for enchanters.</FONT></STRONG> They get tepid deeds, which is a research spell so it's kind of hard to get, but it's a 50% slow, so you can get rid of languid pace once you get it, and it's also really powerful. Also you get alacrity at this level. Alacrity is a 40% haste buff so you can throw out that old quickness and speed your tanks up really nice.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Level 29...</FONT></STRONG> The second truly proud level for an enchanter. You get clarity <BR>at this level. The upgrade to breeze, clarity regens mana even faster, so keep using it on those casters in your group. Also you get Enstill, which is the upgrade to root. A longer duration, and less chance for it to break if the mob is hit by a big direct damage spell. Feedback is a 263 point damage-over-time spell, which is pretty useful if you just want to throw one on the mob at the beginning of the combat to help finish off mobs a little quicker, but I mostly had to conserve mana for haste/slow/root/mezzes. I occasionally threw in a 288 point direct damage spell, anarchy, but those <BR>come in at the next level... level 34.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>---- At 34</FONT></STRONG> you get enchant platinum which is very good for aspiring jewelcrafters because you can get all the way to level 250 in jewelcrafting <BR>without ever leaving platinum jewelry... The cost is high at about 15k <BR>platinum to take Jewelcrafting all the way up to 250, but if you have the money, and some intelligence higher than 200 you can raise your Jewelcraft <BR>skill to 250 in about 2 or 3 days. Believe me it's worth it. I have earned 30k-60k profit per week with the same character I keep mentioning, and I <BR>never levelled her past 34. I just go to Thurgadin, buy about 50 bars of <BR>velium, pay a level 60 enchanter about 10pp per bar to enchant them for me, only giving them to him 5 at a time so I don't get ripped off for everything I have ONLY GIVE HIM/HER 5 BARS AT A TIME, then I go to East Commons and auction for a few days til I'm out of bars. Now there's Bazaar, so go there instead. Some nights I'll do as high as 15k in sales, other nights only 5k. I'll have more on the jewelcraft trade later in this guide. ----</P>
<P>&nbsp;Entrance is an upgrade to enthrall that you get at this level. Has an even LONGER duration. Insipid weakness is a 51 point strength debuff that you get at 34 also. I think you have to get rid of ebbing strength when you start <BR>using this one (If you do still strength debuff them. I found that at this level I was mostly saving mana for mezz and AE mesmerization, while using the rest of the mana for clarity on the casters, alacrity on the melee classes, and slow on the mobs. Remember Shaman slow is much better, if that Shaman has the highest level slow spell for their level. But remember not everyone is rich so some Shamans can't afford to research the best slow for their level, in which case you should ask them what level their slow spell is and if yours is higher, keep on slowin them mobs. Also at level 34 you get Rune 3. This spell makes you a mild healer if you have the extra mana and jaspers to use it. Just make sure you have plenty of jaspers on you and cast it on someone being attacked by a mob. It absorbs 233 points of melee damage, which is just as good as a 233 point heal.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I never levelled my enchanter past 34 because I stopped to get my jewelcraft to 250 and it only took me 3 days, so I got addicted to selling <BR>my jewelry and getting rich. Here are the new spells you get at each level, <BR>to keep you from having to look them up later.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>39:</FONT></STRONG> At 39 you get a new haste called celerity that gives 50% attack speed bonus, and a new root spell called immobilize. There's a spell called insight that you should cast on all the wis and int casters in your group. It is an intelligence and wisdom buff, and wis and int = more mana.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>At 44</FONT></STRONG> you get another wis and int buff called brilliance (might have a small mana regen on this one but can't remember), also enchant velium for those of you who don't want to pay 10pp to have someone else enchant your velium for you. Boon of garou is a very good spell you get at level 44 that gives 100 agility to a single target. This gives them a much higher chance to evade attacks from an enemy. New Tashan spell at this level also, called Tashania.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;At 49</FONT></STRONG> you get a new mezz spell called dazzle, with longer duration (of course) than entrance. Gasping embrace is a 710 point debuff DoT that is <BR>also worth mentioning at this level. Also a 60% haste spell is learned at this level called swift like the wind. Paralyzing earth is the new root spell, it can last up to 3 minutes. Awesome spell.</P>
<P>&nbsp;<STRONG><FONT color=#000099>Theft of Thought comes at 51,</FONT></STRONG> this is a goody that drains up to 400 mana from a target and gives it to you. Nice.&nbsp;Level 52 brings with it boon of the clear mind which is a group clarity, and Rune 5, which is a 700 point damage absorber like its predecessors.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;At 53</FONT></STRONG> you get Aanyah's quickening which is a 64% haste.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#000099>&nbsp;At 54</FONT></STRONG> you get Clarity 2, you know what that's good for. Mana mana mana mana mana MANA MAN!</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>&nbsp;OK! If you get to this level, you no longer need my help, and I'm tired of typing these spells out! Lol. Sorry. No more spells for you. Just follow the strategies I suggest and you'll be a valuable asset to any group you join.</FONT></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Section 4 (Enchanter Jewelcraft tips)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>&nbsp;Jewelcraft is without a doubt the most profitable of all tradeskills! I started a High elf Enchanter at level 1, and bought him about 5k worth of intelligence equipment to boost my int up to 200, and levelled from 1 to 34 in 1 week!!!!! If you follow my levelling guide in section 2, you can get to <BR>34 in about the same amount of time.</P>
<P>&nbsp;The jewelcraft tips below can be done even at level 1, but I don't recommend working on Jewelcraft until you are 34. The reason, is because although you can practice jewelcraft to 250 without enchanting the bars, the <BR>merchant will pay you more money for the enchanted item. You make a LOT of pieces from 200 to 250 skill, so I'd recommend you enchant those bars. If each enchanted item you sell to the vendor from 200 to 250 gives about 5pp profit on average, and you sell back about 300 items. You will gain about 1500pp. Unenchanted, you will loose about 5pp per piece made.</P>
<P>&nbsp;First you must make sure you have charisma up to about 150 or 170 so you can sell the items you've made back to the vendors for maximum prices. Next, you need about 10k in the bank.&nbsp; Keep in mind that it only costs 2,000 to 3,000pp to get to 200 skill, so if you are on a low budget you can use these tips, and still make a decent profit making platinum and gold jewelry and selling it to people at a good profit until you get enough platinum pieces to finance raising your skill up to 250.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Anyway, once you get set up and ready to practice, go to your guild and put 20 practice points into jewelcraft skill. Next, find the jewelry store in <BR>your town and buy about 5 silver bars and 5 bloodstones. Make sure that you switch to your intelligence equipment to max out your intelligence before you begin to practice the skill, then put one silver bar into your jeweller's kit, and 1 bloodstone, then click combine. Once this item becomes trivial at skill level 26, you will get the message "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item." When this happens use the chart below in Section 5, making the next item, silver onyx, until it becomes trivial, and so on until 250.</P>
<P>&nbsp;At first, there is no need to enchant the metals. Just make the items, switch to your charisma equipment to get charisma high enough that platinum bars only cost 105pp, and rubies cost 131pp, then sell the items you just made back to the vendor. Once you start on gold star ruby rings, it becomes necessary to enchant the metals so you don't loose serious money when you fail an attempt. (star rubies cost around 70 or 80pp as I recall so it's kind of painful to fail on those.) Don't forget to switch to your intelligence equipment before you practice skill, and then back to charisma items before you sell them back and buy new supplies. There is also a level 34 enchanter spell called radiant visage which buffs your charisma by 20 points so this helps too. Here is a good list of charisma items and their avarage price to make, so try to get these from another master jeweller before you begin...</P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>velium cateye necklace</FONT> +10Cha costs about 263pp to make</P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>electrum star ruby rings</FONT> +5Dex +7Cha about 80-100pp to make</P>
<P><FONT color=#000099>a crude stein</FONT>&nbsp; +15Cha can be purchased in east commons for about 25pp to 50pp</P>
<P><FONT color=#000066>Velium Star Ruby Veil</FONT>&nbsp; +10Cha +10Dex costs about 350pp to make. This should be all the charisma items you'll need.</P>
<P>Remember there is no need to start enchanting the metals until you get to 199 skill. This is when a single failure on golden star ruby rings can cost you 90pp. You can sell them back to the vendor for about 89pp, unenchanted, <BR>but enchanted, they sell for about 94pp. You make a tiny profit that can save you from going poor if you fail a lot.</P>

<P><STRONG><FONT color=#ff0000>Section 6 (After Grand Mastery.)</FONT></STRONG></P>
<P>WOW! That didn't take very long at all did it?!?!? LOL. This is why I love the jewelcraft trade. Now go to Thurgadin and buy some bars of velium, <BR>making sure you have your charisma items on for the cheapest price. (The cheapest I've managed to get Velium bars for was 262pp. If you don't know how to get to Thurgadin, I will tell you.</P>
<P>Get a friendly wizard or druid to port you to Great Divide, then use your sense heading skill until you find North. Go North until you hit the wall, then turn right and continue to follow the wall until you come to the end of a crystalline colored stream that runs all the way from one end of the zone to the other. Thurgadin is directly at the end of that stream hidden behind a waterfall that is not visible on some computers. There should be someone inside Thurgadin friendly enough to show you to the bank and the Jewelry store, but if there's not, there are plenty of maps of Thurgadin online. <A href="http://www.eqatlas.com">Http://www.eqatlas.com</A> has a map for pretty much every zone, so go there if you need a map.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Ok, now that you've spent almost all your money on the bars, you need to <BR>enchant them. Do a /who all enchanter, and see if you find any in Thurgadin. <BR>There is usually someone in Thurgadin who is happy to enchant the bars for <BR>me, if I pay them the minimal fee of 10pp per bar. If there aren't any in Thurgadin, just send them tells asking for velium bar enchants and you'll eventually be able to meet up with one. I'd suggest you go to Bazaar to get <BR>it done.</P>
<P>&nbsp;Now, on to the specifics of the trade...</P>
<P>&nbsp;Here are my most highly sought after items, their stats, and the price I usually charge for them. These prices are fair, and they keep you making a <BR>hefty profit, although most other 250 jewellers charge more than me for some reason...</P>
<P>&nbsp;NOTE: I usually charge double the cost to make, for platinum or velium items because they fail more often than the lesser metals. Example: platinum <BR>Ruby Veil is a 7str 7wis mask. the platinum bar cost me 105pp from the <BR>store, and the ruby was 131pp. Cost to make is 236pp, so you should sell for 472pp. I'm a nice guy though so I sell mine for 400. Silver star rose rings and other small things that cost me next to nothing to make, I usually just give away.</P>
