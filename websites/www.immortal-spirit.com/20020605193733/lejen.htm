<p align="left"><font face="Dauphin" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">Lejen was born the 4th in a
litter of 9.&nbsp; He enjoyed his young life amongst his brothers and sisters within the
safe walls of Var Shal.&nbsp; He grew fast and sadly he watched as his family diminished
little by little.&nbsp; His parents would die in battle with the Grimlings and so would
many of his siblings.&nbsp; The ones that did not battle died of rare diseases that
inflicted them.&nbsp; Yet somehow Lejen would survive.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Dauphin" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">As the long battles against
the Grimlings began to slow, Lejen decided that he would journey afar to let his mind
stray from all that he has lost.&nbsp; He journeyed to the Lands of Norrtah where he met
Cerryn, a human.&nbsp; Cerryn would guide him and with this guidance he would learn that
his luck in survival was not luck at all, but rather a divine calling.&nbsp; He was
immortal, as was Cerryn.&nbsp; He could not die... of course his life could be stifled
momentarily, but eventually his soul would return and he would rise again, to fight on.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Dauphin" size="3" color="#C0C0C0">So he decided he would find
other like himself.&nbsp; Those that could not die.&nbsp; Together they would forge an
empire of friends... they would become a family of immortals.&nbsp; They would become
Immortal Spirit.</font></p>
