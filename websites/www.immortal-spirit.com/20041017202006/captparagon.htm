<p align="left">Simon Cross was a renowned scientist specializing in energy and electrical
emmissions.&nbsp; Working for the Pargon City Police after the Rikti Invasion, Simon was
developing a prototype power armor to assist the Police in combating the villains of
Paragon City.&nbsp; After a year of hard work and millions of dollars he had finished the
protoype armor and was preparing to field test if for the police.&nbsp; Unfortunately a
competing agency who was also developing a prototype power armor decided to eliminate the
competition...</p>

<p align="left">On one fateful day, Simon was working late making last minute preparations
on the armor.&nbsp; Suddenly a loud boom echoed off the walls of his lab and the main
doors collapsed.&nbsp; Several 5th Column Soldiers stormed into the room.&nbsp; One ran up
to Simon and kicked him in the head knocking him to the ground.&nbsp; Barely conscious he
watched as the soldiers set several bombs around his lab, set the timers, and swiftly
departed.&nbsp; Simon crawled as best he could to try to get to the bombs, but the blow to
his head left him extremely groggy.&nbsp; Seconds passed like days... and as the final
beep of the timer sounded, Simon prayed...</p>

<p align="left">Simon awoke in a hospital bed.&nbsp; He did not know the time or day... or
how he survived for that matter.&nbsp; A young lady stood beside him.&nbsp; Her blonde
hair swayed gently in the breeze from the open window.&nbsp; It was Alex, his assistant.
&nbsp; They spoke quietly for some time.&nbsp; He learned that he had been unconcious for
almost a week.&nbsp; His lab was destroyed.&nbsp; All his documents, computers, and
equipment we destroyed... save one.&nbsp; The prototype!</p>

<p align="left">With all documentation destroyed, nobody could figure out how to operate
the power armor Simon had developed.&nbsp; The Paragon City Police backed out on the
purchase as all equipment and documents of the project had been destroyed.&nbsp; Simon
recovered after a few more weeks and was able to retrieve the prototype and return it to
his private lab.&nbsp; He discovered that it had barely any damage at all and was still
operational once the power pack had been recharged.&nbsp; He donned the armor and tested
all its functions, it wtill worked properly.&nbsp; And so it was then that he decided to
use the armor to hunt down his attackers.&nbsp; Those that had almost ruined his life and
career.&nbsp; He assumed the identity of Cold Volt and entered the streets of Paragon.</p>

<p align="left">It had been a few months.&nbsp; He had stopped numerous crimes yet still
had learned so little of the true source of his attackers.&nbsp; The 5th Column were
stubborn with their information and resistant in relinquishing it to him.&nbsp; So he
decided to attempt to modify&nbsp; his armor to make it more powerful so he could attempt
to delve deeper into the headquarter of the 5th Column.&nbsp; Here his life would change
once again...</p>

<p align="left">Simon had just installed a new flight system.&nbsp; It had a tendency to
overheat though, so he had to modify the cooling system.&nbsp; A misplaced wire would
cause the power pack to explode sending thousands of volts of electricity through his
body.&nbsp; He was unconcious again... He would awaken a few days later.&nbsp; He felt
odd.&nbsp; A strange sensation rippled through his muscles... muscles?!&nbsp; His clothes
lie ripped on the floor.&nbsp; Bulging muscles covered his body.&nbsp; He felt energetic
and powerful.&nbsp; He knew something was odd so he called Alex and they began some tests
the following day.&nbsp; Simon discovered that when the experiemtnal power pack exploded
the electrical field generated by the explosion fused with his body's cells and tissue.
&nbsp; Small electrical impulses surged through every cell of his body, working each
muscle as though he was constantly excersizing.&nbsp; This explained his new body build
and also his new power.&nbsp; Through time Simon discovered that he could channel the
energy stored in his body and convert it into a kinetic force expelled through his hands.
&nbsp; It made for a powerful punch.&nbsp; The energy within his body worked in wondrous
ways, healing wounds rapidly and toughening his skin.&nbsp; He was powerful even without
his power armor.</p>

<p align="left">Simon decided that further experimentation was needed.&nbsp; But in the
meantime he would test out his new powers in the fight against crime.&nbsp; WIth his new
appearance and powers he decided to assume a new identity once again.&nbsp; And so he
became Capt Paragon.</p>
