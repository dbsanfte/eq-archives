<p align="left"><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Immortal Spirit is a casual Super Group on the Infinity Server.
&nbsp; By casual we mean that members are not expected to play everyday or numerous hours
per week.&nbsp; The general idea is to enjoy the game and to enjoy it with friends
whenever possible.&nbsp; Immortal Spirit does stress the importance of team play however,
after all what is the point of an MMOG if one is alone all the time.&nbsp; We as a Super
Group tend to try to help each other whenever possible even if it means sacrificing a good
xp team or somethng similar.&nbsp; Currently the majority of Immortal Spirit plays in the
CDT and EST timezones.&nbsp; Most play during the early evenings and late evenings. &nbsp;
As we are still building our number base of active players, we only average about 5-10
players online at peak hours.&nbsp; Hopefully this will change with the addition of new
members.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Immortal Spirit is RP friendly, although RP is not required it is
welcome and enjoyed by many.&nbsp; I t can be sometimes difficult with the existence of
voice chat.&nbsp; But plans are i n effect to create a RP voice chat server... for it is
believed that true RPers can truly shine in this fashion.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Currently there are only a few requirements for membership. &nbsp;
As far as the game is concerned you must be at least Security Level 10 to join Immortal
Spirit.&nbsp; Real Life friends and family members of current members do not have to meet
this requirement however.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Also a mature gaming attitude is required.&nbsp; Granted humor and
jest are always welcome, however immature attitudes and rude behavior and take away from
the gaming experience and is not welcome.</strong></p>

<p align="left"><strong>Members are required to register on the Immortal Spirit message
board, although posting is not required.&nbsp; This is mainly to assist in maintaining the
roster and to maintain a valid email address in case I need to contact you.&nbsp; Keep in
mind that the email address can be hidden so members may email you but it is done through
the message board so the email address remains unknown.&nbsp; The forum is for
communication.&nbsp; Members should communicate absences from game via the message board
in the case of extended absences or shortened play time.&nbsp; Members whose &quot;Last
online&quot; date exceeds a 2 week period without notification will be removed from the
Super Group.</strong></p>
