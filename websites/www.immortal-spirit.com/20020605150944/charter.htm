    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">General Outlook:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">The basic goals for the guild are really quite
    simple. Although it may sound like a cliche the goal is to have a guild that strives for
    unity among its members and develop a friendship that would encourage members to develop
    strong loyalties with each other. I do not wish for the guilds mindset to be based
    primarily around raiding and the development of power. Guild events are hoped to be
    frequent, however I hope to promote a lot of guild interaction and develop a strong trust
    between guild members.</font></p>
    <u><i><b><p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Membership:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">With the exception of the <i><b>Charter</b></i>
    members (those members that joined at the initial creation of the guild) membership is
    based on several criteria. <i><b>Charter </b></i>members are an exception to the level
    limit rule. First a potential member must be of at least level 40. The potential member
    must also be sponsored by an active guild member who is no longer on probationary status.
    The potential member must also be approved by a guild recruiter or guild leader. After
    being accepted into the guild a new member will be on a probationary status for a minimum
    of 2 weeks with probation lasting upwards of one month. This variation in time is designed
    to compensate for members that may be on often and able to interact greatly with the guild
    and also to compensate for members that may have limited time in the game and may take
    longer to develop a relationship with the guild. The Officers that hold the title of Guild
    Recruiter have the main responsibility of handling potential members and recommendations
    by guild members. More information on their duties can be found under the Officer
    descriptions.</font></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0"><strong><em><u>Alternate Characters:</u></em></strong></font></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">With regards to membership of alternate
    characters who do not meet the level 40 requirement.&nbsp; Alternate characters are
    allowed into the guild as long as they meet a lvl requirement of 20.&nbsp; This level
    requirement is primarily so that we do not appear to be a low level guild and therefore
    falsely advertise and have low level players believe that we allow low level members into
    the guild.&nbsp; The primary reason fo allowing lower level alternate characters is mainly
    so that you as Guild Members can still enjoy the company of those you trust dearly, while
    enjoying the aspect of a new character.&nbsp; The second reason is so that you can see
    guild chat, and should the need for your &quot;main&quot; arise you can &quot;become&quot;
    available at your discretion.</font></p>

    <p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild Guidelines</font><u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Introduction:</font></u></b></i></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">I prefer not to consider our guild members to
    be limited by many rules. Guild members should have a high degree of freedom when playing
    the game. However each member should understand that when they choose to join the guild it
    should have been because they agree with the guilds goals and what it strives to become.
    rather than strict rules I prefer to have guidelines for our guild. These guidelines
    should promote the basic ideals I have set for the guild and in turn promote fairness and
    understand among its members. However I do not wish these guidelines to resrict each
    members freedom to enjoy the game.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Play Nice Policies:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">The play nice policies are rules that verant
    has implemented into the game in an attempt to make the the competitive gaming experience
    of Everquest more fair. The play nice policies can be reviewed at www.everquestlive.com if
    you are not familiar with them. It is my belief that each member of our guild is a direct
    representation of our guild as a whole. how you act while playing influences other peoples
    impressions of our guild. I would ask that all members become familiar with the Play Nice
    Policies and try to follow them. Please by all means, try not to let anger get the best of
    you..countering a wrongful act by another player is not the means in which we should
    handle our actions.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Roleplaying:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">There are many of you out there that are very
    familiar with the concept of &quot;roleplaying&quot;. Simply put, roleplaying is the idea
    that one &quot;becomes&quot; their character while playing the game. One speaks, behaves,
    and upholds the beliefs of that character. Personally I prefer to roleplay as much as
    possible when playing Everquest and I would promote others to roleplay as well. However I
    also understand that there will be many times when we simply will not have the time to
    roleplay. (Ie. During a raid or event where typing slows us down considerably) And some
    may just not be into the idea of roleplaying wither. Therefore guild members that do not
    wish to roleplay shall not be shunned or forbidden from our guild, however I do ask that
    they be understanding to those of us that wish to roleplay.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild Recruitment:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild recruiting is allowed by all members of
    the guild. However the final decision on whether one is allowed into the guild will be
    made by the guild recruiters or the guild leader. In order for a person to be eligible for
    guild membership they must first be sponsored by a guild member. They must also be
    familiar with the guild charter and agree with it. The sponsor must then post on the guild
    forum stating that they are sponsoring someone for guild membership. the Guild Recruiters
    will handle it from there.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Loot Guidelines:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">These guidelines for looting are my personal
    viewpoint on general loot rules for guild events, grouping, and raids. your own personal
    opinions while on your own or with non-guild groups should be decided among your group. In
    some of the other guilds I have been in I have seen almost tear a guild apart. I have
    spent long hours speaking with friends and thinking on my own to devise a fair loot
    system. Please keep in mind that I believe there is no perfect loot system but my overall
    goal is to try and be as fair as possible to all guild members. Also keep in mind that
    loot rules may change from time to time to maintain fairness and to compensate for unusual
    circumstances.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">I truly believe in a &quot;need before
    greed/random roll&quot; rule when it comes to the guild doing events, raiding, or simply
    grouping together. The &quot;Need before greed/random roll&quot; concept is desigend to
    promote overall fairness to everyone that participates in any particular guild event. (Ie.
    In a raid in which an item drops that is SK and pally only, all SK's and Pally's that are
    present will be allowed to roll on the item) This loot rule is a general rule for the
    guild and at times there may be exceptions, changes, or modifications based on various
    circumstances.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Alternate Characters, Twinking, and
    Powerleveling:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">My belief is that each of us pays to enjoy the
    game, so if creating alternate characters and twinking them is what you wish to do then it
    is your right to do so. If you wish to have alternate characters in the guild that is also
    allowed however, your character must meet the level 40 minimum to be a member of Immortal
    Spirit, otherwise they may be accepted in our sister guild Spirit Wind.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Additionally if you wish to powerlevel guild
    members or even ask for help from guild members it will also be allowed, however I do
    recommend the use of tact when approcahing guildmates, and please be understanding if one
    cannot, or chooses not to powerlevel you. It is everyones right to aid or deny aid in
    powerleveling requests.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild Vaults:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">There will be 3 vaults maintained within the
    guild. One will be for items and money. The second will be for spells, and the third will
    be for quest gems. The items for these vaults will be gained by donations from guild
    members. Items in the vaults may be auctioned to guild members at reduced prices at later
    times and the money gained from such will be placed into the guild vault to use for raid
    or event expenses. Items usable by new members that are in the vault may be
    &quot;given&quot; to those new members after the new member is no longer on probation and
    after it is approved by the council of officers or guildleader. Other uses for guild
    monies and items will be taken on an individual basis on most cases, however most
    decisions will be voted on by the Council of officers and guildleader.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Spells will be obtained by donation also. It
    is requested that guild members that obtain dropped spells that they do not need donate
    them to the Spell Vault for use by other guild members. Quest Gems shall be treated in the
    same fashion as the spells. Lists of all items in the vaults will be maintained on the
    Guild website for easier viewing. Donation of items to the vaults is never required.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild Forum:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Communication is essential to keeping everyone
    informed of the news of the guild. the forum is the hub of our communication channel as it
    will be most likely rare for us to ever have all of our guild members online at the same
    time. It is imperative that each guild member review the forum whenever they can and post
    if they have important information or news to share. Also posting helps us see who is
    still among us, as we may rarely see some of our own as a result of different playing
    times.</font></p>
    <p><u><i><b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Officer Positions:</font></b></i></u></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">There will be several officers in the guild.
    The more members we have the will create a need for more officers. Officers will be chosen
    on a volunteer basis. However we will not take volunteers until there is a need to fill a
    specific position. Here is the list for the Officer positions within the guild. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">Guild Leader:</font><br>
    <font face="Belwe Bd BT" color="#C0C0C0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The duties
    of the Guild Leader are all encompassing. He performs the same duties as his officers,
    however he relies primarily on his officers to perform their required duties. His primary
    task is to ensure that his officers are performing their required duties and that guild
    members are not having any problems. Any questions, comments, or concerns may be directed
    to the guild leader, however guild members should attempt to contact any applicable
    officer if possible.<br>
    <br>
    Guild Advisor:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guild Advisor is tasked with maintaining
    guild cohesion. He is charged with handling of problems or concerns between guild members.
    He acts as an investigator of inner guild problems and also problems with persons outside
    of our guild. Our guild is to be based upon trust and friendship. Guild members should
    strive to get along with each other and form strong bonds. Guild Advisor will help to
    maintain this goal by becoming a listening ear to each guild member and their concerns.
    Should you have an issue that you feel need be addressed then inform a Guild Advisor. This
    officer will investigate the concern if necessary and notify the Guild Leader so that a
    resolution may be attained.<br>
    <br>
    Guild Recruiter:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guild Recruiter is tasked with building the
    ranks of Immortal Spirit. They are a social service provided for the guild and its
    members. Do not mistake their tasks and assume that they randomly go about and recruit
    members. They can do this at their leisure however it is through guild members that their
    duties become more prominent. Guild Recruiters duties also include making contact with and
    meeting potential members recommended by guild members and also those persons who have
    heard of our guild and shown an interest in joining our ranks.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OOC- Guild Recruiters will rely heavily on the
    forum in their duties. You will notice a category titled Potential Members. Should you
    have someone you wish to sponsor for the guild you must post the name of this person on
    the forum. Guild recruiters will note this and make an effort to meet with this person and
    even possibly group with them. Their goal at this point is to see if the person seems
    compatible with our current guild goals and if the person agrees with our charter. If the
    Guild recruiter deems the person worthy he will invite that person into the guild and post
    this under the New Members category of the forum. Keep in mind that Guild Recruiters may
    take several days, sessions, or meetings with a potential member before finally deciding
    whether they will be invited or not.<br>
    <br>
    Guild Strategist:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guild Strategists are guild members who
    have proven very knowledgeable in the lands of Norrath. Their primary duty is organizing
    guild events and raids. They can also assist in organizing assistance with quests. Guild
    Strategists are automatically appointed Raid Leader or Event Leader of any task they
    organize unless they appoint a substitute. They will organize events of their own accord
    or organize ones at the request of guild members.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OOC- Aside from events that they will organize
    on their own, Guild Strategists are also tasked with organizing events at the request of
    guild members. In order for this to happen any guild member may post under the appropriate
    category for either quests, raids, or events. Guild members should post what they wish to
    do and what the goals are expected. Guild Strategists will check the forum and pull
    requests of guild members for organization. Once a Strategist has assumed the
    responsibility of a requested event he should post this to inform the other Guild
    Strategists so they are aware that an officer has already begun to organize the event.
    Once the event has been organized the Guild Strategist will post the event time. Guild
    members are expected to post under this new topic to notify the Strategist of
    availability.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Final Note:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have chosen each of my officers based on my
    knowledge of their personality, play style, and overall attitude. I have placed a trust in
    them as they have earned this trust from me. Each officer is his own person and can make
    decisions within their field without conferring with the Guild leader or the other
    officers. However it is expected that they do inform the Guild Leader of any important or
    out of the ordinary decisions they may make. I also expect guild members to respect the
    officers of the guild as they have volunteered to perform extra duties within the guild in
    an effort to make the guild better as a whole. Of course the expectation that we all
    respect each other is a given, sometimes it may seem more difficult when it comes to
    officers as they are members who have the power to make ground breaking decisions. </font></td>
