<p><font face="Dauphin">It was a time not long ago, in a place unknown to most... but
known by the mightiest of us. It is a place of neutrality, a plane where there is not evil
or good... where beings must exist as together and set aside their differences... at least
temporarily. Darkness encompassed the entirety of this realm. There was no land, no
water... nothingness. Almost as if it were a void. For this realm is a sacred place...
where even the Gods have little control, and it is because of this fact that this realm
was chosen for a game among our mightiest. </font></p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">Within the center of this void was a small sphere. A soft purple
light emanated from it casting the only light within the realm. And amongst this light
stood three figures. A tall woman with elven features approached the sphere. Long platinum
hair danced around her being as she glided closer and closer. She placed soft delicate
hands upon its surface and the sphere dimmed momentarily before changing to a warm green
color. Next a broad shouldered man approached. He had a rugged, yet handsome appearance
and silvery armor covered him almost completely. He too placed his hands upon the sphere.
It dimmed momentarily before changing to a bright yellow color. Finally the last figure
approached. His movement seemed hindered as his twisted form neared the sphere. The light
cast from the sphere seemed to shy away from his warty skin. Claw tipped hands reached out
from the shadows of his being and rested upon the sphere. The sphere dimmed momentarily,
then changed to a blood red glow. It suddenly flared with light, quickly strobing between
alternating colors of green, yellow, and red, before finally dimming back to its original
purple glow. The three figures stood motionless for what seemed like ages. They each
looked at one another before finally resting there eyes upon the sphere. The sphere began
to darken...slowly a mist seemed to form within, swirling about the surface. Lady Tunare
would shed a single tear that would drop onto the sphere. Mithaniel Marr stood stern as he
prepared his mind for what would come. And Innoruuk... he only smiled.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">Cullyn gazed skyward as the starfilled sky quickly dissapeared
under darkened clouds. His stomach tightened as he witnesses the many strands of lightning
rage across the sky quickly followed by the tremor of thunder. Massive sheets of rain
began to fall upon him as he quickened his pace and rushed for home. He could barely see
his way as he ran across the plains. He could no longer see the lightning for the rain was
so heavy, however the thunder boomed continuously drowning out all other sound.</font></p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">Not far behind, unhindered by weather, several figures followed
Cullyn. The harsh rain tore decaying flesh from their bones but still brought them no
discomfort. And as Cullyn trudged on, so did these undead creatures... </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">Lanara sat comfortably within her home upon the hills of Qeynos. A
small fire blazed within a nearby hearth shedding its light and warmth to the entire home.
Nestled within her arms were her two infant sons Cerryn and Suma. They slept soundly, for
not even the storm would ruin their rest. The front door opened slightly as Daryan quietly
entered. His rain soaked robes clung to his body as he walked over to the hearth and
placed a few more logs upon it. He conversed softly with Lanara as he finished feeding the
fire and helped attend to the sleeping infants. Their conversation was cut short as a loud
cry of pain echoed through the storm filled air outside. Daryan did not think twice as he
motioned to Lanara to remain still and rushed outside...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">The rain washed the blood from Cullyns wounds as he stood
defiantly before his foes. He had drawn his sword and glared at those around him. Magical
flames danced along the blade, but he was surrounded with nowhere to turn. Directly in
front of him stood a dark skinned necromancer. His hands still smoking from his most
recent spell. Beside the dark elf stood a large skeleton, its hands gripping a rusted
sword. To Cullyns right a mummy groaned as the rain washed age old bandages from its body.
Two ghouls clambered in from behind him and to his left, their constant moaning creating a
horrible harmony with the thunder of the storm. The necromancer lifted his hands to cast
yet another spell as the other undead minions closed in on Cullyn. In an instant pain
wracked his body... but he would not fall. He turned and swung his sword and struck the
nearest ghoul in the shoulder. The force of the blow sent the creature staggering back
with flames erupting from its wound. The skeleton swung its rusted sword slashing Cullyn
across the ribs. He stepped back to regain his footing but fell into the awaiting hands of
the other ghoul. The creature held him fast... its undead strength was to difficult for
Cullyn to break. The mummy closed in and began to strike Cullyn repeatedly among his torso
as the skeleton raised its sword to strike once again. Suddenly a great hammer spun
through the air and hit the skeleton square in the chest causing it to crumple where it
stood. Daryan charged into the fray with another hammer already within his hands. With a
mighty battle cry Daryan bashed the ghoul restraining Cullyn. The ghoul released its hold
and Cullyn scrambled free. The necromancer prepared to cast another spell, however Cullyn
quickly charged into him knocking him off his feet. With one swing of his sword Cullyn
ended the necromancers life. Daryan spun as the two ghouls converged on him. With a prayer
to Marr he would smite one of the ghouls sending its undead life to another plane. The
remaining ghould flailed its clawed hands wildly at Daryan slashing him across the arms
and shoulders. He swung his mighty hammer and struck the ghoul on the head, the sheer
force of the blow separating its head from its shoulders. Daryan turned to witness Cullyn
engaged with the mummy in furious melee. But the mummy was no match alone. Cullyn swung
his mighty Soulfire sword repeatedly. Each blow causing the mummy to burst into flames.
Within seconds it was reduced to a smoldering pile of bones. Daryan and Cullyn looked at
each other and smiled, however their victory was short lived as a scream emanated from the
place they would call home. They both rushed to the house and braced themselves for what
might lie within...</font></p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">The sight was too much for Cullyn to bear as he stood frozen at
the entrance to his home. Standing before the hearth was an ominous creature. A
shadowknight of sorts... one of pure hatred and evil. It was a dark elf like the
necromancer. His armor was the color of coal with numerous spikes and blades protruding
from its surface. He carried a great axe and stood defiantly over the bloodied body of
Lanara. Cullyn and Daryan were both in shock by the sight before them, however they were
brought back to reality by the shill cries of the children within Lanara's lifeless arms.
They were still alive! Without thought for himself Cullyn charged the shadowknight
slamming into him before he could wield his deadly axe. They both tumbled to the ground as
Cullyn cried out to Daryan to take his children and run. Daryan thought only of the safety
of the children and heeded Cullyn's words without question or doubt. He ran to Lanara and
spoke a prayer as he took Cerryn and Suma from her arms. He gazed one last time at Cullyn
as he battled furiously with the shadowknight, then ran quickly out the door without once
looking back. He did not stop until he reached the safety of Surefall Glade... and with
the aid of a band of powerful rangers he journeyed to Freeport to begin a new life...for
himself and the two boys. Yet he would always wonder if Cullyn survived.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">Daryan would eventually find sanctuary at the Temple of Marr
within the walls of Freeport. He would raise both boys as his own. Cerryn quickly took to
the ways of the cleric enjoying the pleasures of helping others through healing. He
studied much but would always spend time with his brother as well. That is until the day
that his brother Suma chose not to follow the ways of the cleric or paladin, but chose to
study the gifts of the Arcane. Suma went away to study with his Arcane master when he was
only fourteen and Cerryn only thirteen. They would never see each other again...</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font face="Dauphin">And so the story goes. Daryan left the sanctuary of the Temple the
same day that Cerryn departed to start his life as a Cleric of Marr. Cerryn had many goals
in his mind. He knew he would aid the people of Norrath as best he could... but more
importantly he wondered if he would ever see Daryan or Suma again. He smiled to himself
and hoped to see them both as he set out on his lifelong quest... he would find his
father.</font>
