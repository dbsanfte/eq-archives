<p>Dirge found his abilities at an early age. His parents, thinking he was a monster,
decided to end his life before he could do any harm. But Dirge had other ideas. Because of
his power, he thought he was superior to average people, and the first ones to feel the
brunt of his wrath, were his parents. He spent years training before he decided to make
himself known to the world. Gallons of blood were spilled in his name before the
government finally detained him. Years later, after successfully blocking off his demented
psyche, the government gave him a new and much more heroic take on life. He was sent to
Paragon City to become a hero and, unbeknownst to him, to atone for his sins.</p>
