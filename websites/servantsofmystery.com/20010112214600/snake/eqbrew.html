<H2>The Art of Brewing in Norrath</H2></CENTER><BR>
<BR><strong>
Brewing in Norrath is a not-too-profitable yet somehow satisfying trade.  Although the brews you make will typically not bring high prices from anybody, you can make a small profit selling certain brews to shopkeepers.  The main effect of drinking alcohol in Norrath is a decrease in Intelligence and a concommitant increase in Strength.  The Int decrease is lessened as your Alcohol Tolerance rises, so at some point, alcoholic beverages act like Strength potions.  Drinking an alcoholic beverage also seems to increase the rate at which Mana is gained during Meditation...I knew drinking could help you study!  Of course, drinking too much will make you bob and weave like a rubber-legged boxer, but one must pay some price for the benefits of consumption!<BR>

Why you brew is between you and your Creator.  How you brew is the point of this guide.  Brewing is done by placing the required ingredients in a Brewing Barrel (see the picture below) and clicking the Combine button.  Only a single recipe's worth of ingredients can be processed at a time.  Your Brewing skill is checked against on every attempt.  If you fail, you will get a message saying that you lacked the skill to make that item, and typically the container will be returned to you and all other ingredients will be lost.  If you succeed, you get a message saying you have succeeded in creating something new, and a container of the product will appear on your cursor.  If you make a mistake and put the wrong ingredients in the barrel, you lose them and get a message saying that these items do not combine to create anything.<BR>

To start Brewing, it's a good idea to first spend a few Practice Points on the skill, so go to your Guild house, find a trainer, and drop a few Points into Brewing.  The more you use, the easier it is to get started, but don't spend any money on it, so don't keep training after the trainer starts charging for it.<BR>
<BR>
The next thing to do is get some ingredients.  To properly advance your Brewing skill, what you make should be determined by your skill level.  The list below shows all the brews you can make, in the approximate order of difficulty from easiest at the top to hardest at the bottom:<BR>

The recipes for all these brews can be found in the <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/brewrec.html"> Recipe Table </A>.  I recommend starting with Short Beer or Mead. Bog Juice and Kalish aren't difficult enough to raise your Brewing skill significantly, especially if you've spent Practice Points to raise it.  Get yourself a load of ingredients and park in front of a brewing barrel.  Put the proper ingredients into the slots in the barrel, just enough to make one recipe's worth and no more.  Click the Combine button and watch the magic!<BR>
<BR>
Keep making your chosen brew until you get the message saying you can no longer advance your skill by making this item.  If you started with Short Beer, you should move up to Short Ale, then to Fish Wine.  If you started with Mead, move up to Fish Wine, and then to Ale.  After Ale, try Gypsy Wine, and if you can get the foraged Berries or Fruit, make Red and White Wines, as these will raise your skill as well as allow you to turn a small profit.  Once these wines become trivial for you, try making Gnomish Spirits.  If you're lucky enough to run across some Morning Dew, try making some Elven Wine.  When Gnomish Spirits will no longer raise your skill, it's time to try Brandy, Vodka, and the 'mixed drinks' made with Vodka.  By this time you should be nearing Master status, if you're not already at it, and the entire world of brewing will be open to you.<BR>
