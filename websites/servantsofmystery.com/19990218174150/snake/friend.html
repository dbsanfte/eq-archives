	Jakhana was just on the last, sweet edge of sleep when loud scratching noises at the door penetrated his nascent dreams and roused him.  Jaki wanted to go out.  Sighing, the old ranger rose from his bed, slipped on his trousers and tunic, belted on his broadsword, and shuffled over to the front door of the cottage.<BR>
<BR>
	"Ready to go outside?" Jakhana asked.  Jaki wriggled in happiness as the old man unbolted the door.  The moment the door began to open, Jaki nosed through and rushed down the front path, barking.  Jakhana sent a sharp mental command, and Jaki immediately stopped barking and sat down on the path.  The ranger knew that his mental control of the animal was not as strong now as it had been when he first found it, huddled in the wet hay at the back of his barn after a fierce cyclone had ripped through the area some fifteen years before.  Fortunately, Jaki was well conditioned now and obeyed readily.  Pleased by Jaki's instant response, Jakhana decided it was all right for the beast to run free a bit.<BR>
<BR>
	"Go on, run!" he said, and Jaki took off at top speed in a circle around the yard.  He went all the way around twice, then made a head-down pass at Jakhana, growling.  They had played this game many times before.  Jakhana made a feint at him, and Jaki abruptly reversed course and ran off behind the house.  The sound of claws furiously digging the earth could soon be heard.<BR>
<BR>
	"Must have found another rabbit hole," Jakhana mused.<BR>
<BR>
	"Hey, old man!" a voice behind him shouted.   Jakhana grabbed the hilt of his broadsword and whirled toward the gate.  Three hard-eyed men stood there, each wielding a curiously shaped and worked metal device.  These could only be smoke powder weapons, which were now derisively referred to as "gonds" in most of the Realms.  Jakhana knew he would not have a chance alone against three men armed with such weapons, which could propel a deadly metal ball at such high speeds that even plate armor was little protection.<BR>
<BR>
	"Put the sword down, or I'll shoot!" shouted the apparent ringleader, a youngish fellow of about twenty-five winters.  That would give him about five years on his two companions, who flanked their older cohort, gonds leveled at Jakhana.<BR>
<BR>
	Jakhana was smiling inside when he said,  "Oh, no!", and took his hand from the hilt.  As he unbuckled his swordbelt and let it drop, he sent a mental command to Jaki.  The sharp ears of the old ranger heard when the digging sounds stopped.<BR>
<BR>
	"That's the smart thing to do, Grandpa," the chief thug said, smirking.  "We don't want to hurt you.  Besides, you're so skinny, I don't think you could stop a bullet!"<BR>
<BR>
	"Not if you make it mad," Jakhana replied, smiling.<BR>
<BR>
The thieves looked at each other, confused.<BR>
<BR>
	"What is that supposed to mean, old fool!" one of the other rogues shouted, brandishing his weapon in Jakhana's face.<BR>
<BR>
	At that instant, there was a loud thrashing sound from the brush behind the highwaymen.  The three thieves turned and pointed their gonds toward the gate.  The ringleader saw Jaki rushing at him, jaws agape, and screamed!  He dropped his weapon, and turned to flee, blundering into the other two, who stood paralyzed with fear!  The gond fell grip-first on the pathstones and discharged, sending a steel ball caroming off Jaki's tough, leathery hide!  A few crushed denticles marked the spot where the projectile had struck the creature.   Jaki growled, a harsh rumbling sound, gnashed its many knife-sharp teeth, and leapt at the horrified thieves!<BR>
<BR>
	"Now you've done it," said Jakhana, mournfully.  "You've made it mad."<BR>
<BR>
	Jaki hit the trio in a frenzy, slashing and biting until a cloud of red mist filled the air.  Jakhana quickly and prudently retired to the relative safety of his cottage while his enraged pet spent its fury in a storm of bloody destruction.  When it was finally over, there was no sign of the three hapless robbers but a damp circle of blood-soaked earth.<BR>
<BR>
	Later, despite the ferocious attack his pet had launched on the three departed scoundrels, Jakhana couldn't keep himself from chuckling as he watched Jaki circle the yard, dorsal fin jutting from the soil as it dug in search of burrowing animals.<BR>
<BR>
	"Stop a bullette!" he laughed.<BR></H5>
