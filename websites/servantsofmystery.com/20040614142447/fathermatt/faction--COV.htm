    <TD colSpan="2">I have spend a lot of time trying to raise Claws of Veeshan faction killing frost giants and have to say it is a pain, giants have a lot of HP and killing one takes a lot of time for a soloer. Add to that the medding down time and you will have a great number of hours (didnt calculate them cuz I get bored lot of times in the middle of the process and went to do something else, but at least 50 hours will be my guess) just to get your CoV faction to dubious.<BR>
      <BR>
      Getting a group is a way to kill more giants in less time than soloing, so you can raise faction faster, but theres not always a group out there with a place waiting for you.<BR>
      <BR>
      At the end of the process, when I was still kos to giants and just warmly to dwarfs, I figured out a way to increase faction much more fastly, soloing. Of course I have bonk my head for all the time I wasted before, but it is already done so ......<BR>
      <BR>
      The method im talking about is simple, go to Great Divide, where most people go to kill giants and drakkel wolves, sow yourself and start running around snaring all the drakkel wolves and giants you see, snared they are easily outrunned so you will be pretty safe no matter how many of them you hit. After doing that for a while, just go to a safe place, sit to med and check how faction raise on its own. You will get all the faction hits for the giants and wolves the
      people out there is killing. I got A LOT of faction hits this way in an hour, by far much more than the ones i could get in a strong group, and finally raise to dubious with CoV and to ally with dwarfs.<BR>
      <BR>
      Of course, you dont have to forget your manners so if the giant or wolf you see while running around has been pulled before you snare it, just ask the puller to snare it for the faction, nobody will say no to a free snare because it helps them a lot killing the mob and make no damage so they wont loose the exp.<BR>
      <BR>
      Hope this help someone.<BR>
