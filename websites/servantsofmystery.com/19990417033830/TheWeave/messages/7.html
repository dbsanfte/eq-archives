Aye lass, I live...have been doing so for quite some centuries now, it's a nice little habit I've gotten into ;)<p>At the moment I'm in between games, although I do have a UO account (again; though not the same one as last time, so my old char's are gone). Between work, a new girlfriend, and Baldur's Gate (and Populous, now that I think of it), I haven't had much chance to actually sign on and play any ;/  That should be changing here in a couple of weeks (hopefully as soon as next week). I'll be around more in the day-time, but probably mostly on the test server. I'll try and pop onto LS from time to time. Hmm...that reminds me, I need to get co-ords for where everyone hangs out...<p>::huggles::<p>it's been a while lass, 'tis good to hear from ye again ;)<p>-Cer.<p>: you live?<br>: Where are you?<br>: waves back<p><br>
