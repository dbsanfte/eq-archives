<blockquote>My thanks to the many Servants of Mystery who have contributed
tips for this guide, including Ceribus, Neranek, Kmalj, Kendrick, Manticorr,
Markemp, Dornal and many others. (My apologies for not being able to remember
the names of all contributors.)
<p>TUTORIAL. First, be sure to run the EQ tutorial before you start playing
the game. It&#146;s fun and it really helps one learn the interface. If you
can&#146;t find it, do a search on your hard drive(s) for tutorial.exe.
<p>CHARACTERS. For information on races (humans, elves etc.), classes (mages,
paladins etc.) and religions (no OOC religions here!) you can choose, see
the following:
<p>An EXTREMELY useful EQ Stratics chart showing which races are best for
which classes can be found at <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/races_ref.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/races_ref.shtml</a>
<p>NOTE: When creating your character, you get to choose how to apply 30
additional ability points to your character. You will probably want to
use those on the abilities that are most important for your character;
these categories will be highlighted in the ability window when you create
your character. For example, if your class&#146;s primary abilities are intelligence
and stamina, you may want to give an additional 15 points to each.
<p>For the MECHANICS on how to create your character, see the EQ Online
page at
<br><a href="http://eq-online.com/tutorial/">http://eq-online.com/tutorial/</a>
<p>For information on specific classes, see the following:
<blockquote>The EQ Stratics page <a href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a>
has a description of each class; just scroll down to get to the races and
classes lists, which are shown on the left-hand side.

For information on specific races, see the following:
<blockquote>As with classes, the EQ Stratics page <a href="http://eqss.stratics.com/">http://eqss.stratics.com/</a>

SKILLS.
<p>Most skills are best raised just by using them repeatedly. However,
skills can also be raised by using Practice Points.
<p>When you start the game, you have five Practice Points that may be spent
on various skills. You also receive five additional Practice Points for
each new level you reach. BE VERY MISERLY USING THESE. Believe it or not,
it gets much harder to advance in skills at higher levels, so save your
Practice Points unless you absolutely must use them. (Most skills are best
raised just by using them, rather than by using Practice Points.) Use your
Practice Points by going to a trainer for your class (generally found in
the guild hall for your class), and right-clicking on the NPC to bring
up the Skills menu.
<p>For the official descriptions of skills see: <a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/p_skills.html">http://everquest.station.sony.com/p_skills.html</a>
<p>There is a cap on skills that depends on your level. That skill cap
is your level times five, plus five. For example, if you are level four,
the highest you can raise any skill is to 25 ((4 x 5) + 5). Once you&#146;ve
hit the cap, you cannot improve that skill until you reach the next level.
<p>COMMANDS. Pages 73-74 of the manual that comes with the CD list lists
some basic keyboard commands. For other keyboard and / commands, go to
the directory on your hard drive where the game is located (probably \program
files\everquest\), open everquest.txt and go to Appendix B and Appendix
C. However, here are a few commands:
<p>Checking inventory: the letter &quot;i&quot; (without the quotes); hit it again
to close the window.
<br>Opening doors: left click, or the &quot;u&quot; key or whatever key you have
bound to use center.
<br>Picking items off the ground: left click
<br>Selecting &quot;targets&quot;: left click
<br>Opening bags: right click
<br>Automatic forward movement: the &lt;NUM LOCK&gt; key.
<p>To access your inventory, hit the letter &quot;i&quot; then click on the bar at
the top right that says &quot;Inventory&quot; to show what you are holding and wearing.
If you aren&#146;t sure where to place an item (or want a quick way to throw
them in your inventory), drop the item onto the picture of yourself and,
if a slot is open and you can equip that item, it will be placed automatically.
This is true with bags too:&nbsp; even if they are closed, this will drop
items into them if they have space and the primary slots are full. To close
your inventory, hit &quot;i&quot; again.
<p>COMMUNICATION. Page 30 of the manual shows basic &quot;chat&quot; commands. For
additional commands, go to the directory on your hard drive where the game
is located (probably \program files\everquest\) and open chathelp.txt.
Still, here are some key communication commands:
<p>&lt;ENTER&gt; &lt;message&gt; sends a message to those in your immediate area;
for example, &lt;ENTER&gt; Hail sends the message &quot;Hail&quot; to those in your
area.
<br>/shout &lt;message&gt; will send your message throughout your zone.
<br>/tell &lt;name&gt; &lt;message&gt; sends a private message to the player
named.
<br>/who lists all players in your zone.
<br>/friend &lt;name&gt; adds that person to your friends list.
<br>/friend &lt;name&gt; done twice in a row will remove that person as a
friend.
<br>/friend by itself will list the players in your friends list.
<br>/who friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is in
your zone.
<br>/who all friend will let you know if anyone on your friends list is
on the server you are on.
<p>HOTKEYS. This is one of the things you should adjust first. The game
comes with the letter &quot;a&quot; pre-set as a hotkey that starts your character
auto-attacking. Since it&#146;s easy--when talking with an NPC--to forget to
hit &lt;ENTER&gt; first and instead start typing immediately, you can easily
activate the hotkeys. While this usually doesn&#146;t matter, auto-attack can
be deadly:&nbsp; if you hit an &quot;a&quot; while trying to talk (without having
hit &lt;Enter&gt; first), the NPC will attack and kill you!&nbsp; The solution
is to change your hotkeys in the game.
<p>To change your hotkeys, click on Options, Keyboard, then the box under
&quot;auto-attack&quot;. Enter the letter or number you want (I use a zero), then
click on Back, and on Back again.
<p>HOTBOX. The hotbox is the set of six spaces in the lower left-hand corner
of your screen. You can add spells and skills to it by left-clicking on
the memorized spell or skill until it &quot;lifts&quot; from the screen, then dragging
it to the hotbox you want; position it and left-click to drop it. (You
can also edit the Socials keys by right clicking on them, and making them
into more useful keys for things like /loc and /corpse that can be added
to the hotbox.)&nbsp; The hotbox spaces correspond with the numbers 1 through
6. In other words, by pressing a number, you activate the corresponding
hotbox item. You can also activate hotbox items by left-clicking on them.&nbsp;
There are six hotboxes; you can rotate among them by using the arrows above
the hotboxes or by holding down the &lt;CTRL&gt; key and pressing the numeral
corresponding to the set of hotboxes you want.
<p>MAPS &amp; CITIES.
<br>Pages 55-73 of the manual show city maps. For a more regional view,
click on the top atlas at: <a href="http://members.home.net:80/eqmaps/">http://members.home.net:80/eqmaps/</a>
<p>However, by far the most complete set of maps is the Enigma collection
at <a href="http://members.door.net/enigma/EQMaps.htm">http://members.door.net/enigma/EQMaps.htm.&nbsp;</a>
Always start here first!
<p>There are city guides at the following sites, but not all cities are
covered yet:

<br><a href="http://files.stratics.com/maps/qeynos.jpg">http://files.stratics.com/maps/qeynos.jpg</a>
<br>Use this one rather the vastly inferior official map!

<br>There is also an EQ Online tips board at:
<br><a href="http://www.eq-online.com/tips.htm">http://www.eq-online.com/tips.htm</a>
<br>EQ Stratics also has a game manual (purportedly official) at:
<br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/game_manual.shtml#manual">http://eq.stratics.com/game_manual.shtml#manual</a>
<p>ADVANCEMENT.
<br>There is advice for advancement for each specific class at EQ Vault
at: <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/playerguide/">http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/playerguide/</a>
<br><b>READ THIS PUPPY</b>!!!! (Note that for some classes you have to
scroll down until you get to good stuff.)
<p>Also check the various classes at EQ Stratics:
<br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag.shtml</a>
<br>For example, under &quot;Magician&quot; there is a great article called &quot;Playing
a Magician--Intermediate&quot;.
<p>GUILD MASTERS. The first thing you should do when starting a new character
is find your guild hall. &quot;Once you find your Guild, locate the Master,
open your inventory, select the right letter and give it to him. In return,
your Master will give you a cloth shirt (which you can equip to help your
Armor Class) and reward you with some Experience Points.&quot;
<p>LIGHTING. Some races--like humans--cannot see well in the dark. This
is a problem in dim passages, not to mention with night hunting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial &quot;fix&quot; is a fire-beetle
eye, which allows one to see better in the dark. These look like large
red eyeballs, and are available in many shops. They are also found on the
bodies of fire beetles. Often, more advanced players leave the eyes on
the corpses, so check beetle bodies that you find.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a spare
in your bank vault too, for when you get killed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire beetle eyes only
provide partial help, though at least they are relatively inexpensive.
When you can, buy a small lantern, and then later a large one.
<br>Light sources will only work if they are placed in your second melee
weapon slot.&nbsp; Eventually you will want to buy a Lightstone, and then
a Greater Lightstone.
<p>DEATH. When you die, you return to a place near your home city--minus
almost all of your possessions! You then have a limited amount of time
to return to your corpse and reclaim your items. Of course, this can be
difficult, since now you no longer have any weapon (except your starting
one), any source of light (if your race doesn&#146;t see well in the dark) etc.
<p>So, rule number one is to put all items in your bank that you do not
absolutely need when you go out adventuring. Rule number two is to leave
some money and/or items in the bank so that you can re-arm yourself enough
to find your corpse without being killed. I make it rule to always have
a fishing pole and 20 bait in the bank. That way when (notice I say &quot;when&quot;,
not &quot;if&quot;) I die, I can head to the bank, do some fishing and make enough
money to buy what I need to return to my body. (Taking a friend along is
sometimes quite useful too!)
<p>HUNTING. Basically, to attack you must target first, then attack.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Target by pressing F8 to
automatically target the nearest NPC or by left-clicking on the beast.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are not sure how
tough your prey is, type /con to &quot;consider&quot; the wisdom of your choice.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the targets usually
are moving, often it is easiest to first attack with either a spell or
a range weapon (by pressing the range-weapon box in the Combat menu--if
you have a range weapon). The target, once hit, will immediately turn and
head straight for you. (With a bit of practice, you can initiate a fight
from quite a distance this way.) I believe the Throwing Axe is a range
weapon that can be used by ALL classes.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After attacking, immediately
press the letter that activates auto-attack, for the beasts respond quickly
when provoked!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will not be able to
strike physical blows unless you can see your target, so if needed rotate
your character until you can do this. Also, you may have to move closer,
since if are far enough away, your blows will fall short.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spells are interrupted by
a blow from your quarry, so time them. I usually wait until I see a strike
by the beast, then I immediately cast the spell. About half the time it
gets off before the beast can hit again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are losing the battle
(keep an eye on the red bar in the upper right portion of your screen),
type /loc to preserve your location. (See CORPSES below for the reason.)
Then RUN! You may not make it, but at least sometimes you can outrun the
monster. (Actually, better yet is to hit the &lt;NUM LOCK&gt; key so you run
automatically, then keep typing /loc.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are attacked by more
than one creature--which happens fairly frequently--remember that after
killing the first one you may need to target the second and definitiely
will need to again turn on your auto-attack (since the kill turns it off).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your character starts in
walking mode. Don&#146;t forget to activate &quot;RUN&quot; on the menu bar: the speed
is useful for hunting.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the dead
prey to obtain any items it may be carrying. If you get the &quot;Considering
the dead is futile&quot; message when trying to loot a corpse, you probably
are too far away. Move closer and try again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you have limited space
to store the items you find on the resulting corpses, you may want to concentrate
on one creature each time between trips to sell your loot, since many items
are stackable. In addition, you may want to purchase a large bag when you
can. (Right click on it to open it.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You also may want to investigate
the Bind Wounds skill, assuming your class has it. To do this, click on
the Combat menu bar, then on one of the six skill buttons that pop up.
A Bind Wounds skill should come up. Left click on it for one or two seconds
until it &quot;lifts&quot;, then position it to a free space in the six-button skill
window and left click to drop it. (You will need bandages to practice this
skill.)
<p>LOCATION. If you have targeted yourself (F1) or have no target and then
type /loc, your location appears on the screen. (If you have someone or
something else targeted, its location appears.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first number is your
north/south axis and the second is your east/west access. Basically, if
you move north your first number rises; it falls if you move south. If
you move east, your second number drops; if you move west, it rises. (I
realize this is strange: you&#146;d expect going east would RAISE this number.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s helpful to write down
the coordinates of the gate when you leave town, since the town will disappear
from view once you are far enough away.
<p>CORPSES. When you die, you have a limited amount of time to find your
corpse and retrieve from it the items you have lost.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary problem is finding
your corpse. The key is to be sure to type the /loc command when you start
getting in trouble in a battle. (Once you are unconscious it is too late,
unless you can find a cooperative Bard or Necromancer.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you die, scroll up
your chat window to get the coordinates.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typing /corpse will summon
your corpse if you are close enough to it, although the range is very limited.&nbsp;
Primarily this is good for pulling your corpse away from nasty monster,
especially if you can get someone to cast the Invisible spell on you first.
<p>EQUIPMENT. The equipment each race/class/level can use can be a bit
complicated. For information on equipment, see EQ Vault at:
<br><a href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/equipment/">http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/equipment/</a>
<br>and see EverWorld at:
<br><a href="http://www.everworld.net/persona/equipment/index.shtml">http://www.everworld.net/persona/equipment/index.shtml</a>
<p>NPC&#146;S.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to talk to each
NPC you meet. Sometimes NPC's won&#146;t have anything to say, but often they
have helpful information or quests. Remember to ask questions using any
words that the NPC says that are in brackets: often this leads to additional
information. To talk to an NPC, left-click the NPC and hit the &quot;h&quot; key
for &quot;Hail&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To buy from or sell to an
NPC, right-click on him/her. Be sure to scroll down the items list: sometimes
there are unexpected items at the bottom. To sell, left-click the item
in your inventory; to buy, left click the item you are interested in. To
see a description of the item--useful if your are not sure your race/class/level
can use it, hold down a right-click on the item.
<p>QUESTS. In addition to quests you receive from NPC&#146;s, the EQ'Lizer Quest
Guide (with a list and a description of each), is found at:
<br><a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/quest.html">http://gameznet.com/eq/quest.html</a>
<br>and the Hyperion guide to quests is at: <a href="http://prime-fe2.lvcablemodem.com/hyperion/questframehtm.htm">http://prime-fe2.lvcablemodem.com/hyperion/questframehtm.htm</a>
<p>SWIMMING. Swimming is a very valuable skill to learn in EQ. I recommend
you start in a fountain or pool in town, rather than in the ocean, where
it&#146;s easier to get lost. Also, if your race does not see well in the dark,
swim during the day or take a light-source with you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start by jumping in. :-)
As long as you keep moving forward (hold down the numberpad 8 key), you
can control your depth by toggling back and forth between numberpad 9 (to
go up) and numberpad 3 (to go down). With a bit of practice, you can even
swim on the surface if you wish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are underwater,
obviously keep an eye on your air-supply bar. To surface quickly for air,
hold down numberpad 8 and numberpad 9 simultaneously. If you become disoriented,
try using numberpad 5 to center your field of vision.
<br>To get out of the water, just hold down numberpad 8 until you reach
an edge, then also hold down numberpad 9. You&#146;ll hear the appropriate sounds
when you emerge from the water. Hit numberpad 5 then to return your vision
to the normal horizontal plane.
<br>And, yes, if you drown, you can find your corpse in the water and get
your belongings back--though you will have to swim to do it.
<p>FISHING. Fishing is the easiest way for a beginner to earn money. You
can fish in the ocean--or in most any fountain or pool in town! The results
seem to be the same no matter where you fish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fishing pole costs 2 gold,
2 silver, 3 copper (I know it&#146;s expensive as a beginner but it&#146;s worth
it), and the bait is 3 copper per item. Get 10-20 of the bait.
<br>Stand as near the edge of the water as you can:&nbsp; use numberpad
9 to look down, use numberpad 8 to inch forward (carefully!), then use
numberpad 5 to look horizontally again.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the pole in your first
melee weapon slot. (Empty that slot first if you are holding a weapon.)
The bait can be anywhere in your inventory.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the main menu, click
on the Abilities bar, then on one of the empty button in the 6-space skill
box in the lower right corner (marked Skill 1 through Skill 6). Fishing
will come up in a bar. Left click on Fishing and hold for one to two seconds,
until the box &quot;lifts up&quot;. Move your cursor to an empty skill box, position
it and left click to drop it. If you now click on the box, you&#146;ll cast
your line. Wait a while and you&#146;ll get a message telling you whether you
caught anything or not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also add fishing
to you hotbox. Left-click for a second or two on the Fishing skill button,
wait until it lifts, then position and drop it in the hotbox. One advantage
of the hotbox is that each slot corresponds to a number, so by pressing
that number you can cast for fish.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can sit while fishing.
You can also practice your spells while fishing: just cast your line first,
then cast the spell.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you first start--until
you reach about level 5 in fishing skill--you&#146;ll likely break three or
four poles. Just tough it out--things will get better.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you pull up a fish,
open your inventory (press the &quot;i&quot; key) and drop the fish on your portrait--as
well as all the old sandals, rusty daggers and fish scales. Keep them all:
they can all be sold.

<p>FOOD TIP. Here&#146;s one tip on food for low-level players: &quot;What about
food? Simply run out and get yourself killed. You don't lose experience
(under lvl 4) and when you return to your home point you have 5 food and
5 water!&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, that&#146;s one way. :-)
<p>MAGIC.
<br>There are various types of magic skills--evocation, abjuration etc.--but
the types don&#146;t matter much because you cannot practice them directly.
Instead, using a spell raises the magic skill(s) associated with that spell.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To use a spell, you first
have to scribe the spell scroll in your magic book, then memorize it. To
scribe a spell scroll, click the spells bar, then drag and drop the scroll
from your inventory onto an empty rectangle in the spell book; wait until
the color in the bar runs out, which will take a bit. You will get a message
telling you when it is done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To memorize a spell,
left-click on the spell (in the book) for a second or two until it &quot;lifts&quot;
then position it over one of the empty oval spell slots on the left-hand
side of your game window; click the space to drop it. Again, wait for the
color bar to run out. (To remove a memorized spell, right-click on it.)
To cast a spell, left click on its icon in the oval slot.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the lower levels, at
least, you cannot cast a spell while walking, running or sitting: you have
to be standing still.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a list of spells by
class--with the level and description for each, go to the EQ&#146;lizer site
at: <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/spells.html">http://gameznet.com/eq/spells.html</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&#146;s one tip: &quot;I inscribed
and memorized my first two spells. Then found me a nice spot to stand around
and hot keyed both my spells. I just repeatedly cast them on myself over
and over, I also used the sense heading skill. And to my surprise my spell
levels (abjure and evoke) and channeling continued to rise. ... Getting
this stuff (especially channeling) can really help you out for countless
levels.&quot;&nbsp; Use F1 to target yourself.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meditation is a good skill
to practice for magic: it allows much faster memorization of spells, which
is helpful after you die. It may also speed the regeneration of mana. To
activate the Meditation skill, assuming your class and level has it, you
will have to use one of your precious Practice Points. To use the skill,
you must have less than full mana (the blue bar in the upper-right portion
of your screen); cast spells to reduce your mana, then click on the &quot;Spells&quot;
bar and then on the &quot;Meditate&quot;.

<p>SHIPS. There are ships that travel a) between Erudin and Qeynos and
b) between Freeport and Butcherblock. There is no charge: just wait for
one to pull up at the dock and walk on board. The ships show up on a frequent
and regular basis (every 10 minutes on the Erudin/Qeynos run and every
40 minutes on the Freeport/Butcherblock run.)&nbsp; .
<p>ETIQUETTE.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone is already fighting
a creature, do NOT step in and kill the beast: you will get credit for
the kill, rather than the first fighter.&nbsp; (One way to help, is to
target the player, then type &quot;/assist&quot; without the quotes; then you can
help but the player will get the experience.)&nbsp; Similarly, if someone
is chasing or stalking a beast, don&#146;t jump in and attack it for your own.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, if you
see someone being chased by a monster, feel free to attack the monster
in the hope of saving the life of the running fighter.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, if someone shouts
that he/she is looking for his/her corpse, and you spot it, it&#146;s kind if
you /loc to identify the location and then use /tell &lt;name&gt; to tell
the person the location of his/her corpse.
<p>LOGGING. To leave the game, sit down, then press the &quot;Camp&quot; button;
after about 30 seconds click the &quot;Leave Game&quot; button etc..
<p>May Mystra Guide Thee!
