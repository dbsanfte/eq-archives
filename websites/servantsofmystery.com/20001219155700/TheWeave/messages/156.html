Greetings, Servants of Mystery!<p>I sit and pen this missive to you in the dark of night. Fortunately, the Temple of Marr here in Freeport supplies ample light of the mundane variety as well as the more ephemeral light they propound to the masses.<p>As of yet, I am not a member of your guild. I write tonight by way of introduction.<p>My name is Silent Song, allthough it hasn't been so for all my life. I was born Pahn, a scruffy child to two scruffy parents who did what they could to teach a young boy manners and righteousness in the somewhat murky streets of a loosley moraled port town. I learned to fight early, as there is little other way to hold your own among sailors and older boys. I learned to fight without weapons as well, for I was often ambushed and could never afford a better weapon than a stick, or rock.<p>Rather than belabour a life of hardship and fighting for survival, which I'm sure many here can share, I will sumarize. Eventually I reached the limit of my fighting skills, and was wounded so severly that I thought I would never be whole again. In time I was proved wrong, but in the interim I found a lack of purpose deep within my soul. My parents had long sinve been killed by the walking undead while foraging outside the walls of Freeport. Without family or friends I turned to the Gods for guidance.<p>It was the Peaceful One who answered me, showing the way of tranquility. Remade anew at the words of this divine being, I cast off my old life and joined the monks of Freeport, the Ashen Order. The brothers called me "the silent song", due to my initial reticence among them, and my apparnetly lyrical grunts, pants, and wheezes while getting "trained". I took the name as my own and have been called Silentsong ever since, although my friends often shorten it to simply "Sigh".<p>I live now in the realms surrounding Freeport, searching out adventure and striving, when I can, to help those whose deities and personal actions comend them to my service.<p>I seek only peace, yet the great among us know that for most, true peace can only be found on the far side of death.<p>In peace,<p>Silentsong,<br>Monk of the 7th level,<br>Holder og the White Sash<p>OOC: Please say hi if you see me online. I would like to join this guild, and begin by meeting as meny members as I can. See you in Norrath!
