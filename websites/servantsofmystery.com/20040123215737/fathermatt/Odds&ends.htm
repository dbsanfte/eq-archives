<p align="left">To automatically increase your Sense Heading skill, adjust your
keyboard in the game.&nbsp; First, if you haven't already, set up &quot;Sense
Heading&quot; as a macro key on the left side of your screen.&nbsp; As an
example, let's say you put it in the first slot.&nbsp; Then press the Options
button, then keyboard.&nbsp; Flip until you get to the screen that contains User
Identified #1.&nbsp; Right click on the secondary slot for this key, then press
your Up Arrow button.&nbsp; Now, whenever you use the Up Arrow key to move
forward in the game, it will automatically do a&nbsp; Sense Heading.&nbsp; (A
tip of the helm to Wylyth for this hint.)&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Batwings and fish scales--along with tiny daggers for the enchanters and many gems--can be bought in unlimited quantities
at a hut at the inn in East Commons that is right on the border with West
Commons.&nbsp; (This is also true in the Arcane Academy in West Freeport and in
Ogguk, but the East Commons site is the closest to a teleport.)</p>
<p align="left">Always have a location macro (/loc) handy.&nbsp; If it looks
like you may die, hit this macro button repeatedly.&nbsp; If you do die, you can
scroll back to get the location of your corpse.&nbsp; If you forget and can't
find your corpse, enlist the help of a bard (level 4+) or necro (level 1+) or, if desperate, get at least two Chipped Bone Rods, which can be used to help locate your corpse. (These can be purchased from any merchant that sells potions; most cities have them; cost is 3 to 10 plat apiece.&nbsp; Be sure to target yourself before trying to use it.)&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">In the middle of the sea, you can enter a boat by getting in
front of it, ducking down (use the &quot;d&quot; key), letting the boat go over
you, then standing up from the duck (hit &quot;d&quot; again&quot;) when the
boat is over you.&nbsp; Doing
this will place you inside the boat.</p>
<p align="left">If you are sitting, <I> /camp desktop</I> will take you fully out of
EverQuest.</p>
<p align="left">If you have a pet, press F1 twice to target it (or once, if you yourself are the current target).&nbsp; If you are in battle with multiple monsters, pressing F8 often will switch among them.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Strongly consider reserving one bag for Charisma gear--and put these items on before buying and selling.&nbsp; (Don't forget to put your regular gear on afterwards!)&nbsp; Over time, this can save an enormous amount of plat.&nbsp; One possible item:&nbsp; a Silk Evening Tunic, +5 CHA.&nbsp; This is available from Iala Lenard (?) just south of the Lion's Mane Inn (outside, under the tent) in South Qeynos for approximately 6pp.&nbsp; </p>
