<p align="center"><b><font face="Dauphin" size="6">SOM Conduct Guidelines</font></b></p>
<p><b>With respect to <u>everyone</u>:</b></p>
<p>Do not use foul language (there are kids playing the game), make racist or
sexist remarks (such as commenting on a female character’s physique) or call
someone &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;fag&quot;.&nbsp; If there really is a need to insult
someone, find a more creative way to do it.&nbsp; Don't use the word
&quot;rape&quot; to describe what you did to that MOB:&nbsp; many women players&nbsp; justifiably take offense at this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>With respect to <u>guildmates</u>: </b> <br>
<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>Guildmates are civil to each other,
even if you disagree--and even if you don't like the other person.&nbsp;<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>Guildmates do not insult one
another.&nbsp;<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>When there are discussions,
guildmates stick to the objective issues and do not engage in personal attacks.&nbsp;<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>More specifically, say a) what the
objective behavior was (in-game action, post, speech), b) how it made you feel
and c) what you would like done about it in the future.&nbsp; Do not make
accusations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>Guildmates never assume that another
guildmate has acted out of malice.&nbsp; If you're hurt or offended by
something, ask the other person about it, but do not accuse them of
intentionally acting badly.<br>
<font FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">! </font>If you have an issue, complaint
etc., DO bring it up, but do it in accordance with the above.&nbsp; If it
involves a specific person, however, start with that person first, rather than
taking it public first!&nbsp; Alternatively, talk to the Guild Master or other Guild officers.&nbsp; </p>
