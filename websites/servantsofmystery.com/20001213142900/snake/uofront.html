The Servants of Mystery are the followers of <A HREF="#Mystra">Mystra, Goddess of
Magic</A> in the Forgotten Realms.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the origin
and
fountainhead of magic and its energies, the One True Spell from which all others flow.  Our Order is dedicated to the teaching of magic and to its practice in service of the common good.  The Servants of Mystery was founded in March, 1995, as a non-sanctioned guild in Neverwinter Nights (NWN), the now-extinct official on-line<A HREF="#ADD"> Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</A> role-playing fantasy adventure game on America Online.   The Servants of Mystery attained Sanctioned status in NWN on September 30, 1996.  The Guild began operations in <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/dsofront.html"> Dark Sun: Crimson Sands (DSO)</A> in May, 1997, and received formal recognition as a DSO Guild on July 16, 1997.  With the opening of <A HREF="UO">Ultima Online</A>, the Servants of Mystery applied to Origin for Guild status in Britannia on October 1, 1997 and were accepted in January, 1998.  Temples have also formed in <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/realmfront.html"> The Realm</A> and in <A HREF="http://www.Empyria.com">Panterra</A>.</H4><BR>

<A NAME="Mystra"><H3>Mystra, Goddess of Magic</H3></A>

<H4>
Mystra is the Goddess of Magic in the Forgotten Realms.  She is the Goddess of the power of
magic itself, not the Goddess of spellcasters, although many spellcasters number themselves among her followers.  To her alone is given the power to see through the eyes of the other gods and goddesses of the Forgotten Realms, that she may see how their strength of purpose colors even their perception of reality.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the greatest of the Greater Powers of the Realms.  When the word came that Neverwinter would be destroyed, the Servants of Mystery fled through an Astral Portal, transporting their Tower to the world of the Dark Sun, Athas.  From there the Guild has spread out to many new worlds, bringing with them the word of the One true Spell.  <A HREF="#Join">Join</A> us as we teach Mystra's wonders to those who would achieve greatness in service of Good  in Britannia!</H4><BR>

<A NAME="Talia"><H3>St. Talia the True</H3></A>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
<H4>
Saint Talia the True epitomized the spirit of Mystra.  This Paladin and Mage was the finest of the Knights of the Mystic Fire.  She spent countless hours traveling The Forgotten Realms, aiding those too weak to survive on their own and questing to find items of power for use in combating evil.  She served as Mystress of Apprentices during the peak period of growth of the Guild in Neverwinter Nights.  Shortly after she was chosen to serve as Assistant Guild Mystress, she was taken to Mystra's side.  The Servants of Mystery revere her as Saint and Protector of all who use magic in the service of Good.  The Shrine of Saint Talia was consecrated in the Temple beneath the town of Longsaddle, where she dwelt before her ascendance.  New Shrines will be consecrated in each world in which the Servants of Mystery travel.  May her shining spirit continue to inspire us wherever we roam!</H4><BR>
