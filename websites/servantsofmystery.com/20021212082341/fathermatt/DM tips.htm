<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Tips for Dungeon Masters</font></b></p>
<p align="left">I won't describe all the DM client features here, though do read
about them before starting as a DM.&nbsp; <font size="3">Planet Neverwinter's <a href="http://www.planetneverwinter.com/nwn/dm/client/">DM
Client</a> page provides a brief description of the features, and BioWare's </font><font size="3"><a href="http://nwn.bioware.com/dms/dmclientintro.html">Introduction
to the Dungeon Master Client</a> provides more in-depth descriptions and is well
worth reading.&nbsp; Also, my comments here are more directed to persistent
worlds rather than a particular campaign or quest, though many apply to the
latter as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><p align="left"><font size="3">I also have not
described instructions for the <a href="http://nwnbuilder.tripod.com/index.htm">DM's Helper</a>
 here (scroll down on that page for features), since this is only available if a builder adds it to the module.&nbsp; To
see if it is available, in the Creator click Item/Custom/Special/Custom1/DM's
Helper.&nbsp; Create the wand and put in it your Quick Bar.&nbsp; To use it,
click on the wand, then click on yourself, players, NPC's, monsters, objects and
the ground (to change the weather etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="3">Lastly, remember that you can go back up a level on
the radial menus by clicking the center icon (if there is one), and you can
remove a radial menu by hitting the &quot;ESC&quot; key.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="3">0.&nbsp; <b><a name="Practice">Practice</a></b>.&nbsp; Note that anyone
can practice using the DM client:&nbsp; you don't have to be given the DM
password for an online module.&nbsp; Start Neverwinter; click on DM Client
(instead of Play); click on Multiplayer, then on OK at the login screen.&nbsp;
Now you have two choices.&nbsp; You can click on New Internet/LAN Game and then
load the beginning of a chapter from the Official Campaign.&nbsp; Alternatively
you can click on Load Internet/LAN Game and load either your saved games from
the Official Campaign or another module that you have downloaded.&nbsp; (Neverwinter
Vault has a short tutorial on <a href="http://www.neverwinterhaven.com/features/features.phtml?id=139669&amp;language=en">how
to add modules to your game</a> so that you can play them; for links of places
to download modules, see my <a href="http://www.servantsofmystery.com/fathermatt/nwn.htm#Modules"><font color="#0000CC">Modules</font></a>
section.)&nbsp;&nbsp;Create your DM character and then play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p align="left">1.&nbsp; <b><a name="Login Account">Login Account</a>.&nbsp; </b>I recommend that you set up
a new login account--separate from your player account--on the Player Login
screen using the Create New Account button. (You can use the same password for
both accounts but you will have to switch the name depending on whether you log
in as a player or a DM.)&nbsp; The reason for a separate name is that when you
first enter the game your login name is shown.&nbsp; While I certainly hope to
establish a reputation as a good DM, I do not want players knowing my player
identity when I DM.&nbsp; In other words, I want my DM identity to be completely
separate from my player identities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">2.&nbsp; <b><a name="General Approach">General Approach</a>.&nbsp; </b>As the DM guides
suggest, the DM's purpose is not to make matters impossible--or too easy--for
the players, but to make them interesting.&nbsp; Also, while at times it is
necessary to talk to the players, I recommend that this be kept toward the
minimum needed.&nbsp; First, you'll find yourself too busy to talk much; second,
in my view a DM who talks too much interferes with the players' enjoyment of the
game.&nbsp; Roleplaying as a DM is recommended, however.&nbsp; I play a goddess
as a DM, but you might also cast yourself as a spirit advisor, a ghost, a guide
from another plane etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">3.&nbsp; <b><a name="Moving Yourself">Moving Yourself</a>.</b>&nbsp; As you know from the
feature descriptions, you can jump to whatever building etc. that you want by
using the Chooser.&nbsp; (Click Chooser, select the building, then click the
GoTo icon in the Chooser menu.) You can jump to wherever a player is by right-clicking
on that player's portrait and then clicking the Northeast icon.&nbsp; If you
pull up the map, you can go to any point
by double-clicking there.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to teleport over a wall,
right-click the spot you want to jump to then click the Northwest (Jump to
Point) icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">4.&nbsp; <b><a name="Moving Others">Moving Others</a>.&nbsp; </b>If you want to bring ALL
players to you, right-click on the main screen and click on the South (6:00)
icon.&nbsp; If you want to move a single player, you'll need to take control of
that player with full DM powers (right-click him/her, click on the South (6:00)
&quot;Take Control&quot; icon, then on the East (3:00) &quot;Take Control Full Powers&quot; icon); after
that, move as you would as a DM.&nbsp; To release, right-click on the player,
then click the South (6:00) icon to unpossess.&nbsp; (You can create and
practice on an NPC.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">5.&nbsp; <b><a name="Difficulty Slider">Difficulty Slider</a>.</b>&nbsp; Remember, the
Difficulty Slider affects the whole module, not just those players in your
immediate vicinity.&nbsp; If you are going to increase it, you may want to first
make sure that no one is in combat, and then tell everyone that the difficulty
is being increased.&nbsp; (You can roleplay this, of course:&nbsp;
&quot;Beware!&nbsp; An evil spell has just been cast over the area that grants opponents more strength.&quot;)</p>
<p align="left">6.&nbsp; <b><a name="Healing and Resurrection">Healing and
Resurrection</a>.&nbsp; </b>If you introduce a monster that
may be too tough--or if you have newbies involved or the players are in an area
where they can't rest--you'll probably want to heal.&nbsp; One way to heal is to
right-click on the player portrait, then click on
the East&nbsp; (3:00) icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;The heal power also has been set up in
the Quick Bar for the F4 key.&nbsp; Of course, dying is part of the game and
you often have to let players die, particularly when they do something
foolish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To resurrect, all you need to do is
use the Heal function on the corpse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">7.&nbsp; <b><a name="Creatures">Adding Creatures</a>.</b>&nbsp; As you know, you can--and
should--add creatures to your DM Quick Bar, as this gives you a way of quickly
adding creatures to the area.&nbsp; Note that there will be few if any custom
creatures unless the builder has added them, so start with the standard
ones.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the names of the creatures are not shown on the Quick
Bar!&nbsp; As a result, be sure to keep track of them using the traditional
AD&amp;D approach:&nbsp; pen and paper!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often you'll find that a creature
you want to introduce has a level too low or too high for the players you are
working with.&nbsp; To add or subtract levels from a creature, right-click the
creature, click the Northwest icon and click the Southwest&nbsp; icon; then
click the Southeast icon to increase its levels or the South icon to decrease
them.&nbsp; An alternative, if you have a creature of too low a level, is to put
it on your Quick Bar and create several at once.&nbsp; One bugbear may not be
enough, but three may be; one stirge may be laughable, but 15 may get some
attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also talk through a creature
by possessing it.&nbsp; (Right-click the creature, click on the South (6:00)
&quot;Take Control&quot; icon, then on the East (3:00) &quot;Take Control Full Powers&quot;
icon.)&nbsp; Of course, roleplay the creature:&nbsp; it's always fun to have
your dragon say something like &quot;You are puny, mortals, but I am hungry and you will tide
me over until the next meal!&quot;&nbsp; (To release, right-click on the creature, then click the South (6:00) icon.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can give a creature weapons,
shields and armor, but the process is cumbersome.&nbsp; Use the creature and use
the mouse pointer to create the item &quot;on&quot; the creature--and the item
will wind up in the creature's inventory.&nbsp; You can then take possession of
the creature, open its inventory and equip the item.&nbsp; Note that items you
give a creature will not drop when it dies, but vanish instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To kill a creature, right-click on it, then click on the Southeast
icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">8.&nbsp; <b><a name="Rewards">Rewards</a>.</b>&nbsp; If the loot drops do not seem
sufficient, you can use the Creator function to create additional items.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(Again, try the standard items first, rather than the custom
ones.)&nbsp; Of course, you can also drag and drop items to your Quick Bar for
repeated use.&nbsp; (Write down what each one is!)&nbsp; While you can also give gold
or items to a creature, unfortunately they will not drop when the creature
dies.&nbsp; One way to deal with this is to keep some gems (or other items) on
you Quick Bar, and create them on the spot where a creature dies; if you do this
immediately after the creature dies, it will look to the players as if the
creature dropped the item.&nbsp; (Gold does not work well as a reward, since you
can only drop it one piece at a time.)&nbsp; Keep the rewards
appropriate, of course, rather than giving too much.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">9.&nbsp; <b><a name="Spells">Spells</a>.</b>&nbsp; Don't try to cast spells from the
radial menu you get by clicking yourself or the main screen:&nbsp; only some
spells are available and targeting is not possible.&nbsp; Instead, add spells
you want to use to your Quick Bar as follows:&nbsp; right-click <b>on an empty
slot in you Quick Bar</b>, click the Northwest icon, then the Northeast icon,
then the South icon; click the class you want, the spell level you want and the
spell you want--and it will appear on your Quick Bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, if you
take control of a spell-caster, the spell-caster's spells will automatically
appear on your Quick Bar; you can also access the spells through the spells
button under the portrait.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">10.&nbsp; <b><a name="Crashes and Levels">Crashes and Levels</a>.&nbsp; </b>I have been involved in crashes
where players lost levels they had gained since the last game save.&nbsp; To add
levels to a player, right-click the player, click the Northwest icon, click the
Southwest icon, then click the Southeast icon.&nbsp; Of course, this should only
be done after crashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">11.&nbsp; <b><a name="PvP">PvP</a>.</b>&nbsp; I realize there's an overpowering
urge to intervene, but it's not fair (unless all concerned approve it in
advance).&nbsp; PvP is part of the game, and a DM should not take sides.&nbsp;
The one exception I might make is if high-level evil players are ganging up on
newbies.&nbsp; Other than that, stay out of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">12.&nbsp; <b><a name="Retrieval from Limbo">Retrieval from Limbo</a></b>.&nbsp;
To retrieve a creature or player you've placed in limbo, open the Chooser,
scroll down to the bottom, click on Limbo, click on Creatures, then click on the
individual creature or player.&nbsp; Click on Jump, then click in the main
window where you want the creature or player to materialize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">13.&nbsp; <b><a name="Communication">Communication</a>.</b>&nbsp;
Note that if you are working with a group, you will not be able to hear anything
they say in Party mode.&nbsp; You likely will want to let them know
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you need to talk to an NPC, right-click on the NPC, click
the Northwest icon, click the next Northwest icon, then click the top
icon.&nbsp; There is no need to become visible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
