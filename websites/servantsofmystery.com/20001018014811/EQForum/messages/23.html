: to get to GUK from Freeport;
: travel to NRO and head for the water
: follow the water till you zone
: this will be the Oasis region follow the water till you reach the mountain follow it to the right till you reach a gap - enter it
: you will zone to SRO
: this zone is good to hunt also - dervish bandits
: head right once you zone 
: follow the wall into the green area (leaving the desert - still in the same zone)
: you will travel along the wall avoiding the orc camps stay close to the wall
: you will encounter a passage (its green and hard to see unless you stay on the wall)
: this will be kitty corner to the spot you zoned into SRO from
: enter this passage and welcome to the Troll Swamps (zone)
: turn left and follow the wall in the swamps
: the entire zone is a large circle with hills marking the edge
: once travelling left along the wall you will encounter a passage up a bit on the wall but very obvious
: enter this and zone into GUK
: warning dont travel too far past the entrance to the dungeon - the troll city is along the same wall further down (5 minute run past it)
: good luck
