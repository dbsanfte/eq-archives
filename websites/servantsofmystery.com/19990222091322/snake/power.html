<PRE><B>     As day broke over the quiet city of Neverwinter, a loud</B>
<B>crash came from the Tower of Mysteries, home of the Servants of</B>
<B>Mystery.  Neranek stalked down the halls of the Tower, searching</B>
<B>out the cause of the noise.  Stopping by the kitchen, he heard</B>
<B>the crash of a dish shattering.  Mumbling softly to himself, Ner</B>
<B>pushed the door open to the kitchen and was taken aback at what</B>
<B>he saw.  This one's appetite never ceases to amaze me, he</B>
<B>thought.</B>


<B>     There, sitting on the kitchen table was the Servants very</B>
<B>own diminutive, blue warrior.  Som Smurf looked up as Neranek</B>
<B>swept into the room and waved for Neranek to join him.  Sighing,</B>
<B>Neranek carefully stepped around the broken dishes that always</B>
<B>seemed to accompany Smurf's attempts at cooking.  As he rounded</B>
<B>the table to take a seat, Neranek tripped and fell.  A series of</B>
<B>cans, stacked to form stairs up to the table, went flying out</B>
<B>from under Neranek's feet.  </B>


<B>     Smurf could hardly contain himself.  He rolled about on the</B>
<B>table holding his little belly while shouting "good job Grace!" </B>
<B>Neranek blew out a long breath and kicked the last can out from</B>
<B>under foot and pulled himself up to the table.  Sliding over into</B>
<B>an oak chair, Neranek tipped his head at the Smurf.</B>


<B>"Why must you make such a racket at this time of the day, Smurf?"</B>
<B>Neranek inquired.  "Haven't we already discussed the rules of the</B>
<B>kitchen."</B>


<B>"Yah, but they don't apply when me belly is empty" came Smurf's</B>
<B>reply as he pointed to his stomach.</B>


<B>"What exactly is that you are eating?"  All Neranek could see in</B>
<B>Smurf's tiny bowl were little red and blue puffs of some type.</B>


<B>"Tis me crunch, of course." Smurf replied, completely oblivious</B>
<B>to Neranek's disgusted look.  "Tis the food of the Gods, why even</B>
<B>old rotten face eats 'em.  You know, Cyr.."</B>


<B>     Smurf's voice was cut short as Ner stood and slammed both</B>
<B>hands down on the table shattering it.  "Enough," shouted the</B>
<B>mage, "you do not understand what you are doing by tossing about</B>
<B>that name so carelessly."</B>


<B>     Smurf noticed that Neranek carried a dangerous edge in his</B>
<B>voice now and decided not to press his luck.  Instead, he sat up</B>
<B>from his new position on the floor and began to scoop his spilled</B>
<B>cereal back into his bowl.  "You didn't have to spill me crunch,</B>
<B>ya know."</B>


<B>     A long-wracking cough spilled from Neranek's lips and he</B>
<B>gripped the counter top for strength.  Smurf looked up oddly at</B>
<B>Ner and wondered what was wrong.  The coughing spell seemed to go</B>
<B>on for some time, until the cleric-mage finally straightened back</B>
<B>up and turned towards the Smurf.  "Perhaps, there is yet time. </B>
<B>Come with me, Smurf, and I will show you the power that words can</B>
<B>hold."  Neranek knelt and thrust his hand, palm up, towards</B>
<B>Smurf.  Smurf looked at the hand dubiously until, finally, he</B>
<B>shrugged and climbed up in Neranek's hand.  I didn't have</B>
<B>anything better to do anyway, Smurf thought.</B>


<B>     The mage stood and lightly closed his hand around the Smurf.</B>


<B>Smurf's tiny blue form was an odd contrast in color against the</B>
<B>shifting, shimmering blackness that formed Ner's displacer cloak.</B>


<B>Ner then turned and walked out of the room, stepping carefully</B>
<B>over the cans, that never seemed to stop rolling about the floor.</B>


<B>He entered the winding hallway and took a path that led out of</B>
<B>the tower.</B>


<B>     Some minutes later, the stunning form of the Lady Talia came</B>
<B>rushing down the corridor in her bathrobe with her sword belt in</B>
<B>her hand.  Her crimson hair was wet and plastered against her</B>
<B>neck.  Her purple eyes searched out the corridor, always on guard</B>
<B>against trouble.  She came to a sudden halt as she spotted</B>
<B>several drops of blood leading away from the kitchen.  Kneeling,</B>
<B>she touched a fingertip to the blood and smeared it.  Hmm, still</B>
<B>warm she thought.  Standing, the lady paladin, drew her sword and</B>
<B>placed the scabbard and belt down in the hallway.  She stalked</B>
<B>towards the kitchen more cautiously than before.  </B>


<B>     Reaching the door, she paused.  With a sudden flurry of</B>
<B>activity, she pushed the door open and charged into the room. </B>
<B>About two steps in, she stepped on a can and went flying across</B>
<B>the room.  She landed with a crash against the far wall.  Her</B>
<B>wet, crimson hair spilled down covering her face.  She pushed her</B>
<B>hair back in annoyance.  Smurf must have been in here, she mused.</B>


<B>He'll rue the day, I catch up to him for leaving this mess.  Just</B>
<B>then the door pushed open again and Som Lynx came bounding in.</B>


<B>"Lynx, Watch out" cried out Talia, already to late to stop Lynx. </B>
<B>Lynx hit the rolling cans and went sailing across the room, feet</B>
<B>kicking.  Lynx came to a stop upon the sprawled form of Talia. </B>
<B>The impact knocked Talia's hair back down over her face. </B>


<B>     Looking up sheepishly, Lynx blew the hair back out of</B>
<B>Talia's eyes with a puff of warm air.  "Jell-o there," he greeted</B>
<B>her.  "I heard a commotion and came to investigate.  Mystery</B>
<B>solved, Smurf must have been having breakfast again."</B>


<B>          Talia snorted in amusement.  "A most logical</B>
<B>conclusion, my friend.  But whose blood do you suppose this is?" </B>
<B>Talia held out her finger for Lynx.  Lynx put his face right up</B>
<B>against here finger and paused.  "It is Neranek's!" he said with</B>
<B>some surprise.</B>


<B>"Indeed, I wonder what is afoot between the Smurf and Ner?"</B>


<B>     Meanwhile oblivious to Talia and Lynx's discovery, Neranek</B>
<B>and Smurf travelled a short distance away from the Tower.  </B>


<B>"Are we there yet?" piped up Smurf.</B>


<B>A sigh escaped Ner.  "No" was his only reply as he quickened his</B>
<B>pace.</B>


<B>     Passing out of Neverwinter, the pair travelled to the south</B>
<B>for most of the morning.  By mid-day, Smurf began to notice that</B>
<B>Neranek's paced had slowed considerably.  Coming out of a grove</B>
<B>of elms, a dark cave lay before them.  Casting a Light spell on</B>
<B>Smurf's hat, Neranek thrust him forward using him as a torch as</B>
<B>they entered the cave.</B>


<B>     Smurf was puzzled by his friends quiet behavior.  Neranek</B>
<B>was usually a bit more talkative than this, he thought.  He has</B>
<B>barely said two words to me on the whole trip.  Odd.</B>


<B>     After travelling about ten minutes into the deep cave,</B>
<B>Neranek sat down upon the hard, stone ground.  He released Smurf</B>
<B>and sat him down on the ground in front of him.  "Now, I feel</B>
<B>that you have progressed far enough in your studies to learn a</B>
<B>powerful form of magic."</B>


<B>     Smurf looked at Neranek in surprise.  Neranek was so usually</B>
<B>close-mouthed about sharing his secrets that Smurf was taken</B>
<B>aback.  "Really?"</B>


<B>     Neranek tipped his head towards Smurf and nodded slowly</B>
<B>once.  "Really.  In this cave lies an ancient and great power,</B>
<B>but that can only be freed by an equally great power."  Neranek</B>
<B>reached into his cloak and found his bag of holding.  Reaching</B>
<B>within, he removed a small apple and began to toss it into the</B>
<B>air and catch it.</B>


<B>     "Now Smurf, you seem to have a penchant for calling out the</B>
<B>name of the Dark Lord, why don't you oblige me now?  What was his</B>
<B>name again? Oldy Moldy or something wasn't it?"</B>


<B>     As Smurf began to speak, Neranek tensed.  "Nah, Ner, you</B>
<B>know that it isn't that, it is Cyr..."  Smurf choked in surprise</B>
<B>as Neranek shoved the apple he had been tossing into Smurf's</B>
<B>mouth, cutting him off in mid-word.  </B>


<B>     "..trobellus," the cleric-mage finished for the cut-off</B>
<B>Smurf.  A deep rumble passed through the ground beneath them.</B>


<B>Smurf looked confused and spit the apple from his mouth.  "Hey</B>
<B>now, that wasn't nice and it isn't Cyrtrowhateveryousaid, either,</B>
<B>it is Cyric."</B>


<B>Neranek didn't seem to notice his companions indignation. </B>
<B>Instead his attention was focused on the dark passageway that</B>
<B>continued down further into the cave.  Just then a shudder ran</B>
<B>through the cave.  </B>


<B>"Umm, Ner, is this cave safe?"  Smurf questioned while slapping</B>
<B>his hand down on the cave floor.</B>


<B>"Of course it is.  Why wouldn't it be?  All we have done is say a</B>
<B>name right?"  was Neranek's reply before another bout of coughing</B>
<B>seized him.  "Of course, that one word happened to be a name and</B>
<B>an ancient one at that.  One I used long ago in this cave."</B>


<B>"And what does that have to do with the floor shaking?"</B>


<B>"Everything," Neranek replied in his typically cryptic voice. </B>
<B>"Observe," he said as he pointed down into the cave.</B>


<B>     Turning to look, Smurf was surprised to see an eerie glow</B>
<B>coming down the darkened cave.  The glow was getting brighter in</B>
<B>time with the rumbles that shook the floor of the cave.  Smurf</B>
<B>began to piece it together.  Something big is coming, he thought.</B>


<B>     Smurf shot a look over to Neranek who seemed to be totally</B>
<B>unconcerned.  Suddenly, the bony head of a large dragon came into</B>
<B>the enlarged area of the cave.  The head was followed by the body</B>
<B>and tail of a large dragon or rather what was once a dragon.  The</B>
<B>ancient dracoliche turned his bony head to look at the smurf and</B>
<B>the mage.  Smurf surmised that it must have been a red one</B>
<B>judging on what few scales remained on it's bony frame.</B>


<B>"Hello Cyrtrobellus, you are looking well," Neranek quipped.</B>


<B>The undead dragon moved his head until it was nearly on top of</B>
<B>Neranek.  Smurf skittered back out of the way.  No way am I going</B>
<B>to sit that close to something that spits fire, he thought.</B>


<B>Neranek appeared non-plussed and reached out a hand to pet the</B>
<B>drach on the head.  "I am sorry to have disturbed you from your</B>
<B>slumber, but I have need of you again.  You know when we began</B>
<B>this together that I told you I would only wake you for two</B>
<B>reasons.  The first, if I found a way to remove you from the</B>
<B>undead state which you despise.  The second being I had need of</B>
<B>your powerful services and only when the situation was most</B>
<B>dire."</B>


<B>"I fear that I have yet to solve the riddle of your state, so I</B>
<B>can not offer you the complete sleep that you crave. </B>
<B>Unfortunately, I have need of your assistance.  A war is coming</B>
<B>Cyrtrobellus, and I may not survive what is to come.  If I were</B>
<B>to fall while you were still under my spell which allows you some</B>
<B>partial measure of sleep, you might continue in that state</B>
<B>forever.  Far too cruel of a fate for you, my old friend.</B>


<B>Smurf was startled to see the drach hang it's head and then shake</B>
<B>it in agreement.  </B>


<B>"I have awakened you now, to give you time to gather your</B>
<B>strength.  Again, I apologize, noble red, that I have yet to</B>
<B>solve the riddle of your existence.  Know that I will search to</B>
<B>the ends of Toril to end your suffering."</B>


<B>     With that, Neranek reached into his cloak and flung part of</B>
<B>it aside.  For a brief instant, Smurf saw bandages soaked with</B>
<B>blood, before Neranek pulled out a bag and drew his cloak shut. </B>
<B>The mage set the bag down in front of the dracoliche. </B>


<B>     "Here are some powerful magical items for you to devour. </B>
<B>They should help with your recovery.  You will know when the time</B>
<B>is right to come for me, Cyrtrobellus."  Neranek stood for a</B>
<B>moment looking longingly at the ancient dracoliche.  He reached</B>
<B>out a hand and ran it gently down the side of the drac's muzzle. </B>
<B>"Till then," he said and turned to leave.</B>


<B>     Stooping down to pick up the still-gaping smurf, Neranek</B>
<B>continued out of the cave, back into the warm sunlight.  Pausing,</B>
<B>Neranek gave a meaningful look to Smurf.  "Do you understand now,</B>
<B>what power names can hold?  The one I invoked has brought awake</B>
<B>an old friend who now must suffer once more until I am strong</B>
<B>enough again to put her back into her fugue state.  The one you</B>
<B>bandy about can do so much more.  Be careful, Smurf."</B>


<B>     As Neranek began to continue on the path back towards the</B>
<B>Tower, Smurf had time to think.</B>


<B>"Ner, ya know what?  You keep strange company."</B>


<B>Neranek stumbled at that.  A low chuckle escaped him.  "Really</B>
<B>Smurf, you don't say."</B>


<B>"yah, and why didn't you tell me while we were in there that your</B>
<B>friend was a she?"</B>


<B>Sighing, Neranek continued home while ignoring the question.</B>


<B>---------------------------------------------------------------</B>


<B>Meanwhile in Windycliffs, an elderly couple walking along the</B>
<B>path outside of the inn are startled to find a gibbering man</B>
<B>dressed in black Sembian Silk.  Stopping to help him, they escort</B>
<B>him on to the Healer in Neverwinter City.  Little do they know</B>
<B>what evil they are unleashing.</B>
