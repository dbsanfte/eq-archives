Brewing is one of the easier trades to learn in EverQuest, and as such, it is not one of the most profitable.  However, there is a curious satisfaction to combining brewing ingredients in a brewing bucket and watching a tankard of ale or a bottle of wine appear!  If you are ready to spend a little money, a few practice points, and a bit of time to master the craft, you can become a Master Brewer, capable of making a variety of drinks to suit all occassions.<BR>
<BR>
Before you get started, you should know that if you are looking for quick profits, brewing is not the trade for you.  Many of the concoctions you can brew cannot be sold to NPCs for a profit, so you can expect to lose money at first.  With that caveat, let's examine how you should get your start in brewing.<BR>
<BR>
Getting Started  --  The first thing you should do before starting a career in Brewing is locate a source of brewing ingredients.  I know of two NPC vendors that sell brewing supplies.  One of these is the now-famed Krystin Charcoal, who can be found in West Freeport, by taking the first left turn as you enter from the West Gate.  She stands at the top of the first hill on the road leading to North Freeport.  She'll sell you Barley, Hops, Rice, Yeast, Wine Yeast, and Malt. She doesn't sell Casks or Bottles, and she doesn't sell a Brewing book. Casks and Bottles can be bought from NPC Innkeepers or other vendors, as can Flasks of Water (you cannot use summoned water for brewing).  Apparently the Brewer's Limerick book can only be found in the dwarven city of Kaladim.  There is a Brewer's Quest that is supposed to give you a Barkeepers Compendium, which starts with a conversation with Gregor, the bartender at the Seafarer's Roost in Freeport, but the quest is broken and doesn't deliver anything that will help you with brewing, although the magic stein it currently gives is a very nice magic item.  There is a REAL Brewer's Quest in Halas, which involves killing three named skeletons (Vengeful Lyricist, Soloist, and one other) to get pages to a book that an NPC in a tavern in Halas seeks...when you give her the three pages, she gives you one of a couple different books containing brewing recipes.  If you have the <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/brewtab.html"> recipes </A> from this site, you won't need recipe books.  The other known vendor of brewing supplies is Heidi Grainsifter of South Qeynos.  She can be found at Voleen's Baked Goods, which is just East of the Qeynos Port Authority, right next to Fish's Ale House.  She sells the same ingredients as Krystin Charcoal.  Grapes can be purchased from many NPC vendors for about 2 silver and 2 copper pieces.  Casks from NPC tavernkeepers will run you about 3 silver and 3 copper, and bottles can be bought for about 6 copper.  Foraged ingredients like Berries or Fruit cannot be bought from NPCs and must either be Foraged for or bought or begged from other players.  Other special ingredients, like Fire Beetle Eye and Snake Scales, can usually be obtained by hunting.<BR>
<BR>
It is a good idea to use some practice points to increase your Brewing skill before you try it, so you can minimize the amount of money you spend failing and losing your ingredients.  I put 19 practice points into it before I ever attempted to brew.  If you don't have that many Practice points available, any amount of skill you can get without brewing will help keep your overall costs of learning to a minimum.  If you don't want to put any practice points into it, I suggest you start out by brewing Bog Juice, because it is the easiest brew to make and costs very little if you hunt for the Snake Scales yourself.<BR>
<BR>
Aside from the inexpensive juices, getting started in Brewing can be rather costly.  Most starting Brewers who've used practice points to get going make Mead, which requires Hops, Malt, Yeast, and a Cask, for a net cost per batch of about 8 silver and 4 copper.  Unfortunately, You cannot make money brewing Mead, since NPCs only give you about 2 silver and 7 copper for the single bottle the recipe makes, and most players won't buy your brews because they currently have no beneficial effects and do not substitute for water as a drink.  However, Mead does not require much skill to make, so you'll have some success early on if you brew Mead, and your skill rises whether you succeed or fail.  At some point between skill levels 20 and 30, you will start getting a message saying that this is trivial for someone of your skill level.  When that happens, you can no longer advance your Brewing skill by making that particular recipe, so you should switch over to something else.  I recommend switching to Ale (NOT Short Ale) once you reach 'trivialization" of Mead brewing.  This will continue your skill increase and at some point you will begin succeeding at it enough to even make a few coppers profit per batch.  Fish Wine and Gypsy Wine are also worth trying at this point.<BR>
<BR>
How to Brew --- The method of brewing is simple.  Locate a Brewing Bucket, which looks something like an Apollo space capsule with a corkscrew tube sticking out of the top that leads to a barrel.  Appropriately, it resembles a crude still.  Left-click on the bucket to open it, place your ingredients in the spaces, one per space, and click the Combine button. Don't think that stacking more ingredients than one per space will get you more brew, it won't, it will fail and you'll lose ingredients. When you succeed in brewing something, you will get a message saying you have combined the ingredients to make something new, and you'll have a bottle, shotglass, or tankard of your brew attached to your cursor. If you fail, you'll get a message saying that you lacked the skill to successfully combine the ingredients, and you'll get back a portion of what you put in...in my experience, you get the cask or bottle back, which makes a certain amount of sense.  If you use a combination of ingredients that doesn't make any existing brew, you get a message saying those ingredients do not combine in those amounts to make anything...and they'll disappear.  Once you have your brew, you can drink it by left-clicking on it once, or you can sell it to an NPC or TRY to sell it to a player.  It is very difficult if not impossible to profit from Brewing until you reach a moderately high skill level.  Fortunately, brewing skill grows fast, so you can move on the more profitable brews pretty quickly.<BR>
<BR>
Once you've honed your brewing skill by brewing Mead and Ale, you can try some of the tougher brews, like Ogre Swill or Ol'Tujims Fierce Brew.  Finding Froglok meat for Ogre Swill brewing may seem a major obstacle, but Frogloks can be found in the sewers of Qeynos and Freeport, and probably other cities as well, you don't have to go all the way to Innothule to find them  When you kill a froglok, you will often find a tongue on the body, which will be called "undead froglok tongue".  I've also seen them on NPC vendors who acquired them by buying them from players.  These are the only "froglok meat" I have ever seen, so I assume these are what you use to make Ogre Swill (I haven't made any yet).
<BR>
<BR>
Wine making  --  This is the most profitable side of Brewing in EverQuest.  As the <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/brewtab.html"> recipe </A> tables show, wines consistently sell to NPC vendors for more than they cost to make, unlike most of the beers and meads you can make.  Assuming, that is, that you get the special ingredients free, which is likely to be doable for most of them.  All wine recipes use grapes and a bottle, most also use wine yeast.  There are different special ingredients for each wine, most of which must be obtained through foraging, hunting, or fishing.  It thus takes a little more effort to make wines, you can't just run back and forth between Krystin Charcoal and the Brewing Bucket at the Hogcaller's Inn in West Freeport, or between Heidi Grainsifter and the Brewing bucket at Fish's Ale House in South Qeynos.  However, if you want to make money Brewing, this is really the only viable way to do it right now, especially since the EQ programmers cut the number of kegs of Ol'Tujims Fierce Brew made per batch from 5 to 2.<BR>
<BR>
Juice making  --  There are several recipes for Juices available now.  The basic ingredients for any Juice are a Flask of Water and a bottle, plus some unique special ingredient.  Because they require fewer and cheaper ingredients, making Juices is easy, and the expense is so low that it can even be slightly profitable.  I doubt it would be a good way to raise skill, it is probably too easy, although I can't say at what skill level it becomes trivial.  I first made Bog Juice yesterday, but my Brewing skill was already at 92, so it was, of course, "trivial."<BR>
<BR>
Gnomish Spirits, which is sort of in between a wine and a juice, is profitable and raises skill even at high levels, but you won't be able to make it efficiently until you get to a moderately high level in Brewing.  It's also more expensive to make than most other things you can brew, because the cost of Rice is pretty high (about 7 silver per bag), but it makes a profit once your efficiency gets up there.  It's possible that you could actually sell Gnomish Spirits to players who are working on Tinkering, since it is a component of several tinkered items, which could make it even more profitable.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this guide helps you get your Brewing career going.  Enjoy!<BR>
