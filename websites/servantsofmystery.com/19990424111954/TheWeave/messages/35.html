Last I checked ye were just Oof-Ack, but I do remember some Moof's running around as well.<p>Sorry lad, but my memory has been fried ;/<p>: I've been doing very well, keeping out of trouble and been pretty busy with various Quake activities.  I'm thinking that would be the reason my UIN info was so interesting. Changed my info when I joined a clan.  Still with SSB though I am not involved in any games SSB is.  The only "rpg" I play is BG and now I've started to PVP other folk on campus here.  As Ner told me last nite, PVP has finally returned to the Forgotten Realms.<p>: It is good to see you are still around.  Aint enuf OOF-ACK's left.  Do you remember if i was MOOF of OOF or MOOF-ACK of OOF-ACK?<p>
