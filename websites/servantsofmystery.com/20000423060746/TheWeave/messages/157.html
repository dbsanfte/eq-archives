Hail!  Things are going well in EQ.  Many old friends have now returned, and a few Servants have departed for various personal reasons.  People seem to like EQ much more than any of the other games we've tried recently.  The hardware requirements are the steepest of anyh of the games we've played so far (Minimum: P 166+, 32 MB RAM, 3D accelerator card with 4 MB VRAM, ~650MB free hard disk space), but this will soon be dwarfed by the hardware required for Middle Earth :-).  Still, it's a pretty well-built game, there seem to be very few serious bugs, the visual impact is good without being gory, and the game world is big enough to keep you busy for a while.  If your machine will run it, give it a try, we play on the Cazic-Thule server.  I warn you, more RAM than the 32 MB minimum will make you a lot happier, especially with zone changes.  I have 80 MB now and I'm a lot happier than I was when it was taking over two minutes to change zones.<p>I'm sure it's very lonely in UO now.  There aren't many SOMs with accounts anymore, about the only one who's really active there is Ftf, and he's formed his own Guild now, Keepers of the Faith.  He's out of town until later next month, though.  Iadris and I are still running our shop in Minoc, but we are probably not going to keep it open much longer.  Last night I was shopping for reagents for my vendor and had a pile of ginseng stolen while trying to buy from a shopkeeper, and it reminded me of why everybody left UO in the first place.  There's none of that in EQ unless you choose to become PvP+, and if you don't, nobody can touch your possessions unless you give consent to have your body looted by a selected character.  So far the contrast in attitudes between UO and EQ has been staggering, it just makes it even more clear how flawed UO is.<p>Good to hear from you again, keep in touch even if you decide not to play EQ.<p>May Mystra guide thy magics!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>Snake
