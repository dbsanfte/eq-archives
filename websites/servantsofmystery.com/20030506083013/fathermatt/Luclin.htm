<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Passage to Luclin</font></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>Transportation.</b>&nbsp; To reach Luclin, you need to travel to one of the following four
sets of wizard spires (one for each continent except Velious):&nbsp; North Karana, Toxxulia
Forest, Greater
Faydark, Dreadlands.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of each set of spires is an NPC called &quot;Nexus
Scion&quot; whom you need to /hail.&nbsp; The Scion will then give you a
shard.&nbsp; The teleport to Luclin happens every 15 minutes.&nbsp; To go you
need to be within the four spires and have the shard somewhere on your
person.&nbsp; The Scions announce the time to the next teleport just as the
captains announce the arrival and departure of boats.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Maps.</b>&nbsp; Before you go, be sure to get some decent maps.&nbsp; The ones
at <a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/atlas.html">EQ Atlas</a> are good; scroll
down to Luclin and look in the cities category.&nbsp; The maps you'll need to
start are
for the Nexus, Shadow Haven and the Bazaar (where the stables are
located).&nbsp; The teleport takes you to the Nexus, the arrival spot in Luclin.&nbsp;
From there you can take passageways that teleport you to the Bazaar (south
passageway) and Shadow
Haven (east passageway), as well as to the Netherbian Lair.&nbsp; These
passageways also contain
small sets of wizard spires that will take you to any of the four sets of pre-Luclin
wizard spires listed above.&nbsp; (This means that those classes without
teleport abilities can now go between most of the continents without using a
boat or hitching a ride.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Misleading Information.</b>&nbsp; Warning:&nbsp; the maps in the Tome of Lore and Game Manual
brochures that come with the Luclin CD's are NOT accurate:&nbsp; at least two of
the key passages are wrong and the Game Manual has several of the
buildings identified incorrectly.&nbsp; For example, these maps show a passage
leading from the north of the Nexus (then East) to the Bazaar.&nbsp; This
passage does not exist; if you go north from the Nexus, you teleport to the
Netherbian Lair.&nbsp; Also, the passage from Shadow Haven to the Bazaar is
shown in the wrong location:&nbsp; it is NOT north of the Hall of
Prospects.&nbsp; Instead it is north of a sunken area between the Hall of
Prospects and Fordel Manor.&nbsp; (If you wind your way east from the Hall of
Prospects, just past the relatively narrow passage you reach a tavern call
Shandeling's Roost. The passageway to the Bazaar is due north of there.)</p>
<p align="left"><b>Spells.</b>&nbsp; The new ranger, druid, shaman and beastlord spells can be found in the
Hall of Prospects in Shadow Haven.&nbsp; (Go to the back of the room and step on the teleport
rectangle; to return, click on the tree.)&nbsp; The new enchanter, wizard and
magician spells are located in the Library in Shadow Haven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Necro spells
are in the Echo Cavern zone.&nbsp; From Shadow Haven, enter the door at about
+250, +1700.&nbsp; Once inside, turn left and go through two false wooden walls,
then zone into Echo Cavern.Zone.&nbsp; Make a right at the &quot;T&quot;.&nbsp;
When you come to a rock wall at the end of the corridor, look to the left and
click on the small stone that is at about eye level on the wall--and end of the
corridor will slide back.&nbsp; Proceed to the canvas huts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><b>Vendors, Factions and Quests.</b>&nbsp; Many of the vendors in Shadow Haven will
refuse to do business with you at first.&nbsp; To overcome this, do the <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1449"> Traders of the Haven Quest</a>
(Trade Commissioner), written up by Allakhazam.&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing this quest and
<u> wearing</u> the Amulet of the Haven
that you earn, you will be able to buy from many merchants who otherwise will not deal
with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commissioner Henry is located
in Shadow Haven just inside a building at about -400, +400.&nbsp; Sateal
Deirosap is in the merchant building in the Bazaar at approximately -725,
-40.&nbsp; To reach Thar Anton, from Shadow Haven&nbsp; enter the door at about
+250, +1700.&nbsp; Once inside, turn left and go through two false wooden walls,
then zone into Echo Cavern.&nbsp; You may well want to Invis or Camo here.&nbsp;
At the &quot;T&quot; make a&nbsp; left.&nbsp; Continue more or less straight (do
not go through the tattered curtain) and go through the huge double
doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue on until you reach a room with tentacles coming from
the ceiling and one wall.&nbsp; Go right, then take the next left.&nbsp; After
wading through lots of water, you will zone to Fungus Grove.&nbsp; Thar Anton is
a ways down the cave at approximately -1,320, -840 in a raised building on the
left.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other quests that are
relatively easy to do are <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1450">Hardam's
Goods</a> (very easy) and <a href="http://eqdb.allakhazam.com/quest.html?quest=1472">Mistala's
Report</a> (aka the Smugglers Reports), which is purportedly strong on the
faction increase, both written up by Allakhazam.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the Hardam's Goods quest,
Hardam can be found in the area just south of where the Nexus portal drops you
in Shadow Haven.&nbsp; Take the stone steps up on the left; Hardam can be found
in a building at -300, +1470.&nbsp; Faeroi can be found in the Bazaar at -600,
+150.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mistala can be found at
+20, +225 in Shadow Haven; the entrance to the building where she is located is
at +60, +40.&nbsp; To reach Lieutenant Broansas, travel through the Netherbian
Lair (just take the main corridor all the way through)--you may well want to
Invis or Camo first if you can--then you will find him in Dawnshroud Peaks
standing on the side of a hill at -1120, +1530.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If need be, these quests can
run multiple times to gain faction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
