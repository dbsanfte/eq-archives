<p><span class="title">There are new battlefield areas for levels 20-35.&nbsp; </span>For
a map of the new battlezones, head to <!--EZCODE LINK START-->
<a href="http://www.daatlas.com/midgard/murdaigeanmap.html">www.daatlas.com/midgard/murdaigeanmap.html</a>.&nbsp; The map is apparently identical for all three zones, although which
realm holds which fort changes with each of the three battlefields.&nbsp; One
caution:&nbsp; if you print the map in black and white, it tends not to show the
third portal fort (a fort where one realm teleports in).&nbsp; The third portal
fort (&quot;pf&quot;) is&nbsp; south of&nbsp; the main keep in the middle, up
against the mountains there and is fuschia; the other two portal forts are shown
in pink.&nbsp; (The main keep in the middle can change &quot;ownership&quot;
depending on which realm successfully takes it in battle.) </p>
<p>In these battlefields (as in all Realm v. Realm combat areas), you do not
suffer any experience penalty if you are killed by the enemy.&nbsp; (You DO
suffer this penalty if killed by a monster, as is usual.)&nbsp; Note that unlike
in non-battleground areas, guards will NOT protect you from monsters--even if
they are the guards to your own realm's fort!&nbsp; You cannot bind in the
battlefield zone, so if you release you will wind up at your last realm bind
point.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To get to these battlegrounds, you need to find the teleportation pad (with a
medallion merchant standing close by) in one of the gate keeps that is an
entrance from your realm to the frontier territories.&nbsp; (In Midgard, this
pad is in the Uppland gate keep; I do not know which are the correct ones for
Albion and Hibernia--shoot me an e-mail if you know.)&nbsp; Buy a medallion from
the merchant, stand on the pad and wait for the next teleport.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you arrive (which is inside the portal fort (&quot;pf&quot;) for your
realm), the first thing to do is to get into the battleground chat group, which
generally includes several player groups.&nbsp; Ask anyone you see (from your
realm, of course!) to ask that you be added to the chat group.&nbsp; If you can't safely locate anyone, use /yell to ask to be added.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once added (you'll see the chat message start), use <b>/c</b> to talk to the
chat group and use <b>/cg who</b> for a list of who is in the chat group.&nbsp;
Once you are in the chat group, if you are not in a player group already, ask
which groups are available to join.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>And here's a reprint from the friendly folks at DAOC:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&quot;We have added two new restricted RvR battlefield zones, which brings
  the total number of Battlefields up to 3. Each is restricted by level. The
  lowest is for levels 20-24, the second for levels 25-29, and the third is for
  levels 30-35. The intent of these battlefields is to provide a training ground
  where lower-level characters can practice and learn RvR tactics without having
  to worry about higher-level players marauding them. Each Battlefield has been
  configured to allow each player approximately 100 enemy &quot;kills&quot;
  before you will no longer be allowed to port there.<br>
  <br>
  The Battlefields are:<br>
  - Caledonia - levels 30 - 35, Realm rank 1, Realm level up to 9;<br>
  - Murdaigean - levels 25 - 29, Realm rank 1, Realm level up to 5;<br>
  - Thidranki - levels 20 - 24, Realm rank 1, Realm level up to 3.<br>
  <br>
  The medallion merchant's speech has been updated to reflect the changes within
  the Battlegrounds. Should you have questions on the function of the portals or
  which battleground your level/realm rank can travel to, please seek him
  out.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See you on the battlefield!<br>
