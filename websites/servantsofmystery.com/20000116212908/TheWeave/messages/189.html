Hail to all.<p>I had the honor of adventuring with some of the Servants last night in PAW.

Later is luck would have it (or the lack there of) I followed the group on a underwater trek. Just a short swim, one I actually made easily. However, upon exiting the water, I must have slipped and fell back in...Taking over 1/2 my hits from falling Damage.<p>Attempting to swim back to the surface I got caught under a ledge or something and could not reach the surface. Alas one really feels stupid when he drowns. To make matters worse, my foolishness got me demoted to 15.<p>Again making the run back to Paw, I had the worst luck possible unable to forage any water my run was dragging to a walk. Then at the worst possible time, my camoflage spell wore off and I was set upon by nasty ogres.<p>Setting out again from Qeynos I again could not find someone willing to help a naked elf with a SoW or even a bit of food so I could at least keep my strength up.  I arrived very late back at the Paw. My comrades having long since retiring for the night. Myself having an early call was way past a time to camp. perhaps this evening I'll attempt to reclaim my body If you are around, hail me I know I would enjoy the company.<p>Lluwen Ranger of the 16...15th Degree<br>
