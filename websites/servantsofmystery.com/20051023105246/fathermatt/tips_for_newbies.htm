<p align="center"><b>FatherMatt's Tips for Newbies</b></p>
<p>*First, go to <a href="http://runescape.com/worldmap.html">http://runescape.com/worldmap.html</a>
to see the main map for Runescape.&nbsp; Bookmark this site and put an icon for
it on your desktop. Always have this open when you play (even if it is minimized
or in the background), because you will be referring to it constantly.</p>
<p>*You start in the town of Lumbridge. By clicking the scroll icon near the
upper right of your game-view window, a small map of the area you are in pops
up.&nbsp; As you travel, go to the red dots and see if there’s anything worth
picking up and reselling.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*As best you can, buy chest and leg armor, a helmet, a shield and a
weapon--even if you are a wizard.&nbsp; Upgrade as you are able.</p>
<p>*There is combat practice room in Varrock across from the bank.&nbsp; Go
there to practice combat safely. You can only earn a certain amount of combat
experience here, and will see a message saying so after you max out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*Eat food between battles to heal, and gather food prior to battle.&nbsp; One
free source:&nbsp; the cabbages from the Draynor Manor field; these not only
heal one hit point but increase your defense by 1 point for a while.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*In any battle, be sure to
run if it looks like you may die--and keep running until you are sure you aren't
being pursued.&nbsp; A good place to begin hunting is across the river from
Lumbridge; goblins are the target. </p>
<p>*You WILL die from time to time.&nbsp; When you die you lose all items on
your person except the three most expensive items, so be sure to always leave
money in the bank to recover from deaths.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*Pick up and bury bones to raise your prayer ability.&nbsp; Remember to renew
your prayer power by clicking on altars.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*As soon as you can get some gold together, do a silk run as set out in <a href="runescape.htm#Money-making">Money-making</a>.
Put 60 back in the bank when done, then go buy better armor, weapon and shield.</p>
<p>*Watch out for scams!&nbsp; They are common and can seem innocent.&nbsp; Read
the <a href="runescape.htm#Scams">Scams</a> section and say &quot;I'm not
interested.&quot;&nbsp; </p>
