Hail!  I have had two requests for the Tower.  I have not responded to either, for several reasons.  I've been trying to decide what should be done with our Britannian assets, and it hasn't been easy.  Basically what it now boils down to is this:  there are two SOM buildings in UO that I am not interested in selling or giving away, the Shrine of Saint Talia and the Tower of Mystery.  At some later date this may change, but for now I do not want to part with these assets, some of us worked very hard for them and I am not ready to let them go yet.  Please don't take it personally, it's not personal at all, I would turn down anybody else who asked for the Tower or the Shrine, too.<p>I'm sorry the fallout from the recent, unfortunate entanglement of interpersonal IC/OOC relationships includes your departure from EQ.  Good luck in Britannia, and may Mystra guide thy magics!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>Snake
