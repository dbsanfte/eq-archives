This is primarily a guide designed for those who are new to having a magician
character, although there are surely some things a more advanced mage will
find useful also.&nbsp; As I gather more material, look for an intermediate
mage guide!
<p>ARMOR. As a general rule, mages can wear only cloth armor. There is
one guide that says that cloth armor offers so little protection that it&#146;s
not worth bothering with. I disagree: when I&#146;m running for the guards with
an angry putrid skeleton in hot pursuit, the extra seconds I get by wearing
cloth armor may make the difference between life and death!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rather than buy the cloth
shirt (AC 3), however, buy the junior apprentice robe (see Neapha Vesturo
at the Herb Jar in Qeynos, for example), which has an AC of 4 and is not
horribly expensive. (The senior apprentice robe, which also increases mana,
costs several plat.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that <a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/wovenarmor.html">http://gameznet.com/eq/equipment/wovenarmor.html</a>
(an EQ&#146;Lizer Web page) states that mages can also wear woven armor, which
is much stronger than cloth (patchwork level). However, it is found in
Upper Guk and therefore generally can be obtained only by higher-level
players.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a more positive note,
here is a composite of two extremely interesting posts on the EQVault Magic
Shop board:
<blockquote>Chanda Miller is an NPC who frequents Qeynos Hills near the
zone to Surefall Glade. She can often be found near the campfire. Chanda
can make you bear hide armor if you provide her with a bear pelt and a
cash compensation. She will not talk to you unless you tell her that her
brother (Baobob) sent you. Ask her about her bear hide armor and she will
fill you in on details regarding the quality and cash requirements for
each piece. You need to give Chandra Miller: 5g and a low quality bear
pelt for a BELT with 4AC (I think); 15g and a med. quality bear pelt for
boots (5AC); 21g and a high quality bear pelt for the cloak which is 6AC.
(Better than a polar bear cloak in terms of AC but without the cold resistance.)
Baobob Miller makes wolf gear but its AC is lower.</blockquote>
WEAPONS. Mages are very limited in the weaponry they can use. The range
weapons (throwing axe, shuriken etc.) that a mage can use are not terribly
appealing given that offensive spells can be thrown a great distance. The
other standard weapons a mage can use are as follows:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dagger 3 damage, 20 delay
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one-handed staff 4 damage,
30 delay
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; worn great staff 5 damage,
28 delay
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; giant snake&#146;s fang 5 damage,
27 delay
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great staff 9 damage, 38
delay
<br>There is also a one-handed Cracked Staff that seems equivalent to the
worn Great Staff when you balance the damages points against the delay
time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The giant snake&#146;s fang usually
is not sold by NPC&#146;s. Instead you have to buy them from players (I&#146;ve seen
them sold usually for 5 gold) or have a friend kill a giant snake.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Qeynos, the Great Staff
is sold by an NPC in the Temple of Life compound, behind a door that looks
like a Persian carpet. Unfortunately, it costs 20p, 3g, 6s, 2c!
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And here is an interesting
diatribe on mage weapons found on the EQ Vault Magic Shop board:
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to check
this place out and find a few hair- raising posts of how &quot;worn great staves
are much kewler for mages!&quot;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, this is VERY
wrong, as a beta tester, and after testing all the weapons myself, I have
to say that great staves are pretty much the WORST weapons for the mage.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It&#146;s easy to see that cracked
staves do more damage than worn great staves: their speed is considerably
faster, and they do only 2 points less damage; the speed factors out the
extra damage &quot;which is negligible&quot;.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Piercing weapons,
I have pretty much decided, are the REAL mage weapons; there are many many
dagger-like weapons with far more power than the staves you will find,
including giant snake fangs and many other magical knives that even exceed
the power of a well-balanced great staff.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is something else
people have not considered at all. Worn great staves level your skill in
2h blunt VERY VERY slow, you will never really max out your skill in it
before the next level unless you spend way too much time at that level
anyway. Piercing weapons, along with having variations that are more powerful
than staves, level EXTREMELY fast; you will always be maxed out in its
skill.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cracked staves do carry
a place with me: because of their extra speed, they level at a good rate
also, and besides, mages just look better with a staff. One thing to remember
is that mages DO get items that they can hold in their extra hand in the
future that will boost stats and do other things. Think about it, is doing
2 more damage worth not getting these extra abilities? If you find an item
or skull you can hold in your free hand that gives you more mana, strength,
stamina, or anything, it will negate losing those two measly points of
damage; it&#146;s not really even 2 points when you factor in the extra speed
of the other weapons.
<p>Of course, this is really for starting mages.&nbsp; Somewhere around
Level 10 to Level 12 you should buy a Runed Totem Staff from a player.&nbsp;
Although prices range from 10 to 40 plat, I would definitely buy at 20
plat and would not pay any more than 25 plat.&nbsp; (Prices may be about
5 plat higher on the continent of Feydwer.)</blockquote>
WHERE TO GET SPELLS/ITEMS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Qeyos, items for the
apprentice mage are found on NPC&#146;s in the Herb Jar, a store next door to
the Hall of Sorcery.&nbsp; Neapha Vesturo sells low-level spells and apprentice
robes there. For training (and higher-level spells) see the mages in the
Hall of Sorcery in the room at the back and to the right. Yestura Rhamrey
provides the training there, and several other NPC&#146;s hold the higher-level
spells.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, you will have to spend
one training point to start your meditation skill.&nbsp; Do not spend any
more than than on it, however, as it rises relatively rapidly.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Erudin &quot;The vast majority
of the spells are in the Erudin Palace in the 'Towers' that serve to hold
your guildmaster. There is also one service representative for each casting
class standing by the water fountain between the Tower that offers an assortment
of spells. The library contains a few more Magician spells up on the 3rd
floor.&quot; (Thanks to Hadrian for this information.)

<p>ELEMENTALS (TYPES AND CONTROL).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been quite a bit
of argumnent over which type of pet to use in what situation.&nbsp; However,
there is a new article on the EQSS site that is definitive (the author
is one of the magic designers for the game!).&nbsp; It is available at
<a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag_dis.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag_dis.shtml</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pets last until you become
invisible (though supposed this will be changed), cross a zone boundary,
log or die--or until it dies from battle. Unfortunately, you cannot use
Bind Wounds or cast Minor Shield on your elemental.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The commands for elementals
(taken from the online game manual at <a href="http://eq.stratics.com/game_manual.shtml#manual">http://eq.stratics.com/game_manual.shtml#manual</a>
are as follows:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>/pet guard here - tells the pet to guard its current location.
<br>/pet guard me - tells the pet to attack anyone that attacks its master,
or that its master attacks.
<br>/pet follow me - tells the pet to follow you.
<br>/pet attack &lt;target&gt; - tells the pet to attack the designated target.
<br>/pet back off - tells the pet to stop its attack.
<br>/pet as you were - returns the pet to neutral, belaying all prior orders.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During Beta the /pet guard me
command would cause your pet to attack good or neutral NPC&#146;s, often resulting
in the owner&#146;s death. This is no longer the case.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My pets follow and guard
me even when I don&#146;t give the &quot;follow me&quot; or &quot;guard me&quot; commands, so the
primary pet commands I use are the &quot;back off&quot;, &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;attack&quot; commands.
(Well, I suppose &quot;follow me&quot; is useful to get your pet to rise from sitting!)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be sure to macro at least
the &quot;back off&quot;, &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;attack&quot; commandsL:&nbsp; you'll need them handy
for battle.&nbsp; Do this by clicking on the Socials bar, then right-clicking
on a predefined command you do not need; the righ-click will open a window
that lets you change both the name and the command. When finished, left-click
on the new command until it &quot;lifts&quot; from the screen, then drag it to the
hotbox slot you want; position it and left-click to drop it.
<p>HUNTING (WITH PETS)
<blockquote>PREPARATION
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carry lots of malachite
(or lapis lazuli if you are level 12 or higher); pets die all the time.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don&#146;t bother giving your
pet a summoned weapon. Although your pet will accept it, it it does not
affect your pet (unlike in Beta, when doing this gave pets extra power).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other classes can cast &quot;buff&quot;
spells on your pet to improve its defenses and power.&nbsp; Ask for this
if in a group.&nbsp; You can also cast certain limited spells like Fire
Shield on your pet.&nbsp; However, at least at the lower levels mages cannot
cast their primary Shield spells on pets (or on other players).
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cast several Summon Bandages
for yourself beforehand; be sure to have the Bind Wound skill macroed.
<p>SCOUTING AND INITIATING
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep a close eye on your
pet while running.&nbsp; Mine have a tendency to lag behind and pick fights
with creatures tougher than both of us.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know exactly where the nearest
guard post or zone border is at all times so you can run there when needed.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Get in the habit of using
/loc regularly: you never know when that Rabid Grizzly (or some other monster)
will sneak up behind you and knock you unconscious in a single blow.&nbsp;
This, of course, means you need to macro /loc.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Always, always, always /con
monsters before attacking to see how tough they are.&nbsp; Try to attack
lone monsters, rather than ones in a group. If at a distance, it may be
best to bring the monster to you by casting on it; if you use /pet attack
you&#146;ll have to go chasing after your pet to where the fight will take place.
On the other hand, sometimes, I WANT my pet to start the fight so that
I can stand back and throw spells.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that if you pet
initiates the fight, you may have to click on the monster (sometimes F8
works) to target it, then activate auto-attack.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once an attack begins (if
not before), use a screen view (F9) that lets you see other approaching
beasts.
<p>BATTLE
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help your pet fight. If
the monster is diseased or has poison, you may want to stay back so you
don&#146;t get bit--but cast like crazy. Otherwise, get in and physically fight,
casting when you can. (Hit your cast button immediately after you see a
line saying the monster has struck, since that makes it more likely you
will get your spell off without interruption.)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try to stop your pet from
getting the killing blow: if it does (according to posts on the EQ Vault
Magic Shop board), the experience points will be split with your pet. This
is relatively easy to do in a group: just give the &quot;/pet back off&quot; command
(which you should have macroed). Unfortunately, when soloing, even after
you&#146;ve given the &quot;/pet back off&quot; command, if the monster takes a swing
at either you or your pet, the pet will attack again. The only remedy--which
works only about half the time--is to keep hitting the &quot;/pet back off&quot;
command. Still, it&#146;s worth doing:&nbsp; if you make the killing blow, you
get ALL the experience.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your health points fall
below 1/3, pull back and just cast. If it looks like the battle will be
lost, pull back FURTHER and prepare to immediately run (remember to use
/loc as you run) or to cast another pet if your mana is high enough as
soon as your pet dies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you end up being attacked
by more than one monster, pull back: it&#146;s almost impossible to cast in
that situation. If you pull back, with any luck no more than one monster
will follow you. At this point you might want to use an area spell like
Fire Flux. It has the same damage potential as a directed spell of the
same level (like Burn), but hits multiple monsters. It&#146;s range, though,
is limited, and direct damage spells like Burn are superior for attacking
a monster at a distance to begin a battle.
<p>RECUPERATION
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the battle, if your
mana has run down at all, meditate! (You can practice Sense Direction while
waiting if you have it set in the hotbox and you mouse click on it rather
than using the corresponding number key.) Also bind your wounds if your
health points are less than 50%.&nbsp; It may take a try or two to get
it going, but binding also can be done while meditating. The point is that
if you attack a tempting target that is passing by while your health and
mana are below 100% and then yet another monster shows up, you often will
wind up dead. Don&#146;t be greedy!</blockquote>
GUIDES FOR MAGICIANS. Some excellent guides for magicians can be found
at:
<br><a href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/playerguide/magician.shtml">http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/playerguide/magician.shtml</a>
(EQ Vault) and
<br><a href="http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag.shtml">http://eq.stratics.com/classes_mag.shtml</a>
(EQ Stratics)
<p>On the latter site, the guides for intermediate and advanced magicians
are well worth reading, even if you are a beginning mage. (The other articles
there are less useful.) Note that a couple of items have changed since
Beta, but most of the information is current and I strongly recommend reading
these guides.
<p>Also, there is a bulletin board for magic users (EQ Vault Magic Shop)
where very useful information can be discovered.&nbsp; It is located at
<a href="http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/">http://www.eqvault.com/boards/mshop/.</a>
