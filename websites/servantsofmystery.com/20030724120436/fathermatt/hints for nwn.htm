<p align="center"><b>FatherMatt's Hints and Tips</b></p>
<p align="left">1.&nbsp; <b>Lighting Loot and Doors.&nbsp; </b>By holding down
the TAB key, all items you can interact with will be light up.&nbsp; This
includes loot chests and doors (not to mention players, NPC's, animal companions
etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">2.&nbsp; <b>Movement and Camera Angles.&nbsp; </b>Despite what Bim says in the
Bioware Prelude, the keys to control movement work in all three modes:&nbsp; <b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w</b> and <b>s</b> for
forward and back,<b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a</b> and <b>d</b> for
turn left and turn right,&nbsp; <b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; q</b> and <b>e</b> for
step (strafe) left and step (strafe) right.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><br>
</b>In addition to clicking where you want to go (including on doors), you can
also move by holding down the left mouse button and moving the cursor to where
you want to go.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recommend using the &quot;<i><b>Chase</b></i>&quot;
mode, since the screen rotates when your character moves.&nbsp; (Sometimes you
may need to take a step to start the camera following you.)&nbsp; In this mode
you can use&nbsp; <b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>the <b> GRAY up and down
arrows</b> to zoom in and out,&nbsp; <b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>the <b> GRAY left and
right arrows</b> to rotate the camera,&nbsp; <b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>and the <b> PgUp</b> and
<b> PgDn</b>
keys to change the camera angle.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><br>
</b>You can also rotate the camera by moving your mouse pointer against the edge
of the screen on the left or right.&nbsp; Using the PgUp key to get a direct
top-down view is useful for looting if you have an animal companion, familiar or
henchman who tends to get in the way.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">3.&nbsp; <b>Quickbar.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to dragging
items from you inventory and memorized-spell list, you can add items to the
Quickbar by right-clicking on a free space on the bar and using the radial menu
to add an ability or spell.&nbsp; (Don't forget the Quickbars accessed by
holding down the CTRL or SHFT keys.) Also, if you use two weapons or a weapon
and a shield, you can drag both onto the same slot in your Quickbar; that way
when you click the slot, both are equipped at once.&nbsp; (This is useful in,
for example, switching back and forth between a crossbow and a mace/shield
combination.)</p>
<p align="left">4.&nbsp; <b>Speech.</b>&nbsp; Hit the &quot;Enter&quot; key to
place your cursor in the box when you want to send a message.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Shout&quot; to
change the style of speech--to &quot;Talk&quot; or &quot;Party&quot;, for
example.&nbsp; (Note that &quot;Shout&quot; goes module-wide.)&nbsp; Use the
&quot;v&quot; key to pull up lists of expressions that will actually be spoken
to other players.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In <b>multi-player worlds</b>, to see
who is in the game, click the two-sword icon under your portrait.&nbsp; To send
a private message (&quot;tell&quot;), use the form <b>/tell &quot;Lord Nasher&quot;
Hello</b>, where you put the recipient's name in the quotes and replace Hello
with your message.&nbsp; To send a tell to someone who has already spoken, click
on their character icon in the chat window in the lower left.&nbsp; If someone
is in your party, you can also double-click their portrait in the group to send
a tell.&nbsp; (To add someone to your group, right click on them, then click the
South icon on the radial menu.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">5.&nbsp; <b>Maps.&nbsp; </b>If you are playing the Official
Campaign module
provided by Bioware, you can buy maps for each of the four districts in the Southeast corner
of the
Peninsula District from Mizzenmast Mercantile.&nbsp;
(You will have to fight your way to get there.)</p>
<p align="left">6.&nbsp; <b>Windows Key.</b>&nbsp; You can use your Windows key
to reach the Windows desktop while playing.</p>
<p align="left">7.&nbsp; <b>Light.&nbsp; </b>Some will consider this cheating,
but you can lighten your screen so that torches etc. are not needed.&nbsp; Go to
the Options menu under your character portrait (the button with the two wavy
lines), then hit Video Options and move the Gamma Slider to the right.</p>
<p align="left">8.&nbsp; <b>NPC Companions.&nbsp; </b>If you have trouble with
summoned creatures, animal companions, familiars or henchmen running off and
starting battles when you don't want them to, right click on them and select the
&quot;guard me&quot; option.&nbsp; It's not 100% but it helps.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">9.&nbsp; <b>Chests.</b>&nbsp; Casters who have offensive spells
(even clerics, who receive a few offensive spells) can use them to open
chests!&nbsp; This is useful when the chest will not open or when trying to
avoid a trap on the chest. </p>
<p align="left">10.&nbsp; <b>ESC Key.</b>&nbsp; Hitting the ESC key will clear
any radial menus from the screen. </p>
