Hail Raven!<p>On the Cazic-Thule server, type /who all servants and you'll get the list of everyone who has the servants of mystery guildtag.  Alternately, you can look for an individual using /who all XXXXXX where xxxxx is Snaek, Gleau, Kmalj, Khaldji, Neranek, Hadrian, somnova, eynon, Silverhand, Iadris, Appello, crim, nall, abrahm, smush, Nyteride, (I'm forgetting a bunch of others)<p>Neranek<p>: Try typing just /who all then the name of the Servant you're looking for. I don't know if anyone not in the guild can do a search for people that are in the guild. Er, I don't have any names with me at the moment (most people have changed their names because of EQ's ridiculous rules). Hopefully one of the Servants' passing through here can post some names.<p>: -Cer.<p>: : Hail,<br>: :  I am no computer genius, so here is one delema I have.
