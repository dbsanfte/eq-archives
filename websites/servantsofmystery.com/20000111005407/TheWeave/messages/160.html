Hail!  Funny thing, I have BG, and the Tales of the Sword Coast expansion, but I have never had time to really play it because I was busy playing one massively-multiplayer game or another.  Naturally I will check out any Neverwinter BG expansion they do, but unless the Guild gets serious about playing multiplayer BG, I don't think I'll take the time to play it very much at all.  I hope Interplay or somebody gets smart and does a massively multiplayer game, otherwise I don't really see this group taking to it in a big way...not like they would if NWN itself were to return.<p>Mystra guide thee!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>Snake
