<P>
The Servants of Mystery are the followers of <A HREF="#Mystra">Mystra, Goddess of
Magic</A> in the<A HREF="#FR"> Forgotten Realms</A>.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the origin
and fountainhead of magic and its energies, the One True Spell from which all others flow.  Our Order is dedicated to the teaching of magic and to its practice in service of the common good.  The Servants of Mystery began as a nonsanctioned Guild in the now-extinct Neverwinter Nights in March of 1995.  We now have Temples in <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/dsofront.html"> Dark Sun: Crimson Sands </A>, <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/uofront.html"> Ultima Online</A>, and <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/realmfront.html"> The Realm</A> in addition to the Panterra Temple. The Panterra Temple of the Servants of Mystery was founded in January, 1998, as a sanctioned guild in<A HREF="#LoE"> Panterra</A>, the first part of an ambitious new multiplayer online fantasy role-playing game called <A HREF="#Zardon"> Zardon</A>.<BR>

<BR>
<P>
Mystra is the Goddess of Magic in the Forgotten Realms.  She is the Goddess of the power of
magic itself, not the Goddess of spellcasters, although many spellcasters number themselves among her followers.  To her alone is given the power to see through the eyes of the other gods and goddesses of the Forgotten Realms, that she may see how their strength of purpose colors even their perception of reality.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the greatest of the Greater Powers of the Realms.  <A HREF="#Join">Join</A> us as we teach her wonders to those who would achieve greatness in service of Good in the far-flung planes of existence!<BR>

The Forgotten Realms is a land of fantasy created by Ed Greenwood for role-playing using the <A HREF="#ADD">Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</A> gaming system.  TSR</A> has made
the Forgotten Realms the centerpiece for their line of AD&D adventure modules and accessories. TSR has also published a large collection of paperback and
hardcover novels set in the Forgotten Realms (over 30 are now in print), some of which have even
made the New York Times bestseller list!  The ultimate expression of the Forgotten Realms existed for over six years online in the form of Neverwinter Nights, a multi-user graphical role-playing game formerly hosted on America Online.  A large community of loyal players created a special place that will always live in our memories, despite the unspeakable "retirement" of Neverwinter Nights by the cretins that compose the AOL management.  The Neverwinter Community has been forced into Diaspora, yet it lives on in a series of sites on the World Wide Web, and in many other Realms.<BR>

Zardon is an ambitious new online fantasy roleplaying game from Realmsnet.  The game will eventually consist of multiple interlocking game worlds with different features and challenges.  The first part of the Zardon series, Panterra, is expected to open its doors to the public soon.  Guild formation is already well underway in Panterra, and the Servants of Mystery are proud to be one of the first sanctioned Guilds there.  To learn more about Zardon and Panterra, visit the <A HREF="http://www.Empyria.com"> Realmsnet</A> web site.<BR>

Panterra is a world both beautiful and perilous.  The evergreen-laden mountains, lush jungles, parched deserts, and balmy tropical islands teem with life, and adventure awaits those who brave the challenges of the wilderness.  Dark caverns and secret dungeons hold perils to be conquered and treasures to be won!  The cities hold the riches of a vibrant civilization and the knowledge of the ages.  A true community of wizards and warriors, monks and barbarians, hold forth in this new land, striving to build their dreams with the generous aid and faithful companionship of their friends. There is no better time than the present to come to Panterra and join us as we travel the lands spreading the word of the One True Spell and helping our fellow adventurers in their times of need!<BR>
