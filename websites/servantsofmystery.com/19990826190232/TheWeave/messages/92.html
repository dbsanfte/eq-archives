Glad ta see you both again  :)<p>SSB are doing well...there are about 20-30 of us currently on Great Lakes in UO (only reason being that is where myself and one other were when the interest developed, and we had a "home" ready).<p>We are still in DSO - though probably not for much longer, as its days are slowly ebbing to a close...and this was merely a stopover for most anyway.<p>And like you, we are looking forward to EverQuest - there has been talk of the NWN community all heading to one server, and last I heard Cazic Thule might be that place.  Right now, SSB is looking toward Fennin Ro - but that could change, you never do know  :)<p>Myself - I will remain in UO...as it no longer bores me as it once did, LOL.  Who knows, maybe that will one day change also.<p>Good to see you both again, drop in on me sometime, I am easy to find!  (www.bladekeep.com)<p>Medar<br>
