  <p>DARKNESS FALLS<br>
  <br>
  A new dungeon makes its debut in this version of Dark Age of Camelot: the
  subterranean land of the dead known as Darkness Falls. Populated by Demons,
  Imps, and other hellish creatures, Darkness Falls is an immense sprawling
  underground kingdom dominated by the arch-demon Legion.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Accessing Darkness Falls<br>
  <br>
  Any character brave (or foolish) enough to want to explore Darkness Falls will
  have to find one of the portals that have been put in each Realm's home zone.
  Additionally, there are portals in each Realm's Relic Keeps. Please note that
  Darkness Falls is attuned to the power of each Realm - only those members of
  the Realm that hold more territory than the others are allowed entry. In order
  to activate your Realm's portal, your Realm must hold more frontier keeps
  (Outposts) than either of the other two Realms.<br>
  <br>
  Please note that you can only use portals located in your Realm, not an enemy
  Realm.<br>
  <br>
  In the dungeon there are several different exits that take you different
  places based on your realm.<br>
  <br>
  Each realm has a wing in which they enter the dungeon, Near each entrance (a
  couple rooms away) is an exit that will take the 'home' realm to back to their
  home region, but will take 'enemies' to their portal keep in the opposing
  frontier. Thus, a Midgard player going through Albion's exit portal will end
  up in Hadrian's Wall in the Midgard portal keep, while an Albion player going
  through Albion's exit will end up near the dungeon entrance portal in Camelot
  Hills.<br>
  <br>
  Darkness Falls has many sub-bosses in addition to Legion, the main boss of the
  dungeon. Each boss encounter has an exit portal nearby that takes each realm
  to their home zone.<br>
  <br>
  Near the center of the dungeon (near the transition to the lower level) is a
  portal that takes each realm to their home zone.<br>
  <br>
  When you are in Darkness Falls and another Realm takes control of the portals,
  you can stay in the underworld until you exit (via a portal) or /release on
  death. This means that while adventuring in Darkness Falls, please be aware
  that you will probably run into members of opposing Realms. RvR combat is
  fully supported in the underworld, so beware. When portal control changes from
  one Realm to another, those members of the original Realm that had control are
  still able to adventure throughout Darkness Falls, so long as they don't
  release on death. As long as they are resurrected on death by a friendly
  healer-type that is with them, they can stay in Darkness Falls for as long as
  they want.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The Political Situation in Darkness Falls<br>
  <br>
  The demons residing within Darkness Falls adhere to a strict structural
  hierarchy that is based on the power of the demon. The most powerful of the
  demons have titles and underlings who serve them. Of all the demons in the
  Darkness Falls, no group is physically weaker or smaller than the Picullus
  Imps. Because they are so small and weak, the larger, nastier demons take
  pleasure in harassing them or make them do menial labor. Like small fish that
  live in the sea, the Picullus Imps have learned to survive by gathering
  together around their siblings and relatives and hiding out as far away from
  the big demons as they can.<br>
  <br>
  While they may be small and weak, the Picullus have learned to use their small
  size to their advantage, perfecting the art of sneaking and infiltrating.
  Since they are unable to fight back against the large demons physically, they
  have found other ways to extract their revenge…by stealing away anything and
  everything they can from the big demons. Fortunately for them, the demons
  never even think that the imps are clever enough (or brave enough) to try
  something so foolish as to raid the demons’ hordes.<br>
  <br>
  The imps never use anything that they steal, and unfortunately for them, the
  one thing that they covet above all else is something they cannot get on their
  own. Each demon possesses a seal, a center of focus that is a part of the
  demon. There are different types of seals, which are determined by the power
  of the demons. The seals are shiny, and the shinier they are, the more they
  are desired by the imps. The unfortunate part is that they can only be
  obtained upon the death of a demon, something the imps are incapable of doing.<br>
  <br>
  Unlike most demons, the imps do not dislike humanity. In fact, they tend to
  like just about anyone who won’t hurt them. The Picullus Imps have learned
  to obtain that which they covet by offering up their stolen goods to those who
  would kill the greater demons and bring back their seals. The different types
  of seals carry different value in the eyes of the imps, and the imps will
  barter for them like money. So by accumulating a lot of seals, one could
  potentially acquire many items of value.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Darkness Falls Loot System<br>
  <br>
  Darkness Falls uses a different set of rules for the acquisition of loot. The
  common denizens of this dungeon drop magic items but they are not the ones you
  usually see. There are various types of jewel-like seals that can be found.
  You will likely find more of them on the powerful demons and lords.<br>
  <br>
  There are imps that want the seals. The stealthy imps have stolen a lot of
  treasure from the demons and will offer it in return for the different types
  of magical seals. The imps could not steal the items from the powerful demons
  in the dungeon, and will gladly trade you their items for your seals.<br>
  <br>
  When trading, seals are deducted from your inventory as you barter with the
  imps. Different imps want different magic seals so check with all of them.
  When you speak with the imp he will tell you what type of magical seal he
  wants. Any items from that imp will require the correct type of seal. There is
  a value next to each item in the store window, which is its cost in seals.<br>
  <br>
  Note: this method allows for very even loot distribution in groups, but keep
  in mind you cannot unstack items, so be careful when you decide to stack them.</p>

          The customer service team lead on duty right now asked me to clarify

          </font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial" size="2">1) Server comes up.<br>
          2) Whoever has the most keeps finds their portal open.<br>
          3) If there was a tie score for most keeps (two or three way tie),
          nobody finds the portal open.<br>
          4) If someone breaks the tie, the team with the most keeps opens the
          portal.<br>
          5) If the situation returns to a tie score, the portal does not close
          - whoever had been winning still keeps the portal.<br>
          6) <b><i>If the server resets, go back to the beginning of this list.</i></b>
          A server reset means a tie score is a tie score - the game does not
          remember from reboot to reboot which realm had been winning before the
          return to tied status. Or, to put it another way, once a portal is
          open, it stays open although ownership may change. The server shutting
          down closes the portal, and it has to be opened again.</p>
