-With a flash of blue light, an dark haired elf appears in the Tower of Mystery.  He is wearing garb similar to, but subtly different, from that worn by current Lords of Mystery.  Those who have been here since then recognize them as the robes once worn in the hallowed halls of Neverwinter, consecrated in the Shrine of Talia.  He walks with an easy grace, the two longswords he wears seeming an extension of him.  His midnight blue cloak is held closed with two clasps, one a Mystran holy symbol, the other fashioned in the shape of a silver dragon's head, which echoes the articulate tattoos at his wrists and hands.  He is smiling broadly, radiating a confidence that comes from years of adventuring, and the security of being home after so long away. . .-<p>Hail, fellow Servants!  It has been a while, hasn't it?  Cer, Snake, I would have guessed you in retirement by now. *laughing* And Father Matt, have you any ale standing by?  I remember you used to, but times may have changed. . .  But not that much, I assume.  Ah, yes, it is good to see so many new faces.  I'm sure I will get to know all of you soon enough.<p>So, *sliding into a chair and smiling conspiritorially* what have I missed?<p>Patryn of Elvenshae<br>Master Bladesinger, Order of the Silver Dragon<br>Lord of Mystery, Ret.
