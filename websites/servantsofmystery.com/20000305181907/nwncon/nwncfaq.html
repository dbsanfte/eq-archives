Q: What is the original Neverwinter Nights?<BR>
<BR>
A: Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was a multiplayer fantasy roleplaying computer game that was hosted by America Online for about 6 years.  It was based on the Forgotten Realms Advanced Dungeons and Dragons game world created by Ed Greenwood of TSR and modeled on the "Gold Box" AD&D computer games created by <A HREF="http://www.ssionline.com"> SSI</A>.  NWN first went online in 1990 and was closed down by AOL in July, 1997, displacing a community of thousands of loyal players.  Over 20,000 downloads of the second edition NWN software had been recorded by then.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: What is the NEW Neverwinter Nights?<BR>
<BR>
A: Neverwinter Nights is ALSO the name chosen for a new AD&D game being designed by <A HREF="http://www.bioware.com">Bioware</A> for distribution by <A HREF="http://interplay.com"> Interplay</A>, who have licensed the Forgotten Realms for computer games from TSR and their parent company, <A HREF="http://www.wizards.com">Wizards of the Coast</A>.  This new game is going to be quite different from the original NWN.  Instead of all the action taking place on one massive server, users of the system will be able to host "limited" multiplayer sessions, with anywhere from a few to possibly as many as 64 players per game session.  Another key difference is that the players will be able to design their own "modules" using graphics, items, monsters, and non-player characters from the Bioware game, and host them on their own computers for multiplayer play.  These modules can be linked by "Portals", allowing players to move from one server to another in-game.  There is also a Dungeon Master function in the game that allows the host to take control of NPCs and even player characters and to dynamically affect the monsters, items and other game features during play.  The combat system is currently planned as a "real-time" system (like Ultima Online or EverQuest) rather than the "turn-based" system used in the original NWN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: What is the Neverwinter Consortium?<BR>
<BR>
A: We are a group composed mainly of former Neverwinter Nights players.  We are planning and coordinating the creation of a linked set of game modules using the new Neverwinter Nights game system, when it becomes available.  Our goal is to recreate our favorite parts of the Forgotten Realms and link them into a server ring that will allow players to "travel" from one server to the next as they play the game.  Our intent is to operate our game as a persistent world.  While re-establishing the "original Neverwinter" surround is our first priority, we are not restricting ourselves to that.  Ultimately we would like to construct as much of the Forgotten Realms as we can.  While we know that for many there can be no substitute for the original game, we're going to give it our best shot and try to create anew what we had, and then some.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: What effect will the acquisition of Wizards of the Coast by Hasbro have on the new game?<BR>
<BR>
A: Hasbro is unlikely to change the deals that Wizards of the Coast have already made with companies like Interplay.  The acquiring company does not usually rush in and start breaking contracts, so I don't think we are going to see any problems arise from this acquisition.  We believe that the management of Hasbro is enlightened enough to see the value of the game for their business and not interfere with its creation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: A lot of old NWN players have said they will refuse to play the new NWN, and have accused its creators of using the name just to get publicity.  What is your stance on this issue, and how do you plan to deal with the shunning of the game by a lot of old NWNers?<BR>
<BR>
A: When the old NWNers (like me) first heard about a new NWN coming out, we hoped and expected that it would be like the original in almost every respect...turn-based combat, persistent world server, etc.  A lot of people were unhappy when they saw how different it is, and some vowed never to touch it.  We hope that in time they will reconsider.  At first, the writer of this FAQ was upset about it, too, and thought we were being jerked on an emotional chain, but that attitude has been replaced by a hope that somehow this system will let those of us who played the original NWN recapture some of its magic for ourselves, since nobody else is going to do it.  We can't make the old NWN players play our module, but we hope that they will be willing to try it if they start to hear good things about it.  We're going to try to make the core of the game as close to the original NWN as the new game system will allow.  We hope that will be enough for most old NWNers.  This is a tribute to them and to the game that brought us all together.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will your game have PvP, like the original NWN?<BR>
<BR>
A: Yes, there will be PvP zones and non-PvP zones, just like in the original NWN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: What about melee PvP, which can exist in the new game but couldn't in the old game?<BR>
<BR>
A: That's a tough one.  For the oNWN purist, melee PvP would be out of the question, since you couldn't do it in the original.  We don't know if there will be a way to allow magical PvP without also allowing melee PvP.  The combat system in the new game is so different from the original, though, that it may be a moot point.  Allowing melee PvP is more consistent with AD&D but less consistent with oNWN.  We'll probably need more time to think about this one, and some advice and guidance from other oNWNers.  When in doubt, we will be inclined to go with the more oNWN-like option, at least in the core areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will you have a PvP Death Match area, where the loser suffers permanent character death?<BR>
<BR>
A: Yes, the Triboar Arena will have a Death Match area, just like in oNWN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: What will the normal 'death consequences' be in your game?<BR>
<BR>
A: Normal (as opposed to Death Match) death consequences will be minimal, like in oNWN.  You'll probably appear at the last area boundary you crossed, with just 1 hit point, and may lose items that weren't 'readied'.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will you have DMs that fulfill the function served by the NW staff in the original game?<BR>
<BR>
A: There will be Consortium members with DM powers in our modules.  Like the NWs in oNWN, they will be volunteers who run special events and deal with problem players.  Also like the original, they won't be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  We will have rules of conduct and we will enforce them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will 'official' characters (from the official NWN Vault) be allowed to play in your module, and if they are, will they still be 'official' when they leave?<BR>
<BR>
A: We will neither require nor prohibit 'official' Vault characters.  At the moment we cannot guarantee that Vault-certified characters that enter our modules will still be Vault-certifiable when they leave, since we don't know yet what the criteria will be for retaining 'official' status.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will there be Guild Halls and/or player-owned houses in your game?<BR>
<BR>
A: We want to accommodate the Guilds of NWN as much as possible.  One option we are considering is offering registered Guilds that meet our criteria for activity the chance to have a Guild Hall in a separate, private area that is accessed through the one of main areas of one of our modules.  Alternatively, qualified Guilds can design and host their own Guild Halls and request Portal entry into our modules.  As for player-owned housing, there are no plans to implement it at this time, at least not in the oNWN core, where no such option existed.  We have not ruled out the possibility of adding on areas for player-owned houses outside the oNWN core.  Players WILL be able to store possessions in an in-game Vault, as in the original NWN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: Will you give Portal access to non-Consortium modules in your game?<BR>
<BR>
A: Portal access will be granted to non-Consortium modules that can meet our strict criteria of Realmsworthiness and content. Since our dream of a linked server ring that encompasses all the Forgotten Realms is very ambitious, we simply can'tafford to ignore high quality contributions from people who work outside our group.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: How many players will be able to play your game at one time?<BR>
<BR>
A: We don't know that for sure right now, but we are hoping we can have several hundred players in a module at once.  This is mainly an issue of Internet connection bandwidth.  We are looking into connection options now so we can be ready to go as soon as the game is functional, but we have to realize that a lot of things could change between now and then.  We'll host our modules on the best available connection we can get.  If that's a T1 or fractional T3, we'll have no problems.  If it's 8 cable modem or DSL connections, we'll have minor problems.  If its three dozen 56K dialup connections, we're in trouble :-)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q: How do I join the Neverwinter Consortium?<BR>
<BR>
A: To join the Consortium, you must request membership by posting on our <A HREF="http://usadnet.com/Neverwinter_Consortium_Messaging/Neverwinter_Consortium_Messaging.html"> Message Board </A>.  We are serious about this and are not interested in having a lot of members who aren't going to design modules for the linked server ring, although people with significant expertise in NWN or in AD&D module or campaign design are welcome to apply and contribute their wisdom to the project.<BR>
