: There's a real easy way to protect against this: simply don't download anything that doesn't come off of a secured server that you trust. OSI is currently working on making certain third party applications licensed, but until they do so you may want to be careful of what you download. It is not advised that you download anything to "enhance" your game (FUSE, UOX, etc.)<p>: If you really feel the need to download something, make sure you are getting it directly from the author's site (for example, UOCurse is a popular program. Someone put it on a seperate server from the author, but added a virus to it. Always get from the program's author's site).<p>: Something else that should always be running is one (if not more) anti-virus programs. Things like McAfee, or Norton Antivirus programs. Be sure to visit their web sites regularly to download new files to protect against new forms of virii.<p>: These people can't gain a hold on your computer unless you let them. So if you want to be sure you're safe, simply don't download anything to use with UO that isn't offically licensed (which I believe nothing is, at this point).<p>: Take care all,<p>: -Cer.<p>
