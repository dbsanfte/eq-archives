Hail!  Some time ago, FatherMatt asked how you can tell how much video memory you have.  One way is to go to your Control Panels, double-click the Display icon, and click the Color tab.  Look at the sliders that control your video resolution and color plane depth.  If you can run 800 x 600 pixels in 24-bit color, you have at least 2 Meg of video memory on your card.  A 4 Meg card should be able to run even higher resolutions in 24-bit color.  Now you can get cards with 16 or more Meg of video memory.  That's right, some video cards may have as much or more RAM than your computer itself!<p>I got the Everquest phase 4 beta CD yesterday, but the minimum video memory is 4 Meg, which I don't have right now.  I guess it's upgrade or don't play EQ.  That's a tough choice for me, for some it's no choice at all, unfortunately.  I am concerned that it means the Guild will be split again as those who can jump to EQ and those who can't stay in UO.<p>I wish programmers would slow down with the escalation in system requirements a little, so more of us could use their programs without having to drop extra dollars on largely superfluous hardware upgrades.  Right now the only real reason to have one of these cards is to play games, and many people won't spend money on an new card just to play a game.  I can't blame them for that!<p>Mystra guide thee!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>SOM Snake
