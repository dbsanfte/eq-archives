<p>MAPS.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the official map of
Qeynos (hmmm, how can I put this delicately?) is relatively useless, since
it does not identify many key shops, it does not show where the two zone
changes occur and it does not show many of the other non-shop buildings
that block the way and make Qeynos so difficult for the newcomer to traverse.
As a result, the very first thing you should do is go to <b><u><font color="#00AA00">http://eq.stratics.com/files/maps/qeynos.jpg</font></u></b>
and print this wonderful, detailed map by Gram. I cannot stress this enough.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a brief but useful description
of Qeynos and surrounding regions, see the EQ’Lizer guide at <b><u><font color="#00AA00"><a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/qeynos.html">http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/qeynos.html</a></font></u></b>
<p>BANK. The name of the Bank in Qeynos is, weirdly, Qeynos Hold. Why they
couldn’t call it the Qeynos Bank mystifies me; I always thought a hold
was watchtower or small stone fortress. In any case, it is located to the
west (left) of the Hall of Sorcery.
<p>PROVISIONS. The primary provisioners are Snead Galliway’s Trading Post,
which is across from Crow’s Pub and Casino in the north end of town; and
two establishments in the south end of town: Voleen’s Fine Baked Goods
(for cheap eats), which is in the area just east of the Qeynos Port Authority;
and the Mermaid’s Lure, which is located by the boat docks (the northern
set of docks). However, many NPC’s in Qeynos buy and sell provisions, some
more so than others.
<p>GATES. There is only one gate out of Qeynos, the North Gate. Often there
is someone at the North Gate who is doing binding. The going price seems
to be 5 gold per person. The nearest provisioner to the gate is Snead Galliway’s
Trading Post, which is across from Crow’s Pub and Casino.
<p>Going due north from this gate takes you to the Qeynos Hills. From there
you can further north to Surefall Glade (the tunnel is quite dark, so bring
a good light) or east to West Karana (although you should probably be at
least level 8 to go there). See the SURROUNDING ZONES section below for
more information.
<p>DOCKS AND BOATS. There are two docks in Qeynos, both on the southwest
side. Each dock is in its own walled area, although these areas are side
by side and there is an open portal between them.
<p>Although you can fish from either dock, the southernmost one is known
as the fishing dock. It is the one next to the Qeynos Port Authority, which
is empty.
<p>The northernmost–and longer one–is the boat dock. The building located
here is the Mermaid’s Lure, where you can buy fishing poles, bait and many
other supplies.
<p>This dock is where the boat to Erudin stops. The boat comes every ten
minutes. There is no charge: just step on the boat when it comes. You can’t
cast spells on the boat, but you can fish, so you may want to bring a fishing
pole and some bait. On the way to Erudin (but not on the way back to Qeynos)
the boat stops at a primitive island inhabitated by cat people who at least
do not attack; attractions there are wisp hunting and a sunken boat guarded
by skeleton sailors..
<p>SIGHTS. A sight-seeing tour should include at least three stops.
<p>One is the Grounds of Fate. Here there is a square where even non-PvP
players can fight just by stepping onto the square. There are mezzanine
ramps up above for those who want a good (but safe) view. Don’t worry if
you want to reach the Hall of Steel on the far side of the arena square–you
can cross the arena, just don’t dawdle. :-)
<p>Another sight is the clock tower in Merchant Square. (If you’re looking
at Gram’s map, this is in the square housing Bag ‘N Barrel and Nesiff’s
Wooden Weapons.) This attractive tower was apparently a gift by the gnomes.
Too bad it doesn’t tell the time! (Use the /time command to find out what
time of day it is.)
<p>Finally there is the Temple of Life. There is a mysterious "flying saucer"
here that hovers atop a column of blue light over a pool of water. To enter
the saucer (which is actually the temple), go up the ramp in the middle;
when you get to the top, step inside the column of blue light there and
you will be transported to inside the saucer. There are several NPC’s inside.
When done, step through one of the large blue rectangular portals and you
will be taken to the entrance of the Temple of Light compound.
<p>HARD TO FIND NPC’S. Well, I’m sure there are more of these, but here
are the ones I have had trouble with.
<p>For fletching (arrow-making) materials, there is an NPC who stands outside
in Merchant Square (the one with the clock tower). His last name is Fletcher,
appropriately enough. He is not in a shop but outside, standing in a corner
just to the west of the pool in this square.
<p>To buy a compass, visit the NPC in the far southwest (lower left) corner
of Qeynos, the area where the Qeynos Port Authority is located. However,
the compasses are expensive.
<p>In Qeynos, items for the apprentice mage are found on NPC’s in the Herb
Jar, a store next door to the Hall of Sorcery. Neapha Vesturo sells low-level
spells and apprentice robes. For training (and higher-level spells) see
the mages in the Hall of Sorcery in the room at the back and to the right.
Yestura Rhamrey provides the training there, and several other NPC’s hold
the higher-level spells.&nbsp; Hanlore Escaval used to sell malachite in
the Herb Jar, but this is now available at IronForge in Qeynos.
<p>In Qeynos, cloth armor can be purchased from Lala Lenard, who is in
the courtyard under an awning just south of the Lion’s Mane Inn and Tavern,
as well as from Ms. Clothspinner, who is located outside of IronForge.
<p>AQUEDUCT. Qeynos has an underground aqueduct system. (Although sometimes
called the sewers, this is something of a misnomer.) Essentially, this
is a set of passages filled with water and intersecting stone walkways
above. In most places–but not all–you can get up for air. The place is
an absolute maze! A map of the aqueduct can be found at <a href="http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/cityguide/catacombs.shtml">http://www.eqvault.com/guidebook/cityguide/catacombs.shtml</a>.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You need to have some swimming
skill to enter the aqueduct and to get around in it; I recommend level
21 or higher in the skill. You should also have a good light source. Trapdoor
says this is a good area for those at levels 5 or 6 or higher. Supposedly
there are +5 hp earrings and +5hp rings that can be found.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the fountains in
Qeynos lead to the aqueduct. Simply jump in, swim to the square opening
on the bottom and swim down it; you will hit a zone change about half-way
down. Once through that, continue swimming to the bottom. There hit numberpad
5 to right yourself, and swim horizontally until you find a shaft going
up where you can swim up and get air. The stone walkways provide places
to get out and take a breather. It’s a bit scary the first time or two,
but it does work.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember to use your mouse
to swim! Hold down the right mouse key, then hold down the left one to
move forward. (Set your pace at walk, rather than run.) Move the mouse
to move up and down in the water–it’s easy to breathe when traveling this
way–and move it sideways to turn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangely, fighting with monsters in the water-filled
passages is almost identical to fighting on land! The primary differences
are that a) you have to surface periodically for air (this is not as hard
as it sounds), b) you can float at any level in the water and c) you can
only move forwards (though you can turn).
<p>SURROUNDING ZONES.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A "map" showing the zones
on the continent can be found at
<br><a href="http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/cheats/eqantonicamap.htm">http://www.thecomputershow.com/computershow/cheats/eqantonicamap.htm</a>
<br>Here you can see the relationships of the zones to each other.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qeynos Hills. This is the
primary hunting place for those who have passed the newbie level. For a
brief but good description of this region, see the EQ’Lizer page at
<br><b><font color="#00AA00">http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/qeynoshills.html</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there is an EverWorld
map with the coordinate markings on it (very useful!) at
<br><b><u><font color="#00AA00">http://www.everworld.net/norrath/maps/qeynos_hills.shtml</font></u></b>
<br>as well as another map by EQOnline at <b><u><font color="#00AA00">http://www.eq-online.com/maps/qhills.jpg</font></u></b>.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surefall Glade. It is relatively
safe to travel to Surefall Glade, and some quests are available. Just don’t
kill a bear in Surefall Glade, for they are protected there. For a map
of Surefall Glade, see the C.O.R. page at <a href="http://cor.simplenet.com/Everquest/maps/Surefall.html">http://cor.simplenet.com/Everquest/maps/Surefall.html</a>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; West Karana. You probably
need to be at least level 8 to go here, and even then you’ll have to stay
near the guard towers and leave when evening falls. For a brief but good
description of this region, see the EQ’Lizer page at <b><font color="#00AA00">http://gameznet.com/eq/zone/wkarana.html<u>.</u></font></b>
<br>A map of this region can also be found on the NotCrazy site at
<br><a href="http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/maps/zones/Antonica/WestKarana.shtml">http://www.notcrazy.com/collated/maps/zones/Antonica/WestKarana.shtml</a>
<p>QUESTS. For some quests in Qeynos and surrounding regions (as well as
other regions), see the EQ’Lizer guide at <b><font color="#00AA00">http://gameznet.com/eq/quest.html</font></b>
<br>and see the Black Panthers Guild page at
