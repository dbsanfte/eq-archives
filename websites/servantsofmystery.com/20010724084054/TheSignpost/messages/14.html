That was Logan, brother.  And, aye, it was a most interesting night.<p>Ner<p>: Hails<p>:  Sorry I had to bail on you and Pope last eve Ner, I started a really bad head ache, it kept me up most of last eve. Doc calls them cluster head aches. Anyways, did you know that fellow we were with? He seemed abit bossie, and quick to the loot, of the better corpses. Sorry I couldn't help but notice how he was very quick to point out that he got to loot 3 times before he gave you your first, and tossed pope and I the lessar loots. BTW he seemed ticked when that red skel followed me and the greater skel ran out of the house. No?<p>: Khaldji<p>
