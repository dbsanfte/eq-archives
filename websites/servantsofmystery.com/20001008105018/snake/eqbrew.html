Brewing is one of the easier trades to learn in EverQuest, and as such, it is not one of the most profitable.  However, there is a curious satisfaction to combining brewing ingredients in a brewing bucket and watching a tankard of ale or a bottle of wine appear!  If you are ready to spend a little money, a few practice points, and a bit of time to master the craft, you can become a Master Brewer, capable of making a variety of drinks to suit all occassions.<BR>
<BR>
Before you get started, you should know that if you are looking for quick profits, brewing is not the trade for you.  Many of the concoctions you can brew cannot be sold to NPCs for a profit, so you can expect to lose money at first, but this is typical of EQ trade skills.  With that caveat, let's examine how you should get your start in brewing.<BR>
<BR>
Getting Started  --  The first thing you should do before starting a career in Brewing is locate a source of brewing ingredients.  I know of several NPC vendors that sell brewing supplies.  One of these is the now-famed Krystin Charcoal, who can be found in West Freeport, by taking the first left turn as you enter from the West Gate.  She stands at the top of a hill on the road leading to North Freeport.  She'll sell you Barley, Hops, Rice, Yeast, Wine Yeast, and Malt. She doesn't sell Casks or Bottles, and she doesn't sell the Brewing Guide. Casks and Bottles can be bought from NPC Innkeepers or other vendors, as can Flasks of Water (you cannot use summoned water for brewing).  Apparently the Brewing Guide can only be found in the dwarven city of Kaladim.  If you have the recipes from this site, you won't need the Guide anyway.  Another known vendor of brewing supplies is Heidi Grainsifter of South Qeynos.  She can be found at Voleen's Baked Goods, which is just East of the Qeynos Port Authority, right next to Fish's Ale House.  She sells the same ingredients as Krystin Charcoal.  There is a 'clerk' in High Keep who sells brewing supplies, near the back of the first floor.  Grapes can be purchased from many NPC vendors for about 2 silver and 7 copper pieces.  Foraged ingredients like Berries or Fruit cannot be bought from NPCs and must either be Foraged for or bought from other players.<BR>
<BR>
It is a good idea to use some practice points to increase your Brewing skill before you try it, unless you are a late starter with plenty of money.  Even if you are loaded with platinum, putting a few points into the skill can reduce the amount of time and money you spend failing and losing your ingredients.  I put 19 practice points into it before I ever attempted to brew.  If you don't have that many Practice points available, any amount of skill you can get without brewing will help keep your overall costs of learning to a minimum.<BR>
<BR>
Most starting Brewers make Mead, which requires Hops, Malt, Yeast, and a Cask.  You cannot make money brewing Mead, as the ingredients cost far more than you'll get by selling the product to an NPC, and most players won't buy your brews.  However, Mead does not require much skill to make, so you'll have some success early on if you brew Mead, and your skill rises whether you succeed or fail.  The method of brewing is simple.  Locate a Brewing Bucket, which looks something like an Apollo space capsule with a corkscrew tube leading to a wooden cask.  Left-click on either the brewing 'vat' or the cask to open the bucket, place your ingredients in the spaces, one per space, and click the Combine button. Don't think that stacking more ingredients than one per box will get you more brew, it won't, it will fail and you'll lose ingredients. When you succeed in brewing something, you will get a message saying you have combined the ingredients to make something new, and you'll have a bottle or tankard of your brew attached to your cursor. If you fail, you'll get a message saying that you lacked the skill to successfully combine the ingredients, and you'll get back a portion of what you put in...in my experience, you get the cask back, which is OK, as it is the single most expensive brew component at about 3 silver and 3 copper each.  If you use a combination of ingredients that doesn't make any known recipe, you get a message saying those ingredients do not combine in those amounts to make anything...and they'll disappear.  Once you have your brew, you can drink it by left-clicking on it once, or you can sell it to an NPC.  Mead only sells for a couple silver pieces a bottle, but costs about 8 silver and 4 copper to make.  Even if you succeeded every time, which you won't, you'd still be losing money on each bottle of Mead.  Fortunately, brewing skill grows fast, so you can move on to marginally profitable brews, such as Ale, pretty quickly.<BR>
<BR>
Since I have now mentioned it, I would recommend you start brewing Ale as soon as you start getting the message saying it is trivial for you to make this item when you make Mead.  Making Ale will keep your skill rising at this point, and, if you're lucky, can also pay for itself or even make a small profit.  It costs about 7 silver and 8 copper pieces to make Ale, but each brewing makes not 1 but 3 tankards, which can be sold for a total of 8 silver and 3 copper pieces, so you make about 5 copper pieces per three Ales sold...or you would if it never failed, and we all know that doesn't happen right away.<BR>
<BR>
Once you've honed your brewing skill by brewing Mead and Ale, you can try some of the tougher brews, like Ogre Swill or Ol'Tujim's Fierce Brew.  Ol'Tujim's used to be a cash machine, but that changed when the number of casks of product per batch was reduced from 5 to 2, making it a money loser like almost all the brews.  It's still a good choice for skill advancement if you have the money to keep buying all the ingredients (Hops, Barley, Malt, Yeast, and a cask).<BR>
<BR>
Froglok meat (for Ogre Swill brewing) is found on the corpses of Frogloks.  These loathsome creatures can be found in the sewers of Qeynos and Freeport, not to mention the Innothule Swamp and the dungeons of Guk, and when you kill them, you will often find 'froglok meat' on the body.  I've also occassionally seen it on NPC vendors, who presumably acquired them by buying them from players, but that isn't a reliable source.  Combining the froglok meat with Malt, Yeast, and a cask will produce Ogre Swill (no, I don't want to drink it either :-)
<BR>
<BR>
Wine making  --  Wines use three basic ingredients, and one unique ingredient that gives each wine its 'character' (as well as a name and a bottle style).  All but one of the brewable wines contains grapes, wine yeast, and a bottle.  The unique ingredients can be foraged berries (red wine), foraged berries (white wine), fresh fish (fish wine), or fire beetle eye (gypsy wine).  Combine one of these ingredients with the three basic ingredients and you'll make a nice bottle of wine (or more than one bottle, in some cases).  If you instead combine Morning Dew (a formerly rare to nonexistent forage found in the Elven lands), foraged Berries, wine yeast and a bottle, you will make Elven Wine, the preferred libation of the discerning Faydark citizen.<BR>
<BR>
Mixed Drinks and Distilled Spirits --  Ah, there is so much to teach of the brewer's craft!  The distilled spirits form the basis of many exotic 'mixed drinks'.  The major distilled spirit is Vodka, which is made by combining foraged vegetables, 2 short beers, a water flask, and a bottle.  Put them all in the Brewing Bucket, hit Combine, and if you're successful, a little blue flask of Vodka will appear!  If you use only one short beer instead of two, and substitute a shotglass for the bottle, you'll make Ginesh instead of Vodka.  Another major distilled spirit you can make is Brandy.  Combine two bottles of red wine, foraged vegetables, spices, and a shotglass to make a bottle of Brandy.  You can also make Gnomish Spirits (which gnomes use for many industrial purposes...in addition to drinking :-).  Little red jugs of Gnomish Spirits are made by combining rice, bat ears, spider legs, and a bottle.  This can be made at a lower level than Vodka, but also becomes trivial at a skill level of about 75.  It is a reasonable transitional brew for the gap between the wines and Vodka, but Vodka is important and you'll still gain skill even if you fail, so I recommend you begin trying to brew Vodka as soon as the wines become trivial.<BR>
<BR>
Once you have some Vodka, you can begin making some of the mixed drinks, which are among the hardest things to brew. This makes them the brews of choice for skill advancement once you get to about 100.  Halas Heaters are probably the simplest, being made with one bottle of Vodka, one set of spider legs, and a cask. One brewing run will make three Heaters.  You can make Bleeding Brain (nice image, eh?) by combining a bottle of Vodka, a fire beetle eye, spices, and a shotglass.  Hulgarsh, which also sounds pretty foul for a drink, is made with 2 bottles of Vodka, fishing bait (the kind you buy from the shopkeepers), a water flask, and a cask.  A much more pleasant drink is the Halfling Stouter, which is made by combining a bottle of Vodka, foraged berries, spices, and a shotglass.<BR>
<BR>
There are also some unusual quest brews that are made with ingredients that can only be gathered from specific locations.  One example is Legion Lager, which is made by combining a Flask of Bloodwater, Deadbone Barley, a Giant Blood Sac, and a bottle.  There's also an ale that can only be made using a cask taken from a Gnoll brewer in Blackburrow, which is better described elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
Juices  --  There are several things you can brew that are basically Juices, and they typically contain some foraged ingredient.  They are also some of the easiest brews (in terms of skill level) to make, so they won't help you advance much in skill.  However, they may let you start Brewing without investing too many Practice Points.  Bog Juice, a quest item for a certain class-specific quest, is made by combining Snake Scales, a Water Flask, and a Bottle.  Kalish is made by combining foraged fruit, foraged vegetables, a water flask, and bottle.  Aside from Embalming Fluid (Bone Granite Powder, 2 bottles of Bog Juice, and Rubbing Alcohol), these are the two easiest brews to make in terms of required skill level in Brewing.  Another quest item brew is Tumpy Tonic, which is made by combining a Kiola Nut and a Water Flask.  It's a fairly difficult brew to make, and Kiolas are hard to come by at times.  Heady Kiola, which finds a use in Tailoring, is made by combining 2 packets of kiola sap, a water flask, and a bottle.<BR>
