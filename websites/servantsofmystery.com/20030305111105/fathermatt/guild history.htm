  <pre><b>A Brief History of the Servants of Mystery</b></pre>
  </center>
</div>
<pre>The Servants of Mystery are the followers of Mystra, Goddess of Magic in the Forgotten Realms.
Our Lady of Mysteries is the origin and fountainhead of magic and its energies, the One True
Spell from which all others flow. Our Order is dedicated to the teaching of magic and to its
practice in service of the common good. Our members strive to aid the weak and the good, and to
engage in roleplaying.  </pre>
<pre>The Servants of Mystery was founded in March, 1995, as a non-sanctioned guild in Neverwinter
Nights (NWN), the now-extinct official on-line Advanced Dungeons and Dragons role-playing
fantasy adventure game on America Online. Our founder and first Guild Master was Lord
Mystery.  Snake (also Snaek) was elected Guild Master on May 17, 1996, and continues to serve
in that capacity to this day. Kmalj was instrumental in helping Snake build the guild. The Servants 
of Mystery attained Sanctioned status in NWN on September 30, 1996.  At some point during this period, 
FatherMatt opened the guild wine cellar; he continues to hold the keys to it.  </pre>
<pre>The Guild began operation in Dark Sun: Crimson Sands (DSO) in May, 1997, and received
formal recognition as a DSO Guild on July 16, 1997. With the opening of Ultima Online, the
Servants of Mystery applied to Origin for Guild status in Britannia on October 1, 1997 and
received Guild status in January, 1998. </pre>
<pre>The Servants of Mystery migrated to EverQuest and the land of Norrath on March 16, 1999 and
were granted Guild recognition there on May 5, 1999.</pre>
