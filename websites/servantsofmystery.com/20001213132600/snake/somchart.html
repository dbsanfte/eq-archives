<BR>
The proposed activities for the Servants of Mystery shall be as follows:<BR>  
     *Participation in events sponsored by their Realms.<BR>

<A NAME="3">3.  Background</A> <BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="3a"> a.  Description of Mystra </A><BR>
<BR>
     Mystra is the goddess of magic, the most powerful deity in the Forgotten Realms.  She is the
     goddess of the spells themselves, the magical energy that makes all spell
     casting possible.  Known also as the Lady of Mysteries, she taught the first spell
     casters and enabled many of the races to use magic.  Any powerful spell caster
     is said to be "touched by the Goddess." The Servants of Mystery ("SOM") follow
     the teachings of Mystra, and use their magic to protect, guide and enlighten the
     good characters of their Realms. <BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="3b">b.  Official Colors </A><BR>
<BR>
     SOM's colors are black, dark blue, blue, light blue and white.  Each member must wear a customary item of the appropriate color for his or her rank within the Guild in Realms where this is possible.<BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="3c"> c.  Official Symbol </A><BR>
<BR>
     The <A HREF="http://servantsofmystery.com/snake/whtsymx.gif">official symbol</A> of Mystra is a red mist flowing from the center of a circle of eight stars, with each
     star having five points <BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="3d">d.  Official Salutations</A> <BR>
<BR>
     The official blessings of the Guild is "May Mystra guide thy magics."<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#top">Return to Top of Page</A><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="4">4.  Membership Requirements </A><BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="4a"> a.  Alignment and Class </A><BR>
<BR>
     All individuals of good alignment are welcome.  Characters of neutral alignment
     will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Evils need not apply.  SOM accepts
     all classes, but prefers that each member have some spell-casting ability <BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="4b">b.  Stand on Player vs. Player Combat (PvP)</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Each member is free to decide whether he/she will participate in  PvP, but the Guild encourages PvP training for
     purposes of self-defense and combating evil.  More specifically, PvP is approved
     in the following situations at each member's discretion:<BR>
          * If he or she has been unjustly attacked.<BR>
          * To aid in the protection or training of those unschooled in the use of
          magic.<BR>
          * If he or she is directly combating the forces of evil at work in
          the Realm.<BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="5">5.  Admission to the Guild</A> <BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="5a"> a.  Application</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Applications for membership in a Temple of the Servants of Mystery are to be e-mailed to the Guild Minister and Assistant Guild Minister of that Temple.  Prospective members are
     requested to also post a general request for membership on a Guild message board.  In
     addition, prospective members are asked to post on a Guild message board an initial
     role-playing message that discusses the applicant's character, how
     he/she learned of the Guild, any adventures with Guild members, and his/her
     interest in joining the Guild.  Any member who has knowledge of the prospective
     member shall post recommendations and comments.<BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="5b"> b.  Selection</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Approval of new members will be made by the High Lord/Lady, or in his/his
     absence by the Lord/Lady Regent, upon submission of an approved application by the Temple Minister of the Temple to which the prospective member applies.  Decisions are to be made within 1 week.  If both are unavailable, approval of new member may be made by any
     two members of the Templarate of the Temple in question.  All new members will be announced on the Guild message board and greeted by e-mail.<BR> 
<BR>
    <A NAME="5c"> c.  Guild Oath</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Players that are accepted for apprenticeship must take an oath at a Guild
     meeting, while surrounded by eight burning candles, to perform all the duties of
     a Guild member.  The Council shall establish the wording of the oath as it deems
     best.<BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="6">6.   Roles, Duties and Promotion of Members </A><BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="6a">a.  Duties of All Members </A><BR>
<BR>
     All members of the Guild are required to do the following:<BR>  
          * know, uphold and further the Official Purposes of the Guild; <BR>
          * aid fellow Guild members, the weak and the Good in battle;<BR>
          * promote role-playing among all in their Realm;<BR>
          * aid fellow Guild members in all of their endeavors in their Realm;<BR>
          * share weapons, armor, magical items, maps, knowledge and money with
          fellow Guild members;<BR> 
          * recruit newcomers by providing them with information, spare weapons
          and armor, and telling them of Mystra and how to contact the Guild;<BR>
          * attend the Guild meetings; and <BR>
          * abide by the Guild Charter. <BR>
 <BR>  
<BR>
   <A NAME="6b">  b.  Role of Apprentices </A><BR>
<BR>
     Apprentice of Mystery is the ranking for all new members to the Guild. This is an
     observation period where the members of SOM evaluate the prospective new
     member.  Apprentices must identify their rank according to the customs of their Temple.  For example, Britannian Apprentices must wear a white sash, while Athasians must instead add their rank to their profile, the following being an acceptable profile statement:

SOM Somebody wears the white sash of an Apprentice of Mystery.

     The duty of each Apprentice is to become familiar with the ways of their Realm. <BR> 
<BR>
     <A NAME="6c">c.  Role of Disciples </A><BR>
<BR>
     Disciple is the ranking for all members who have served out a sutiable apprenticeship and are worthy of recognition as true followers of Mystra.  The special duty of each Disciple is
     to maximize their abilities in service to the Goddess.  Disciples must identify their rank according to the customs of their Temple.  For example, Britannian apprentices must wear a light blue sash, while Athasians must replace their Apprentice profile statement with an appropriate statement displaying their new rank.<BR>  
<BR>
    <A NAME="6d"> d.  Role of Lords and Ladies</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Lords and Ladies of the Guild are responsible for the training and protection of
     Apprentices and Disciples, and for upholding the beliefs and purposes of the
     Guild.  They must identify their rank according to the customs of their Temple.  For example, Britannian Lords and Ladies must wear a medium blue sash as a sign of their loyalty to Mystra and the Guild, while Athasians shall replace their Disciple profile statement with an appropriate statement signifying their new rank.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#top">Return to Top of Page</A><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="7">7.  Promotions</A> <BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="7a"> a.  Promotion to Disciple </A><BR>
<BR>
     Upon serving a minimum of one month from the date of admission, an Apprentice may apply for promotion
     to Disciple by posting a request on the Guild message board and e-mailing the request to
     the High Lord/Lady and Lord/Lady Regent.  Promotion will be based not only
     on the member's length of service, but also on whether the Apprentice has participated in the Guild and has
     generally upheld the beliefs and furthered the purposes of the Guild.<BR> 
<BR>
     <A NAME="7b">b.  Promotion to Lord or Lady </A><BR>
<BR>
     Upon serving a minimum of three months in rank, a Disciple may apply for promotion to Lord or
     Lady by posting a request on the Guild message board and e-mailing the request to the
     High Lord/Lady and Lord/Lady Regent.  Promotions are based on the
     player's amount of activity within the Guild, including consideration of the
     following:<BR>
          * Does the player post regularly on the Guild message board? <BR> 
          * Does the player participate in guild events? <BR> 
          * Has the player upheld SOM beliefs and purposes?  <BR>
          * Has the player completed any specific quests that have been assigned? <BR> 
          * Has the player acted bravely in battle? <BR> 
          * Has the player shown leadership?<BR>
     No one item will be decisive; overall participation in the Guild will be the
     determining factor. <BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="7c"> c.  Making of Promotions</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Promotions will be made by the High Lord/Lady, or in his/her absence by the
     Lord/Lady Regent.  Decisions are to be made within 1 week.  If both are
     unavailable, promotions may be made by any two Guild Council members.  Promotions
     are effective instantly, but each promotion will be honored by ceremony at the
     next Guild meeting.  All promotions will be announced on the Guild message board.<BR> 
<BR>
     <A NAME="7d">d.  Experienced New Members </A><BR>   
<BR>
     At the discretion of the High Lord/Lady or Lord/Lady Regent  experienced
     players may be admitted to the Guild at the level appropriate for their
     experience.  Decisions are to be made within 1 week.  If both are unavailable,
     admittance of the player may be made by any two Guild Council members.<BR>  
<BR>
  <A NAME="7e">   e.  Ceremonies and Oaths</A> <BR>
<BR>
     The Council shall proscribe such ceremonies and oaths as it deems fit for
     promotions to Disciple, for promotions to Lord/Lady and for other appropriate
     occasions. <BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="#top">Return to Top of Page</A><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="8">8.  The Orders of the Servants of Mystery
<BR>
     <A NAME="8a">a.  Purpose </A><BR>
<BR>
     The Orders are the highest honors the Guild bestows upon its members.  Each character class, with the exception of thief, has an Order to which accomplished Servants of Mystery may belong.  Rank within the Orders is based on achievements in the Realms.  The main purpose of the orders is to foster role-playing and allow character development in accordance with published materials regarding the Servants of Mystery.  The Orders of the Servants of Mystery are:<BR>
<BR>
Clerics:  The Temple of Mystra <BR>
Fighters: The Blue Gauntlet <BR>
Mages: The Many-Starred Cloak <BR>
Paladins: Knights of the Mystic Fire <BR>
Rangers: The Order of the Shooting Star <BR>
<BR>
There is also an Order for those who lend artistic talents to the Guild.  The Starry Quill is the Order to which these Bards of the Realms belong.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="8b"> b.  Membership and Discipline </A><BR>
<BR>
     Any member who is fully maxxed and
     interested in Order membership may apply.  Applications to
     the Orders shall be e-mailed to the First Officer of that Order,  and, for
     record keeping, to the Guild Council.  The First Officer shall determine admittance to the Orders.  Each who is
     admitted shall change his/her surname to reflect the Order and their own rank within it. The Orders may also have their own color schemes for character icons, although all members must wear the sash of rank bestowed upon them by the Guild to signify their devotion to Our Lady of Mysteries. Members may choose to belong to more than one Order if their classes and talents permit.<BR>
If needed, the
     First Officer may issue such discipline as he/she sees fit, including expulsion
     from the Order (although not from SOM).  Grievances ensuing from disciplinary actions shall be heard by the Guild Council, and their vote shall hold over any actions by Officers of the Orders.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="8c"> c.  Chain of Command </A><BR>
<BR>
     In terms of the chain of command for the Orders, the High Lord/Lady shall serve as Commander in Chief, and each First Officer as the equivalent of an Executive Officer.  First Officers are appointed by the High Lord/Lady, and should preferably be experienced, senior members of the appropriate class.  The First Officers may appoint assistants as deemed necessary to the functioning of the Order, and shall determine their hierarchy within the Order.   <BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="8d"> d.  Duties   <BR>
<BR> 
     Each member is expected to maintain an active presence in their Realm.  This does not mean daily presence, simply a pattern of activity that shows the member is participating in the Guild.  In addition, it is the duty of each Order member to role-play in a manner appropriate to the honorable status the Guild has granted them.   <BR>
<BR> 
<A NAME="8e"> e.  Status   <BR>
<BR> 
The Orders are the primary method of advancement beyond the milestone of maximum levels.  As such, all Servants of Mystery who have attained maximum level are encouraged to seek membership in the Order or Orders appropriate to their class or talents.  Rank within the Orders does not confer authority over those of lower status within the Guild, but it does command respect for the accomplisments made in its attainment.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="8f"> f.  Rules</A> <BR>
<BR>
     The First Officers  shall establish such rules for the Orders--including ranks
     and insignia--as he/she shall deem fit, subject to the approval of the Council.  This will include requirements for advancement within the Order, such as specific quests or missions that must be accomplished for a given rank. <BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="9">9.  The Guardians of Mystery</A> <BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="9a">a.  Purpose </A><BR>
<BR>
     The Guardians of Mystery constitute the military arm of SOM.  In war--which may
     be declared only by the Council--the Guardians are the Guild's primary forces,
     and are required to fight for SOM and its honor.  (Other members of SOM have
     the option of fighting or not.)  In addition, the Guardians may fight in response to
     individual challenges posted on the Guild message board or otherwise made.  The
     Guardians are charged, however, to avoid doing or saying anything that plunges
     the Guild as a whole into war.  The Lord Captain shall lead the Guardians.  The
     symbol for the Guardians shall be a flaming screwdriver. <BR> 
<BR>
    <A NAME="9b"> b.  Membership and Discipline </A><BR>
<BR>
     Any member who is fully maxxed (dualled and maxxed in both classes) and
     interested in PvP may apply for membership with the Guardians.  Applications to
     the Guardians shall be e-mailed to the Lord Captain, Lieutenant Captain and, for
     record keeping, to the Scribe and Assistant Scribe.  The Lord Captain or the
     Lieutenant Captain shall determine admittance to the Guardians.  Each who is
     admitted shall change his/her surname to "Guardian of Mystery."   If needed, the
     Lord Captain may issue such discipline as he/she sees fit, including expulsion
     from the Guardians (although not from SOM).  <BR>
<BR>
    <A NAME="9c"> c.  Chain of Command </A><BR>
<BR>
     In terms of the chain of command for the Guardians, the High Lord/Lady shall serve
     as Commander in Chief, and the Lord Captain as the equivalent of the Chair of
     the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  The Lieutenant Captain shall assist the Lord Captain. <BR> 
<BR>
    <A NAME="9d"> d.  Duties </A><BR>
<BR>
     Each Guardian is expected to practice and become knowledgeable in the arts of
     PvP. In addition, it is the duty of each Guardian to inform other SOM of the ways
     of PvP when appropriate.  <BR>
<BR>
     <A NAME="9e">e.  Status </A><BR>
<BR>
     Guardians are those who are particularly interested in PvP.  As PvP is not the
     primary focus of the Guild, Guardians have no greater status or privileges than
     any other Lord or Lady of the Guild. <BR> 
<BR>
    <A NAME="9f"> f.  Rules</A> <BR>
<BR>
     The Lord Captain shall establish such rules for the Guardians--including ranks
     and insignia--as he/she shall deem fit, subject to the approval of the Council.<BR>

<BR>
<A NAME="10"10.  Meetings </A><BR>
<BR>
  <A NAME="10a">   a.  Regular Meetings </A><BR>
<BR>
     Regular meetings are to be held at least once a month, and may be called by the
     High Lord/Lady, the Lord/Lady Regent or any two Council members.  The
     High Lord/Lady or the Lord/Lady Regent will post on the Guild message board a notice of
     the  time of the meeting at least 72 hours in advance (except in case of
     emergency meetings), with seven days' notice preferred.  The posting will be
     accompanied by an agenda for the meeting.  Agenda items will be set initially by
     the person(s) calling the meeting.  Subsequent agenda items--excluding the
     election or removal of Council members--may be added only by the High Lord/Lady
     or Lord/Lady Regent, although they must be posted at least 24 hours prior
     to the meeting.  In addition, the Guild Scribe will e-mail each member the notice
     and agenda for each meeting as far in advance as practicable.<BR>  
<BR>
   <A NAME="10b">  b.  Emergency Meetings</A> <BR>
<BR>
     In the event of an emergency, a Guild meeting may be called by at least three
     members of the Guild Council (also known as the "High Council"), who will set
     the agenda, e-mail to each member and post on the Guild message board the notice of
     meeting and the agenda at least 24 hours prior to the meeting.  Council
     positions may not be filled or confirmed at emergency meetings, nor may Council
     members be removed at emergency meetings.<BR>  
<BR>
     <A NAME="10c">c.  Conduct of Meetings</A> <BR>
<BR>
     Guild Meetings will be conducted by the High Lord/Lady or, in the High Lord/Lady's
     absence, by first the Lord/Lady Regent, then the Guild Chancellor, then the
     Guild Scribe, then the Guild Ambassador.  Should none of these persons be available, one of the Temple Ministers shall conduct the meeting.  The
     person conducting the Guild meeting will determine who is allowed to speak
     next. Members may request to speak by typing a "!" or "::raises hand::" or some
     similar short request.  However, members are allowed to express agreement with
     statement by the briefest of comments, such as "agreed" or "I agree with
