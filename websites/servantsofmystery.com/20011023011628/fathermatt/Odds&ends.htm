<p align="center"><b>FatherMatt's Odds &amp; Ends</b></p>
<p align="left">Batwings and fish scales--along with tiny daggers and
bloodstones for the enchanters--can be bought in unlimited quantities
at a hut at the inn in East Commons that is right on the border with West
Commons.&nbsp; (This is also true in the Arcane Academy in West Freeport and in
Ogguk, but the East Commons site is the closest to a teleport.)</p>
<p align="left">Always have a location macro (/loc) handy.&nbsp; If it looks
like you may die, hit this macro button repeatedly.&nbsp; If you do die, you can
scroll back to get the location of your corpse.&nbsp; If you forget and can't
find your corpse, enlist the help of a bard (level 4+) or necro (level
1+).&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">In the middle of the sea, you can enter a boat by getting in
front of it, ducking down (use the &quot;d&quot; key), letting the boat go over
you, then standing up from the duck (hit &quot;d&quot; again&quot;) when the
boat is over you.&nbsp; Doing
this will place you inside the boat.</p>
<p align="left">If you are sitting, /camp desktop will take you fully out of
EverQuest.</p>
<p align="left">If you have a pet, press F1 twice to target it.</p>
