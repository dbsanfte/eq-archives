<H3>The Minoc Mystery Shoppe Opens on the Lake Superior Shard!</H3></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
<H5>Hail, traveler, and well met!  Mystran Enterprises, Inc., a virtual commercial venture of the Britannia Temple of the Servants of Mystery, proudly announces the opening of the Minoc Mystery Shoppe!  Located in a guarded area on the southwestern side of the Mt. Kendall Mining Camp <A HREF="#MAP">(Click here to see a map view)</A> on the Ultima Online Lake Superior Shard, the Minoc Mystery shop caters to the discerning Minocan shopper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Featuring Magic Reagents and other magical aids!</H4><BR>
<BR>
<H5>As a public service to the people of Minoc, our shoppe features magical reagents and selected scrolls and special magic items.  We can't completely make up for the lack of a full-service magic shoppe in Minoc, but we shall do what we can!  We plan to expand our offerings as need dictates. If you want us to stock something you routinely need, contact Snake of SOM, Chief Operating Officer of Mystran Enterprises, Inc., at <a href="mailto:snake@servantsofmystery.com">snake@servantsofmystery.com</a></H5><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Miners Supplies In Stock!</H4><BR>
<BR>
<H5>How many times have you had to run across the bridge from Mt. Kendall to Minoc, stop at the bank to get some cash, and hot-footed it to the Tinker's Shoppe to buy a new shovel?  Think about how much more ore you could mine if you only had to trot over to the Minoc Mystery Shoppe instead!  Well, that IS all you have to do!  We'll try to keep a supply of shovels on hand for those times when your shovel breaks just as you uncover a new lode of iron ore!</H5><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Coming Soon: Home Add-ons, More Magic, GM Armor and Weapons!</H4><BR>
<BR>
<H5>The skilled artisans of Mystran Enterprises, Inc. will soon offer a number of attractive and useful add-ons for your home or place of business at the Minoc Mystery Shoppe.  Expanded magic offerings are also coming soon as our talented alchemists and scribes begin to offer their wares to the people of Minoc.  We are also proud to announce that Gwydion of SOM, GrandMaster Blacksmith, will be offering his exceptional hand-crafted armor and weapons at the Minoc Mystery Shoppe!  Our shoppe may be small, but you'll be amazed at what you can find there!  Don't waste your time on a trek to Vesper, stop by the Minoc Mystery Shoppe first and save yourself the trip!</H5><BR>
