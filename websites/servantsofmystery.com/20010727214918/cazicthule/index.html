    halls of this undead mausoleum.&nbsp; We made it down into the 3rd level without incident
    and successfully stole a bone-bladed claymore from the shadowknight there.&nbsp; After
    running into an overpowering patrol of necromancers and their unholy guards we completed a
    strategic withdrawal.&nbsp; Much fun was had by the participants.<br>

    friends.&nbsp; Many of the Servants have gone silent since the quest to uncover the
    secrets of the screaming mace. &nbsp; A scrap of a note was delivered with a drawing of
    many of the Servants assembled in a castle.&nbsp; Perhaps this note will lead Neranek to
    them.</p>

    <p><big><strong>08/06/99 - </strong><big><big>N</big></big></big>ews of an artifact from
    the world of Aebor-Toril has the Servants anxious with the sense of discovery.&nbsp; There
    has been talk circulating that a &quot;screaming mace&quot; has been found in the
    Crushbone area.&nbsp; Could this be a similar mace to the one wielded and ultimately
    thought destroyed at the Edifficent Library in Faerun?&nbsp; The Servants have embarked on
    a mission to Crushbone to find out.&nbsp; Coming from all quarters, they are expected to
    meet on Tuesday evening in an attempt to get to the root of the mystery.</p>
    <p><big><strong>8/02/99 - </strong><big><big>U</big></big></big>ploaded some screen shots
    from Berginyon and Nall. &nbsp; Thanks for the help brothers!</p>
    <p><big><strong>8/01/99 - </strong><big><big>R</big></big></big>evolt of the Undead
    King!&nbsp; Apparently Cazic-Thule (the god) doesn't much care for being beaten on by 30
    heroes around the levels of 45 - 50.&nbsp; (see <a href="http://www.cazic-thule.com/">http://www.cazic-thule.com/</a>
    for the story there) &nbsp; He sent his minion, the Undead King, to invade the Oasis of
    Marr.&nbsp; The Undead King was a towering skeletal presence who appeared to dwarf even
    the regions Sand Giants. &nbsp; He summoned a small army of ghouls, zombies and spectres
    to slay any hapless travellers that they came across.&nbsp; Once the field was littered
    with bodies, the Undead King disappeared.&nbsp; Presumably, he returned to report back to
    Cazic-Thule.</p>

    gathered up their desert survival gear and camped out in the North Ro Desert and then
    later in the Oasis of Marr.&nbsp; While many bugs were slain, even more were driven off in
    terror after listening to the bizarre humour these Servants were espousing.&nbsp;
    Participants were Berginyon, Snaek, Kmalj, Gleau, Iadris and Neranek.&nbsp; Other servants
    out hunting this eve were Eynon, Nall, Khaldji and Nyteride.</p>

    an exploratory service into Befallen this eve.&nbsp; They ran into many a determined foe

    will prove instrumental in the routing of the evil in the future.</p>
