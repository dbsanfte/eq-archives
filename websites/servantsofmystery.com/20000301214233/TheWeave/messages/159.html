Hail!  I don't know if you were aware of it, but your sponsor, Crissy, has left the Guild for personal reasons that I won't go into here.  I know she was the one who recruited you, but I don't know if it will make a difference to you that she has left SOM.  As for meeting members of the Guild, I haven't seen a night yet in which there were no SOMs on at all, so you should be able to find us with one of the variations on the /who command.  I have not been able to get /who all servants to work with non-Guilded characters, maybe that is stopping you, so try something like /who all Snaek (or any of the other names on our EQ roster, which can be found in a somewhat behind-the-times state on our web site).  Our most active time is between about 9 PM and 1 AM Eastern time.<p>If you're still interested, we'll see you in Norrath.  May Mystra guide thy magics!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>Snake<br>
