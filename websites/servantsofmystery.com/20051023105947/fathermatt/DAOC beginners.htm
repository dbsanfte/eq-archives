<p ALIGN="CENTER">FatherMatt’s Tips for Beginners</p>
</b>
<p>I won’t try to cover everything here, just things may not be obvious or may
be overlooked in trying to learn the game.</p>
<p><b>Commands. </b>At the time I am writing this, on the back of the map that
comes with the game CD is a keyboard layout showing which keys do what and a
list of the slash commands. The commands are also listed on pages 26 through 29
of the manual.</p>
<p><b>Abilities and Spells. </b>Be sure to check your Abilities and Spells.
Check Abilities by clicking the &quot;hand&quot; icon in the upper right. Check
Spells by clicking the &quot;ying/yang&quot; icon in the upper right. (If a
spell line is showing a solid gray small box, click it to see the spells you
have in that line.) Drag the spells you want to use on a regular basis to the left-hand gray bar and click on the number of the slot where you
want the macro to be.</p>
<p><b>Appropriate Armor. </b>As soon as you can afford it, get armor to fit in
the large slots on your character. (The small slots are for items acquired by
quest, purchased from another player or special drops.) You can
&quot;auto-drop&quot; items into the correct slots by opening your character
window (click on the &quot;backpack&quot; icon in the upper right) then dragging
and dropping the items onto your picture.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: It won’t do you any good to use weapons or armor that con red or
purple to you: these have automatic penalties that make them less useful. (This
is an anti-twinking measure in DAOC.) Use blue, yellow or orange weapons and
armor. Of the three, yellow is best.&nbsp; (Orange is a bit touch-and-go, but you can grow into it when you level.)</p>
<p><b>Scrolling</b>. To scroll the text windows, use PgUp and PgDn for the
bottom text window and Shift-PgUp and Shift PgDn for the upper text window.</p>
<p><b>Tasks. </b>When seeking a task from an NPC, use <b>/say task</b> NOT <b>/task</b>.
Using <b>/task</b> will only give you information about outstanding tasks, not
get you a new one.</p>
<p><b>Quests. </b>Right click on NPC’s to get any available quests. Use <b>/quest</b>
to get information on outstanding quests and a list of completed quests. (You’ll
need to use Shift-PgUp to get the current quest information.)</p>
<p><b>Purple Cons. </b>You probably know that creatures that con blue to you are
good hunting and creatures that con purple are deadly because they are so much
stronger than you. On some monitors it is hard to tell the difference between
blue and purple. The purple cons will have three plus signs (+++) after them.</p>
<p><b>Text Background. </b>You can control whether the background to the text
windows is clear, solid black or in between. Right click on the text window,
then click on the arrows to lighten or darken the background. Be sure to click
on &quot;Accept&quot; when done to save the change.</p>
<p><b>Armor Repair. </b>Be sure to repair your armor and weapons when the
&quot;Con&quot; on them drops down to between 90% to 85%. Repair by dragging and dropping
the item on a Smith.</p>
<p><b>Macros. </b>You may want to create at least two macros, one to
rest and one to stand. Create a macro by using the form <b>/macro Stand /stand</b>
where the &quot;Stand&quot; in the middle will be the label on the macro icon
and /stand is the action it performs. Drag the macro to the left-hand gray bar
and click on the number of the slot where you want the macro to be. Holding down
the Shift key and right-clicking deletes a macro.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; if you're a caster and
need all the slots for spells, typing <b>/r</b> will put you in rest mode, and
hitting the Up Arrow key or Numlock key will get you standing again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Healers.</b> After level 5, you need to visit an NPC healer after each death in
order to remove resurrection sickness (which otherwise takes a fair time to wear
off) and regain any lost Constitution points. Most towns have healers, though
sometimes (as with Audlitten) they are in a nearby fort. Just keep right
clicking on the healer (and paying the coins) until you get a message saying
that all of your Constitution points have been restored. Also, you probably know
this already, but if you go back to where you died and pray at your grave, you
will get some of your lost Experience back. (Again, this is only at level 6 or
above.) Just target the gravestone and use /pray.</p>
<p><b>Bind Points. </b>You can change your bind point (where you go when you
die). Many towns have bind points, which are indicated by a large boulder with a
small pointed column on each side. To change your bind point, stand relatively close to the
boulder and use <b>/bind</b>.</p>
<p><b>Location.&nbsp; </b>Use
<b>/loc</b> to see your location. (Getting maps with location numbers on the
sides is very useful.) The first number is your East/West coordinate and the
second is your North/South coordinate. To increase the first coordinate go East.
To increase the second coordinate, go South.</p>
<p>

<B>Direction.
</B>&nbsp; Use <b>/d</b> to determine the direction you are facing.&nbsp; Use Shift-c to activate, change and remove a compass
      window.&nbsp; (Hold down the Shift key and hit the &quot;c&quot; key.)&nbsp; It's small and very useful.</p>
<p>

<B>Grouping.&nbsp; 
</B>The obvious reason to group is that you die less often.&nbsp; =)&nbsp; One way to find a group is to click on the group icon in the upper right-hand corner, which looks like some dots and a semi-circle.&nbsp; Click on the &quot;Find&quot; button to find groups and people looking for groups in your area.&nbsp; You can also click the button that will tag you as &quot;looking for group&quot;.&nbsp; (Another method: if you see someone in your area, con him/her and if he/she
is about your level, ask politely to group.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<B>Horses.&nbsp; 
</B>There is no teleporting in DAOC (except to the battle grounds and to Darkness Falls); the way to travel long distances is to hire a horse, which are available at most of the larger towns.&nbsp; (Look for a horse standing outside with a stablehand nearby.&nbsp; Buy the ticket from the stablehand, then give the ticket to the stablehand start the ride.)&nbsp; The cost is 5 silver (500 copper).&nbsp; The best horse maps at the time I'm writing this are at Allakhazem (see <IMG HEIGHT="10" ALT="blueball.gif(7394bytes)" SRC="blueball.gif" WIDTH="10" ALIGN="middle"><A HREF="http://www.daatlas.com/albion/horsetravelmap.html">Albion</A>
<IMG HEIGHT="10" ALT="blueball.gif(7394bytes)" SRC="blueball.gif" WIDTH="10" ALIGN="middle"><A HREF="http://www.daatlas.com/hibernia/horsetravelmap.html">Hibernia</A> <IMG HEIGHT="10" ALT="blueball.gif(7394bytes)" SRC="blueball.gif" WIDTH="10" ALIGN="middle"><A HREF="http://www.daatlas.com/midgard/horsetravelmap.html">Midgard</A>).&nbsp;&nbsp;The lines are drawn straight, but the horses follow the roads.&nbsp; To get off along the way, hit the &quot;a&quot; key.&nbsp; Your
horse will go on without you, but if you're where you want to be, who cares?&nbsp; Watch for bridges, water, towns and forts to keep track of where you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; (You may well also want to get a map for the region where you are heading.)</p>
<p>Be safe!</p>
