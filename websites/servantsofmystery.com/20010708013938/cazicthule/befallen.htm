<p align="left"><big><strong>7/25/99 </strong></big>- What has Befallen the Servants?
&nbsp; Sunday evening served up a most interesting adventure for the assembled Mystran
host.&nbsp; Ashnal, a Lady of Mystery, received a request for help from an elf warrior
named Hyunkel.&nbsp; Hyunkel had travelled into the ruins of Befallen and had promptly
managed to leave his belongings behind him.</p>

<p align="left">Ashnal send out a call to arms to her fellows in the Servants of Mystery.
&nbsp; Many responded to her call and fell upon Befallen in a determined formation, among
them Neranek, Adon, Gleau, Nall, Eynon and the paladin in St. Talia's service, Cassus.
&nbsp; Stalking throught the ruins, Cassus was backed against a deep well by an undead
skeleton lord and he toppled to his doom.&nbsp; In the face of this double rescue mission,
Mystra smiled upon us by allowing Hyunkel a relatively easy time in finding his
belongings.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Attempting to spot the broken body of Cassus, the magician Neranek
overbalanced and also fell down the well.&nbsp; He arose from the fall and was beset upon
by a foul necromancer and his undead minions.&nbsp; The Servants were determined to affect
a rescue to the bottom of the well.&nbsp; For many hours, these stalwart Mystran faithful
attempted to overcome the odds and reach the third level of the Befallen ruins.
&nbsp; Finally, as the battle weary and bloodied Mystrans were nearly overcome with
exhaustion, a most desparate plan was hatched.</p>

<p align="left">Cassus bravely dove down the well and taunted the necromancer before
dashing off into the tunnels below.&nbsp; The enraged necromancer and his undead roared
off in pursuit.&nbsp; Hearing the sudden silence at the bottom of the well, Neranek once
more plunged down the well.&nbsp; He quickly gathered up the belongings of Cassus and his
own, and cast a gate spell to deliver him back to the top of the well.&nbsp; </p>

<p align="left">Through the brave sacrifice of Cassus, he and Neranek were able to reclaim
their belongings.&nbsp; Weary, the Servants departed the ruins and camped for the night,
vowing to return in the future to rout the evil.</p>
