Posted by Jesse-Guildmaster Of No Limit Soldiers on February 22, 1999 at 23:16:25:<p>
Hello good sir.  My name is Jesse and I am the leader of a new guild called the No Limit Soldiers.  We as of now only have 16 members but we are gaining daily.  I saw that you are out to help others and we are also.  I would really like to speak with you and possibly form a lasting alliance.  I understand you are a busy man and whatnot, but I feel that this would be a nice way to meet new friendly people.  And do not worry I am not asking for anything monetary at all.  I am just looking for friends in thsi evil realm of cowards, thieves, and pkers.  If interested please icq me-28339048  I hope wecan make a lasting bond that will benefit both sides.  Oh, and if you are a guildmistress I beg your pardon.  Good day to you-Jesse
