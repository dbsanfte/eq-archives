Hail!  There is an easy quest that can get you cash for gnoll teeth, which can be found on any adult gnoll but NPCs will not buy.  First, get some gnoll teeth by killing gnolls, which can be found in abundance in and around Blackburrow, in the Qeynos Hills.  Take your gnoll teeth to Captain Tellin at the Steel Warriors Guild Hall in the Grounds of Fate in South Qeynos.  You can find him upstairs on the balcony next to Ebon Strongbeard.  Before you try to give the teeth to him, say Hail to him, then after he replies, say "What about the gnolls?"  He will give you a promise of reward for gnoll teeth.  Give them to him one at a time by dragging one onto him and dropping it, then clicking the Give button.  He will give you a Moonstone for each tooth.  Take the moonstones to Fish's Ale House, which is in South Qeynos, just east of the dock that the Port Authority is on.  Talk to MacNeil Jocub and after he answers your hail, say "I have moonstones."  He will tell you he'll give you something for moonstones.  Give them to him like you gave the gnoll teeth to Captain Tellin, one at a time.  He will give you a bottle of Blackburrow stout for each moonstone.  These can then be sold to NPC vendors for a little more than 7 silver each.  It's not as lucrative as hunting willowisps on Erud's Crossing,but it's not bad for something that you can't actually sell itself.<p>Mystra guide thee!<p>Your Humble Serpent,<p>Snake<br>
