<p ALIGN="CENTER">FatherMatt’s Guide to EverQuest Etiquette</p>
<p>Looting.</b> After entering a group, ask if looting is being done in
alphabetical order or is &quot;free for all&quot;. Also ask whether autosplit
should be on or off. (Casters tend to like it on, since they are usually medding
rather than looting.&nbsp; Monks tend to like if off, since coins weigh them down too much.)</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Even with &quot;free for all&quot; (ffa), make sure everyone gets roughly
    the same amount of loot; tell people to loot up if they do not. Be sure to
    leave corpses on the ground for a while so that everyone has a chance to
    loot. If you are getting more than your fair share of coin, use /split
    [plat] [gold] [silver], where /split 0 12 0 would take 12 pieces of your
    gold and split them among all party members. With &quot;free for all&quot;,
    special items usually are &quot;randomed&quot; to the highest number,
    generally by the group leader.</p>
    <p>The standard rule is that if an item comes up for a particular class and
    you have someone of that class in your group who can use it, he/she gets
    first dibs.</p>
    <p>Often it is considered bad form to loot during battle, although if you
    are in a group with constant pulling this may be unavoidable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The main point is to always ask what should be done if you are not sure. You
do not want to be known–rightly or wrongly--as a &quot;ninja looter&quot; who takes more than a fair share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Grouping.</b> Also after entering a group, find out what you are to do (pull,
tank, heal, buff, nuke)–it may be different than your usual (or preferred)
role.&nbsp; Don’t make assumptions about this: doing so can cost lives. With casters
in particular, if there is another person of your class in the group, talk it over and figure out
how you will divide up your duties. Casters should always give periodic reports
on their percentage of available mana, whether asked or not.</p>
<b>
<p>Kill Stealing.</b> Yes, it’s wrong to steal someone else’s MOB. (Although
some would argue that this is &quot;in character&quot; for evil races, if you do
this you aren’t going to get any help from anyone when you need it.) Still,
don’t assume that someone intentionally stole your kill; let the offending
party know that was your kill and see what they say. (Casters in particularly
may be pulling with very long-range spells and may not have seen you.&nbsp; Also, in some areas the MOBs' pathing is weird, so it may not look like the MOB is following you.) If you
accidentally steal someone’s kill, apologize profusely and leave the corpse
for them to loot.</p>
<b>
<p>Spamming.</b> Never spam the zone by repeating a request too quickly. Yes,
you can repeat a request (for a group, help etc.) but wait a decent interval
between each send. Otherwise, you will wind up on many folks’
&quot;ignore&quot; list. If you get into a conversation using /shout or /ooc,
take it to /tell so you don't annoy the rest of the zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Fleeing.</b> If you are fleeing a MOB and heading for a zone, hit the NumLock
key (if you haven’t already) to run automatically, then send a /shout using
the word &quot;train&quot; and saying which zone you are heading to, for
example: /shout Train to FV zone! (If you are in a zone for a while, you may want to make a macro for this.)&nbsp; Always take your MOB to a zone, rather than
dragging the MOB into a group of people (such as at the docks in Oasis). It’s
YOUR MOB to deal with, not theirs. DO yell for help by using /help, which you
should have macroed for ready use.&nbsp; (Using /shout to get help is pointless unless you also state where you are--and there's usually no time for that.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Inspecting.</b> It is considered much more polite to ask someone’s
permission before inspecting their equipment. I’ve never had anyone refuse
this request, but be sure to ask:&nbsp; some folks get really upset if you don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Help.</b> When requesting any kind of help, use &quot;please&quot; and
&quot;thank you&quot;. Never demand that someone help you, and if someone turns
down your request for help, accept it gracefully. You will also get better
attention if you speak in character and/or roleplay.</p>
<b>
<p>Donations.</b> Always offer to donate for services (SoW, Clarity, teleports
etc.) even if the provider does not say anything about it. Often you will find
they refuse the donation, but be sure to offer. If they refuse the donation and
are casting for you, try to cast a buff in return–even if you have only the
lowliest spells and you are sure they won’t take. It is the effort that is
appreciated.</p>
<b>
<p>Language.</b> Do not use foul language (there are kids playing the game),
make racist or sexist remarks (such as commenting on a female character’s
physique) or call someone &quot;gay&quot; or &quot;fag&quot;. If there really is
a need to insult someone, find a more creative way to do it.&nbsp; Don't use the word &quot;rape&quot; to describe what you did to that MOB:&nbsp; many women player justifiably take offense at this.&nbsp; </p>
