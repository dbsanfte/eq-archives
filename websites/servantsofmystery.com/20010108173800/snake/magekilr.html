Mage Killer<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
A figure in dark leathers stood before an ornate chest. Inside were his most prized possessions, the tools of his trade. He quietly slipped the key into the lock, and turned. He felt the mechanism turn, and he jumped to the side just as a dart tipped with the poison of a Wyvern's tail flew out of the lock.<BR>
<BR>
Satisfied that the chest hadn't been tampered with, the slim figure picked up his tools, and readied them. <BR>
<BR>
First he pulled out a small bag with several different rings in it. He took out a red, and a blue ring, and placed them on his middle fingers. He was now immune to fire and ice based attacks. Next he slipped out a white ring, and a dark green one. Placing these on his ring fingers he sighed in contentment. Now he was immune to poison and lightning attacks as well.<BR>
<BR>
Next he put on a ring with a full Globe of Invulnerability cast on it. On the same finger in his opposite hand he placed a ring that protected him from attacks of the mind. As an after-thought he took out two more rings, one of water-breathing, the other was a ring of vampiric regeneration. He placed these rings on his "pinkie" fingers.<BR>
<BR>
He reached into the chest and pulled out a bundle wrapped in silk. He gently unwrapped it, uncovering bracers that protected him from thrown weapons, and any weapons non-magical. <BR>
<BR>
He then unwrapped a helm that prevented others from casting any type of tracing spell on him, and he put this on. Next he took out some boots of speed, and a shield that either absorbed or reflected spells cast at the wielder, all the person holding the shield had to do was will it to be so.<BR>
<BR>
The next item he took out wasn't wrapped in anything, but it seemed to be somewhat alive with a power all its own. The shadowy figure shook it out, revealing a jet black cloak. He swirled it on, and activated its powers. The cloak suddenly sprouted giant bat wings, and flapped under the will of the figure in black. With another thought the wings receded back into the wings of the bat cloak.<BR>
<BR> 
He then took out various daggers and throwing weapons, many of which had spells cast on them. From the bottom of the chest he brought out a scabbard. It appeared to belong to a normal long sword, but this weapon was not normal. It was a sword of sharpness, and it had taken the life from more than one mage before. With deep reverence he strapped it on his waist.<BR>
<BR>
There remained only four things in the chest, each in a separate corner. They were specially bound rocks, taken from certain places around the realms. They were shielded in metal, because nothing magical was even remotely safe in the presence of these rocks. Two of them were dead magic rocks. Any enchantments in a certain area were rendered inactive, and no spells could be cast. It was perhaps the single most destructive thing in his arsenal, because it could wipe out anybody's magical defenses, even his own. The remaining two rocks were wild magic rocks. Any spell cast in a wild magic area ran a high risk of becoming warped, and twisted. These were a basic last defense, and a souvenir from the Time of Troubles. He strapped one of each rock onto each hip.<BR>
<BR>
Picking up his shield, the figure stood. It was time for the hunt. . .and there was a mage that needed killin'. . .<BR>
                          *                *                 *<BR>
Elora hummed a cheerful tune as she walked through the woods. Several squirrels skittered about overhead, playing chase with each other. A pair of birds looked up from building their nest to chirp testily at the light hearted squirrels.<BR>
<BR>
The cleric just shook her head, and idly ran her fingers through her long, sun-golden hair. She was taller than most men, standing at nearly 6 feet tall. She was dressed in pure white robes, trimmed in blue. She had a fair complexion, and her eyes shone like aquamarines.<BR>
<BR>
Glancing down at the path in front of her, Elora opened her spell-book. She had recently taken up the study of magic, and her tutor wanted her to study as much as she could. She got distracted again as a deer came bounding through the clearing to take a drink at the small pool that passed nearby.<BR>
<BR>
Elora flounced onto a tree stump, and placed her spell book on the forest floor. It was too fine a day to be studying a musty old book. That's why she had left the temple in the first place, so that she could be outside among nature.<BR>
<BR>
She reached in her pocket for some grain, and held it out for the deer to smell. The deer looked up, and cautiously sniffed the air. After decided that a late afternoon snack couldn't hurt, the deer came up and nuzzled Elora's hand, eating that grain that she had there. <BR>
<BR>
Looking fondly at the animal, Elora started to idly stroke the deer's magnificent fur. "What a fine animal you are," she murmured.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly the deer looked up, frightened. Without advertising his intent, the deer took off through the forest.<BR>
<BR>
Puzzled, Elora looked after it. "Now why would you do that, little deer?" she wondered aloud.<BR>
<BR>
"Maybe it's because she saw me sneak up behind you." a cold, quiet voice said from behind her.<BR>
<BR>
Startled, Elora spun around. "Who are you?"<BR>
<BR>
Ignoring her completely, the man clad all in black looked at the open spellbook on the forest floor. "So, you're a mage are you?" he asked with casual calm.<BR>
<BR>
 The girl picked up her book and hugged it to her chest, something about this man seemed, wrong. "What's your name?" she asked again, quietly readying a spell.<BR>
<BR>
The man in black looked at her, and noted the that she was trying a spell. Narrowing his eyes, he replied, "I'm called the Mage Killer, and I will be your death."<BR>
<BR>
At his words the girl released her spell, that of a clerical spell flamestrike. A great pillar of flame immediately pierced the heavens, and struck the man, enshrouding him in flames. Shivering uncontrollably, that was the only time she had used a spell to harm, Elora backed up.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly there was a hiss, and the pillar of flame died down. "Haven't you got something a tad bit stronger than that? I'd hate to have this over with so quickly." The man in the black said, as he started a slow advance.<BR>
<BR>
The girl, trembling, turned around and started to run. The man in black frowned, "That's not very sporting of you." he said with a frown. Using the extra speed afforded him by the boots of speed, he got in front of the girl.<BR>
<BR>
When she saw that he was in front of her, Elora screamed, eyes wide with fright. She fell to the ground, back peddling furiously. She turned, trying to get away. The Mage Killer strode up behind her, and grasped her shoulder. Spinning her around, he drew his sword. "And so ends another meddler of a spellcaster that seeks to toy with the very forces that give us life." With that he drove his blade through the spellbook, which she still clutched to her breast, and into the soft chest beneath it.<BR>
<BR>
His blade slid in easily, brutally ending the life of the young woman that just wanted to be left alone with nature. As she died, the forest, which had been silent up until now, shuddered to life as squirrels and birds alike ran away in horror. <BR>
<BR>
The Mage Killer watched as the light left the eyes of his most recent victim. This one wasn't even a challenge. He contemptuously pulled his blade free, and cleaned the blood off of it on the robes of the dead girl. He glared down at the girl, and watched the slow spread of blood in grim satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
He snapped his head up, Someone was coming this way! He hurriedly looked around for a place to hide. He scrambled up a tree as a male elf walked into the clearing, looking down at the dead girl in horror. The elf said a short prayer to Mystra over the body, and the figure in the tree tensed. If this was a spellcaster he would have to die, but nothing he had done so far led the cloaked figure to believe that the elf was a mage.<BR>
<BR>
Thinking, Mage Killer moved off through the trees to find a suitable area. There was always one way to find out if someone's a mage. . . <BR>
                           *                 *              *<BR>
Ceribus wandered through some woods that he happened to find. He didn't know the name of these woods, but that hardly mattered. All that mattered was that he was in a setting that made his elven soul well up in thanks. <BR>
<BR>
He was dressed in plain, homespun robes, the only ornament he had was a small symbol. It had eight stars in a circle, with a red mist flowing downward from the center. The symbol of Mystra, goddess of magic. He wasn't a cleric, he just belonged to the Servants of Mystery, and they liked for their officers to wear Mystra's symbol.<BR>
<BR>
He walked on, enjoying the peace and quiet. He passed a certain type of tree, and he paused. Taking out his knife, Cer cut into the bark a short way, and drained off some of the sap. Cer removed a powdered mint flavored leaf from one of his many pouches, and mixed this with the tree sap. When it was sufficiently mixed, Cer stuck it in his mouth and started chewing. <BR>
<BR>
Blowing a bubble with the concoction, Ceribus walked on through the woods.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly a deer burst through the woods in front of Cer, with the whites of his eyes showing, clearly scared out of his mind. Concerned, Ceribus tried to calm the animal down. However, the animal had other thoughts in his head. Breaking free of Cer's grasp, the deer bounded on through the forest.<BR>
<BR>
It wasn't long after that, that Cer heard a scream resound throughout the forest. Instantly wary, he tried to determine where the sound came from. He figured, quite correctly, that whatever made the deer frightened probably caused the scream as well. So he headed off in the direction that the deer came from.<BR>
<BR>
It didn't take him long to reach the clearing, and the sight he saw made him gag. He saw a girl laying on her back, with a single sword mark through her breast, and the book she had been holding. There was a semi-congealed pool of blood that was spread out from the wound. <BR>
<BR>
Walking fully into the clearing, Cer gently closed her eyes, and spoke a short prayer to Mystra. As he was raising up, he heard the sound of something moving through the trees. It sounded too heavy to be a forest animal, so Cer made note of which direction that noise was traveling. Casting a spell of illusion on the dead girl, so that hopefully nothing would mess with her, Cer sprinted off in search of whatever made that noise. <BR>
<BR>
He had chased the sound until he came into a really dense region of the forest. He didn't have much hope of following the sound now, the trees grew too close together to do much following.<BR>
<BR>
Just as he was about to turn around, Cer noticed a man standing in the shadows of a tree. He had almost overlooked the man because he was wearing all black, but Cer could see him now.<BR>
<BR> 
"Hail!" Cer called out. "Do you know anything about the dead girl back in that clearing?" Cer asked.<BR>
<BR>
"Can't say I have mate," replied the dark-cloaked figure. "I was just waiting here for someone to help me, will you help me?"<BR>
<BR>
Somewhat confused, Cer agreed "Aye, what did you have in mind?"<BR>
<BR>
"Just follow me." the man replied mysteriously.<BR>
<BR>
He lead the way to another clearing, this one with a cave nestled in one corner. Off to one side of the cave was a drop off, and it ended several hundred feet below, on many sharp edged boulders.<BR>
<BR>
"What exactly are we here for?" Cer asked with some trepidation.<BR>
<BR>
"There's a dragon in that cave that has been terrorizing caravans. I've been sent to destroy it, but my mage has died. I thought you were a mage, and could help me." The man in black said smoothly.<BR>
<BR>
Cer glanced around nervously, he didn't like the idea of fighting a dragon in this terrain, but he didn't really have a choice, the human would probably die without the help of a mage. "Alright, you're correct, I am a mage." the human's eyes lit up. Cer continued, "When the dragon comes out I'll cast a lightning bolt at it, by the way, what color dragon is it?"<BR>
<BR>
"It's a red."<BR>
<BR>
"Okay, after the lightning bolt connects the first time I want you to start throwing daggers at me."<BR>
<BR>
The man in black let his jaw drop. This idiot mage just ASKED him to kill him! The Mage Killer nodded, and Ceribus went into motion.<BR>
<BR>
Casting a fireball spell, Cer aimed it into the cave's entrance. The fireball flew in, and billowed out in a magnificent explosion of fire. The cave shook, and several small boulders dislodged themselves.<BR>
<BR>
The dragon brought its head out of the cave. Its head alone was two times as tall as Cer was. The monster's teeth were as long as swords and looked to be as sharp as diamonds. It gazed malevolently out at the fool that had dared awaken it. It pulled the rest of its serpentine body out of the cave entrance, and slowly unfolded his enormous wings.<BR>
<BR>
Cer finished casting his lightning bolt spell, and aimed it so that it would rebound off the cave wall behind the dragon, and hit the dragon twice. The bolt flashed blue from Cer's hand, and struck the massive beast in the chest, then the rebound hit him in the back.<BR>
<BR>
Ceribus looked towards the human, and signaled him to start throwing. Mage Killer did so happily. Each blade he threw went true . . .and Cer caught each one and put it up into the air, flipping and catching until all of Mage Killer's knives were in the air. Mage Killer looked on in stupefaction. That mage had caught every blade and was juggling them! <BR>
<BR>
Ceribus had no time to look at his companion, he shifted slightly, and added in a few blades of his own, these were enchanted blades. When the dragon started to inhale, Cer casually flung each blade as strong as he could. The blades came down in the juggling pattern, and were then thrown straight toward the dragon. A steady line of blades was leading away from Ceribus, and when the last blade left his grasp, he collapsed, breathless.<BR>
<BR>
The dragon, who had closed his eyes in preparation of toasting these intruders, felt the first burning stab, he wasn't worried. When he felt twenty more follow in quick succession, then he thought something was wrong and swallowed the fire he was getting ready to breath. The last blade struck home, and the dragon collapsed on its stomach, driving the blades even deeper.<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer just looked at Cer. Shaking out of his amazement, Mage Killer set his mouth, drew his sword, and grimly started to advance. He was going to regret killing this particular mage, but not for very long.<BR>
<BR>
Cer looked up, and saw the human stalking toward him with a drawn blade. "Its alright, I believe that he won't be troubling anything for a while." Cer said, slightly out of breath.<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer paused. "I don't care about the dragon. My name is Mage Killer," he said with a bow. "And I will be your death."<BR>
<BR>
"Now that's not a very polite thing to do, now is it?" Cer asked.<BR>
<BR>
His killer stopped, momentarily confused. This wasn't how things were supposed to go. "Aren't you going to scream, run, beg for mercy, or cast spells at me?" he asked.<BR>
<BR>
"Why should I?" Cer asked in return. "I just want to know why you want to kill me."<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer paused. This wasn't a normally asked question. Still, it wouldn't hurt to tell this one before he died. "My parent's were once mighty spell caster's. One day their magic got out of control and destroyed them. All because of magic! I was just old enough to understand what had happened. Their pursuit of magic killed them, magic killed them. That's why I kill mage's, because no one should mess with the stuff that gives us life."<BR>
<BR>
Cer thought to himself that that sounded kinda hypocritical, but he didn't say anything. He almost had his breath back, now if this guy would just keep talking..."I'm sorry for your loss," Ceribus said. "By the way, my name's Ceribus." <BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer looked uncertain. This wasn't supposed to happen. His victims weren't supposed to feel sympathetic, they were supposed to feel fear. "You do know that I'm going to kill you, right?"<BR>
<BR>
Cer nodded, "Most likely." he agreed.<BR>
<BR>
Scowling, Mage Killer started moving towards Cer. He stood above Cer, who was still on the ground, with sword upraised. Trembling, he lowered the sword slightly. "Cast a spell."<BR>
<BR>
"Can't do it," Cer replied. "Mystra forbids the irresponsible use of magic."<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer growled, "The Goddess of magic? She's the one responsible for my parents death! I'll kill her too in time!!"<BR>
<BR>
Cer didn't even think, he just cast a stream of magic missiles at the Mage Killer. Killer swung his shield around and absorbed the hits. "I tried to get you to see that some of us use magic with dignity, not casting spells to enslave or harm other folk, but you just wouldn't listen." Cer said as he slowly stood.<BR>
<BR>
"You told me lies, magic spells should always be kept away from mortal use."<BR>
<BR>
Cer cast another stream of magic missiles at him. Like the others, these were absorbed into the shield. <BR>
<BR>
"For lying to me I'm going to kill you slow, mage," he sneered, making an insult of the word. Pointing his shield at Cer, Mage Killer released the stored spells. Many bright pulses of magic raced toward Cer, and burst apart before they hit him, stopped by a minor globe of invulnerability.<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer snarled, and rushed toward Cer. Ceribus called his magic quarterstaff to his hand, and prepared himself. Mage Killer came in high, swinging for Cer's head, Cer blocked, then swiped for his opponent's legs.<BR>
<BR>
He backed up, then attacked with a shield slam as a frontal assault, and came in low with his sword, angling it up towards Cer's ribs.<BR>
<BR>
Ceribus cast a dimension door and ended up at the edge of the cliff edge. Mage Killer was enraged, it had been a long time since someone put up this much of a fight! Lunging with his sword, Mage Killer made a mistake. Ceribus moved out of the way slightly, and pushed Killer's back. Mage Killer went over the edge.<BR>
<BR>
Fearing contingency spells, Cer ran to the edge of the forest. He heard an insane cackling coming from behind. Wondering what was going on, Cer turned around. What he saw surprised him more than a little.<BR>
<BR>
Mage Killer seemed to have grown huge bat wings and was hovering over the chasm, laughing insanely. He had lost his sword and shield in the fall, but he thought he could still beat this opponent.<BR>
<BR>
Then something unexpected happened, the dragon recovered. It snapped its massive head up, and glared right at something flying in the air. The dragon couldn't see very clearly because of the tears of pain, and to its blurred vision the flying bat-winged thing looked somewhat like a baby dragon come to take advantage of a wounded relative.<BR>
<BR>
With a bellow of rage, the wounded red dragon rose, slowly, up to its feet. Mage Killer looked at it in horror. The first time in many long years he had felt this emotion. The dragon flapped its mighty wings, and reached out a taloned arm to snatch the would-be plunderer. Mage Killer tried to fly away, but the dragon's massive tail shot out, grazing him, and tearing his cloak. As the cloak's enchantment fell away, the dragon's taloned hand reached him, and in the space of but a breath the man feared by mages everywhere was no more.<BR>
<BR>
Ceribus turned and ran into the forest, glad to be rid of the Mage Killer. By luck or chance he happened upon that first clearing. He dispelled his illusion, and gently buried the body. This clearing would never be the peaceful haven it once was, but at least the soul of the girl would be at peace. He must remember to have a cleric from her church stop by to say last rights for her.<BR>
<BR>
Ceribus sat and prayed silently that her spirit knew peace. As he was finishing he heard a noise off to one side. Standing and brushing himself off, Cer waited. Out of the brush came a face he knew well, the paladin Kmalj, resplendent in his full plate mail, polished as usual.<BR>
<BR>
"There you are lad!" Kmalj rumbled. "I've been looking around for you, what have you been doing?"<BR>
<BR>
Cer thought back, smiling he replied "Not much, just playing with a dragon, nothing important." With that he walked off into the forest. After shaking his head at Cer's statement, Kmalj joined him.<BR>
