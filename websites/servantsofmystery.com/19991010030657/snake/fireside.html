Fireside Chat with Talia<BR>

<BR>
You push the heavy oak door open and enter a brightly lit room. 
Candles cast their illumination across a spacious sitting room. 
The floor is carpeted, a rarity indeed in these parts.  A
fireplace lines the far wall with two high-back chairs sitting
facing it.  A coffeetable sits between the chairs with a silver
service set upon it.<BR>
<BR>
You breath in a light scent of mint.  You spy a lady sitting in
the one of the chairs.  Her hair is scarlett and shoulder length. 
Sensing you entry, she turns in the chair to face you.  Seeing
her purple eyes gazing at you softly, and the light smile upon
her lips, you begin to relax.  The Lady Talia Autumnals is all
you have heard.  <BR>
<BR>
Smoothing a fold in her splendid azure dress, Talia beckons you
forward.  "Please, do be seated." she says in a light, musical
voice.<BR>
<BR>
You glide forward throught the rich carpet and settle down into
the comfortably upholstered chair.  Talia leans forward and picks
up the silver teapot.  After pouring a cup of the steaming
liquid, she hands the cup to you.  You take the cup and inhale
it's aroma.  Ahh, the source of the mint, you surmise.<BR>
<BR>
Talia settles back into her chair, folding her legs up into the
chair beneath her.  She sips from her cup briefly and then sets
it aside on the table.  "You have come to hear of Sybil. 
Correct?"<BR>
<BR>
You nod in agreement. <BR>
<BR>
"Let me begin with a little of her background.  I have come to
know her rather intimatly," she says with a wry smile, "and
little of her life escapes me.  Sybil was born into a low ranking
house within the hierarchy of Menzoberranzan, Hyp'Tel.  She was
the first born child of their Matron, Qagless.  In a vain hope to
increase her houses power, Qagless sent Sybil off to Arach-
Tinilith in very early in her life."<BR>
<BR>
Talia pauses and takes a sip from her tea.  "At their school of
priestesses, Sybil was treated as one lower than low.  Drow
society is one of violence and treachery.  There were no helping
hands for her.  Instead of sucumbing to despair, Sybil thrived
there.  In that quality, she and I are much the same.  Hate
filled her heart and she threw her entire being towards servicing
her spider goddess, Lloth.  Where as, here on the surface, I was
able to work towards different ends."<BR>
<BR>
"As her lust for power grew, she gained in ability.  She seemed
adept at all things magical, however, she neglected her physical
studies.  She has only taken up arms once or twice.  Sybil did
not live in a vacuum, however.  Her ambitions were noticed my
other members of the clergy from more powerful houses.  They
bargained with Lloth and won a boon.  They were sent a rather
exotic looking vampire thrall of Lloth's choosing.  The vampire
seduced the young drow and gave her his gift of nigh-eternal
life.  Lloth had agreed to the request for many reasons I am
certain.  No doubt did the conspiritors endebt themselves to her,
but they also gave a powerful chaotic tool to Lloth in the form
of a vampire-priestess.  Know this, above all else, Lloth thrives
on chaos."<BR>
<BR>
You swallow your mouthful of tea and nod solemnly.  Slowly, you
trace a warding sigil in the air.<BR>
<BR>
"Sybil served Lloth in this capacity for centuries.  She was
given to prowling the surface world during the night, sowing
havok wherever she could.  It was but a short time ago our paths
crossed here in NeverWinter."<BR>
<BR>
The Lady Paladin pauses.  Studying her face, you think you can
spot a hint of regret in her eyes.<BR>
<BR>
"One night, not long ago, I arrived at the Inn in WindyCliffs.  I
had promised my old friend Versuccio that I would sing and dance
that night for his patrons.  Entering the Inn, all seemed to be
at rights with itself.  The Inn was packed as usual with an
assortment of travellers, shopkeepers and sell-swords.  However,
Versuccio was not at his usual post behind the bar.  <BR>
<BR>
"I was informed by a passing waitress that he was in the
storeroom.  Since Versuccio and I are old friends, I thought
nothing of wandering back there to greet him.  Outside of the
door, my fighters instinct ticked off in my head.  Something was
out of place here."<BR>
<BR>
"I concentrated for a moment and was nearly overwhelmed by the
power of the evil that I detected.  Slamming the door to the
stockroom open with my shoulder, I charged in to see Versuccio
throughly entranced by the Vampiress' gaze.  I brandished my Holy
Symbol against her to no effect.  She was of a level far above my
abiltity to turn."<BR>
<BR>
"We fought, then, over the life of that innkeeper.  Sybil relied
heavily on magic to attempt to bring me down.  After she hit me
with an opening magical attack, I cast Minor Globe of
Invulnerabilty on myself and charged her with my enchanted
blade."<BR>
<BR>
"I hit nothing but open air.  While I was protected from her
magical assaults, she was able to dematerialize at will.  I was
easily able to defend against the minor physical attacks she
attempted, but we were in a standoff.  In frustration, Sybil
called upon her goddess, and was answered.  While she stood
there, she returned to a solid form, to receive the blessing of
Lloth.  Seeing an opportunity, I took it.  As my blade bit into
her neck, the capricious Lloth took her priestess' prayer of
besting me and twisted it to suit her chaotic fancy."<BR>
<BR>
Talia breathes a deep sigh and sips from her cup.<BR>
<BR>
"To Lloth, there is no great love between her and her servants. 
So what she did next cost her nothing, and amused her greatly. 
As the life began to slip from Sybil, she honored her request for
aid in besting me in a chaotic way.  Using my blade as a conduit
between Sybil and I, Lloth transferred Sybil's essence into my
body."<BR>
<BR>
"A long, drawn out struggle for control ensued between us. 
Eventually, I came out on top but she lurks here," Talia
indicates her forehead with a graceful hand, "always scheming,
trying to find a way to either possess me or escape to another
host."<BR>
<BR>
"From time to time, she has gained momentary control over me. 
Fortunately, only when I am taken off guard, or extremely weary. 
She is a scourge and a pox on my soul and I would be rid of her
if I was able."<BR>
<BR>
Finishing, Talia smiles warmly at you.  "Have no fear, my friend,
she is shut away quite strongly at the moment.  Here, have
another cup of tea and let us spend some time listening now to
stories of your adventures."<BR>
<BR>
It is many hours later before you bid the Lady good-eve and
journey on your way.<BR>
<BR>
