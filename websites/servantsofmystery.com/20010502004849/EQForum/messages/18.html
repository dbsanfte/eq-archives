So where is Paw and how do I get there, you ask?  (Well, you didn't but I'm going to tell you anyway!)  This is a LONG walk from Qeynos:  roughly half an hour, even if running and not stopping, but it's a good place to know about.  <p>From Qeynos, go north to the Qeynos Hills, then north-east past the guard tower (follow the road) to the canyon that leads to West Karana.  <p>Once in West Karana, turn right to head south along the base of the mountains.  When you come to the water, turn left and follow the water's edge (heading east).  Stay close to the water and you'll avoid the monsters.  Keep going (yes, it seems like forever--and it durn near is!) and you'll eventually hit the zone to North Karana.  <p>Once in North Karana, keep heading east along the water's edge and you'll come to four curved spires and the tower at one end of the bridge leading to South Karana.  (In the tower you'll find a cleric NPC who can cure disease and poison, and a guard captain on the roof with a quest.)  There are also often guards on the ground here, so it's a good place to remember.  <p>Cross the bridge; you'll hit the zone for South Karana about half-way across.  Paw is due south of this bridge (you just keep going straight from the bridge).  When you get to the top of the first low ridge after the bridge, you'll see some ruins at the right.  STAY AWAY FROM THE RUINS!  There are nasty undead there and they attack in groups!  Also watch out for the lions, which are aggressive in South Karana:  detour around them if you have to.  On the other hand, the centaurs and the elephants do not attack unless you are foolish enough to attack them.  (Don't do it!)  However, do move out of the way of the elephants, for I'm not sure if they can step on you by accident or not.  <p>Paw is at about minus 3200, plus 800 in South Karana.  You'll start to see it at about minus 2500:  low brown hills with three giant rock claws along one side.  <p>The entrance to the Paw dungeon is in those hills relatively near the middle claw.  However, you probably will want to hunt the gnolls that frequently spawn on the surface.   In addition to random spawns, gnolls spawn just on the outside of each stone claw; often you have go around each claw to see them, rather than merely look from the hills.  There is also a flat spot about half-way up the north-west side of the hills where a gnoll spawns.  Con each gnoll, because they range in strength.  The EXP and loot is good, and usually not many people are around.  Remember, if you get in trouble, you can run into the Paw Dungeon for the zone that is not too far underground there.  (It's probably a good idea to try this zone first so you know where it is before gnoll hunting.)<p>The only real problem is that there is no nearby place to sell your loot!  There may be a building in the southeast corner of North Karana (near a dangerous brigand camp) where goods can be sold, but I haven't had a chance to check this out yet.  (If anyone knows of good places to sell in that region, please let me know.)<p>Good hunting!<br>--FatherMatt
