The Servants of Mystery are the followers of <A HREF="#Mystra">Mystra, Goddess of
Magic</A> in the Forgotten Realms.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the origin
and
fountainhead of magic and its energies, the One True Spell from which all others flow.  Our Order is dedicated to the teaching of magic and to its practice in service of the common good.  The Servants of Mystery was founded in March, 1995, as a non-sanctioned guild in Neverwinter Nights (NWN), the now-extinct official on-line<A HREF="#ADD"> Advanced Dungeons and Dragons</A> role-playing fantasy adventure game formerly hosted on America Online.  The Servants of Mystery began operation in <A HREF="#DSO">Dark Sun: Crimson Sands (DSO)</A> in May, 1997, and received formal recognition as a DSO Guild on July 16, 1997.  The Servants of Mystery also have Temples in several other game worlds <A HREF="#Where">(Where?)</A></H4><BR>

<A NAME="Mystra"><H3>Mystra, Goddess of Magic</H3></A>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
<H4>
Mystra is the Goddess of Magic in the Forgotten Realms.  She is the Goddess of the power of
magic itself, not the Goddess of spellcasters, although many spellcasters number themselves among her followers.  To her alone is given the power to see through the eyes of the other gods and goddesses of the Forgotten Realms, that she may see how their strength of purpose colors even their perception of reality.  Our Lady of Mysteries is the greatest of the Greater Powers of the Realms.  When the word came that Neverwinter would be destroyed, the Servants of Mystery fled through an Astral Portal, transporting their Tower to the desert outside the city of Tyr on Athas.  The Servants of Mystery believe there is a way to cast spells on Athas without draining the life forces of living beings, if only a way can be found to bring the power of The Weave, the magical energy of the Forgotten Realms, to godless Athas.  We believe that all Athasian magic can be powered by the Weave, and that Mystra herself can be brought to Athas by the power of the Shards.  Then the defiling of Athas will end, and the Green Age will return!  <A HREF="#Join">Join</A> us as we teach Mystra's wonders to those who would achieve greatness in service of Good!</H4><BR>

<A NAME="Talia"><H3>St. Talia the True</H3></A>
</CENTER>

<H4>
Saint Talia the True epitomized the spirit of Mystra.  This Paladin and Mage was the finest of the Knights of the Mystic Fire.  She spent countless hours traveling the Forgotten Realms, aiding those too weak to survive on their own and questing to find items of power for use in combating evil.  She served as Mystress of Apprentices during the peak period of growth of the Guild in Neverwinter Nights.  Shortly after she was chosen to serve as Assistant Guild Mystress, she was taken to Mystra's side.  The Servants of Mystery revere her as Saint and Protector of all who use magic in the service of Good.  The Shrine of Saint Talia was consecrated in the Temple beneath the town of Longsaddle, where she dwelt before her ascendance.  New Shrines will be consecrated in each world in which the Servants of Mystery travel.  May her shining spirit continue to inspire us wherever we roam!</H4><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.TEN.net/DSO">Dark Sun: Crimson Sands</A>, also known as Dark Sun Online or DSO, is a multiplayer online AD&D game playable by Internet or by direct phone connection to <A HREF="http://www.TEN.net">Total Entertainment Network</A>.  This game is set on the desert world of Athas, a harsh and forbidding land filled with deadly creatures, not least of which are other people!  DSO is based on the 2nd edition AD&D rules and incorporates Psionics as well as Clerical, Druidic, and Mage magics.  Players can choose from among a diverse set of races (including muls, half-giants and thri-kreen!) and class combinations.  The Servants of Mystery have recently petitioned the Powers that rule DSO for official Guild recognition.  Come explore Athas with us!  We can bring the power of the One True Spell to this godless world!</H4><BR>

<H4>
Advanced Dungeons and Dragons (AD&D) is a fantasy role playing adventure gaming system
from <A HREF="http://www.tsrinc.com">TSR</A>, a publisher of games and related materials headquartered in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin and recently acquired by <A HREF="http://www.wizards.com">Wizards of the Coast</A>.  In AD&D,
players create fantasy characters of various races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, etc.) and classes (fighter, cleric, druid, magic-user, thief, etc.) and play the parts of these characters in imaginative adventures.  Characters solve complicated puzzles, fight fantastic monsters, and earn amazing treasures as they travel through lands of fantasy.  AD&D has attracted a large and diverse group of people to its realms of fantasy and adventure.  You, too, can play AD&D in the privacy and comfort of your own home by joining us in <A HREF="#DSO">Dark Sun Online</A>, the remaining official AD&D online game.</H4><BR>
