There are two ways you can get the Deadlands Pony Express Mailin' List.  We got yer Regular list and we got yer Digest version.  The only difference 'tween the two of 'em is the packaging.  
<P>

The Mailin' List is a *very* high-traffic list.  We routinely put through over 150 messages per day.  With the Regular list, you get each email individually, mere moments (in most cases) after it gets sent to the list.  While there are a lot of emails, each individual one is small.  And you can keep up with things as they happen.
<P>

The Digest version contains all the emails you'd get if you were subscribed to the regular list, but it saves 'em all up for you and sends 'em to you in four or five big chunks per day.  This is for folks who want to read all the emails, but don't want 80 different emails per day cluttering up their mailbox.
<P>


If'n you wanta join the Regular version of the Deadlands Pony Express Mailin' List, here's what you do:
<P>

Send an email to <A HREF="mailto:esquire@gamerz.net">
esquire@gamerz.net</A>.  Leave the subject blank.  In the
body of the email, don't put nuthin' but:
<P>

<DL>
<DD>
<PRE>
SUBSCRIBE deadlands
</PRE>
</DL>


If you want the Digest version, follow the same instructions as above, except put:

<DL>
<DD>
<PRE>
SUBSCRIBE deadlands-digest
</PRE>
</DL>

...in the body of the message.
<P>

A few minutes after you send this email, you'll get a
confirmation message.  We hafta send these confirmation
messages out because some sidewindin' varmints like to stir
up trouble for innocent folks, and one of the ways they
do it is to sign up folks they don't like to a zillion mailin'
lists.
<P>

Anyhow, just foller the instructions in the confirmation message
and you'll be in afore ya know it.  And welcome to the Deadlands
Pony Express!
