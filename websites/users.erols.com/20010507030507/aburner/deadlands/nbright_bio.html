<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My first introduction to Role Playing was on-line at the
Castle D'Image Mush, but I didn't discover table top gaming until I met my
husband, Darrin Bright.  He and his friends introduced me to Warhammer FRP,
Call of Cthulhu, and Paranoia.  Then Deadlands came along, and gaming
stopped being something I did with my husband and his friends and became
something I did for the total pleasure it.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I've played Warhammer FRP, Call of Cathulhu, Feng Shui, and
Paranoia, but Deadlands is the first game I've owned.  Darrin might think
the Deadlands books are his but they are really mine, mine... all MINE!
