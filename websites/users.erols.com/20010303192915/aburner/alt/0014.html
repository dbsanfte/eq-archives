<P>Pardon my week-long absence, AB, but I do get taken away from this blasted machine every once in a while.  It's probably a good thing, too.  Anyway, back to where the rubber meets the road.
<P>(1) If I was incorrect in my note (5), then I apologize.  There remains, however, the question of just what you <I>are</I> trying to say if (5) is not <I>implied</I> by your remarks.  Is it unconstitutional for Vermont to refuse to recognize an individual's certification, granted by Montana, to practice law?  Does Vermont's action in such a case "nullify" the "Full faith and credit" clause?  If this is what you are saying, then we have some fundamental disagreements on the nature of the Constitution that we need to resolve before we can effectively discuss issues as particular as DOMA.  If this is not what you are saying, then how is DOMA, which allows for the same type of exception, a threat to the "Full faith and credit" clause?
<P>(2) Also, your definition of "enumeration" in relation to the powers granted to Congress needs some clarification.  It was Congress that authorized, by law, the establishment of the U. S. Air Force.  Since no mention of an Air Force can be found in the Constitution, am I correct in taking your remarks to mean that we should consider this to have been an unconstitutional act?  If so, again, we need to go back to the basics.<P>

The Framers knew that the people, through Congress, could eventually vote themselves into dictatorship.  Their hope (which was tarnished for some by what has turned out to be a well-founded pessimism) was that their intricate system of enumerated powers, federalist organization, sytemic checks, and specified divisions of powers would prevent our nation from falling into the historically consistent pattern of democratic governments' eventual descent into tyranny. It is my sad assessment that today each of these safeguards has been rendered practically ineffective.  We are now, in fact, ruled by the whim of the mob, and they, in turn, are ruled by their own self-indulgent tendencies and the cleverness of demagogues.  It is only the rapidly evaporating individual and institutional memories of effective self-government that preserve what little remains of the rule of law.
<P>(3) You insist on characterizing the passage of DOMA as an act of nullification of the first clause, when, in fact, it merely takes advantage of Congress's <I>specifically enumerated authority</I>, established by the second clause, to make <I>exceptions</I> as it deems necessary.  It is an authority not only clearly established by the <I>words</I>, but also strongly supported by the <I>intent</I>.<P>

One of the great impediments to the successful drafting (much less ratification) of the Constitution was the issue of slavery.  The slave-holding states would not agree to join (or remain in) any union that prohibited slavery.  The non-slave states, beyond rejecting slavery in principle, would not agree to accept the effects of slavery within their own borders.  The second clause (which you seem to want to treat in the way that the ACLU treats the Second Amendment, by ignoring it) permitted Congress to make exceptions to the "Full faith and credit" clause so that, among other things, the legal recognition of certain human beings as property could have <I>no effect whatsoever</I> in those states that did not grant such recognition.<P>

It was not until the activist (read:  extra-Constitutional) Taney court nullified (in effect) the second clause -- by nothing less than judicial fiat -- that Congress's authority in this regard was questioned.  The Supreme Court committed a blatant act of law-making from the bench by forcing all states to recognize as property those human beings who were declared to be property by any other state.  It is just such an act of illegitimate judicial imposition that DOMA is designed to preempt.
<P>Back to you.
