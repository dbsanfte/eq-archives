Everyone knows the story of how Jesus fed the multitudes with
only a few loaves of bread and a few fishes.  The Blessed can 
call upon their Deity to partially reproduce the ol' 
Loaves 'n Fishes miracle.<P>

The Blessed character must already have enough food to feed a
full meal to one person.  If the character doesn't have any
food to start with, he's outta luck.  The Blessed character
must also be the person cutting and serving the food.<P>

A successful <I>faith</I> roll means that the power of the
Blessed's patron has miraculously multiplied the available food.
Each success and raise feeds an additional two folks.  (So a
simple success would feed three people, a raise would feed five
hungry folks, and so forth.)<P>
