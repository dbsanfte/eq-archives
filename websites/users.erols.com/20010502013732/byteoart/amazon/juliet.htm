            childhood was a nightmare.</b> My family, living out in the forest 
            at the time, was captured by the gruesome orcs of Lord Crush when 
            I was five. My Mother and Father were sold to Ambassador D'vinn shortly 
            there after. I saw them leave Crushbone via a secret entrance only 
            known to Lord Crush and to Ambassador D'vinn. I knew some day I would 
            use that secret to escape.</font></td>

            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              was forced to work their mines until I was 15 years old. At this 
              time I was moved to work in the castle. This was my opportunity 
              to escape, for the castle was under constant raids. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On 
              the eve of my escape, while I was preparing to sleep, Our Mother 
              Tunare visited me and blessed me with the rudimentary ability to 
              shape shift and to peer into peoples minds. She knew I was destined 
              to greatness and that I was planning to escape that very next morning. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
              a final gift, to which I owe my life, She granted me the shape of 
              a smelly orc for one hour whenever I chose to use it. I escaped 
              easily out through the tunnel and never looked back...until it came 
              time for my revenge. I headed far out into the forest not knowing 
              which direction to go. I came to a small valley where I rested and 
              waited for the orc illusion to wear off. When it did and several 
              hours later, I came upon the city called Felwithe. </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              was the first time I had seen the place so I wondered in and looked 
              around. I was very hungry so I ..um..borrowed some bread and was 
              promptly placed in prison. With ease I made the guard think I escaped 
              for I turned myself into a rug. After getting caught again, I was 
              carried off to Master Goldsinger, the guild leader of the Enchanters. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              figured that it was either prison or a hard life as an enchanter 
              so I reluctantly chose to learn the ways of the Enchanters. I was 
              under Master Goldsinger's direction for 6 levels at which time I 
              foolishly determined it was time for revenge. I accepted a tenure 
              with the Champions of the Feydarks to defend against the orc onslaught. 
              I was fighting the orcs for many years.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
              all of my hatred was extinguished I headed for home where I was 
              welcomed as a hero. I learned that my fame had spread to the guards 
              of both the city that I now call home, Felwithe, and the famed tree 
              city, Kelethin. Whenever I visit these places the guards warmly 
              greet me and invite me to the local bar for war stories.</font></p>
            <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I 
              now live from place to place changing race as I choose only visiting 
              my friends in Felwithe on occasion. </font></p>
