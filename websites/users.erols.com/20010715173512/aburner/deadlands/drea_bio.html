<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It all started back in my wee teen years when a friend of mine named Silver was running a youth course on roleplaying, and well, we'll be darned if it wasn't Chill.  I personally took the course so I could stare at Silver for a few hours, but well, that's just me.  The only chick in the entire group, I had to prove myself by tying a cherry stem with my tongue and buying lots of Beastie Boys albums (which I didn't mind)

Chill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Oh Silver!!!<BR>
Deadlands&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Starring Ian the Mute Huckster<BR>
CoC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;          You honestly don't want to know how I got away with playing what I did.<BR>
Shadowrun&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Corps - does a body good!<BR>
Noir&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;         If you don't know what Noir is...<BR>
and finally, that darn GRW, using my half infamous metallic green based minis.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Right now, it's a dead heat between Deadlands and Noir.  I just love Noir.  Noir is good.  But it's tough to beat Bob the Last of the Flying Elvi.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I write, draw, and I do graphic design.  I am, once again, unemployed, and thinking that maybe taking up tattoo art wouldn't be a bad idea.<P>

  Other than that, I enjoy playing with Jay and Mark, as well as giving Phalen's dirty mind some cannon fodder.  Oftentimes, i write really dumb letters to Afterburner giving him bad suggestions as to what to do with stuff (not like THAT, you sickos)

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I am really really scary.  Really.  I swear to God.  I'm a perky goth, which has been tested to be the most evil, vile, and horrendously frightening thing on Earth.  You've been warned.<P>

  I'm also a big fan of Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, the Beastie Boys, the Doors, Portishead, Willy Nelson, and the man in black (NOT Will Smith)
