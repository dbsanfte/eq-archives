<B>I live in:</B> New Orleans (not da parish, not Baton Rouge, but New Orleans, dammmit)<P>

<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
My parents used to run D&D when I was 8 or so, so I blame them for my current financial situation.<P>

Later, I met some friends in High School that played Cyberpunk, so I got into that.  It wasn't long after that they made me GM for them...  I don't play much now [SOB!]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Currently, I GM Deadlands, Cyberpunk 2020, Palladium games, and hopefully Hell On Earth when I get it.<P>

I also get to play In Nomine, Over the Edge and Fading Suns when I'm lucky, and when Mischa Krilov's feeling like GMing.<P>

I also own a huge stack of games which I never touch, and frequently contemplate the fact in irritation.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>
<blockquote>
I very much dig Deadlands, obviously.  I'm big on the Palladium universe, but not the system.  Conversely, I love Cyberpunk 2020's system, but not the universe...<P>

Fading Suns has a lot of promise but I don't play it often, and In Nomine has great potential but gets far too complicated for my tastes.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>
<blockquote>
I'm a guitar player, but don't hold that against me.  At least I'm not a drummer ;-)<P>

I'm also a Web Designer by trade, and I'm not a bad technician either.<P>

I froth at the mouth around hot muscle cars, Joe Satriani, Bruce Campbell, Anime and really badass movies.<P>

You may, on occasion, catch me ranting about Final Fantasy 7.<P>

And I take great pleasure in tooling my brother in Quake.  I will own joo!

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>
<blockquote>
Beware the hype, when I advertise additions to the Bullet, I get a little involved :)<P>

And if you need graphics for your web page, give me a beep, I'll let you know.
