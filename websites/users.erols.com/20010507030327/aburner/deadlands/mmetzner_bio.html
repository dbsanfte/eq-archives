<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Books.  They were like Heroin to my 9 year old mind.  I grew tired of THEIR choices so I forged my own road into RPGs

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Oh lord.  What HAVEN'T I played?<P>

Currently, then: AD&D-Greyhawk, DEADLANDS (which I Marshal), Warhammer, GREAT RAIL WARS, and the upcoming MARVEL SAGA game and Hell On Earth!!!!<P>

Oh, and boring old Poker.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
DEADLANDS.  (the PINNACLE staff make this an easy choice, along with all the cool people on the ListServ.  Support is ACES in my book.)<BR>
GRW  (This is what got me INTO DL, if you can believe it)<BR>
AD&D  (First loves are hard to forget.)<BR>
Shadowrun <P>

And boring old Poker.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Comics, reading all genres of fiction (fantasy and sci-fi preferred), tennis, mini painting, movies, Playstation, writing, trying not to be such a geek in front of my girlfriend. :)<P>

Oh, and apparently the ListServ. :)

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm stuck at a computer 8 hours a day, so I'm ALWAYS on the ListServ.  This is both good and bad apparently, to some.<P>

And FYI, Jay and I have taken MOST of our silliness offline.  But since he has the attention span of a rabid squirrel, sometimes he leaks out into the Serv.  I'm doing my best to contain any problems, but I'm running low on Ghost Rock, so I do what I can.<P>

Also, in case my mail server's down at work, I'm on Yahoo! as Manitou_Joe.  Simple, huh?  BTW, thanks AB for keeping Jay's <I>[fake]</I> bio of me offline. &nbsp;&nbsp;<I>[No problem.  We're here to serve.  -AB]</I>&nbsp;  For those of you who want to read JAY'S version of this bio, email him directly, as I wash my hands of the little monster.</blockquote>
