      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I just watched a show 
        about Amazons on the history channel. It was very interesting. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It would seem that 
        the ancient Greeks first wrote about the Amazons. The name &quot;Amazon&quot; 
        comes from the Greek. It means &quot;One breast.&quot; Apparently Amazons 
        burned off the right breast, so they could shoot arrows better (that's 
        some real commitment!). </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Greeks considered 
        the Amazons to be the best warriors, and thought no normal Greek man could 
        hope to beat one. Of course the Greek "heroes" could <i>supposedly</i> 
        beat Amazons. In one story, a Greek hero (I forget which one - Herododis 
        or something like that) killed the Amazonian Queen, then fell in love 
        with the corpse. What can I say? The ancient Greeks were weird.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Then the show continued, 
        and talked about Amazonian Celts, Native Americans, Africans, and even 
        prehistoric Asian Amazonians. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The one thing they 
        all had in common was that they were fierce, merciless warriors who defended 
        their homes with great courage and skill.</font></p>
