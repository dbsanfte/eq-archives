<B>Info:</B> Contrary to what some folks'll tell ya, Josey Wales
hain't always been an outlaw.  In fact, up until around 1869, I 
reckon he was a right nice feller.  Had hisself a farm out in 
the backwoods o' Missouri, a purty young wife, and a strappin' 
10-year-old son.  Everything was as fine as it could be.<P>

But one day, while Josey was out plowin' up a patch o' dirt to 
plant some vegetables, he saw smoke risin' up from the woods 
where his house should be.  He ran home just in time to see his 
wife bein' carried out of their burnin' house by some Union 
Redlegs led by Captain John Terrill.  He did his best to save 
his family, but he was on foot, unarmed, and outnumbered.  He 
was struck down by Captain Terill hisself, and Wales bears the 
scar to this day.<P>

When Wales came to, his family was dead and his house had been 
burnt to cinders.  Now, this wouldn't set right with most folks, 
as you might expect.  But something inside Josey Wales snapped 
that day.  He fished out his .45 Peacemaker from the burnt ruins 
of his house and began to practice his shootin'.  By the time 
Bloody Bill Anderson and his band o' Confederate raiders showed 
up, Wales had reached the point where he hit more'n he missed.  
And when he found out that Bloody Bill was aimin' to payback the 
Union and, in particular, the Redlegs, Wales told 'em he'd be 
joinin' up.  Thereafter followed several years of guerilla 
fightin' as Anderson, Wales, and the rest of Anderson's raiders 
took the fight to the Union.<P>

It all ended one day when Anderson's band was lured into an 
ambush.  Anderson was fatally wounded in the ambush, and 
everyone but Josey Wales was captured.  The Rebels were lined 
up and were prepared to be taken as prisoners of war.  Instead, 
the Union soldiers turned a Gatling gun on the helpless Rebels.  
Josey raced in from the trees in time to kill a sizable portion 
of the Union camp all by his lonesome, and then he escaped with 
one of his former companions.<P>

Naturally, the Bluebellies took sorta a dim view of the whole 
mess, and they offered a $5000 reward for the man what could 
bring in Josey Wales, dead or alive.  And some of their spies 
managed to convince a few high-up folks in the Confederacy that 
Josey Wales betrayed Anderson's raiders, lured them into the 
ambush, and then killed 'em hisself.  So the Confederacy also 
has out a $5000 reward on his head.  Needless to say, Wales is 
right popular with a lot of bounty hunters, and there ain't many 
places where he ain't recognized.<P>

Wales's whereabouts are unknown at the moment.  The last 
verifiable sighting of Wales has him headin' south into Texas 
accompanied by an elderly Cherokee and a young Navajo squaw.  
Rumor has it that he's settled down and taken hisself a new 
young wife in some ghost town in south Texas, but the bounty 
hunters that go lookin' for him down there either come back 
empty handed or they don't come back at all...<P>
