&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the rest of their Para- and Quasi-Genasi cousins, the Shadows of the Vapors have a pretty easy transition when they leave their native plane and hit the Multiverse-at-large.  The biggest reason for this is simple: Sigil.  Sigil is, thanks to its status as the City of Doors and the Crossroads of the Multiverse, the first location most travellers (of any race) visit on their first trip outside of their native plane.  And the air of Sigil is almost always filled with some form of smog, smoke, or haze.  So, while Smoke Genasi have to go through the usual adjustments that all Para- and Quasi-Genasi have to go through the first time they leave their native planes, all the smoke and smog in the Sigillian air provides Smoke Genasi with some of the comforts of home.  This probably explains why Smoke Genasi are the most numerous of the Para- and Quasi-Genasi on the Planes.  It also probably explains why Sigil has the largest concentration of Smoke Genasi outside of the Plane of Smoke.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, since they acclimate themselves so easily to life in the city of Sigil, cities in general (especially those with lots of smoke and/or smog) come to provide Smoke Genasi with a measure of psychological security.  Consequently, Smoke Genasi are dedicated and enthusiastic city dwellers.  Naturally, this doesn't mean that they're always happy and cheerful about their lot in life.  They have the same problems as the average berk, after all.  But Smoke Genasi are fascinated by city life like no other race in the Multiverse.  They can gaze for hours at the endless ebb and flow of traffic on a city street, watching the intricate patterns of life play themselves out on the cobblestones.  And the rare Smoke Genasi planewalkers will travel from city to city on the planes, exploring them, learning their customs, and so on.  Indeed, some of the best travelogues on the Planes have been written by Planewalking Smoke Genasi.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoke Genasi always have a faint odor of smoke about them, and this odor usually indicates their mood.  The pleasant odor of smoked cedar, for instance, may indicate that the Smoke Genasi is in a generous mood, while a sharp and acrimoniously smoky odor might indicate anger or jealousy.  Smoke Genasi usually also have dark gray hair that moves of its own accord like smoke coming off a fire, or mottled gray skin which seems to change coloring and pattern from moment to moment.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Dexterity, -2 Strength: Smoke Genasi are as slippery as a puff of smoke.  Unfortunately, they're about as strong.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Smoke Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Air- and Fire-based spells and effects.  Smoke Genasi also receive a +1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. spells which affect their target via inhaled vapors (for example, <i>Stinking Cloud</i>).  Both of these bonuses increase by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.  Note that some spells which produce vaporous clouds actually work by contact rather than inhalation (e.g. <i>Cloudkill</i>).  Smoke Genasai are no more resistant to these spells than anyone else.
<LI>+2 racial bonus to Hide skill checks when trying to hide in shadows.
<LI>+2 racial bonus to Move Silently checks.
<LI>Outsider: Smoke Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Smoke Immunity (Ex): Smoke Genasi can breathe non-magical smoke without difficulty or discomfort.
<LI>Smoke Sight (Ex): Smoke Genasi can "see" through smoke up to 120 feet.  This applies only to smoke, and not to fog or any other vapor.
