<B>Info:</B>The man known only as El Mariachi is a mythic figure, Señor.  I will tell you his 
story for the price of a cerveza.  Ah, muchas gracias.  To your very good 
health...<P>

El Mariachi was a wandering musician who travelled from town to town playing his 
gitarra in any saloon or cantina who would let him.  One day, he travelled to the
wrong town.<P>

This town, it was run by a bandito muy malo.  And this bandito had heard that an
assassin had been sent to kill him.  The assassin, he heard, carried his guns in
a guitar case.  So he sent his men out to search for a stranger with a guitar
case.<P>

Well, sure enough, there was El Mariachi wandering through town with his guitar
case.  Los banditos didn't stop to see if maybe he really was just a musician.
Instead, they just tried to kill him.<P>

El Mariachi managed to survive.  He is quick like lightning, muy fuerte and...sorry.  
"Muy fuerte" means "very strong."  Anyhow, he is very dangerous, and he
finally kills the bandito, but not before the bandito kills his -- how you yanquis
say? -- his "girlfriend."  And the bandito also shoots him in his fret-hand, so
now he can no longer play la gitarra.<P>

Since this time, he has gone across the countryside looking for banditos who prey
on innocent people.  He even killed his own brother when he discovered that his
brother was also a bandito.  And, like the assassin they thought he was, he now
carries around a guitar case full of guns.  No one knows where he is or where he 
will turn up next.  Many people think he is a myth, but I know better.  I have
seen El Mariachi in action, and I tell you -- I am glad he is on our side...<P>

<BR>
<B>Special Gear:</B><BR>
      A guitar case with lots of guns.  This
case also contains a spring-loaded device which can launch a shotgun 4-5 feet
straight up into the air.  If El Mariachi is standing next to the case,
he can grab the gun and fire in the same action on a successful quick-draw
roll.<P>

      El Mariachi also has two spring-loaded
gun holders strapped to each of his forearms.  On a successful quick-draw
roll, the guns in these holders will zip into El Mariachi's hands and he 
can fire them in the same action.<P>
<BR>
<B>*</B>Although <I>performin'</I> is usually a <I>Mien</I> based skill,
El Mariachi can no longer play the guitar due to his injury.  However,
he still retains his knowledge of how to play the guitar.<P>
