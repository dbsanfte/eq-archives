<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Not AD&D, if you can believe it.  Started playing RoleMaster when I was like 17 or so(Yes, I was a late-bloomer). Ever since it's been mostly Shadowrun.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
RoleMaster, Shadowrun, EarthDawn, Vampire/Werewolf(I'm  ashamed to say), AD&D(Dark Sun mostly, and of course Deadlands as of late.  Of these, only DeadLands and Shadowrun I currently play.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
The ones I currently play(more like the ones I currently GM or Marshal). &lt;g&gt;

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

Guns.  Doing the occational computer thing. Guns. Write when I can.  Did I mention guns?

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
My hobby list is short because I work a lot.  Right now I work for a Corporate Security and Private Investigations company(that's what we say when we are Security Guards that get paid well).  &lt;g&gt;<P>
I also hope to get into Law-Enforcement, and my "dream" is to be a real Marshal(not the kind that run Deadlands, I do that already).  &lt;g&gt;
