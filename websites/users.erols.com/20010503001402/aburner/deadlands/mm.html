<B>Personality:  </B>I know mountain men are supposed to be
a little crazy, but I'm tellin' ya I saw what I saw!  I wuz out
checkin' the traps last week, seein' if I'd caught anything.
The beavers are out this time o' year, so I got traps in every
creek bed and stream around these parts.<P>

So I'm sittin' there -- it's where this stream runs into Potter's
Lake, y'see? -- and I'm resettin' a trap that got sprung without
catchin' nothin'.  And I spot over on the shore a grizzly steppin'
down to the water to drink.  And then, just as sure as I'm
standin' here, this...THING...rears up outta the water and
latches onto the side of the bear!  The bear starts into howlin'
and growlin' and tryin' to knock this thing off'n its side, but
the thing won't let go!  And it drug that bear straight into
the water and I never saw it again.<P>

Well, as you might expect, I hot-footed it outta there.  Ain't
been back since.  But I can't stay down here forever.  I'd be
obliged if I could tag along with you.<P>
