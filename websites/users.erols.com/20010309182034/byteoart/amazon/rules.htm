          After all, they can bring you gifts, fix your boo-boos, and other things 
          that we don't want to bring up here. Who knows? They might even make 
          good...*gasp*...mates.</font></b></li>

          Well. A few pieces of armor, help going through a tough area, and such...that's 
          not taking advantage. Flirting to get what you want? That's natural. 
          It's expected. We couldn't possibly refuse to do it. But don't focus 
          on just one man and drain him dry. Take only as much as is fair, and 
          never promise something you won't give.</font></b></li>

          All woman are important. Who knows? A youth we help today might be a 
          sister tomorrow.</font></b></li>
