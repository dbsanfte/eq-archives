<B>Description:</B>  You don't like machinery much at all.  Maybe you don't like the filthy smoke they belch into the air.  Or maybe you just don't trust 'em to do what they're supposed to do without blowing up in your face.<P>

Taking the 3-point hinderance means that your character doesn't trust anything created by mad science.  To use a mad science-created item (this includes riding on trains that use Ghost Rock and riding on steam wagons), the character must first succeed on an Onerous (7) <I>Spirit</I> roll.  (Add +2 to the roll if the situation is life-or-death.)  Failure means that the character refuses to use the item.  Characters with the 3-point hinderance can never purchase an Aptitude relating to mad science (e.g. <I>shootin': flamethrowers</I>).<P>

The 5-point hinderance means that your character views anything more complicated than a pistol or a rifle (or other simple machinery, like a hand water pump) as an evil blight on society -- whether it's from mad science or not.  She will not use complicated machinery (trains, steam wagons, gatling guns, and so on) at <I>all</I> except in a life-or-death situation, and even then she must succeed on an Hard (9) <I>Spirit</I> roll (with <B>no</B> bonus) to do so.  Assuming she succeeds with the roll, all attempts to actually use or operate complicated machinery (firing a flamethrower or driving a steam wagon, for example) are made with a -2 penalty in addition to whatever other penalties may apply.  If she goes bust on the <I>Spirit</i> roll, she will attempt to destroy the item in question.  Naturally, characters with the 5-point hinderance can't specialize in any Aptitude involving advanced technology (e.g <I>trade: steamboat captain</I>).
