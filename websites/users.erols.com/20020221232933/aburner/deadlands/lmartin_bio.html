At 14 I saw an ad for Marvel Super Heros in a comic.  So I bought it and the rest is a misspent youth.

You name it I probally have it.  As far as playing goes the only games I really have had a chance to play are pendragon(solo) and Marvel (GM).  I am more of a collector.   But I hope now that I have a game store near me I can join a game or two!!
