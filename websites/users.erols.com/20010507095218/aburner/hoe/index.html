<Font size=+1>Hell on Earth is the role-playing game of the Wasted West, and is one possible future of the original Deadlands setting.  If you're not familiar with Deadlands: The Weird West, it's a cross between the Western and Horror genres.  It's a world much like our own Wild West, right up until 1863.  On July 3rd, 1863, the Reckoning occurred, and pretty soon the heroes of the West found themselves fighting Walkin' Dead, werewolves, Mojave rattlers, and other weird critters.  Fortunately, the Reckoning also gave certain heroes special abilities to fight these monsters.  While these powers weren't always without their risks, hex-slinging hucksters, gizmo-toting mad scientists, miraculous clergymen from all faiths, and shamans at one with the nature spirits helped even the odds a bit.<P>

Hell on Earth is set over 200 years after Deadlands: The Weird West.  It's been 13 years since the Last War.  The world is an apocalyptic wasteland, but that's not the only thing to worry about.  Abominations and fearmongers still walk the earth, making survival even trickier.  To get an idea of what it's like, take the <I>Mad Max</I> trilogy, Blue Oyster Cult's "Veteran of the Psychic Wars," the future world of <I>The Terminator</I> movies, and a bunch of monster movies like <I>The Blob</I>, <I>Tremors</I>, and <I>Return of the Living Dead</I>.  Stick all these ingredients in a blender, set it on frappé, and wait a few minutes.  The resulting mixture is Hell on Earth.</FONT>
