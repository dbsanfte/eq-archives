While watching the "attract screens" (i.e. the screens video games display when nobody's playing 'em), I was shocked, stunned and amazed to learn that (A) Dave Hankins has entered the realm of 1-on-1 fighting; and (B) He's gotten pretty damned buff since last I saw him.  But the evidence speaks for itself:<P>
