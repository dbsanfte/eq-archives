Well....I thought I've been dead for 28 years, but it turns out I was
in Nebraska.  (Go Huskers!)  I love sports, expecially Baseball and Pro
Wrestling! (DX 4 LIFE) I live in an apartment in the basement of my folks
home, and drive them nuts.  Otherwise, your not cleared for that
information, and I'll have to kill you!
