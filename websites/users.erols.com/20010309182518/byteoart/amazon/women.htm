      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is my 
        belief that whether you are male or female does not matter as long as 
        both genders respect each other. This does not mean one should not be 
        proud of one's differences.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Equality 
        is a delicate topic. I cannot bring myself to hold with the idea that 
        women are superior, that the only way to gain equality is to dominate. 
        Likewise, I do not see men as superior, and would hate to feel dominated 
        by that gender.</font></p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only 
        true way to prevent ignorance is through knowledge. The only way to know 
        what rights you have as a woman is to learn them.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I feel very 
        strongly that a woman's body is her own to choose what to do with, however, 
        I would always choose closer to my heart...and for life. I cannot force 
        another to follow in my belief, nor would I wish to.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I burn with 
        anger every time I hear of a woman being beaten by her spouse, and strive 
        to encourage them to learn that they do not have to put up with it. No 
        woman deserves to be hit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In my goal 
        to educate, I have gathered these links to give you knowledge, open your 
        eyes, and let you form your own beliefs.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Although 
        &quot;Amazonian Sisters&quot; is a group of female characters played by 
        both the male and the female, and is a fantasy group, I feel the knowledge 
        important enough to give you access to it.</font></p>
