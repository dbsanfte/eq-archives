        Ye've found yerself at th' Roamin' Genasi tavern.  Although we'll take jink from any sod willin' t'spend it, we <I>do</I> tend t'draw a lot o' bashers what have been tetched by th' Inner Planes.  O' course, part o' that might be because I'm plane-tetched m'self.  Rastus Darkglass, formerly o' th' Para-Elemental Plane o' Smoke, at yer service.<P>

        Eh?  What's that ye say?  Ye've never heard o' Genasi a'fore?  Ye Gods, cutter, ye must be new t' th' planes.  No offense, friend, but if'n I was ye, I'd be keepin' quiet about th' things I knew an' th' things I didn't.  Sigil ain't always nice to clueless sods steppin' outta their first portal, an' if'n th' wrong folks hear ye rattlin' yer bone-box about not knowin' what a Genasi is, why, they might take it inta their heads that yer a clueless ripe fer th' peelin'.<P>

        Not ol' Rastus, though.  Friend o' th' Clueless, that's me.  So let me learn ye about Genasi.  Which would ye like t' hear about first?<P>
