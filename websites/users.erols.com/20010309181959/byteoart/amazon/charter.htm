        were founded to provide a Sisterhood where neither good nor evil matters. 
        It is a Sisterhood where a Drow necromancer can have tea with a High Elf 
        paladin. It's a Sisterhood where we gather to laugh, smile, adventure, 
        and comfort each other.</b></font></p>
      <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 
        are no limits on race, religion, or class. At this time we are accepting 
        applications.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Our goals 
        are to provide a solid arm when strength is needed and a soft touch where 
        the gentle stroke of elegence is desired. We know that as women, we are 
        uniquely qualified, as we are superior.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When 
        all is said and done, we want to make the world smile...and provide a 
        few fashion tips along the way.</font></b></p>
      <p><b><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On a 
        note: This is a serious guild with a serious goal: To be anything BUT 
        serious. Where what we say may have truth, we do this in fun, in a tongue-in-cheek 
        manner. Where our characters strut around knowing the superiority of women, 
        the players may be men or women, and we know that both genders are equal. 
        The guild is made for fun only, and if you have a sense of humor, and 
        can shove your tongue deeply into your cheek...this is the guild for your 
        girl.</font></b></p>
