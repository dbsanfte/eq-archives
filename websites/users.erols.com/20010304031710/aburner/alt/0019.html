As a recovering conservative, I have to point out that there often exists an agenda by conservatives in power that really is sexist, even if there a great number of conservatives who do not share this agenda.<P>

What I suppose I mean is: There is the conservative party line, which I used to passionately believe in, and there are the hidden power politics of rich, white, greedy old men that swirl around and behind them. I realized this when Dan Quayle was criticizing Murphy Brown for glorifiying Single Motherhood as being bad for children. Dan Quayle might as well have been directly insulting my mother, a single mom. Conservatives, like Quayle, employ a exclusionary, divisive rhetoric that terrifies me. I am deeply, deeply suspicious of any conservative dialog conserning a woman's right to choose. I suspect that there are ultimately issues of power here, and who gets it. It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that I am unwilling to concede even one drop of a woman's right to choose to politians.<P>
