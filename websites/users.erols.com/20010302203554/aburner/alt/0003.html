I can appreciate your argument against abortion for the
detrimental effects on society as opposed to the fetus
itself. However, I disagree that our obligation to non-adult
individuals (in this case, the fetus) can be so casually
defined as what "matters" to that non-adult individual. Do
we allow our children to eat chocolate cake for dinner?
Do we allow them to ride bicycles without helmets or play
tag in the street?<P>

We allow adults (or should) to decide appropriate individual
courses of action, but deny our children the freedom to make
those decisions for the simple reason that a child's
potential to make informed, adult judgments has not been
fully realized. Selectively failing to honor what "matters"
to a child is often the mark of a responsible adult. If that
weren't true, the word "No" wouldn't be the most-used word
in our house (my son is two).<P>

And do we have the right to end the life of a suicidal
individual, even though doing so may not "matter" to that
individual?<P>

Although a blob of human cells may not consciously object
to the cessation of its life, every individual -- born or
unborn, healthy or ill, retarded or sane -- has the right
to develop to his or her full potential. The "right" to
interrupt human growth should not exist at any arbitrary
point on the human development continuum.<P>

These points are made, of course, assuming its death doesn't
matter to the referred-to blob of human cells. But what if it
does matter to an *older* fetus (which are also routinely
aborted)? While largely uneducated as to its cognitive
abilities, I remain unconvinced that losing its life would
not matter. Having carried a child, I find it hard to
believe that although simple gestures such as poking or
stroking my stomach elicited kicks and squirms and
retaliatory pokes, the attempt to end its life would
elicit no response at all. Survival is an instinct that
even the fetus seems to possess.<P>

Anyway, AB, I'm just passionate about your web site!
It's one of my new favorites. You might check out Atheists
for Life -- I don't have the URL on me, but can find it if
you'd like. Also, PLAGAL [Pro-Life Alliance of Gays &
Lesbians --I think is the name--] would make a great Alt
Con link.<P>

All my best, Stephanie Herman<P>
