I think his point was that whether you believe in God or
not isn't something that happens at a philosophical level.
You just do or don't, and he doesn't.  It isn't a matter
of objecting philosophically.<P>

I have a friend who's the least defensive atheist I ever
met. He'll cheerfully admit that the arguments both for
and against God's existence are inconclusive. (In most
cases, he feels both sets of arguments are nonsense, and
I agree with him.)  He just, quite simply, doesn't get
it where a supreme being is concerned.  He compared it to
trying to describe color to someone who was colorblind,
or light to a blind man.  (I am not giving his name because
some of his fellow atheists would tear him a new orifice
for saying things like this.) ;&gt;<P>

Me -- I'm a believer and always have been, despite having
been raised by two agnostics.  It took quite a few years
to figure out that what I'd always felt and sensed had a
name -- God -- but it's always been there.  And trying to
convince me otherwise would work about as well as trying
to convince me there is no such thing as green, or as
the sun.<P>

That doesn't prove anything, of course.  It's always possible
that I'm delusional, for example.  (Or that we're all 
delusional, or....)  But, in my case, believing in God is
the simplest and cleanest explanation of what I perceive and
live with.<P>

Interesting article, Afterburner.
