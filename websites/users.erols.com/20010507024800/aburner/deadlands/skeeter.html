<B>Description:</B>  Found only in swamps, marshes, bayous, or
humid woodlands, this big brother of the regular mosquito is a
routine hazard to folks in the Deep South.  It looks mostly like
a regular mosquito, except that it's about the size of a large
dog.  Additionally, folks have reported that it has an "evil"
cast to its features, although no one has been able to describe
what, exactly, makes it look evil.<P>

It's preferred attack method is to lurk in the trees until something
(or someone) passes by.  It then swoops down, latches onto the
back of its unfortunate victim, inserts its proboscis into the
victim's neck, and begins to feed.<P>

Dislodging one of these nasties usually requires the help of a
friend.  But if you're all by your lonesome, you gotta have
something long (sabre, rifle, etc) to whack it with.  Knocking
it off your back requires an Onerous (9) <I>Deftness</I> roll.<P>


<B>Special Abilities:</B><BR>
      <B>Blood Drain:</B> On a 
successful <I>Fightin': Brawlin'</I> roll, the Skeeter latches
onto its hapless victim and begins to drain blood at the rate of
2d4 Wind per round.  As this Wind is due to lost blood, the
victim dies when its wind reaches 0.  Furthermore, the lost
Wind is regained at the rate of 2 per day (unless aided by
magic).<BR><P>
      <B>Weakness:</B> The Skeeter
is especially vulnerable to fire, taking 3d12 damage from a
torch-sized flame.<P>
      <B>Erratic Flyin'</B> Due
to the way the Skeeter flies, a Skeeter <I>dodges</I> automatically
each turn it's in the air and not actually attacking something.
