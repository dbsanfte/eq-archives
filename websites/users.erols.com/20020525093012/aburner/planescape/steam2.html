&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Inner Planes has collected a variety of nicknames over the millenia.  The Plane of Air is known as <i>The Boundless Blue</i>, the Plane of Earth is known as <i>The Anvil</i>, and so on.  For some reason, the misty expanses of the Plane of Steam tend to make folks think of mystery and secrecy and long-lost darks.  As such, the most common nickname for the Plane of Steam is simply <i>The Hidden</i>.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steam Genasi, or Lanterns of the Mists as they call themselves, seem to embody this "hidden" quality.  Like their Magma, Salt, and Dust Genasi cousins, Steam Genasi are ardent, enthusiastic explorers of the Multiverse.  But Steam Genasi specialize in (and excel at) investigating the unknown.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some Steam Genasi, this means unearthing lost darks and forbidden knowledge.  This could be anything from uncovering the reasons why Nemausus has gone missing from Arcadia, to discovering the pattern of a shifting portal in the Hive, to capturing the murderer of the late Colonel Halvart.  But for most Steam Genasi -- the overwhelming majority, in fact -- it means taking the first portal out of Sigil and striking off for parts unknown.  Steam Genasi have a burning curiosity about those areas of the Planes about which there is little (if any) information.  Find a spot on the Planes that no one knows anything about and you can bet that a Steam Genasi will find some way to get there <I>and</I> return alive to tell the tale.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given all this exploration of the unknown, it's no wonder why experienced planars tend to be respectful of Steam Genasi.  For one thing, a lot of the knowledge collected about the lesser-traveled regions on the Planes comes directly as a consequence of the Lanterns of the Mists.  For another, anybody who wanders into unknown areas of the Planes and lives to tell about it is not someone you'd want to cross.  After all, it's one thing to visit Jangling Hiter after consulting with sages and planewalkers to find out the preparations you need to come back from the visit with all of your skin still attached.  It's another thing entirely to just gad about the lesser-traveled portions of the layer of Minauros without any prior knowledge of the dangers that lurk there.  Most would call such exploring barmy, but experienced Steam Genasi can do it and return six weeks later to toss the chant about it over a cup of mead and a game of dice.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance-wise, Steam Genasi are the most human-looking of all the plane-touched.  The only hints that give away their true nature are things like perpetually wet hair or an odor of fog about them.  Occasionally one will have perpetually wet skin, but this is rare.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough (and with only a very few exceptions), Steam Genasi avoid some of the more popular fashion trends favored by many Planars (especially Sigillians).  In particular, Steam Genasi do not pierce their bodies (female Steam Genasi may be occasionally seen with one piercing per earlobe, but even this is rare), nor do they affect the tattoos or body painting prevalent among other Planar races.  The reason why the Steam Genasi, as a whole, seem to avoid these things is a mystery itself.  (Along these lines, I pointed out this mystery to a Steam Genasi of my acquaintance.  The Steam Genasi in question is now assembling a team to investigate.  A trip to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Steam is anticipated, and interested individuals are invited to inquire at the Rotting Treant tavern, off of Bloodmarsh Way, in the Lower Ward.)<P>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Constitution, +2 Dexterity, -2 Wisdom: Steam Genasi have a well-deserved reputation for being tough to kill, but you have to be slightly barmy in the first place to do the kind of exploring they do.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Steam Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Water-based spells and effects. This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.
<LI>Outsider: Steam Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Planewalkers: Due to their propensity for planewalking, Steam Genasi get the Knowledge (Planes) skill as a class-based skill.
