A pro-life atheist?  Surely not!<P>

Well, it's not entirely true.  I'm not pro-life.  I'm anti-abortion.  I say this because "pro-life" implies certain assumptions regarding "life," chiefly that there exists a transcendant, immortal "soul" which springs into existence at conception.  As an atheist, I don't believe in the supernatural, and thus I don't believe in an immortal soul.  We're born.  We live.  We die.  Game, set and match.<P>

Since there is no soul, there is a finite length of time during the development of a fetus during which thefetus really <I>is</I> the proverbial "blob of cells."  And during this time, I am forced to accept the "quality of life" argument put forth by those on the pro-abortion -- i.e. "does it really matter to the fetus if it is aborted?"  The absence of a soul compels me to say "During this finite period of time, it doesn't really matter to the fetus."<P>

At this point, let me digress briefly to provide some background on my former views concerning abortion.  I became pro-abortion at roughly the same time I started having sex.  You see, I had no desire to have the presence of progeny spoil my sex life.  Like most of society today, I wanted the freedom to copulate as often as I wanted, but I didn't want to deal with the responsibility that copulation might entail.  (I suspect that it is this self-interest which motivates most males who support the pro-abortion cause.)<P>

For several years, I considered myself "pro-choice" and argued strongly against the "pro-life" crowd.  I thought I had heard all the arguments.  Whenever I debated the subject, I always informed my opponent that "it would take a new argument, or an old argument presented in a totally new way" for me to change my mind.  And one day, I recieved just such an argument.  Which brings me back to the "quality of life" argument I mention above.<P>

If the fetus doesn't know (or care) if it is aborted before a certain time, what is there to gripe about?  Why should I oppose abortion if I believe the fetus is unaware of itself before a certain time?<P>

The answer lies in the detrimental psychological effects to society at large.  In my opinion, the detrimental effects to society stem not from the fetus's perception of the situation, but of society's perception of the situation.<P>

Consider:  An average member of the pro-choice crowd is walking along with his young son.  They see a pregnant woman.  The son asks the father "Why is that woman so fat?" (or something similar).  Now, unless the father is a complete radical, he will tell the child "She has a baby in her tummy" (or something similar).
<P>

The point being that society at large -- even those on the pro-choice side -- recognize the inherent specialness of a child, and that specialness is transferred onto the fetus as well.  This is why abortions were illegal for so long.<P>

For the past 20 years, however, we have been slowly eroding the specialness of the fetus.  And as a consequence, we have been eroding the specialness of life in general.  While I don't think this is the sole cause of our social problems, I can't help but think that it's one of several primary causes.  Thus my opposition to widespread abortion on demand.<P>
