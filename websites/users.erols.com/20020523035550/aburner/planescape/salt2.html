&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Para- and Quasi-Genasi that prefers living outside of their native plane has a natural curiosity about the rest of the Multiverse.  In Salt Genasi this curiosity has flowered into a passion for exploring matched only by their Magma, Dust, and Steam Genasi cousins.  And like their cousins, Salt Genasi have focused on the single-minded exploration of one particular facet of the Multiverse.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Magma Genasi often focus on exploring the naturalistic side of the Multiverse (writing treatises on the life cycle of the Ethyk, for instance, or studying the ecology of Jangling Hiter), Salt Genasi tend to concentrate on exploring the waterways of the planes.  Oceans, lakes, rivers, seas, and even swamps and marshes; any reasonably sized body of water is enough to make the average Salt Genasi feel an urge to map its boundaries, explore its expanse, and experience life to the fullest while sailing its surface.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough, of all the planar races, none are as enamored of the Prime Material Plane as are the Wanderers of the Brine.  This stems from the fact that oceans on the planes usually cover entire layers (Ossa, Thalasia), they're usually fairly homogeneous ("One stretch of Ossa is pretty much the same as any other," is a common saying among Salt Genasi), and smaller bodies of water are infrequent in comparison to the amount of land.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prime worlds, on the other hand, often have more water than land.  Moreover, the oceans of one prime world are usually vastly different from those of other prime worlds, and in many cases there are vast differences within the same ocean.  And for those more interested in rivers, lakes, and other somewhat smaller bodies of water, you really just can't beat the Prime for variety.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if that weren't enough (and you'd certainly think it would be), many Salt Genasi have discovered Spelljamming and have taken to it with the same enthusiasm that they have for exploring oceans on the Prime.  In their minds, it's just another type of ocean to explore.  And since Spelljamming allows them to go from Prime world to Prime world without needing portals or gates, many Salt Genasi end up on the Prime and never return to the Planes.  Because of all this hopping about on the Prime, Salt Genasi who spend most of their time on the Prime call themselves <B>Primewalkers</B>, an obvious reference to the more common <B>Planewalker</B>, and a not-so-subtle hint to their fellow Planars that the Prime is also a plane worthy of respect, just like the Abyss or Bytopia.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't to say that you won't find Salt Genasi exploring planar waterways.  In one particularly interesting case, a Wanderer of the Brine named Hobart Frimax has modified a Spelljamming ship to make it submersible, and is exploring Thalasia beneath the waves.  In another instance, a Salt Genasi named Mitel Cannate is busy exploring the layer of Belerin (and staying one step ahead of both the Asuras and the Hydra), on the Plane of Elysium.  And Salt Genasi who are more interested in profit than in exploration routinely set up shop as ferrymen on the River Oceanus.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salt Genasi usually have a slight crusting of salt on their skin and in their hair, and there's usually an odor of brine about them.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Wisdom, -2 Dexterity: Salt Genasi are extremely open-minded, as reflected by the fact that, unlike most Planars, they don't view the Prime as a waste of time.  Unfortunately, they also tend to be prone to clumsiness.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Salt Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Water-based spells and effects.  This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.
<LI>Outsider: Salt Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Sea legs (Ex): Salt Genasi get the Profession (Seafaring) skill as a class skill.
<LI>Dehydration Immunity (Ex): Salt Genasi are immune to any effect that would drain their body of moisture.
<LI><i>Destroy Water</i> (Sp): Salt Genasi have the ability to cast <I>Destroy Water</I> once per day as though they were a 5th level Druid.  This is the reverse of the Druid spell <i>Create Water</i>.

<LI>Automatic Languages: Common, Aquan.  Bonus Languages: Any (except secret languages such as Druidic).
