Congress Adds 'All Your Base Are Belong To Us' Amendment To Bankruptcy 
Bill

WASHINGTON, DC-- Seeking to increase fiscal accountability among 
citizens who have no chance to survive make their time, the House of 
Representatives added an "All Your Base Are Belong To Us" amendment 
Monday to H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer 
Protection Act of 2001. "What you say!!!" shouted the bill's sponsor, 
Rep. George Gekas (R-PA), following the amendment's approval. "This 
bill will not only make debt-ridden Americans more accountable, but it 
has the added benefit of taking off every 'zig' for great justice." 
Opponents of the amendment protested that it would potentially set up 
U.S. the bomb.

the first mask, and it was Captain Kirk! And I'd take off the second 
mask -- and it was Captain Kirk!"

40,000 miles an hour, scattering white-hot debris for miles in every 
direction. The hole measures nearly a mile across and is 570 feet 
deep."

<mikewd> Amusingly, M$ Exchange uses some form of X400 for it's 
internal communications 
<Helioz> you have a weird concept of "amuse"

%

I remember when being a pervert was a bad thing. 

If you were warped, you tried to hide it, and good for you if you 
did.  If you were going to polish your rod to autopsy photos or bugger 
a Shetland pony, you did it in the privacy of your own sick, sad home.  
No one else, especially not me, had to know, and that was great.  The 
best part was, if you decided to crawl out on the roof and inform the 
neighborhood via midnight megaphone that being urinated on got you 
hot, you would be told, in no uncertain terms, how very diseased you 
were.  Most people I know don't have too much trouble distinguishing 
between a "lifestyle choice" and a "warning sign."  Yep, in many parts 
of the world, the idea of making love to Andy Panda is still regarded 
as somewhat misguided.  Most parts, that is, except "Furry Fandom."

...

"Live and Let Live" is an excellent, tree-hugging philosophy, but it 
doesn't do much when the ones you refuse to kill are dragging you 
down with them.

...

Getting your rocks off on lower orders of the animal kingdom is bad 
enough without your partner being licensed by Disney.  Yes indeedy, as 
we descend just a step deeper into Hell, we stumble across the path of 
the Plushophile.  That's shorthand for "I find this Meeko doll 
intensely erotic."  These are the people who use FAO Schwarz as a 
singles bar.  I don't know who decided that this was a valid excuse 
for a sex life, but he probably still lives in his mother's basement.  
You don't have to earn a degree in psychology to figure out how thickly 
laden with sexual dysfunction the very concept of Plushophilia is.  
How badly was your id stomped on to get you to the point where you 
would consider wanking with a child's toy?  I'm not sure I want to 
know.  But I *DO* know Plushophiles have latched onto Furriness like a 
swamp leech.  When people call furries "perverts," THIS is the kind of 
crap they're talking about. 

...

Don't misunderstand me; Werewolves are fun.  Role-playing a werewolf?  
Knock yourself out.  Drawing werewolves?  E-mail me some pointers, I 
can't do 'em to save my life.  Claiming to BE a werewolf?  SEEK HELP.  
You're not a werewolf.  THERE ARE NO WEREWOLVES.  Anyone who claims 
to turn into a giant dog at the whim of a celestial body should be 
mercilessly ostracized and laughed at with maximum cruelty.  

...

And YES, there's even a special breed of nutboys out there who insist 
a major component of Furriness is the practicing of Veganism.  For 
those of you who don't live in California, that's the total shunning 
of all animal products. No eggs, no leather, no beef, no fish, no 
clubbing baby seals until their skulls are soft and dough-like.  
For reasons beyond my comprehension, THIS sort of self-denial is 
supposed to put you "more in touch with your furriness."  God knows 
how.  I've never seen a pride of lions abandon a mule carcass to 
chase down a fleeing herd of Garden Burgers.  Animals have a strange 
way of mutilating OTHER animals.  That's nature, welcome to it.  And 
there's nothing more furry and natural than gnawing some flesh, kids.  
Human beings are omnivorous, and that means meat.  If you don't 
believe me, fetch yourself a mirror and smile.  See those pointy 
things?  Canines.  So enough with the tofu and bean sprouts, your 
Spirit Animals are laughing at you.

In other news, I imbibed a bit of hot sauce that was obviously pure 
HCL.  I think my brane melted and ran down the back of my throat.  I 
think my stomach acids are now recoiling in fear and paying homage to 
a higher intelligence.  When I hiccup, I have to aim away from bare 
skin.  I would rather tongue-kiss a drunken penguin with herring 
breath, eat scab and chocolate chip cookies, see Bea Arthur naked, 
and pour molten glass in my navel than defecate within the next 24 
hours.  If we could just pour one glass of this on each spammer, we'd 
win for sure.  They'd shrivel and die.  Horribly.  Like a spider
