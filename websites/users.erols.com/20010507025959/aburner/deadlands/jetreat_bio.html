<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
You mean, that I can talk about in mixed company?  Um, cats are nice.<BR>
Oh, dang.<BR>
Also, getting AB to reprimand me for being too funny.  I mean, off-topic.<BR>
Also, and this is uncoincidentally related, being the biggest smart-ass I can be.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Revlon genetic makeup. Not enough cats. Flunked out of MK-ULTRA only to be taken in by a sympathetic group of militant squirrels, trained to assassinate "stingy no-tails", and eventually released upon the world to create the havoc I so fondly refer to as "Joey Joe Joe".
