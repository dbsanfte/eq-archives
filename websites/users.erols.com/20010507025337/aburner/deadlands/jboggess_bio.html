<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back in my freshman year of high school I saw an add in
ANALOG for some game called OGRE.  Other boardgames followed until a buddy
of mine came back from his first year of college with three little books
called Dungeons & Dragons.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Right now Deadlands(surprise!), AD&D, Paranoia.  Also have
recently been working on some playtesting for Battletech (I wanted to call
the protomechs "cockroaches" but they wouldn't listen).<P>

I measure my past by the stack of games next to my desk - Avalon
Hill(lots), SPI(a few), V&V, Champions, Traveller, HOL, Battletech, Car
Wars, an assortment of miscellaneous stuff, and a pile of unpainted minatures.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Most time that isn't spent at work goes to my family.  I
have two fantastic little guys with whom I try to spend as much time with
possible, and a Loving(tm) wife who would like to have some time to go out
with her friends, too. <P>

Throwing money at PEG seems to have become a separate hobby.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Many years ago I had an episode of SCA, but the therapy has done
wonders.  My sense of humor is a little off-center, so if you don't
understand what I meant to say it was probably a joke.
