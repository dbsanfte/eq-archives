              was born</b> into a very large Wood Elf family. We lived peacefully 
              in the shadows of the towering trees of Greater Faydark. I lived 
              a simple life with my brothers and sisters. We relied on the blessing 
              of our great mother, Tunare. She blessed us with abundant food, 
              and the power of Druid. </font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I 
              remember many nights</b> gathered around the ancient stone circle, 
              listening to elder Druids tell fantastic stories. They spoke of 
              far off lands, great heroes, and honorable quests. I longed to one 
              day explore Tunare's great creation, and become a hero myself. As 
              soon as I was able I joined the local guild, the soldiers of Tunare, 
              and set about defending my homeland, and learning my craft. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Once 
              I reached my second circle of power</b>, the call of the wild was 
              just too much for me to resist. I said my good byes, and embarked 
              on my first journey. I ran though the Butcher Block Mountains, and 
              found a boat headed for Freeport. I had never crossed the Ocean 
              of tears before. I was so excited that I could hardly wait for the 
              boat. The trip was long and agonizing, I was sick many times, but 
              after an eternity it was over. I exited the boat as fast as I could. 
              I found myself in a strange land. So many people, dirt, houses, 
              bums, odd smells, and guards that looked at me apprehensively. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>This 
              was not what I had expected at all!</b> Everything was so bizarre, 
              no flowers, no animals, no smiles, and no beautiful trees. There 
              were a few shriveled up dead trees, how awful! I ran from that city 
              as fast as I could. Soon I was in the desert of Ro. Out of the pan 
              and into the fire. Freeport was bad, but the desert was unbearable. 
              It was a desolate land with nothing but sand and horrible creatures. 
              </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I 
              prayed to Tunare for help</b>, and a kind jackal came to my aid. 
              He led me to a fishing village, where I met the most amazing people. 
              Barbarians, they were so huge and strong! I had never seen such 
              a thing before. A nice fisherman, that looked like a towering oak, 
              explained to me which way I needed to go. I thanked him and went 
              on my way. I found my way to the commons.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Finally 
              a nice place</b>: Trees! Bears! Wolves! I continued through Kithicor 
              forest and finally to Rivervale. It was here that I would make my 
              new home. I lived with the kind Tagglefoot family, and helped them 
              with their farm. They continued my druid training, and taught me 
              the ways of Karana. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Due 
              to my previous training</b> in the soldiers of Tunare, I decided 
              to join the Rivervale Wall Squad, and defended the city from goblins, 
              and orcs. I stayed here until the fourth circle. I felt very powerful 
              now, and had to journey on to test my new strength. I decided to 
              go explore the Karanas. The Karanas were the most wonderful place 
              that I had ever been. It was so full of life and wide open. I ran 
              and ran with the spirit of the wolf inside me. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>I 
              protected and defended travelers</b> from the many giant bugs, griffawns, 
              and those vile lions. I have been all over Norrath now, and met 
              many peoples: From the home of those awesome Barbarians in the north, 
              to the hideous Trolls in the south, the sinister Kerrans in the 
              east, to the cute little Gnomes in the west. I am blessed that I 
              now travel with the Amazonian sisters. I look forward to the many 
              adventures in the future.</font></p>
