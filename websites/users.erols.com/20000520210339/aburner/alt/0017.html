On the subject of abortion, I would like to ask those who believe in a fetus having a soul whaen they believe that ensoulment occurs. Since twinning (or greater multiples) is possible up to the 14th day after conception, what happens to the soul if ensoulment occurs at the moment of conception, and twinning occurs? Does the soul split in two, or another soul come into existance, does one twin get the soul and the other not have one, do they get half a soul each? 
I personally do not believe that ensoulment takes place until the fetus is born and takes the first breath of life. I would be interested in what others think of this theological matter. I am not a Christian, by the way, I'm just curious as to what others, Christians as well as fellow nonbelievers think of this question
