<B>Cost:</B> 1-5
<P>
<B>Description:</B> Some folks just have a hard time keepin'
their mind on what they're doing.
<P>

There's something your character finds extremely distracting, 
to the point that your character will drop what she's doing
and watch (or participate in) whatever it is distracting her.
<P>

In game terms, your character must make a Fair (5) <I>Spirit</I>
roll, subtracting the cost of the hinderance from the roll.  A
gal with a <I>Distraction (-1)</I> would subtract one from the
roll, while someone with a <I>Distraction (-5)</I> would
subtract five from the roll.
<P>

Success means that your character was able to stay focused
despite the distraction.  Failure means that your character
stops whatever it was he was doing beforehand and focuses on
his particular distraction.  Additionally, once the character
is distracted, he remains distracted until (A) he passes a
Fair (5) <I>Spirit</I> roll with the appropriate penalty;
(B) someone makes a successful <I>persuasion</I> roll against
your character; or (C) the distraction goes away.
<P>

Some possible distractions include purty women, games of 
chance, or losing a particular hat.
<P>

<B>Example:</B> J.P. MacGillicudy, the noted Riverboat gambler,
has a <I>distraction (-2)</I> when it comes to games of chance.
He's chasing a thug through the back alleys of Albuquerque
when he stumbles across a group of men having an impromptu
craps game behind the local saloon.  A successful <I>Spirit</I>
roll with a -2 penalty means that J.P. continues after the
thug without even breakin' stride.  A failed roll means he
notices the dice game and cain't help but stop a bit to roll
the bones. 
<P>

<B>'Nother Example:</B>  Pete Hutter (from the TV show <I>Brisco
County, Jr.</I>) has a <I>Distraction (-5)</I> when it comes to
his gun.  If he loses his gun (or if someone takes his gun),
he must pass a <I>Spirit</I> roll (with a -5 penalty) before
he can do anything.  A failed roll indicates that Hutter will
obsessively search for the gun or just sit despondently and
mutter "I've lost my piece" under his breath.
<P>

<B>Notes:</B>  Once the character gets a success, he is no
longer distracted by that particular incident for 24 hours.
(e.g. Once MacGillicudy gets a success, he can pass by that
particular crap game again and not be distracted.)
<P>

The Marshal should adjust the penalties in favor of the 
character (if not negating the hinderance altogether) under
particularly stressful situations.  If MacGillicudy is being
shot at as he runs down the alley past the crap game, his
self-preservation will probably kick in before he gets too
distracted.
