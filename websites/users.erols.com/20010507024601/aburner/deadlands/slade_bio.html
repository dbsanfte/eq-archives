Basic D&D in 80/81, Top Secret & Gamma World soon thereafter. Lots of gaming through high school, then with two circles of friends met through a job at a bookstore.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Through the years, almost every RPG in existance. Currently, Deadlands and Earthdawn. Also a splash of AD&D, Werewolf, and Warhammer FRP. Some Feng Shui as well, a game that died before its time.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Earthdawn, AD&D, Deadlands, and Warhammer in role-playing. Play an on-and-off Champions game as well. Feng Shui too.<P>

Can always be talked into a game of Axis & Allies, Uno, Civilization, or a hand or two of Magic: The Gathering.
