<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Played AD&D in high school.  Stopped.  Hang around with people that played ccgs a few years later. Stopped that.  Started playing Earthdawn.  Got hooked and am now marshalling Deadlands.  Also, I have collected comics, so I have always hung around game stores.
