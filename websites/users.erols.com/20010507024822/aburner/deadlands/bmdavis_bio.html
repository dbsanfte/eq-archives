My stepfather introduced AD&D to me when I was 8 years old, and I loved it. I just really started playing however, because of my lack of a group.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Deadlands and Shadowrun!!  No game even comes close to Deadlands(Yet, HOE might make it), but I do play Shadowrun online to pass the time.  Besides, I have to be the one to annoy the GM sometimes!

I specialize in making Shadowrun characters! Munchkins in paticular, if you want one made just email me! My crowning glory is the sammy with a starting initiative of 3d6+27. Also, if you would like to hop into my Deadlands(and hopefully HOE) campaign, just email me!
