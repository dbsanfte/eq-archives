Congress Adds 'All Your Base Are Belong To Us' Amendment To Bankruptcy 
Bill

WASHINGTON, DC-- Seeking to increase fiscal accountability among 
citizens who have no chance to survive make their time, the House of 
Representatives added an "All Your Base Are Belong To Us" amendment 
Monday to H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer 
Protection Act of 2001. "What you say!!!" shouted the bill's sponsor, 
Rep. George Gekas (R-PA), following the amendment's approval. "This 
bill will not only make debt-ridden Americans more accountable, but it 
has the added benefit of taking off every 'zig' for great justice." 
Opponents of the amendment protested that it would potentially set up 
U.S. the bomb.

the first mask, and it was Captain Kirk! And I'd take off the second 
mask -- and it was Captain Kirk!"

<AB> Whether or not a peep in RollerCoaster Tycoon will ride a ride 
is determined by the peep's Preferred Intensity, which can be either 
"Less than 4," "4 to 11," "Less than 11," or "Less than 15".
<AB> Each peep also has a Nausea Tolerance.
<AB> Which is independent of their preferred intensity.
<AB> So you get peeps with a preferred intensity of 4-11, but with a 
Nausea Tolerance of "None."

landmarks over the PA system.  "Coming up on the right, you can see

Arizona.  It was formed when a lump of nickel and iron, roughly 150 
feet in diameter and weighing 300,000 tons, struck the earth at about 
40,000 miles an hour, scattering white-hot debris for miles in every 
direction. The hole measures nearly a mile across and is 570 feet 
deep."

written for any platform. They can be written to use a variety of 
e-mail clients.  In this case the virus author chose to target 
Outlook probably because it gave him better reach.  There isn't a

"If you were warped, you tried to hide it, and good for you if you 
did.  If you were going to polish your rod to autopsy photos or bugger 
a Shetland pony, you did it in the privacy of your own sick, sad home.  
No one else, especially not me, had to know, and that was great.  The 
best part was, if you decided to crawl out on the roof and inform the 
neighborhood via midnight megaphone that being urinated on got you 
hot, you would be told, in no uncertain terms, how very diseased you 
were.  Most people I know don't have too much trouble distinguishing 
between a 'lifestyle choice' and a 'warning sign.'  Yep, in many parts 
of the world, the idea of making love to Andy Panda is still regarded 
as somewhat misguided.  Most parts, that is, except 'Furry Fandom.'"

"Getting your rocks off on lower orders of the animal kingdom is bad 
enough without your partner being licensed by Disney.  Yes indeedy, as 
we descend just a step deeper into Hell, we stumble across the path of 
the Plushophile.  That's shorthand for 'I find this Meeko doll 
intensely erotic.'  These are the people who use FAO Schwarz as a 
singles bar.  I don't know who decided that this was a valid excuse 
for a sex life, but he probably still lives in his mother's basement.  
You don't have to earn a degree in psychology to figure out how thickly 
laden with sexual dysfunction the very concept of Plushophilia is.  
How badly was your id stomped on to get you to the point where you 
would consider wanking with a child's toy?  I'm not sure I want to 
know.  But I *DO* know Plushophiles have latched onto Furriness like a

Knock yourself out.  Drawing werewolves?  E-mail me some pointers, I

You're not a werewolf.  THERE ARE NO WEREWOLVES.  Anyone who claims 
to turn into a giant dog at the whim of a celestial body should be 
mercilessly ostracized and laughed at with maximum cruelty."

...

"And YES, there's even a special breed of nutboys out there who insist 
a major component of Furriness is the practicing of Veganism.  For 
those of you who don't live in California, that's the total shunning 
of all animal products. No eggs, no leather, no beef, no fish, no 
clubbing baby seals until their skulls are soft and dough-like.  
For reasons beyond my comprehension, THIS sort of self-denial is 
supposed to put you 'more in touch with your furriness.'  God knows 
how.  I've never seen a pride of lions abandon a mule carcass to 
chase down a fleeing herd of Garden Burgers.  Animals have a strange 
way of mutilating OTHER animals.  That's nature, welcome to it.  And 
there's nothing more furry and natural than gnawing some flesh, kids.  
Human beings are omnivorous, and that means meat.  If you don't 
believe me, fetch yourself a mirror and smile.  See those pointy 
things?  Canines.  So enough with the tofu and bean sprouts, your 
Spirit Animals are laughing at you."

"In a genre full of such Academy Award contenders as Chuck Norris and 
Steven Seagal, acting comes second to roundhouse kicking.  But Van 
Damme is clearly determined to change that.  To probe the soul of his 
character (laconic drifter capable of kicking people), he has grown 
his hair long, curled it and packed it with gel.  He has also adopted 
an earring and let his stubble grow.  De Niro dreams of commitment 
like this."

"Fans of ER star Alex Kingston are taking her role as a doctor a bit 
too literally - they keep asking her for medical advice.  The British 
actress, who plays Dr. Corday on the hit TV series, says she does get 
fans who have problems differentiating between her onscreen character 
and her as an actress.  She says, 'You do get some of the public who 
take the show too literally.  I've had a fan writing to me, giving me 
all their symptoms and listing what the doctor had prescribed for them 
and asking me if I thought the doctor was correct in his diagnosis.'  
But the star says she's so far managed to restrain herself from doling 
out any medical advice to her viewers.  'I haven't written back,' she 
admits."
