<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As with most gamers, I cut my teeth on D&D. I started with a bunch of one-on-one sessions, with a friend, then a few group sessions. I then get out of gaming for eight years or so, picking it back up late in high school. I didn't get my renewed interest in roleplaying until my last two years of college.
