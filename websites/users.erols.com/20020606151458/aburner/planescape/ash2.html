&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many respects, Scions of the Dying Embers are the opposite of their Smoke Genasi counterparts.  Whereas Smoke Genasi prefer the closed-in hustle and bustle of a well-populated city, Ash Genasi have little use for large cities and even less use for crowds.  Residents of the Plane of Ash have a very solitary outlook on life, even more so than the residents of the other Inner Planes, and this outlook manifests itself in the Ash Genasi's natural dislike of cities and crowds.  This isn't to say that Ash Genasi are anti-social or that they don't like the trappings of civilization; they just prefer a less hectic existence free of large <I>concentrations</I> of civilization.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When an Ash Genasi first leaves the Plane of Ash, they normally find themselves square in the middle of Sigil.  Given their solitary natures, and given that Sigil is one of the largest, most crowded cities in the Multiverse, most Ash Genasi quickly decide that they've seen enough of the planes for one lifetime and head back to the Plane of Ash.  Consequently, Scions of the Dying Embers are rarely found outside their native plane.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But occasionally an Ash Genasi will be sufficiently curious about the Multiverse to stick around.  And even more rarely, an Ash Genasi will find a portal or vortex that leads to someplace <I>besides</I> Sigil.  Regardless of how it happens, these rare Ash Genasi avoid turning tail and heading back to the Plane of Ash, and they head out into the vast Multiverse looking for the secluded areas they enjoy.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, Ash Genasi who leave their plane take a liking to a particular area and settle down to live out a simple, comfortable existence.  In other cases, they become Planewalkers, going from plane-to-plane experiencing a variety of rustic towns, isolated villages, and remote wilderness regions.  Note that a sweltering, unpopulated tropical jungle on a prime world, a relatively clear and difficult-to-reach plateu in Gehenna, and the gatetown of Faunel would all be equally attractive to the average Ash Genasi.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ash Genasi who become rangers or druids have no way to study the necessary wilderness skills while on the Plane of Ash.  So all Ash Genasi rangers and druids must learn these skills after leaving the Plane of Ash.  This means that Ash Genasi rangers and druids will be, on average, several years older than non-ranger, non-druid Ash Genasi of similar experience level.  To reflect this, determine their starting age normally and then add 5d4 years.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ash Genasi usually have dark grey skin, and their hair will be dark grey with flecks of white.  Most Ash Genasi leave an ashy residue on anything they touch, and they usually smell like burnt wood.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma: Ash Genasi are generally introspective.  They're also not particularly social.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Ash Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Fire- and Cold-based spells and effects.  This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.
<LI>Outsider: Ash Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Cold Immunity (Ex): Despite being related to the Plane of Fire, the Plane of Ash is bone-numbingly cold.  As a consequence, Ash Genasi are completely immune to non-magical cold.  Magical cold damages them as normal.
<LI><i>Extinguish Flames</i> (Sp): Ash Genasi have the ability to <I>Extinguish Flames</I> once per day.  Upon use of the ability, the Ash Genasi can, for the next two minutes, extinguish any non-magical flames within a 5' x 5' square as a standard action.  Burning materials that are extinguished in this manner instantly become cool to the touch, as though they'd stopped burning days before.
<LI>Clerical Focus: An Ash Genasi cleric must follow a deity of fire, nature, or solitude.
<LI>Automatic Languages: Common, Ignan.  Bonus Languages: Any (except secret languages such as Druidic).
<LI>Favored Class: Ranger or Druid.  In the event that the Ash Genasi follows the path of a Ranger/Druid multiclass character, only the highest of the two classes counts as his or her favored class.
<LI>Level Adjustment +1: Ash Genasi are slightly more powerful and gain levels more slowly than most of the other common races.
