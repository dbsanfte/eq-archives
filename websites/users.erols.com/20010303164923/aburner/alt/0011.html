Whenever I link to someone on my <A HREF="links.html">links</A> page, I always send them a notification.
Along with the notification, I request that they take a look at my site and link back to it if they find it
worthwhile.  Thus far, only one person has refused to link to my page, and in fact this individual requested
that I remove my link to his page because he didn't want his link to be on the same page as that "gay stuff."
Aside from that, however, the response has been warm.  I have recieved a number of compliments
on this site, and most folks provide a reciprocal link.<P>

But there seems to be a trend developing:  A lot of the folks who link to my page describe me (or my page,
which is ultimately the same thing) as a "pro-religion atheist."  And while I don't mind the label (it does
encapsulate much of my worldview), many people may be wondering "what, exactly, does 'pro-religion
atheist' mean?"<P>

Before expounding on this any further, I think a disclaimer would be useful.  So here 'tis:  In the following
discussion, I shall provide some exposition on my atheistic views.  Since I don't believe in a Supreme Author
of the Cosmos, my view is that religion is a man-made thing, and my remarks will reflect that.  And while
I do not, in any way, apologize for my atheistic views, I am nonetheless cognizant of how atheists are
perceived (aforementioned perception being largely justified, thanks to my disgruntled fellow atheists).  More 
specifically, I  am cognizant of how Christians think atheists percieve them.  Therefore, allow me to clear 
the air from the outset:  <B>No vitriol is present in the following discussion.  No disrespect is implied, nor 
should it be  inferred.</B>  If you read the following text and find yourself thinking "Gosh, this guy doesn't 
like us Christians very much," you've misread something. Start afresh, preferably from the beginning, and 
re-read.<P>

Now that we've gotten that out of the way, an appropriate place to start would be with a little background
info on Yours Truly.  My views on religion are shaped largely from an intimate familiarity with Christianity.
My grandfather was a preacher for the Assemblies of God church for over 50 years, my brother is just
now starting out in the Assemblies of God ministry, and in general my family (especially my mother's
side of the tree) is (and has always been) extremely devout and God-fearing (as distinguished from being
extremely "religious," a term that may carry some negative connotations with some folks).<P>

The first 7 years of my life were spent being raised in a church-going, God-fearing home, and even after my 
parents divorced and my mom did a little backsliding, I was still exposed to Christianity.  I attended a
Christian summer camp every year from 7 until 14, and attended church weekly until I was about 11 or so.
From the age of 11 until the age of 17, my parents divorced again and both fell completely away from the
church.  However, even during this time, I still found myself infrequently exposed to Christianity 
via my grandparents and my mother's siblings and associated in-laws.  Then, near my 18th birthday (and 
coinciding with my parents both getting remarried), my parents returned to the fold, where they have 
remained ever since.  (Also coincidentally, I admitted my atheism shortly after my 18th birthday.)<P>

I have also kept up with religion in general in other ways, chiefly through discourse with those who profess
a particular belief.  I'm moderately informed about the tenets of Catholicism, I'm very familiar with the
"fundamentalist" branch of Protestantism (chiefly the Assemblies of God denomination, the Southern
Baptist denomination, and the United Pentecostal Church), and I know a smidgen or two about the rest of
the major world religions and about the other Christian denominations.<P>

Moreover, my experiences with Christianity (and with religion in general) have been overwhelmingly positive.
Whenever I discuss Christianity with my fellow atheists, they invariably invoke the word "hypocrite" to
describe Christians.  In their eyes, all Christians are mealy-mouthed and two-faced, saying "Hosanna" in
one breath and then participating in sinful behavior the next.  While I readily admit that I've met my share of
folks like this (Marvin Gorman being the most famous one I've personally met), it has been my experience
that these true hypocrites are far and away outnumbered by those folks who -- like my family -- practice what
they preach.  My grandfather is a righteous, humble man.  He talks the talk <B><I>and</I></B> he walks
the walk.  Most Christians I've met in the "fundamentalist" branch of Protestantism are cut from the same
cloth as my grandfather.  (This is not to say that other Christians in other branches of Protestantism are <I>not</I>
cut from that cloth, but simply that I haven't met enough of them to qualify the issue further.)<P>

And finally, I have seen epiphanies accomplish changes in someone's personality and/or habits that, in all
likelihood, could not have been accomplished in any other way.  It is an undeniable (and documented) fact 
that a religious conversion can help defeat addictions and overcome other personality problems.<P>

The point of all this scintillating, ego-centered prose is that my views on religion don't stem from ignorance.
In fact, it is precisely because of my experiences with Christianity that I hold them in high regard.  Many of
my fellow atheists look at Christianity and see only the negatives; the "don't do this, don't do that" portion.
Thanks to my upbringing, I have seen the "true" nature of Christianity, and I find it to be generally agreeable.<P>

"That's all fine and good," you say.  "But how does that play into being a 'pro-religion' atheist?"<P>

Simple.  I'm an atheist.  I don't believe in God, nor in the divinity of Jesus Christ.  (Nor in Brahma or Allah or
Yahweh or Bob or whoever else, just to provide equal time.)  But I do believe that a belief in religion can
accomplish nifty things on a personal level, and I do believe that Christianity (in particular) is largely a 
positive, pro-civilization religion.  To paraphrase Will Durant, there has never been a society in the history
of the Earth that has flourished without religion.  Humans are a metaphysical species.  We cannot, as
a group, abide with the fence-straddling of strict agnosticism.  We fall to one side or the other.  To seek to
remove religion completely from society (or even to marginalize it) is, therefore, most manifestly a Bad Idea.
To put it another way, our current Christian society has given me the freedom to be an atheist.  I doubt very
seriously that an atheistic society would give me the freedom to be a Christian.<P>
