Balles's Law is a simple, yet profound, observation.  Paul Balles (pronounced to rhyme with "Dallas") is a
professor of Literature at the University of Bahrain.  The Law itself originated during an on-going discussion
on the Debate conference of WildNet (a hobby network similar to FidoNet).

While surfing the web, I have run across a number of conservative and quasi-conservative sites which claim
all manner of conspiracy theories, usually revolving around Bill and Hillary Clinton and their part in the 
"Master Plan" to subjugate the masses.  Occam's Razor, however, posits that the simplest explanation
is almost always the correct one.  And while I agree that there are elitists out there who think that only
<I>they</I> know the path to enlightenment (hell, I used to be one myself), the simplest explanation is that
there is no conspiracy among these folks.  Just as there is no "conspiracy" among Conservatives to lower
the tax rates, promote capitalism and entrepreneurship, etc.
