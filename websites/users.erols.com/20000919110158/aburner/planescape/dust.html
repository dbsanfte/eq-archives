        In the minds of most cutters, the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust conjures up images of decay, decomposition, and disintegration.  The Plane is inimical to both life and to created items, and both will quickly turn to dust without the proper magical protection.  Amid all this waste and desolation are the Loreseekers of the Eroding Sands -- the Dust Genasi.<P>

        Dust Genasi are fascinated by the history of things:  Buildings, magical weapons, famous (or infamous) bloods, regions, towns, you name it.  Most sages and scholars claim this is due to the fact that Dust Genasi are raised on a plane where they routinely see the ultimate embrace which awaits all things, and have therefore developed a curiosity about the life <I>before</I> the decay.  On the other hand, some claim that it's the symbolism of accumulated dust (or sands through an hourglass) representing the passage of time.  And a few berks say it's because researching the history of dead people and ruined towns is the only thing that matches the dry, somber personality possessed by most Dust Genasi.  (Note that this last is woefully inaccurate.  While Dust Genasi are indeed more subdued than most other Planar races, only their Magma Genasi cousins match their enthusiasm for research.)<P>

        Whatever the reason, most Dust Genasi explore the planes in much the same manner as their Magma Genasi cousins.  Some Loreseekers of the Eroding Sands focus their research on one particular location, person, or item, and spend the rest of their lives unearthing its history.  Other Dust Genasi prefer to dabble, rather than delve.  These are the Planewalking Loreseekers, and they accumulate a broad base of knowledge by travelling around the Multiverse.  And finally, some Dust Genasi exist somewhere between the two, wandering the planes for the most part, but occasionally settling down for a year or more to more thoroughly investigate a particular item, region or person.<P>

        All Dust Genasi feature a colored pattern to their skin reminiscent of sand.  Additionally, they will have one or more of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>A thin, perpetual coating of sand on their bodies and/or in their hair
<LI>A dusty haze surrounding them, extending about 1 foot out from their body
<LI>The faint howling of a sandstorm in their voice
<LI>A somewhat flimsy consistency to their body, as though their flesh was filled with sand instead of bones and muscle
</UL>

        Dust Genasi receive a +1 bonus to both Dexterity and Constitution, and receive a -1 penalty to their Strength and Charisma.  They are completely unaffected by the disintegrating nature of their native plane, and they have a 50% magic resistance to <I>Disintegrate</I> spells (or any other spells which attack via disintegration-like effects), in addition to whatever saving throws may be applicable.  Additionally, they gain a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. Earth-based magic every 5 levels.  Finally, Dust Genasi have the ability to <I>Shatter Rock</I> once per day.  This is identical to the 2nd-level Wizard spell <I>Shatter</I>, except that it works only by touch, and it affects only rock or stone.  Dust Genasi can use this ability on up to 20 cubic feet of rock or stone.<P>

        Dust Genasi can be fighters, mages, Earth Elementalists, Diviners, or bards.  They also have the option of being a fighter/mage or fighter/Diviner multiclassed character.  Dust Genasi can be of any non-Chaotic alignment.<P>
