<B><font size=-1>Note: This is not an automated guestbook.  Although there are several free guestbooks available for someone
crafting a homepage, these tend to be somewhat erratic.  (A friend and fellow conservative had the contents
of his guestbook wiped out recently by some glitch.  And my girlfriend's guestbook just flat disappeared.)
To avoid this, I will simply be processing the guestbook entries manually.  Thus, there may be a delay of a
day or so between the time you sign the guestbook and the time it appears here.<BR></font></B>

Nice site . . . I'm goofing off at work, and wound up here!<P>

You've got a lot of good stuff here, and you present it
very well indeed (ie, well written and logically presented).<P>

Thanks for helping me avoid doing anything useful :)<P>

Cool page.  I agree with most, but not quite all, of the
politics, and the rest is at least reasonable and well
presented.  I like the way it's mostly text (as is mine),
and well-written text at that, as opposed to many pages so
loaded down with graphics that they take forever to load.
Nicely organized into logical chunks.  Too bad I don't have
time to take part in the message forum.... <P>

And of course, as Bailiff of Erol's, thanks for all the
spammers' peepees you have whacked and will whack.  (I just
wonder how many people REMEMBER that sketch....)</UL>

Wow!  I thought I was the only one! I was born and raised
a FAR left wing liberal.  At the age of 23 I joined the Navy as a nuclear technician, and experienced the blessings of socialism first hand.  All of my material needs where seen to, and all I had to give up was all of my rights and freedoms.  What a deal!  When I was working 100 hour workweeks for less than minimum wage, with a higher level of actual education than the majority of the officers, I was still told that living accomidations that are considered unacceptable for a convicted felon where good enough for me!  During this time I began to resent those who considered the interests of those who had destroyed their lives thru their
freely chosen actions a greater priority than someone who was 
serving their country!  After my eyes where opened I began
to see the irrationality of ALL of the beliefs I had been
indoctrinated to believe in.  I am so glad to realise that I
am not an isolated phenomenon.  Keep up the good work!
We shall overcome!

I stumbled across CIF by way of Minnesota College Republicans while looking for a suitable Republican elephant for my web site.
I figured that I should check some of the links to get a feel for the type of sites here before I applied.<P>
I saw "Alternative Conservative" and thought that it looked promising  not another conservative atheist, that's two in one week.<P>
Even though my site is hardly finished, it does have my student newspaper editorials on a variety of conservative topics which of course went over really well!<P>
I'll bookmark your site so I can come back later to give it more attention.<P>

AB: If you have a chance, look at the "flag" the liberals <BR>
would like to make our national banner. Let me know what you <BR>
think. Take a look at my guestbook for some of the suggested <BR>
changes to this image. <P>

Hello Alternative Conservative!<BR>
Just wanted to let you know that the link to your page is active<BR>
now. Many thanks for the link to my page.<BR>
The really neat thing about conservatism is that we come in a<BR>
wide variety of categories, but we can agree on how our<BR>
government ought to function.  And we agree that Bill Clinton<BR>
is not the answer. Reminds me of a bumper sticker I saw:<BR>
"If Bill Clinton is the answer, it must be a real stupid question"<BR>
Best regards
