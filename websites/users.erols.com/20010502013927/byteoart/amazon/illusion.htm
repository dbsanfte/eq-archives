      art of illusion is a highly technical subject, which would take many years 
      of research for anyone other than a High Elf enchantress to fully understand 
      all of its aspects so I will paraphrase it.&nbsp; Illusion is the ability 
      to take the shape of people or inanimate objects from your environment.&nbsp; 
      There are several reasons why one would want to change into something else 
      or someone else.&nbsp; The corrupt guards of Qeynos hate most if not all 
      non-human races.&nbsp; If I walk into town as my beautiful self, they scorn 
      me and mock my very existence.&nbsp; If though I change into one of their 
      favorite ladies of the night, they admire me.&nbsp; Some even go as far 
      as liking me.&nbsp; Also, when was the last time you visited Oggok as a 
      Huuuman, as the horrid, non-intelligent Ogres call that average group of 
      underlings from Freeport and Qeynos?&nbsp; To summarize, the main reason 
      for illusions is to become the ordinary and not the extraordinary, like 
      me.&nbsp; I have to change races for I am easily picked out of a crowd wherever 
      I go.</font></td>

<p><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'><font size="-1">The second reason for the wondrous art of 
  illusion is the ability to morph into a common object of the environment.&nbsp; 
  Among the craft keepers this aspect is called a minor illusion.&nbsp; This illusion 
  is used to hide.&nbsp;&nbsp; If someone is chasing you and you are not a fast 
  runner, it is nice to be able to run into an inn and morph into the shape of 
  a bed. Even if the attacker knew what you were, nine times out of ten he is 
  going to leave you alone because he would look awful silly cursing and destroying 
  a bed, which supposedly belongs to someone else.&nbsp; The innkeeper would most 
  likely have him thrown in prison for that. Actually, the innkeeper, who most 
  likely is an ex-soldier, would probably kill the attacker without drawing a 
  sweat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, how many of you spell casters wish the dirty animals 
  of the forest or wondering orcs would leave you in peace when you are trying 
  to refill your mana supply?&nbsp; Enchanters just need to cast minor illusion.&nbsp; 
  Most of the time this works.&nbsp; However, I have met some foolish Highmen 
  enchanters who talked to their party as a minor illusion.&nbsp; Even the dumb 
  goblins are not ignorant enough to believe you are a lamppost then.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Dang, men!&nbsp; If you are not smart enough to figure this out then you ought 
  to train in Felwithe with the ladies where we know better!&nbsp; I am sorry 
  if that just offended some of the lower life forms but it is the truth.&nbsp; 
  Sometimes even the truth hurts.</font></span></p>
<p><font size="-1"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Now the primary reason for illusion, flirting.&nbsp; Yes 
  you read correctly. The High Elf women have for years been able to get any man 
  to do what they want just by morphing into whatever that particular man finds 
  attractive.&nbsp; The hardheaded, hard-hitting barbarians from the tundra would 
  not find a Gnome too appealing.&nbsp; Nor would an Erudite find an, and excuse 
  my Troll, inki very attractive.&nbsp; If you want what they have you have to 
  persuade them that you are giving them what they want.&nbsp; So far, for you 
  novice enchanters, I have seen more men persuaded by a scantly clad barbarian 
  lass.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, if you are looking for a fun time or if you want a gift, 
  I would recommend that race.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>One last note, some other races use the skill for playing 
  tricks.&nbsp; High Elves would never stoop the to level of using years of dedication 
  for fun and teasing but I hear the Gnomes love to.&nbsp; There are many books 
  in their libraries on this subject so I recommend you look there for information.&nbsp; 
  I will say what I have observed other less mature enchanters doing for the purpose 
  of this guide though.&nbsp; I have seen enchanters lead a person into town to 
  a certain location and loose their trailer.&nbsp; Why or how you might ask.&nbsp; 
  Here is what I saw and scorned him for doing.&nbsp; He would run around a corner 
  and morph into a race so far from his previous race that the trailer would run 
  right by without noticing.&nbsp; This is utterly shameful and I refuse to go 
  into detail.&nbsp; It will be Christmas in the plane of hate before you catch 
  one as noble as I doing that disgraceful stunt.</span></font></p>
<p><font size="-1"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Verdana'>Enough comment on that twist to the exalted art of illusion.&nbsp; 
  I wish all enchanters well in their research and studies.&nbsp; May someday 
  you excel to the stature of the High Elves.&nbsp; Tunare bless you and good 
  journeys.</span></font></p>
