<B>Description:</B>  Your character must've eaten all her veggies as a kid.  Whatever the reason, she never seems to stay down long.  Treat all her wounds as if they were one level lower <I>for the purposes of healing only</I>.  For example, if her highest wound level is a critical wound, treat it as a serious wound for all healing attempts (be they her own attempts at natural healing, or be they attempts by 3rd parties to use a healing hex, a blessed miracle, or what-have-you).<P>

	This edge is <I>not</I> cumulative with the Thick-Skinned edge.  And no, you can't use this edge to try and heal maimed noggins or guts.<P>
