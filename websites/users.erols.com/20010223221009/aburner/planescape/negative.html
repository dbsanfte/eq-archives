        Of all the Genasi (Para-, Quasi-, or otherwise), none are regarded with more suspicion and fear than the Negative Energy Genasi -- known among Planars as Negatai, and among themselves as Sceptres of Unlife.<P>

        Like all Para- and Quasi-Genasi, Negatai are quite curious about the Multiverse.  However, Negatai grow up on a plane formed from the very stuff of anti-life, and populated by hordes of free-willed undead.  This has an effect on the Negatai outlook as one might expect, and their curiosity is shaped appropriately.<P>

        When they leave their native plane, they discover life -- and death -- in abundance.  For Negatai, Life is a foreign concept, in much the same way that Chaos is a foreign concept to Modrons.  But Negatai understand death perfectly.  And this is part of the reason why they're so feared on the Planes.<P>

        Y'see, a small percentage of Negatai hit the Planes and just can't seem to deal with being surrounded by vibrant, incessant life.  So, in order to recreate some of the "comforts of home," they begin killing folks.  Some don't even bother to be subtle about it, publicly mowing down innocent civilians until put in the dead-book by the Hardheads or the Red Death.  Others are a bit craftier, and can carry on a campaign of grisly killings for years before being caught (or finding a way back to the Negative Energy Plane).  Thankfully, this doesn't happen too often.  But when it does, it tends to stick in a sod's mind, and all Negatai have suffered by  being associated with their infamous, bloodthirsty brethren.<P>

        By far, the overwhelming majority of Negatai loose on the Multiverse are <I>not</I> going around putting sods in the dead-book just so the Negatai can be reminded of their native plane.  But most of 'em are fascinated (some berks say "comforted") by death and the dead.  Again, this is because they have an innate and natural understanding of death, but not of life.  Regardless, this fascination manifests itself in various ways.  A lot of Negatai -- especially the fighters -- roam the Planes learning the various death rituals of different cultures.  They do this so that they may give the appropriate "last rites" to foes they've slain in combat.  Others become Necromancers, learning the hidden magical Darks of life (and death).  Still others become priests of Death-related Powers.<P>

        Interestingly enough, and contrary to what a lot of berks would assume, Negatai aren't any more (or less) likely to join the Dustmen than any other sod.  Sure, the Negatai understand death, but that doesn't automatically mean they think everyone is already dead (which is the central belief of the Dustmen).  Still, when a Negatai does join the Dustmen, he usually rises pretty quickly through the ranks.<P>

        All Negatai have jet-black skin.  Their skin is so dark, in fact, that it seems to absorb light.  It's also very cold to the touch.  No other distinguishing features have been recorded.<P>

        The nature of their plane imbues them with a certain amount of power, and so Negatai receive a +1 bonus to their Strength.  It also makes them more susceptible to death, reflected in a -1 penalty to their Constitution.  Being natives of the Negative Energy Plane, the very nature of a Negatai is suffused with the essence of Unlife, and this confers the following benefits and hindrances:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Negatai are completely immune to level drain.
<LI>They have a 50% chance of being completely ignored by any Undead powered by the Negative Energy Plane (which excludes Mummies, but includes just about every other type of undead).  If this roll is successful, the undead creature will not attack the Negatai unless the Negatai attacks first.
<LI>Similarly, they can turn Mummies (or other Positive Energy undead) as a Cleric of the same experience level.  Mummies that resist being turned will try to concentrate their attack on the Negatai.
<LI>Positive Energy creatures (including Mummies and Positive Energy Genasi) cause an additional 1d4+1 damage to Negatai when striking a Negatai barehanded.
<LI>Negatai heal at half the rate of other bashers.  It requires 2 days of rest to heal 1 hit point, and 2 days of complete bed rest to heal 3 hit points.  This also applies to being treated by those with the healing or herbalism proficiency.  Furthermore, magical healing is only half as effective (round fractions down) on Negatai.  (Magical healing will always heal at least one hit point, however.)
<LI>Negatai have an innate <I>Chill Touch</I> ability, which can be used once per day.  This ability is identical to the 1st-level Wizard spell of the same name.
<LI>Every 5 levels, Negatai gain a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. Necromantic magic.
<LI>As a consequence of their poor reputation, Negatai suffer a -4 penalty to their reaction rolls when dealing with NPCs.
</UL>

        Negatai can be fighters, mages, Necromancers, clerics, specialty priests, or thieves.  They can also be fighter/Necromancers or Necromancer/thieves.  Negatai specialty priests must follow a Power of Death.  And contrary to what many bashers might suspect, Negatai can be of any alignment.  Death isn't necessarily evil, berk.  It just <I>is</I>.<P>
