Where into this do you place the morality of killing a 
helpless human?  I do agree with you that for a period of 
time, the baby is just a mass of cells.  And during that time
the baby has no way of knowing what is happening.  But there
does come a time when that unborn child *does* recognize what
is happening.  I don't know if you ever saw the video protraying
the "silent scream" - an unborn baby being aborted... all caught
on film for postarity.. and to be used as a scare tactic by
the more fanatical.  That video does, however, prove that this
fetus is a human with senses.  Is it therefore, morally acceptable
to abort the fetus before it reaches awareness?<P>

Not being too religious myself, I still have a hard time
fitting morality into the issue of abortion.  I do believe 
that women should have the choice (meaning that the government
should not be permitted to make this blanket moral decision
for America)  that abortion should *not* be used as 
birthcontrol  and that abortion is morally wrong.<P>

One could argue: "What about an autistic woman who is 
raped and becomes pregnant?"  The moral thing
to do?  I don't know.  But I do know that killing is wrong.  
Whether the human killed is in the womb or 42 years old.  Were I
ever required to make that decision, I would begin on those 
personal convictions and make that decision for that situation.<P>
 
On a tangent, it seems that society in general sees much 
more horror in the murder of a young child (toddler, 
elementary school age) than an abortion.  I pose this 
question: If it is immoral for a mother to kill her 5 year 
old child, why is morally debateable for her to kill her 
unborn child?<P>
