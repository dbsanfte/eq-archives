&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Slow, but burning with intense energy" is the description often used to describe the Explorers of the Lava.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like their close cousins the Earth Gensai, Magma Genasi tend to be ponderous and deliberate in their outward motions.  However, this slow, monolithic movement disguises a fiercely active and intelligent mind.  As a consequence, the curiosity typical of all Para- and Quasi-Genasi manifests in Magma Genasi as a desire to explore, investigate, and truly understand the Multiverse in a scientific way.  Lawfully inclined Magma Genasi are usually drawn towards the Guvners, but no matter which Faction they belong to, Magma Genasi are usually one of their Faction's most profound philosophers due to their constant inquiry into the nature of the Multiverse.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a less political note, Magma Genasi almost always become active planewalkers.  Hopping from plane to plane and exploring the vast variety of the Multiverse is certainly one way to learn more about it, after all.  Other Magma Genasi have gone on to become noted naturalists and researchers, such as Braus Horfand, who wrote the seminal work on the ecology of the Lower Planes.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appearance-wise, Magma Genasi tend to be thick and bulky, but more rounded than their Earth Genasi counterparts.  Their skin is warm (even hot) to the touch, and is usually black or dark brown, and laced with streaks of red or bright orange.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Intelligence, +2 Strength, -2 Charisma, -2 Dexterity: Like most genasi related to the element of Earth, Magma Genasi are big, strong, and slow.  Additionally, they are extremely inquisitive about the Multiverse, reflected in their higher intelligence.  Unfortunately, they also tend to be single-minded about their scientific inquiries and often have trouble relating to people who don't share their passion for their particular subject.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Magma Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Earth- and Fire-based spells and effects.  This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.  
<LI>Outsider: Magma Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Natural Science (Ex): Magma Genasi get the Knowledge (Geography) and Knowledge (Nature) skills as class skills.  
<LI>Lava Immunity (Ex): Magma Genasi are completely immune to the effects of non-magical lava, and can also "breathe" while completely immersed in lava.
<LI>Lava Sight (Ex): Magma Genasi can "see" through lava up to a distance of 60 feet.
<LI>Fire Immunity (Ex): Magma Genasi are completely immune to the effects of non-magical fire.  Magical fire damages them as normal.
<LI><i>Heat Rock</i> (Sp): Magma Genasi have the ability to cast <I>Heat Rock</I> once per day as though they were a 5th level Cleric.  Aside from the fact that it affects rock instead of metal, <I>Heat Rock</I> is identical to the 2nd-Level Druid spell <i>Heat Metal</i>.
<LI>Clerical Focus: A Magma Genasi cleric must follow a deity of earth, fire, science, or knowledge.
<LI>Automatic Languages: Common, Terran, Ignan.  Bonus Languages: Any (except secret languages such as Druidic).
<LI>Favored Class: Wizard
<LI>Level Adjustment +1: Magma Genasi are slightly more powerful and gain levels more slowly than most of the other common races.
