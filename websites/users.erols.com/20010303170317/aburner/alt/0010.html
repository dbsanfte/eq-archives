In my view, there are two levels to the abortion debate.  There is a large-scale "macro" view and a
small-scale "micro" view.  The "macro" view concerns itself with the effects abortion has on society as a
whole.  The "micro" view is the more personal view, focusing on the effect abortion has on the individuals
in question, particularly the fetus/baby in question.<P>

On the macro level, I agree with your assertion that "it doesn't matter what matters to the fetus."  Whether
we believe that the fetus is blessed with an immortal soul that would largely unappreciate being aborted, or
whether we believe that it is utterly inconsequential to the fetus one way or the other, the large-scale detrimental
effects still occur.<P>

On the micro level, however, I fear I must disagree.  As well, I disagree with your assertion that there is only
one "unequivocal point at which to define life's inception."  (After all, here I am equivocating...)  Is it life at
conception?  Unquestionably, in that it is not a rock or a cloud of vapor.  Is it human life at conception?
Without doubt, in that the DNA is human rather than that of a wolverine or a cactus.<P>

Is it meaningful life at conception?<P>

This is the question at hand, I think, and I suspect that the lion's share of the abortion debate springs from
this question.  (If nothing else, it has fostered this exchange.)  I confess to siding with the pro-abortionists
on this question on the micro level.  Before a certain point, it <I>is</I> just a "blob of cells," and it is utterly
inconsequential to the embryo/fetus as to whether or not it gets aborted.  Moreover, although we can
speculate endlessly on what kind of individual the fetus would have become, such an exercise is just that:  
speculation.  The fetus might have been the next Einstein.  Or he might have been the next Jeffrey Dahmer.
<P>

You have made the analogy that, since we don't let our two-year olds make their own decisions (else they'd
"eat ice cream cones and play video games all day"), what "matters" to the fetus is irrelevant to the argument
at hand.  But this puts an animus into the fetus that I don't believe exists.  It's not a case where (like your
two-year old) we make decisions which run counter to what the fetus wants.  Instead, it's a case where the
fetus is metaphysically incapable of making a decision, or of formulating a thought, or even of being aware of
its surroundings.<P>

As mentioned, this is why I don't usually label myself "pro-life," instead preferring to label myself "anti-abortion."<P>

However, let's not lose sight of the crucial distinction between myself and those in the pro-abortion crowd:
I believe that widespread abortion promotes irresponsibility and erodes the "specialness" of human life.  There
are instances in which I agree that abortion is the preferable choice of two or more poor alternatives.  There
is never an instance in which I agree that abortion is a "good" choice.<P>
