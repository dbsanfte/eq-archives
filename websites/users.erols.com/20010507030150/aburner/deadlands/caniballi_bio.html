<BLOCKQUOTE>
A friend got me hooked into AD&D back in middle school, from there, Battletech and Call of Cthuhlu weren't far behind. It was like an addiction, soon I was selling my blood so I could afford new books, scrounged money for  weeks just to go to cons to spend time with the un-bathed, Yes, it happened to me, I had a problem......So many games, So little time.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I have a Rampaging love for Hong Kong cinema, It's actors, directors, and it's differences from American filmaking. Any money left over after buying gaming books usually ends up feeding my movie collection, 45 movies so far.
