<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I think I started playing D&D when I was in fifth grade wiht my next door neighbor and his friends, and haven't stopped playing rpgs since.  Although, I haven't played D&D in many, many years.  Other than that, I suppose my interests grew along with the particular guy I was dating, as I learned to play what ever he played.  Now I am my own woman, and I play whatever I want....

Currently, I play Cthulhu, Deadlands, the hero system, rail wars, battletech, Warhammer40K, and a few games our company designed.  I own the old D&D books, StarFleet Battles, about 3 different editions of Warhammer40K, Kult, Chill, GURPS, Car Wars, Star Wars, tons of CCGs, the Hero system, earthdawn, dark conspiracy, immortal, and the list goes on...

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I love to cook, and I am remodeling my house, and working on my garden (which is no small feat in Phoenix!).  I also am trying to teach my three cats a few performance tricks, but that isn't going so well...  I also just like to hang out with my friends and do nothing...
