        Silent, stealthy, and comfortable in shadows, Smoke Genasi are the most urban of all the Para- and Quasi-Genasi.  This isn't because the Para-Elemental Plane of Smoke is populated with cities, but rather because once a Smoke Genasi leaves the Plane of Smoke, they discover that they're uncomfortable in wide open spaces where a berk can see for miles and miles on a clear day.  This isn't to say that a Smoke Genasi can't function out in the open; they just don't like it (a Smoke Genasi on a mountain top is a miserable berk indeed).  Cities (and the bigger, the better) provide Shadows of the Vapors with a measure of psychological security due to the closed-in nature of most cities.  And if the city has a lot of smoke and/or smog, so much the better.  Small wonder, then, that Sigil has the greatest concentration of Smoke Genasi outside of the Plane of Smoke itself.<P>

        Para- and Quasi-Genasi are notoriously curious about the Multiverse (or aspects thereof), and Shadows of the Vapors are no exception.  However, their curiosity takes the same urban direction that they themselves take; Smoke Genasi are dedicated and enthusiastic city dwellers.  This doesn't mean they're always happy and cheerful about their lot in life.  They've got the same problems as regular berks, after all.  But Smoke Genasi are fascinated by city life like no other race in the Multiverse.  They can gaze for hours at the endless ebb and flow of traffic on a city street, watching the intricate patterns of life play themselves out on the cobblestones.  Indeed, many Smoke Genasi become merchants or innkeepers precisely so they can more fully experience the life of the city.  And the rare Smoke Genasi planewalker travels from city to city on the planes in an effort to compare, contrast, and explore the different urban settings of the  Multiverse.<P>

        Smoke Genasi always have a faint odor of smoke about them, and this odor can often indicate their mood.  The pleasant odor of smoked cedar, for instance, may indicate that the Smoke Genasi is in a generous mood, while a sharp and acrimoniously smoky odor might indicate anger or jealousy.  Additionally, Smoke Genasi will have one or more of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Dark gray hair that moves of its own accord like smoke coming off a fire
<LI>Mottled gray skin which seems to change coloring and pattern from moment to moment
<LI>A choking, coughing tone to their speech
</UL>

        Smoke Genasi receive a +1 bonus to Dexterity and Intelligence, and a -1 penalty to Strength and Constitution.  They're immune to the effects of normal flame, but take normal damage from magical flames.  However, they receive a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. magical fire every 5 experience levels.  They can also breathe smoke without penalty and suffer only half-damage from magical clouds (like <I>Stinking Cloud</I>).  Note that this only applies to those magical clouds which require inhalation before the detrimental effects occur.  Spells like <I>Cloudkill</I> work by contact, not inhalation, and thus Smoke Genasi aren't any more resistant to these spells than anybody else.  Finally, Smoke Genasi can create a <I>Wall of Smoke</I> once per day.  This is identical to the Wizard spell <I>Wall of Fog</I>, except that a barrier of smoke is created.  Creatures within this barrier suffer no damage, but must spend the same number of rounds recovering (clearing their eyesight, regaining their breath, and so forth) that they spent inside the <I>Wall of Smoke</I>, unless they prepared for it (by holding their breath, perhaps, or breathing through a wet rag).<P>

        Shadows of the Vapors can be fighters, mages, thieves, fighter/thieves, or mage/thieves.  They can be of any alignment.<P>
