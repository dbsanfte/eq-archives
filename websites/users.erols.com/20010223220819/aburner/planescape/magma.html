        "Slow, but burning with intense energy" is the description often used to describe the Explorers of the Lava.<p>

        Like their close cousins the Earth Gensai, Magma Genasi tend to be ponderous and deliberate in their outward motions.  However, this slow, monolithic movement disguises a fiercely active and intelligent mind.  As a consequence, the curiosity typical of all Para- and Quasi-Genasi manifests in Magma Genasi as a desire to explore, investigate, and truly understand the Multiverse.  For many Lawfully inclined Magma Genasi, this draws them towards the Guvners.  But regardless of the Faction to which they belong, Magma Genasi are always among their Faction's most profound philosophers due to their constant inquiry and introspection into the nature of their beliefs and the Multiverse.  <P>

        On a less political note, Magma Genasi almost always become active planewalkers.  Hopping from plane to plane and exploring the vast variety of the Multiverse is certainly one way to learn more about it, after all.  Other Magma Genasi have gone on to become noted naturalists and researchers, such as Braus Horfand, who wrote the seminal work on the ecology of the Lower Planes.<P>

        Appearance-wise, Magma Genasi tend to be thick and bulky, but more rounded than their Earth Genasi counterparts.  Additionally, Magma Genasi may have one or more of the following:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Black or dark brown skin laced with streaks of red or bright orange
<LI>Skin that's warm (even hot) to the touch
<LI>A mild odor of heated rock
<LI>The faint rumbling of a volcano in their voice
</UL>

        Magma Genasi add +1 to their Intelligence because of their inquisitive natures, but lose -1 from their Charisma since they prefer researching interesting minutiae about the Multiverse instead of learning standard social graces.  Magma Genasi are completely unaffected by either normal fire or by lava, and could swim, breathe, and live in an active volcano if they felt like it (and some do just to keep away unwanted visitors).  Furthermore, Magma Genasi gain a +1 bonus per every 5 levels applied to their saving throws vs. magical fire- or lava-based attacks.  Finally, Magma Genasi can <I>Heat Rock</I> once per day as though they were a 5th-Level Priest.  Aside from the fact that it affects rock instead of metal, <I>Heat Rock</I> is identical to the 2nd-level Priest spell <I>Heat Metal</I>.<P>

        Magma Genasi can be fighters, mages, specialist mages, specialty priests, or a multiclassed fighter/mage or fighter/priest character.  Note that Magma Genasi can't be standard Clerics, since their desire to investigate and understand the Multiverse makes them gravitate towards specific dieties.  Magma Genasi who become specialist mages must specialize in either Elemental Earth or Elemental Fire.  Specialty priests must pick a Power of Fire, Earth, or Lava.<P>

        Magma Genasi can be of any alignment.<P>
