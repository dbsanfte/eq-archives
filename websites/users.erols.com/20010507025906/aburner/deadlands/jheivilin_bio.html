<BLOCKQUOTE>
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far ... <BR>
wait, no, that's something else.  <P>

Many years ago I found a copy of Avalon Hill's Afrika Korps in the school library.  That was "the beginning of the end" as they say.

Web page weirdo and techno weenie. Jim had a normal childhood, well, except for the fact that his mother sat him down with her in front of the TV to watch Classic Trek (sort of like Classic Coke). Somehow he was never quite the same. After escaping college (where he studied rocket science) he ended up in Europe looking at communists. After escaping that he somehow found his way into the industry. Narrowly missing being impaled by a packaging machine, he moved to Missouri to take up writing and computer junk. <P>
