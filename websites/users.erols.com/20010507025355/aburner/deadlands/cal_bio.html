<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was told girls weren't allowed to play, so it was inevitable that I would want to one day. I spent far too long wondering what was going on with the dice rolling and weird language, then finally got to try it. I haven't stopped since. So...sheer bloody-mindedness would be the answer.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Warhammer FRP (the first game I played properly)<BR>
AD&D (tolerated it for a short time)<BR>
Call of Cthulhu (still love it, but refuse to play anything other than Deadlands at the moment)<BR>
Shadowrun (briefly,didn't have a clue what was going on)<BR>
Rolemaster (got bored, and that was just while someone looked up one table)<BR>
Vampire (very silly, I blame Anne Rice for the spread of this sort of nonsense)<BR>
Deadlands (Wow. Can't get enough.)<BR>
<BR>
Currently play - Deadlands only, as far as role-playing goes.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Deadlands. Nothing comes close, but CoC still makes it to second place. Desperately waiting for Hell on Earth.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
No, everything is games related, even if not role-playing.  Painting armies and other figures for Warhammer, Necromunda, all the usual stuff. Doomtown and a couple of other card games. Playing computer games.  Collecting Monopoly sets from around the world (I know I'm sad, but I don't
care). Reading Katherine Kerr and Michael Moorcock, well, just about anything really. Actually I'm lying, I've just remembered I love motor racing too. Although we've got this Formula 1 board game...

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I want to hire a hitman to get Anne Rice, any donations gratefully received. I worship Ferrari, Michael Moorcock, and the music of The Fall (when I'm allowed to listen to it). I live with Jon Padgett who is also on the list, he's my Deadlands Marshal.
