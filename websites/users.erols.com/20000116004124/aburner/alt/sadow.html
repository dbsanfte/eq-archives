And there you have it:  The Sadow Principle.  Another way to view the Sadow Principle is "Disagreeing
with someone on a point of ideology is not a sufficient reason to be an asshole."
<P>
My good friend Dr. Jeff Sadow is a professor of political science at the Shreveport campus of Louisiana
State University.  Dr. Sadow is a very Conservative professor, and is often billed as one of only two
Conservative political science professors in the entire state of Louisiana.  And despite his frequently
inflammatory guest editorials for the local Shreveport paper, Dr. Sadow is a very congenial, pleasant
individual in person.
<P>
The Sadow principle originates from an incident in which Dr. Sadow, during a trip to Tempe, AZ, sat down
with an open and avowed Communist and tossed back a number of brewskis over the course of an evening.
Those of us who knew him well understood that this was nothing out of the ordinary.  But some folks 
wondered why an arch-Conservative would ever deign to share a table with a Communist.  Dr. Sadow
pointed out that the Communist in question was a very reasonable, well-spoken individual, and that they
shared many common interests (chiefly in the area of football and baseball).  To reject this gentleman
merely because he and Dr. Sadow didn't share the same political views would have deprived Dr. Sadow
of an evening of pleasant conversation.  The gentleman was a very reasonable man, and Dr. Sadow said
"As long as they're reasonable, I can drink a beer with anybody."
