<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Oh, I don't know.  It was a long time ago.  People kept
telling me that D&D was evil and satanic and all that, so I looked into
it.  Besides, those choose your own adventure books were starting to wear
thin.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Ah lets see, first of course was D&D, followed shortly by AD&D.
 Then I delved into idiocy with Batman the roleplaying game.  After thatIt
was Shadowrun, Did a little GURPS for awhile then moved hardcore into
Cyberpunk.  Flitted about mindlessly with Paranoia for awhile too.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Deadlands, obviously.  The AD&D Planescape stuff is pretty
good, but I haven't played in awhile since my DM won't get off his butt
and put a game together.  I ought to go steal his books.  STill love
Cyberpunk even though we don't play much anymore.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I read quite a bit.  I used to collect comics, but after I
put together my Cry For Dawn set and spent upwards of $500, I realized
that I really couldn't afford to keep doing it.  Heh.  Big movie buff, I
own quite a few tapes and laserdiscs, including some very difficult to
find stuff. I like Douglas Adams, Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I find
that harassing other people is fun.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm the quiet lunatic on the listserv, I suppose.  I want to make
idiotic comments, but figure Jay does enough of that for me.  I have a cat
who I believe is clinically insane and a dog, a beagle named Maverick.  I
intend to start college next year after my fiancee gets her degree to get
dgrees in Philosophy and Theology. I figure this will give me the right to
tell people to think like me.  Heh.
