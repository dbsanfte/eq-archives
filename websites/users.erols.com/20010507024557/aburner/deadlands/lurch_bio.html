<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Waaay back in the summer of '78, a buddy of mine said, "Hey, I just got this great new game called Dungeons & Dragons; wanna play?"  I was instantly hooked, and went on to become a voracious devourer of All Things Gaming.  Even during the lean times when I didn't have a gaming group, I had my nose in one rulebook or another (& I still do...)

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It seems I've owned & later discarded just about every game that ever came out at one time or another, but I've managed to distill it down to the current list (for now at least):<BR>
<BR>
1. AD&D (the eternal classic)<BR>
2. Shadowrun<BR>
3. Deadlands (eventually to include Hell on Earth & the Great Rail Wars)<BR>
4. Star Wars<BR>
5. The various White Wolf games (Vampire, Werewolf, Werewolf: Wild West & Wraith, to be exact)<BR>
6. Call of Cthulu<BR>
7. Battletech (currently my sole nod to the wargaming community)<BR>
8. Magic: The Gathering (I know, I know... :))

Same as above (the actual order of preference tends to shift according to my mood, however)

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>
<blockquote>
Are there any? (lol)  I also enjoy writing, drawing, reading, listening to music, camping/hiking, collecting pop-culture (comics, action figures, anime, and other geek stuff), and I'm a martial arts/melee combat enthusiast.

I could probably go on at great length about myself (I'm a Leo, y'know), but if you want to know anything specific about me, feel free to visit my homepage or email me!
