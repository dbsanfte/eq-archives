The smiling chap you see here on the <font color=#080880><I><B>right</B></I></font> (pun most 
definitely intended) is me, Afterburner.
<P>

Up until about 1992, I was very much an elitist.  I was convinced that 99% of the people on the
planet consisted of "herd," 1% of the planet was "non-herd" and therefore better suited to guide the
ignorant and unwashed masses into the 21st century, and I (naturally) fell into the 1% category.
<P>

Of course, at the time, I was living largely hand-to-mouth (as were my other "non-herd" friends), had little
in the way of social prospects (ditto), and not much in the way of a future (again, ditto).  In fact, my chief
qualification for being in the 1% category seemed to be that I could sit around for hours pontificating on the
sorry state of the unwashed masses without actually doing anything productive or constructive.  (As an
aside, you will find folks with this self-same attitude by the truckload on the internet.  They positively infest
cyberspace.  Ick.)
<P>

Granted, even at this time I wasn't a complete liberal -- I've always been suspect of socialist financial
schemes and I've never subscribed to political correctness.  But I was fairly close.  I was most definitely
pro-abortion, pro-Affirmative Action, and anti-gun.
<P>

And then a funny thing happened to me on the way to work one day...
<P>

I grew up.
<P>

You see, as a card-carrying elitist, I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that Rush Limbaugh was The Bane
Of All Existence.  He was racist, sexist, homophobic, and otherwise wicked, evil, mean and nasty.  Granted,
I had never actually <I>listened</I> to any Rush Limbaugh programs.  (That is, unless you asked 
me if I had ever listened to Limbaugh.  Since I knew the consequences of being caught with my ideological 
pants down, so to speak, I would always say "Of <I>course</I> I've listened to his show.  It would be a 
fine thing if I passed all these judgments about him without giving him a listen."  This was a lie.
I was simply saying it so as to avoid the embarrassing and untenable position of criticizing him without 
listening to him.)
<P>

And so it came to pass that, while ironing my clothes for work, my mother turned on the radio, and tuned
in to Rush Limbaugh.
<P>

I had to iron my clothes for work.  No way out of it.  So I suffered myself to listen to this hate-mongering,
sabre-rattling, four-flushing little so-and-so while I ironed, and steeled myself for the worst.  His first rant:  
Political correctness.
<P>

Well, I confess that at this point my ears perked up.  I have always detested political correctness, finding it
to be a hollow philosophy.  Rush waxed on eloquently about the true dangers of political correctness and
about how it inhibited the free exchange of ideas.  I agreed with him on every point, and found myself
considerably discomfited therefrom.
<P>

But surely, I thought, it was just a fluke.  Even a fool is occasionally right, I concluded, and once again
I steeled myself for the onslaught of racist ideology that would doubtless be springing from his lips at any
moment.  His next subject:  Taxation.
<P>

At this point, I was captivated.  I mentioned above that I was living largely hand-to-mouth at the time, and
as a consequence I had considerable difficulty dealing with large, unexpected bills.  And as it happened,
I had just sent off a check to the IRS for $208 dollars the week before.  So I was all ears as Limbaugh
expounded at length on taxation.
<P>

His claim was that increasing taxes actually decreased the amount of revenue brought in by the government.
The more you tax people, the less likely they are to do those things which costs them that tax.  By George,
it made sense.  Especially since my Aunt Brenda refuses to buy any article of clothing unless it's marked
down at least 50%.  (If all the stores in the world stopped marking down their clothes for sale, my Aunt
Brenda would just wear her existing clothes until dry rot set in.)
<P>

I was still highly suspicious of this Limbaugh character, but as the afternoon wore on, I found myself agreeing
again and again with the hated, venal, etc. Rush Limbaugh.  Since then I have discovered that Limbaugh is
not racist or sexist, and in one of his less guarded moments he even admitted that he thought homosexuality
was genetic and that he didn't agree with trying to exclude homosexuals from the political process.
<P>

Imagine my surprise.
<P>

Since then, I have done a great deal of reading about the conservative philosophy.  I have read Henry Hazlitt's
outstanding book <I>Economics in One Lesson</I>, the Federalist Papers (most of them, anyways), and
discovered the Laffer Curve (among many other books from a conservative viewpoint).  And while I still have 
a <a href="diff.html">few disagreements</a> with the standard Conservative platform, these differences are
(in my eyes) relatively minor.
