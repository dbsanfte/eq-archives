"There are three types of sages:  Those who do not mind admitting when
they do not know the answer to a question, and those who <I>do</I> mind.
Two types of sages."
			--Xansost the Slaad
</PRE>

        Ask a sage to describe the sort of being that would be native to the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum, and many (perhaps most) sages would mutter something about "creatures of pure thought" and then quickly change the subject.  Bring up the existence of Vacuum Genasi and ask these same sages how a "creature of pure thought" could produce a half-breed, and most will have you forcibly removed from the premises.<P>

        Despite the difficulties in explaining their existence,  there's no denying that they <I>do</I> exist.  Of course, as things in the Multiverse tend to go, lots of berks wish they didn't.  Y'see, the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum isn't a popular plane.  There's no air, no sound, damned few pockets of other Elemental matter, even fewer residents, and almost no visitors.  Oh sure, it has the occasional bit of excitement -- after all, in an infinitely large plane, something's bound to happen from time-to-time to break up the monotony.  But outside of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes, the Plane of Vacuum is the most difficult Inner Plane on which to survive (since <I>Airy Element</i> and <I>Breathe Element</I> spells don't work on vacuum, among other reasons), and so excitement happens here a bit less on average than on the other Inner Planes.  As a consequence, the Offspring of the Void are probably the least sophisticated race in the planes.  And that's putting it mildly.<P>

        Think of the most clueless, wide-eyed Prime berk you can think of, and they'll look like Tarsheva Longreach herself next to the average Vacuum Genasi.  But whereas Primes are clueless due to their arrogant assumption that their Crystal Sphere is the Center of the Multiverse, Vacuum Genasi are clueless because they have absolutely no experience with things most everyone else takes for granted.  Like razorvine.  Or tanar'ri.  Or smog.<P>

        And when you couple the natural curiosity about the Multiverse that exists in all Para- and Quasi-Genasi with the cluelessness that exists in all Vacuum Genasi, you'll find that they often act even <I>more</I> clueless than Prime berks.  Since they come from a plane that has almost nothing in it, <I><B>everything</B></I> is new and exciting to an Offspring of the Void.  So Vacuum Genasi spend a lot of time wandering the planes with an excited, awe-filled expression pasted on their faces, and this is true whether they're looking at Mount Olympus or a pile of Bebilith droppings.<P>

        Most Vacuum Genasi get over it.  Eventually.  If they live.  But it usually takes longer for them to shed their "cluelessness" than it does for even the most backward Prime.  And even experienced, powerful Vacuum Genasi still have a touch of the "wide-eyed tourist" about them.  Growing up in a nearly empty plane is not something one loses easily, after all.<P>

        Offspring of the Void all look very gaunt, sometimes to the point of seeming emaciated (although they're perfectly healthy).  Additionally, they have one or more of the following traits:<P>

<UL>
<li>an area of "dead air" extending about 1 ft. from their bodies, in which sounds seem muted, the air seems a little thin, and/or odors are non-existent
<LI>hair that's unaffected by even the strongest wind
<LI>skin that's dry and cool to the touch, and never perspires
</UL>

        Because of their gaunt frame, Vacuum Genasi suffer a -1 penalty to Strength.  But because they do not need to breathe, they've never had to suffer from air-borne illnesses.  Consequently, their Constitution is exceptionally hardy and they gain a +1 Constitution bonus.  Vacuum Genasi are completely immune to the effects of vacuum whether natural or induced by magic.  Since they don't need to breathe, they're also immune to harmful vapors which do their damage by being inhaled.  Additionally, they gain a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. air-based magic every 5 levels.  Finally, Vacuum Genasi can create <I>Silence, 15' Radius</I> with themselves in the center (like the 2nd-level Priest spell) as though they were a 5th level caster.<P>

        Vacuum Genasi can be fighters, mages, clerics, or thieves.  They can also be multiclassed fighter/mages, fighter/thieves, or mage/thieves.  They can be of any alignment.<P>
