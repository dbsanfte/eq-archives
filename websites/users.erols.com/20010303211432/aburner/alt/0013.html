Greetings, Michael, and welcome to my little corner of cyberspace.
<BR>

Quoting:<BR>
<B><I>"I had planned to answer comprehensively your comments on the Defense of Marriage Act
(DOMA), anticipating your every riposte with a preemptive parry, but I realized that such a
response would ruin the back-and-forth liveliness of our exchanges."</I><P></B>

It's just as well that you didn't, since my prose is more workman-like than it is adroit.  Think of me
as Mike Hammer to your Sherlock Holmes.  <G><P>
<BR>

Quoting:<BR>
<B><I>"With regard to (1), I concur. The issue of homosexual marriage is important, but our current
discussion should be limited to the separate question of DOMA's constitutionality."</I></B><P>

Since we're both in agreement on this point, no further remarks seem necessary.<P>
<BR>


Quoting:<BR>
<B><I>"The decision in </I>Roe v. Wade<I> was an outright
dismissal of the Constitution. Justice Brennan and his concurring associates read </I>into<I> the spaces
between the lines of the Constitution the imaginary penumbras and emanations (inexplicably hidden
for nearly two centuries) that conveniently dictated the imposition on the nation of their own
ideological agenda."</I></B><P>

You give them too much credit, my friend.  I would say they manufactured it from whole cloth.  But I digress...<P>
<BR>

Quoting:<BR>
<B><I>"The authority of Congress to enact a law such as DOMA, however, is specifically and clearly
granted in the Constitution: 'And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which
such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.' One may disagree
with Congress's decision, but there should be no question of their authority in these matters."</I></B><P>

And this is where the rubber meets the road, insofar as our current disagreement is concerned.  The U.S.
Constitution was intended to be a limiting document.  The history of the creation of the Constitution is
replete with instances of the following litany:  "If a power is not specifically granted to the government, then
it is specifically prohibited."  For the purposes of explication, I direct you to the infamous "general 
Welfare" clause in Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B><I>Section. 8</I></B>. The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and
Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
As you are well aware, the "general Welfare" clause, like the "commerce clause," has been used to justify a
variety of unConstitutional schemes.  As the argument goes, "the Constitution gives Congress the power to
provide for the general Welfare, and thus Congress is authorized to amass funds for &ltinsert favorite 
pork-barrel scheme here>."<P>

However, immediately following that clause is a list of specific, individual powers granted to Congress
(e.g. Establishing Post Offices and post Roads).  And in this list we note something curious:  There is
an enumerated list of specific powers related to the Defense of the United States (e.g. Provide and maintain
a Navy).  The curious part stems from the fact that in the initial clause of Section 8, Congress was granted
power to "provide for the common Defence."<P>

Thus, there are two ways in which we can view the "common Defence" portion of Section 8:<P>

<OL>
<LI>The Framers granted Congress the power to provide for the "common Defence" of the U.S., and then
turned around and, in a wholly redundant gesture, granted them the additional powers to provide a Navy,
raise an Army, declare war, etc.
<LI>The Framers granted Congress the power to provide for the "common Defence" of the U.S., and then
went a bit further and specifically enumerated what providing for the "common Defence" entailed.
</OL>

All the evidence points to #2 above.  By specifically listing "provide and maintain a Navy," "declare war," and
so forth, the Framers were simply saying "these enumerated items are what we mean when we say that
Congress has the power to 'provide for the common Defence.'"<P>

Which brings us back to the "general Welfare" clause.  A similar argument holds for the "general Welfare"
clause as holds for the "common Defence" clause: Congress was not granted broad powers to provide
for the "general Welfare" of the U.S..  Instead, the Framers specifically enumerated in the subsequent
clauses of Section 8  what they meant by "general Welfare" in the first clause.<P>

Which brings us back to Article IV, Section 1:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>Section. 1</B></I>. Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts,
     Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by
     general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings
     shall be proved, and the Effect thereof. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
An examination of the second clause of Section 1 reveals that Congress has the Constitutional authority to 
do two things:  (1) prescribe how a citizen may prove to Vermont that he was married in Montana (for 
example); and  (2) what the effect of such proof will be.  However, nowhere in the second clause is 
Congress granted the power to nullify the first clause.<P>

Doubtless this will raise the question of "but it says they can prescribe the 'Effect thereof.'  What does that
mean if it doesn't mean they can choose 'no effect whatsoever?'"  Again, recall the litany "any power not 
specifically granted is specifically prohibited."  To say that the "Effect thereof" portion allows Congress to 
choose "no effect whatsoever" is to say that the "general Welfare" clause gives Congress broad powers to
promote the "general Welfare," whatever that may mean at the time.<P>

The history and proceedings of the creation of the U.S. Constitution clearly implies that, had the Framers
wanted to grant Congress the authority to completely nullify the first clause of Article IV, Section 1, they
would have specifically granted that authority somewhere in the Constitution.  The fact that they did not do
so indicates that, from a Constitutional standpoint, Congress doesn't have that authority.<P>
<BR>

Quoting:<BR>
<B><I>"Finally, with regard to (5), you are simply incorrect."</I></B><P>

That would well be true if I had, in fact, made point (5) in my original article.  Upon further review of that missive,
I can find no place in which I asserted that the passage of DOMA will endanger the legal standing of any other
acts, records, and proceedings recognized among the several states.<P>

Looking forward to further conversation with you, Michael.  Cheers!<P>
