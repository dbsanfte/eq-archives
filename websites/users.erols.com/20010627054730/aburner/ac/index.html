After months and months of being HOUNDED RELENTLESSLY AND WITHOUT MERCY (*sob*) by my coworker <a href="http://www.sche.net">shodan</a>, I finally picked up Asheron's Call.  So far, it's been an absolute blast.  So without further ado, here are the requisite AC screenshots.<p>

<ul>
<li><a href="ac001.html">Picture #1</a> - This was my first character, Kitab al-Azif.  Bonus points await if you know where the name comes from.
<li><a href="ac002.html">Picture #2</a> - Another shot of Kitab, looking stylish in front of the Bazaar in Al-Arqas.  Sadly, due to some crucial mistakes made during his creation, Kitab retired from active play.  But he still hangs around to offer sage advice as the situation calls for it.
<li><a href="ac003.html">Picture #3</a> - Jihad al-Fatwa, the brash young upstart who took over the adventuring reins from Kitab.
<li><a href="ac004.html">Picture #4</a> - Here's Jihad in his spiffy Dho robe.  This is what he wears when running around town so as not to drain the mana from all his l33t gear.  Note his bare feet (what a hippie).
<li><a href="ac005.html">Picture #5</a> - Walk softly and carry a BIG stick...
<li><a href="ac006.html">Picture #6</a> - I gradually acquire ever more l33t armor pieces.  But while I become harder to kill, my fashion sense and color coordination take a near-fatal blow.

<li><a href="ac008.html">Picture #8</a> - Are you lookin' at me?  Are you lookin' at ME?
