<B>Description:</B>  Sometimes a feller doesn't want to chase
after his dinner.  Sometimes he just wants to set a spell on
the shore of a lake, drop a line in the water, put his Stetson
over his eyes, and wait.

Not too many cowpokes will have this particular skill, on
account of there bein' not too many places to fish in the
Badlands.  But other places (the Great Northwest, the South,
etc.) have plenty of places to fish.  Maybe your cowhand grew
up in one of these places.  Regardless of how he got it, success
in this skill usually means he's caught enough to feed hisself
a meal.
