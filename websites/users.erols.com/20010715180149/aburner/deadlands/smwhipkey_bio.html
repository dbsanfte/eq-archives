<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I started off in elementary school, when a friend introduced me to the joys of Car Wars.  From there, I slowly gotten dragged into more and more...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm currently playing in a long-running RoleMaster game, and have paused my In Nomine game.  I also thought about running Heavy Gear, but have put that off for now due to the fact that I'll be running two seperate campaigns of Deadlands.<P>

I've also played Rifts, Vampire, Cyberpunk 2.0.2.0., Paranoia, Call of Cthulhu, Twilight: 2000, Dark Conspiracy, INWO, GURPS, Cyberspace, Traveller: TNE, as well as owned a number of other games, such as 2300 AD, Blue Planet, and way too many others to count.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Deadlands by far right now.:)<P>

I also enjoy Heavy Gear, In Nomine, INWO, and RoleMaster (but only when run in the style campaign I'm in now; in the hands of an incompetent gamemaster it would be damn scary).
</blockquote>

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Tons.  Other then the usual "drinkin', partying, then more drinkin'" that seems to be standard for this town, I also enjoy paintball, computers (why hell, I *am* in technical support), firearms, sci-fi, fantasy, writing, smoking cigars, reading, taking roadtrips, listening to all types of music, playing percussion, playing in the Virginia Pep Band, and I'm sure there's some other stuff in there, too.
</blockquote>

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm a huge GWAR fan, and have the opportunity to help them occasionally with their costumes, drinking their beer, etc.<P>

I'm also stuck at an Internet connection for at least 9 hours a day, so the best way to contact me is usually via e-mail or ICQ (#605228).
