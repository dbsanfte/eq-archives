        To speedily use the location command, place it into your hot keys. To 
        do this, bring up your ‘windowed screen’ and click on the Socials button. 
        Right click a social button that you are not using (write down the command 
        so that you may be able to change it back later if you so desire). A dialogue 
        box will appear, allowing you to change the title, text and colour of 
        the button text. Left click the title of the button and type ‘loc’. Left 
        click the first line of the text area and type ‘/loc’ (note it is important 
        to have the slash present). Left click the done button. (Note that the 
        other lines allow you to place further commands by left clicking in those 
        empty lines.) Your newly titled button will appear in the social button 
        list where it was previously. Left click and hold until the button duplicates 
        itself, then drag-and-drop it into an empty space of the hot-key pad on 
        the lower left of the screen. If all your hot buttons are being used, 
        you can still access the loc command by typing /loc normally.</font></p>

        how the Grid Reference work s<br>
        Unlike modern mapping practices, Verant has used a ‘up the stairs and 
        in the door’ reference. By this I mean the first number displayed is either 
        Up or Down depending on whether it is positive or negative respectively. 
        The second number displayed is either Left or Right depending on whether 
        it is positive or negative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Imagine 
        a blank piece of paper with an X in the centre of the page. This X divides 
        the page into four quadrants. The top left area is positive/positive. 
        The top right is positive/negative. The bottom left is negative/positive 
        while the bottom right area is negative/negative.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Example:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">loc 1000.00, 
        1000.00 would place you in the top left area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">loc 1000, 
        -1000 would place you in the top right area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">loc –1000.00, 
        -1000.00 would place you in the bottom right area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">loc –1000, 
        1000 would place you in the bottom left area.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">To further 
        the excitement and discovery of mapping the coordinates, Verant has moved 
        the centre X (displayed as 0.0, 0.0) on every map. So it is with Greater 
        Faydark that the centre of the map is indeed 0.0, 0.0 and coincidentally 
        is the rough centre of the tree city of Kelethin. While the Western Plains 
        of Karana has the 0.0, 0.0 location on the extreme left side of the map. 
        Verant also changes the size and shape of the zone maps between square 
        and oblong. So far in my wanderings, Kithicor Woods is the smallest non-city 
        zone, while the afore mentioned Western Plains of Karana is the largest 
        (ignoring the Sea of Tears). Therefore wherever you are may be shown by 
        these two numbers.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Why did 
        Verant included the two decimal figure extention? It could only be for 
        pin-pointing game design vectors for their design staff. Why are they 
        allowing us to see this feature? Only Verant in their infinite wisdom 
        know why and I am certainly not privy to their secrets.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="howto"></a>How 
        to use the Location Command to navigate in the game<br>
        Dakadin the Dwarven cleric tells Iludari the Elven druid that he is at 
        loc 2456, -1827 and he wants her to meet him there as he has no clue as 
        to how to read the locations. Currently Iludari is at loc 986, 657 and 
        must figure out which way she is to travel in order to meet Dakadin. Looking 
        at the two sets of numbers, she concentrates on the first number in each 
        pair. The first number is the up/down number. Since Iludari’s number is 
        lower than Dakadin’s, she knows her postion is below his (note: I do not 
        mean her position is below 0.0, 0.0). Iludari then looks at the second 
        number in each pair.  These are the left/right numbers. Positive numbers 
        are left and negative numbers are right. Therefore she must travel right 
        to get to Dakadin’s position. To do this she takes a few steps and uses 
        the loc button again. This will give her a slight variation in numbers. 
        (note: ignore decimal numbers) Example:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">986, 657 
        present position</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">986, 668 
        after a few steps. This shows she traveled to the left instead of the 
        right.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Now she 
        can confidently turn around and head off to the right for a little bit. 
        After a few yards she uses the loc button again. Now she is at loc 1057, 
        502. This is a good direction as the first number has risen indicating 
        that she is traveling up and the second number has dropped indicating 
        she is traveling to the right. She now begins to run while periodically 
        using the loc command to keep track of where she is. Depending on your 
        character you can see for about 400 units under ideal conditions. Therefore 
        Iludari need only get near 2000, -1400 to have a chance of seeing Dakadin.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><a name="tips"></a>Tips 
        to using the Location Command<br>
        When sitting with the magic book open, you cannot use the buttons 1 to 
        6 to make your hot keys function. However, you may use the mouse to click 
        your hot keys. This will allow you to find your loc, sense direction or 
        what have you.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">When you 
        initiate combat, use the loc command. This will capture your position 
        incase of sudden death.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If it is 
        obvious you will die, instead of running, use your loc command. This will 
        ease the hassle of finding your body.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Sometimes 
        I find it hard to see the numbers when I scroll back to locate my body. 
        So I have started repeatedly hitting the loc command button so that a 
        full page of loc numbers are displayed.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The location 
        of my loc button is repeated for every set of six hot keys. That way no 
        matter what set I am on, number 6 is always loc. To do this, click hold 
        and drag from the social set of buttons for each set of hot keys.</font></p>
