Amazing!  I am in almost total agreement with everything
said here [minor exceptions to follow].  In your economics
section I would suggest one other book: "America: What Went
Wrong" whose author I cannot bring to mind at this instant -
it grew from a newspaper series into a book & points out
much of what is wrong by design with our current financial
laws.<P>

On abortion - I disagree.  While I would agree that certain
limits should be placed on abortion, I cannot and will not
take an an anti-abortion stance.  I am of the fundamental
position that, as long as my actions are free of malicious
intent or actual harm towards another, then I should be
free to continue as such without interference from outside
parties, and vice-versa.  To wit: Tho abortion may be the
wrong choice for my family, it is NOT our place to tell
someone else that it's the wrong choice for them.<P>

This stems from a prevelant "you-live-your-life, I'll-live-mine"
theme on which just about all of my socio-political stances
are based.  Hey, you asked.<P>
