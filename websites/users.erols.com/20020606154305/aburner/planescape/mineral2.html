&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most sods would think a being from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral would be a little on the hard, unfeeling side.  After all, not only is the Plane comprised of stones harder than rock in most cases, but those stones are also usually razor sharp.  A cutter has to be extremely thick-skinned -- in the literal sense -- to survive even a day on the Plane.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But canny bloods know that things don't always turn out in the obvious, logical way, especially on the planes.  And so it is with Mineral Genasi.  Inheritors of the Glittering Stones are singularly large and imposing -- larger than even their Earth Genasi cousins -- and they've got a heart to match.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mineral Genasi grow up on a plane where the entire collected treasury of the Merkhant sect pales in comparison to the riches littering the ground within a mile's radius from their childhood kip.  As such they really don't understand the notion of hoarding wealth, especially just for the sake of hoarding it (which is why you'll never see a Mineral Genasi in the Merkhants).  This doesn't mean that they don't have any use for it.  But to them, jink is part of the journey.  It ain't the destination.  So while they'll keep themselves in good repair and maybe even save some for a rainy day (being prepared ain't the same as "hoarding," after all), you'll never see an Inheritor of the Glittering Stones living in anything more opulent than a modest case.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do they do with the rest of their jink?  99 times out of 100, Mineral Genasi use it to help the less fortunate of the Multiverse.  Again, this goes back to their early environment; Mineral Genasi are raised around vast amounts of material wealth, and they find it a little disturbing to discover that some berks don't have two coppers to rub together.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different Mineral Genasi have different approaches to helping out the poor and downtrodden.  Some will open up farms or smithies (or something similar) on one of the Upper Planes (or the portion of the Outlands near the Upper Planar gatetowns).  Then they'll give down-on-their-luck sods a chance to come work for 'em and learn a trade.  For those less fortunate cutters who, due to their pride, don't like accepting charity, this works out fairly well.  Other Inheritors will open up soup kitchens or resthouses to give luckless bashers three squares a day and a roof over their head at night.  Some simply make small charitable donations to existing charities, assuming that the existing charities are more familiar with the needs of the impoverished locals.  Still others decide that education is the key, and open up small public schools.  The list goes on and on, frankly, but one thing remains true: All Mineral Genasi, in their own way, do what they can to improve the lives of the downtrodden. Like the Lightning Genasi, the Mineral Genasi's exploration of the Multiverse is an exploration of the heart, and of the soul.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(It should be noted that, despite what one might think, Mineral Genasi rarely join the Ring-Givers.  This is because the Ring-Givers give things away in hopes that of receiving <I>more</I> things in return.  Inheritors of the Glittering Stones, on the other hand, are genuinely altruistic.  When they help someone, they honestly don't expect anything in return.) <P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planewalking Mineral Genasi tend to think a little bigger with regard to helping out the downtrodden, and will usually seek out villages, towns, or occasionally entire regions that are down-on-their-luck for whatever reason (usually due to marauding bands of raiders, drought, famine, or something along those lines).  When this happens, they'll attempt to take whatever corrective action they feel necessary to get the village, town, or region back on its feet.  And the rare Mineral Genasi thief will usually find some oppressive rich berk to steal from, and will then give this stolen loot back to the oppressed folk in question.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In appearance, Mineral Genasi are large, thick and imposing.  Their features are sharp and angular, like the gemstones from their native plane.  They may also have rough, dark brown skin; smooth, dark grey skin; small (half-inch diameter) crystalline stones of various colors embedded in their flesh (these crumble to worthless dust if somehow removed from the Mineral Genasi); or eyes that seem faceted (like a cut diamond).<p>
