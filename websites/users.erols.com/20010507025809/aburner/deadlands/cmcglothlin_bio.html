<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At age 12, I walked into Waldenbooks with an insatiable
interest in Greek mythology, and then I spotted the original *Deities &
Demigods*. "What's *that*?", I thought. The rest you know already from the
TV movie biopic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
D&D, Top Secret, Traveller (all versions), Marvel Super Heroes,
Twilight: 2000, Star Trek (FASA), Gangbusters, It Came from The Late, Late,
Late Show, DC Heroes, and probably a couple dozen more RPGs. Don't even get
me started on military board games! Playing nothing currently, due to the
fact that I alone constitute South Boston's gaming community.
</blockquote>

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Champions, Shadowrun, Star Trek (LUG), and Deadlands. (What?
You were expecting Dangerous Dimensions or something?)

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm a War Between the States re-enactor (2nd Corporal, 18th
Virginia Infantry, Company G), and I read any book about the War I can get
my hands on. I also know more about professional wrestling than anyone
alive (No brag; just fact:)). I've been a horror/scifi fan since I was born
and my folks named me after Hammer Films star Christopher Lee. My
application to join the Justice Society of America is currently under
review.  And I am nWo WolfPac 4-LIFE!!!!

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
You might remember me from such Deadlands books as *Tales o'
Terror:1877*, and such PEG website articles as "Gettysburg". When I'm not
altering the course of history, I'm Chairman of the Social Studies
Department at Halifax County High School, Lt. Commander & Chaplain of the
Armistead-Hill-Goode Camp# 1624, Sons of Confederate Veterans, and
Commander of the Thomas F. Williamson Camp, Military Order of the Stars &
Bars. I'm devoutly Anglican Catholic, conservative, and pro-secessionist. I
once signed a petition to make "Freebird" the new national anthem. And with
my partner Steven S. Long, I am a six-time WCW/nWo World Tag Team Champion.
