<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm an undercover agent of the 700 Club spying on you godless heathens and blackhearted satanist... err... I mean at a young age I was fascinated with Myths and Monsters and saw some metal miniatures at the local hobby store.  I begged my parents to buy them for me.  It was a Grenadier pack of Wood Elves with Spears.  Many packs of miniatures later (both Heritage and Grenadier) I saw a new book in the hobby store called the Monster Manual.  Thinking this would be interesting I begged to get this too.  Yes, that's right, I got into the hobby in just about the same way as Afterburner did, but please don't hold it against me...

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I'm getting married in October, I spent two years in a Zen Buddhist Monastery in the Catskills of NY, I'm half-Japanese Half-Norwegian, I like big dumb dogs and am not terribly fond of cats (though a couple have won my affection), I like run on sentences, I like classic rock and modern alternative, I like Oingo Boingo, Joe Jackson, Tori Amos;  I honestly belive there is no better feeling in the world than performing psychological torture on a posse, and I think the rat race is fixed.
