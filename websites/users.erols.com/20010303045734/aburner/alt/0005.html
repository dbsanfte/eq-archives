One of the most infuriating things I've discovered about many of my fellow atheists is that they tend to be
extremely smug and elitist about their atheism.  In their eyes, the fact that they don't believe in a Supreme
Being means that they're somehow smarter and more logical than religious individuals, and therefore
superior.<P>

Here are a few techniques you can use to bring them back down to earth...<P>

First off, there is only one theological belief (if you can call it that) which is strictly, totally and 100% logical:
strict agnosticism.  Strict agnosticism is the belief that it is impossible to make any judgments about
the existence or non-existence of a Supreme Being (or Beings, as the case may (or may not) be).  This
is due to the inherent limitations of analytic deduction and the scientific method.  So the true agnostic
simply says "I don't know because I can't prove it one way or the other."<P>

Since only agnosticism is 100% logical, it then follows that any other theological belief relies on some
measure of faith.  Most Christian denominations recognize this and count it as one of their postive
qualities ("faith can move mountains" and all that).  One must therefore conclude that atheism also requires
some measure of faith.  (I fully admit that a leap of faith is required to go from agnosticism to atheism.
However, it seems to me that the leap of faith required to be an atheist is an order of magnitude smaller
than the leap of faith required to believe in a Supreme Being.  Which is why I'm an atheist.  Your mileage 
may vary.)<P>

Of course, the minute you point this out to the average atheist, they will become all indignant and irate and
begin claiming that no faith is required to be an atheist.    At this point, the discussion will doubtless turn
to the question of "proof," and the athiest will self-righteously claim "It's impossible to prove a negative
statement.  Therefore, the burden of proof is on you to prove that God exists."  And, strictly speaking, it is 
impossible to prove a negative.  (That's why a physicist will say "The Law of Conservation of Mass/Energy 
has never been violated that we know of, and the odds are against it being violated anytime soon" 
instead of saying "The Law of Conservation of Mass/Energy will never be violated.")  However, it is not 
impossible to disprove a positive statement.  So instead of saying "Prove that there is no God," say "I say
that God exists.  I now invite you to disprove it."<P>

COMING SOON (As soon as I get some books back from my parents, anyways):  Irrefutable evidence that
this country was founded largely on Christian principles.<P>
