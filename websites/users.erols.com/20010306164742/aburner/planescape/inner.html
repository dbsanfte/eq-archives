        Para-Gensai and Quasi-Gensai provide an interesting contrast to their more common cousins from the four major Inner Planes.  As pointed out in the Planewalker's Handbook™, 
regular gensai approach the Multiverse with arrogance and an air of superiority, as though they and they alone had the keys to Creation.  Para- and Quasi-Gensai, on the other hand, show no signs of this attitude.  Instead, the arrogance is replaced by curiosity of varying degrees.  Sages specializing in the Inner Planes speculate that this is due to the Para-Elemental and Quasi-Elemental planes being less travelled than the four major elemental planes.<P>

        Most berks are curious about the origins of the Para- and Quasi-Genasi.  The most commonly accepted explanation is that Para- and Quasi-Genasi are the offspring of humans mating with some as-yet-unknown native to Para- or Quasi-Elemental planes.  However, it's also true that genasi are occasionally produced spontaenously by two otherwise normal human parents.  This only happens in permanent human settlements of the particular planes, and sages assume that the very nature of the plane itself affects the child in the womb.<P>

        All Para- and Quasi-Genasi are immune to any harmful effects which may exist on their native plane.<P>
