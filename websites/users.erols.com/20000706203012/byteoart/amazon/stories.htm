  was telling a friend who doesn't play EverQuest about EQ Guilds and about us,

  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In doing so, 
    I informed her that as an official guild, we get special abilities (I neglected 
    to mention it was guildchat and such). What do you think she thought our ability 
    was...?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">She thought 
    that by using a command, our breasts grow bigger!</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flirting. Simple 
    as that. You get to make men blush, shuffle their feet, and feel completely 
    boyish...and they love it! This happened the other night, and it was the beginning 
    of a rather exciting and funny evening.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">First, I'm in 
    the bank, waiting for Nefertiti, because I had something for her. She comes 
    in, but I'm flirting with Jorim. Jorim, mind you, is this massively sized 
    barbarian with thin, elegantly-done tatoos (he says he got them for honor 
    in battle, and believe me, I'd love to see his honor in battle!) I'd already 
    gotten him to blush once, but that wasn't enough. I kept at it, and he was 
    beet red before we continued on.</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From there, 
    Lannfear, swearing to drag me out and educate me in the fighting arts, even 
    if it took using my ears as handlebars, showed. The three of us were ready, 
    but it would take too much time to walk there. So we recruit a druid to teleport 
    us (thankee, Larual!) This led to a fun exchange, which eventually turned 
    into us gaining a new, fun-loving, and special sister. (Huzzah!)</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We picked up 
    her male friend along the way, a gent who has helped me immensely, but I'll 
    not embarrass the poor guy by mentioning his name unless he asks me. Jorim's 
    another thing. He is fun to embarrass. By the time we had finished, we'd added 
    Wenei and more to the list of people involved. A few hours later, we finally 
    reached our destination...and by then, we'd become so giddy that we could 
    barely breathe!</font></p>
  <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This just goes 
    to show that Amazons can even make walking exciting!</font></p>
