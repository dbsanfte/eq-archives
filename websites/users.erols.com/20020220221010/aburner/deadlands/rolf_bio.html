Okay, I doubt if anyone's heard of it, but we started playing
this new kinda game called 'role-playing' in 7th grade. It was a game
called Empire of the Petal Throne. This pre-dates D&D - and yes, I'm a
charter member of the AA-RPG (read 'old fart'). By the time I hit high
school, I started hearing, "Aren't you a little old to be playing
make-believe?" Been hearin' it ever since-- only now I respond, "I'm not
playin' make-believe, I'm playin' Cowboys-n-Indians!"

Oh, you mean there are things to do besides spreading papers
and dice all over a table top, making gratuitously vulgar noises and
consuming large quantities of cheese puffs and beer? <P>

Oh right! I like:<BR>
Hiking, Biking, Volleyball, Reading, Writing, Illustration, Movies,
Studying history and the Bible, Posing as a former highly-skilled operative
for an ultra-secret agency, now on the dodge from government agents who
seek to silence me, while the tri-lateralists hunt me like a dog for the
experimental chip grafted onto my temporal lobe (oops, sorry, lost my mind
for a minute).

You already know too much, it looks like I'm going to have to kill
you. But first-- I'll explain my entire heinous master plan so that when I
underestimate your survival skills you'll know exactly how to destroy me
after effecting your escape.<P>

Actually, it's pretty simple: I have a crazy wife and five wonderful cats
(I don't think that came out right?), all of whom are very good about
putting up with my weird hobby and equally weird friends. The most awesome
thing is that last week I finally got my wife (Jan)to create a DL
character! Can't wait to run her first session!
