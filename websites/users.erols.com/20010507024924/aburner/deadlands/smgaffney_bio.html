Purchased Dieties and Demi-Gods AD&D supplement when I was in grade school and loved it but I had know one to play with, for at the time I was living in Beloit Wisconsin and know one I knew played. I actually first started playing AD&D when I was a Freshman in Highschool, and have been addicted ever since.
