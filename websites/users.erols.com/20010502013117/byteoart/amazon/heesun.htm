            have to admit</b> that I have led a sheltered life, that is, at least 
            until my 16th birthday. I was born into a noble family in the city 
            of Freeport, my father being a well-known paladin in the local Hall 
            of Truth. I was able to grow up without a care in the world, oblivious 
            to the evil that spawned all around me. </font></td>

            as anyone more than passingly familiar with Freeport knows, it is 
            a city with a dark secret. The Freeport militia, while posing as guardians 
            of the people, are really running the town as a center for their illicit 
            activities. My father, along with the other members of the Hall of 
            Truth, tried for years to shut them down. But alas, his diligent activities 
            against the militia attracted the attention of the militia leader 
            himself, Sir Lucan, who slayed my father before my very eyes during 
            my sweet 16 party. That day changed forever my life as I had known 
            it. Although I still feel that my view of the world is naiive and 
            I have much to learn, I realized then that I needed to know more about 
            what was going on in the world around me, both good and evil. I took 
            to studying the arcane sciences, in the hopes of someday getting my 
            revenge against the Freeport Militia, and especially Sir Lucan, for 
            the brutal murder of my father. However, the militia is very strong, 
            and I must be patient.... </font></td>

    <td bgcolor="#CCCCCC" colspan="2" height="196"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>My 
      biggest personal interest</b> before the death of my father was flirting 
      with and gossiping about boys. After that tragedy, however, I became seriously 
      engrossed in my studies of the arcane. I did manage to meet a wonderful 
      paladin, by the name of Jimicapone, who proposed to me for the first time 
      in the heat of a battle. I, of course, could not believe his lack of romantic 
      timing, so I rejected his proposal, despite being attracted to him. But 
      we continued to fight the evils of Freeport together, killing as many of 
      them as we could. I couldn't help but admire his single-minded determination 
      to rid Freeport of the militia - it reminded me so much of my beloved father. 
      Alas, he killed one guard too many, and is now Kill-On-Sight in Freeport. 
      It was because of his inability to enter Freeport freely, that he called 
      for me to meet him outside the city gates one beautiful starlit night. Under 
      the full moon, he got on his knees, pulled out a beautiful magic ring, and 
      proposed to me. Of course, this time, I had to say yes. We have not yet 
      set a date, as we wish to be a bit more experienced before we attempt to 
      establish our new household and lives together. Because of his KOS status 
      with the militia, we are planning to move to Queynos after the wedding, 
      so that we can advance our abilities more conveniently. The purpose, of 
      course, is to return to Freeport later, powerful enough to exact our revenge 
      on the evil Freeport Militia.</font></td>
