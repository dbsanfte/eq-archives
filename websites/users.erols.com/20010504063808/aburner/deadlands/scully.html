<B>Info:</B>  Danielle Scully was born into a wealthy New Orleans
family, but she isn't your typical Southern Belle.  As a child
she was always something of a tomboy, and she also had a knack
for taking care of sick animals.  As she grew into a lady, this
knack turned into a desire to heal sick humans.
<P>

She entered into a prestigious (and progressive) medical school
and learned the healing arts.  But her tomboyish sense of
adventure had never quite left her, and so she chose to work
with the Texas Rangers upon her graduation instead of following
a promising medical career.
<p>

Scully's first years in the Rangers were exemplary, if otherwise
dull and uneventful.  Capitalizing on her medical knowledge,
the Rangers gave her a research position to help unlock the secrets of
the Weird West.  However, despite her contributions to Weird
West research, she remained unsatisfied with what was, to her,
essentially a "desk job."  She continued to train for the
opportunity to become a field agent, and continued to prod
her superiors into giving her this opportunity.
<P>

Her wish was finally granted with the inception of the X-Division.
Ranger Mulder, while respected within the Rangers, was still
considered something of a hot-head.  Furthermore, the senior
officers of the Rangers preferred a low-key, hush-hush
approach to the Reckoning, and Mulder's penchant for telling
the whole truth gave them considerable pause.  Scully's record
showed that not only was she exceptionally level-headed, but
she was also a downright skeptic to boot.  They felt she would
be the perfect foil for Mulder's impulsiveness, and she became
the second field agent for the X-Division, as Mulder's partner.
<P>

While there was some friction between the two at first, it
quickly dissipated.  They've been through countless scrapes and
each has saved the life of the other on numerous occasions.  And
while she still thinks that Mulder (and the rest of the Rangers)
are a little screwy for thinking that the Weird West is the
result of supernatural forces, she doesn't deny that innocent
folks are in danger by these (totally natural and explainable)
new varmints that seem to have sprung up within the past few 
years.
