Great Page.  I agree with the majoritory of your views espicaly the freedom of/from religion.  Sorry I didn't get to read the whole page, but I don't really have time.  As I said I agree with MOST of your ideas.  I to am an athiest, I have found most athiest plesent and full of open-mindedess.  Another thing I disagree on is how Athiests always argue with Christens, but complain that Christens always badger them.  The reason is that Christanity existed for over 10,000 years without anyone really questioning it.  Until Darwin.  Even that didn't really stop Christainity.  Now is when they are getting opposed, with facts.<P>  

I have gotten into debates (organized, not shouting, but saying points and reasons) with people about religion and I usually win with the christen saying, "sometimes you just have to have faith."  Sorry but that excuse doesn't cut it for me.  Christanity was make 10,000+ years ago by people who were scared and needed a purpose.  So they invented God.  George Carlin said, "We are supposed to believe in an invisible man that lives in the sky, has ten things he doesn't want you to do, watches you every minute, if you do something he doesn't like you'll burn forever, BUT HE LOVES YOU.  Some how that made perfect since to me.  I am a definate believer in freedom  of/from religion, and stand by it.  It just with people would choose a religion that they would follow.  I don't mind christens if they do what their religion says, but you have christens in gangs.  Wearing cross necklesses and going out and killing people.  Every day.  But every Sunday you see them in church.  That's what Christanity has come to now aday and that's why I'm aginst that.  Now if people would pick a good religion like Buddahism (and follow it), then they wouldn't be blowing eachother's brains out.  You're right about America being formed on Christanity.  And talking about seperation of Church and state.  The plege of alegience has a bit of a prayer in it.  So does all the money and coin.  <P>

I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying, just like christanity, America should follow though with their laws/rules.  I agress almost excatily on your views of homosexuality.  I say treat it just like heterosexuality.  If you're going to have sex, do it behind closed doors, and have an agreement that you (they) both want to do this.  That should be a rule for both hetero and homosexual relationships.  I also agree that is doesn't have an effect on society.  It only would if people didn't want it and made it a point of tracking out gays and desterbing the peace.  It wouldn't be the gay's fault.  It would be the homophobe's because he/she couldn't keep his/her nose in his/her buisness.  This is all I have time for.  If you have any other points you would like discussed.  No matter how this letter sounds,  I enjoy your insite to religion and life.<P>
