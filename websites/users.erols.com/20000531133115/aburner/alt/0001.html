In my wanderings through cyberspace, I have occasionally encountered pages dedicated to answering questions of a technical nature.  These pages take the form of an on-going discussion in which someone posts a question and then others answer it.  (As an example, check out the 
<A HREF="http://www.awa.com/nct/discuss/winweeni/index.html">Windows Weenie</A> page.)<P>

After seeing that, I thought "Why not make something like that for conservatives?"  And so I have.  This is the Refutation Finder.  You may post your questions or comments here, with the ultimate goal being to amass a collection of both facts and rhetorical gambits of interest to the conservative.<P>

Note, however, that I do not yet know CGI scripting.  Thus, there will be a delay of a day or so between the time you post something here and the time it actually appears.  Note also that I maintain editorial privilege, and certain submissions may be rejected.  The purpose of the Refutation Finder is to serve as a clearing  house for facts, figures, statistics, and debating strategies.  If you want uncontrolled anarchy, visit any of the alt.politics.* newsgroups. 
<P>

Those two caveats aside, feel free to jump right in!  The goal is to make this page the most comprehensive collection of Truth on the Net!<P>
