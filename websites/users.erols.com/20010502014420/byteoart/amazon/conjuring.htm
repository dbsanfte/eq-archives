      art of conjuration is something that is learned very young in a magicians 
      life.  If a magician does not learn what pet to conjure, what is needed 
      to conjure, and when to conjure it could lead to the dreaded corpse run 
      that we all experience.  So for you to be able to conjure with the best 
      of them, and in the worst of conditions, I am writing this guide to conjuration.<br>
      <br>
      First you must gather the proper spell and/or component.  For instance pet 
      spells for magicians require different materials throughout the course of 
      their leveling.  Now as I am yet to surpass level 14 I shall only be able 
      to tell you of the ones I have encountered at this time; but I will return 
      to update this guide as I progress.  For levels 1-11 you will be required 
      to have a good stock of malachite on hand. These stones are fairly cheap; 
      but can get costly if you demand high-level pets to fight with.  Now from 
      12-14 I have been required to use Lapis-Lupiz, a little more expensive gem, 
      to summon my stronger pets.  So remember that you will need these to conjure 
      a pet successfully.  </font></td>

<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Next, you shall 
  need to know what type of pet you will need versus the environment you are fighting 
  in.  Now I personally use an earth elemental for fighting solo because they 
  have the most hit points and ac of all the pets.  Also the earth elemental has 
  the ability to cast the root spell, which in a time of need can give you that, 
  added time to escape if need be.  This pet however may not be as good in a group.  
  So in a group you would want to use one of the other three elementals.  The 
  other three elementals are air, water, and fire; and each has its own little 
  perks.  The air elemental not only has the ability to cast a wind attack spell; 
  but it can also cast invisible upon itself.  Now the water elemental is merely 
  as it sounds an elemental that casts water based attack spells.  The fire elemental, 
  my favorite to group, has fire-based attack; but also casts a fire shield upon 
  itself that gives its attacker extra damage.  Now all of these pets have their 
  good points; but only a true master of conjuration can tell when to use what 
  pet.  So all you need to know is what weakness does the target have; and then 
  you can inflict the damage through that weakness.</font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Now lastly you 
  need to know a few keys as to when are good times to summon a pet.  Firstly 
  you must remember that a pet cannot, and will not, follow you through zones.  
  So you need to summon a pet after you enter the zone; but only if you think 
  you will need to use it.  Secondly there is a little trick you can do if your 
  pet is about to die.  If your pet is about to die in combat then you can start 
  to cast your pet spell and use the &quot;/pet get lost&quot; command right before 
  you finish. This will give you an added edge to your fighting.   Lastly in this 
  aspect you do not want to try and summon a pet during a battle that you are 
  getting hit in.  Doing this while you are taking damage can cause the spell 
  to be interrupted and that will waste your component.  </font></p>
<p><font size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In closing other 
  parts of conjuring such as: food, drink, ect. are only a click of a button to 
  command. Pet conjuration is the true test of conjuring skills.  So go out into 
  the world with the knowledge I have given and fight well!  </font></p>
