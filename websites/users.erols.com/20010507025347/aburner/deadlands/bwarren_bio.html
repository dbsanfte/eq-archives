<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I was on a high school trip to a Latin Club competition and
picked up a copy of D&D at a toy store in Dallas.  I had heard some of the
guys I played wargames with mention it and it sounded like fun. 
Fortunately &lt;grin&gt;, D&D didn't last long and I moved on to play Runequest
and other games...

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Currently, I am not gaming much. I have played many, many
role-playing and war games.  I got into Magic when it first started (and
got out of it shortly after Legends came out).  Currently, I am thinking
about running Deadlands for some friends and I am playing Doomtown, L5R,
and Bloodbowl.  I am eagerly awaiting Clan Wars (the L5R miniatures game)
and HoE.
