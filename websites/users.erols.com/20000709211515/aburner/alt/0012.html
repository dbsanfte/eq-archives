AB, <P>
I had planned to answer comprehensively your comments on the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA), anticipating your every riposte with a preemptive parry, but I realized that
such a response would ruin the back-and-forth liveliness of our exchanges. (Besides, my
other obligations and my lamentable need for some sleep already demand about
twenty-eight hours from each day. Alas, such are the burdens to be borne by the
<I>de</I>pendently <I>un</I>wealthy.) I have decided, therefore, to limit this first entry to the points
you have made: <P>
(1) The issue presented for our consideration is not the advisability of legally recognizing
homosexual marriage; it is limited to the question of the constitutionality of DOMA. <P>
(2) DOMA is analogous to <I>Roe v. Wade</I> in its disregard of the Constitution. <P>
(3) DOMA is analogous, by its similar disregard of the Constitution, to the distortions
made of the "Commerce Clause." <P>
(4) DOMA acts to circumvent the "Full faith and credit" provision of Article IV of the
Constitution. <P>
(5) DOMA nullifies the "Full faith and credit" provision, and this nullification endangers
the legal standing of the other acts, records, and proceedings currently recognized among
the states. <P>
With regard to (1), I concur. The issue of homosexual marriage is important, but our
current discussion should be limited to the separate question of DOMA's
constitutionality. It is unfortunate that so many people seem incapable of recognizing that
related but separate issues underlie almost all surface issues being debated, for the
underlying issues are often the most important. The conclusion that I have drawn from my
exchanges with individuals who exhibit this incapacity is that they would be content with a
dictatorship as long as they believed that the dictator shared their particular points of
view. This is a trap into which far too many nations have fallen. <P>
With regard to (2), (3), and (4), I strongly disagree. The decision in <I>Roe v. Wade</I> was an
outright dismissal of the Constitution. Justice Brennan and his concurring associates read
<I>into</I> the spaces between the lines of the Constitution the imaginary penumbras and
emanations (inexplicably hidden for nearly two centuries) that conveniently dictated the
imposition on the nation of their own ideological agenda. In stretching the "Commerce
Clause" beyond recognition, both Congress and the Supreme Court have read <I>into</I> the
words of the Constitution meanings that require the willful suspension of critical faculties
to endorse with a straight face. <P>
The authority of Congress to enact a law such as DOMA, however, is specifically and
clearly granted in the Constitution: "And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the
manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect
thereof." One may disagree with Congress's decision, but there should be no question of
their authority in these matters. The purpose of DOMA, in fact, is to <I>prevent</I> further
judicial fiat. Some members of the Supreme Court of Hawaii (in opposition to the will of
the overwhelming majority of the citizens of Hawaii, by the way) have "discovered" a
constitutional right to legally recognized homosexual marriage. They may end up
imposing their <I>de facto</I> legislation on the people of Hawaii, but the Congress has
determined that such action should not force the same policy on the other states. 
The fact is that DOMA does not prohibit homosexual marriage, nor does it prohibit states
or private parties from recognizing and bestowing benefits on those whom they recognize
as "married" homosexual couples. It is only in those areas clearly within the purview of
Congress that DOMA denies recognition of married status to homosexuals, and in this
the Congress clearly has acted within its authority. To argue that Congress <I>should not</I>
have acted as they did is to expand the scope of our discussion beyond the limited
question of constitutionality. <P>
Finally, with regard to (5), you are simply incorrect. Among the acts, records, and
proceedings <I>not</I> mutually recognized among most states without any perceived threat to
liberty or the Constitution are: the licensing of drivers; automobile registration; the
accreditation of doctors and others who work in the fields of medicine and health services;
the accreditation of lawyers (bar exams); a host of other accreditations covering every
occupation under the sun; the legal drinking age; the age of consent; vehicle safety and
pollution standards; ages for compulsory education and public school education
standards; and so on <I>ad infinitum</I>. In some areas, such as the standards for state
National Guard units and certain voting qualification standards, Congress has enacted
laws to require uniformity for those functions that it oversees. 
<I>Nunc est bibendum</I>. (Now is the time for drinking.)<P>
