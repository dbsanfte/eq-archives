            parents </b> were powerful necromancers in the dark city of Neriak. 
            I was being trained in their chosen art when Innoruk himself called 
            all Dark Elves to a battle against the forces of light.</font></td>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">My 
              parents, dedicated wholly to their evil god, immediately joined 
              the dark army that gathered in Nektulous and marched upon Freeport. 
              They believed that Innoruk would make them invincible and protect 
              them from harm at the hands of the light. Innoruk did not seem to 
              notice, however, that in his battle, many of his followers died 
              the final death. Many, including my beloved parents, lost their 
              lives in satisfying Innoruk's endless hate and desire to destroy 
              the light.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Angry 
              and disbelieving that the god of my people could be so callous of 
              their lives and dedication, I turned my back forever on Innoruk 
              and on the art that he advocated. The circles of Necromancers that 
              had previously accepted me as an acolyte now scorned me; I had forsaken 
              the proudest arts of Neriak.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fleeing 
              from their derision, I took refuge in the Tower of the Spurned. 
              This was the bastion of all Neriak's magical crafts except Necromancy. 
              As my heart and soul healed, the Enchanters of the Tower noticed 
              my ability to persuade the merchants to give me the best prices, 
              and my eerie talent of fading into the shadows and surroundings. 
              They led me to the depths of the Tower and taught me the art of 
              Enchanting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Finally, 
              I had found my vocation! As a young enchantress, I could access 
              any city of Norrath and leave the dark caves of Neriak that held 
              so many painful memories. As soon as I learned how to emulate the 
              forms of the other races, I began to wander Norrath. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One 
              day, when returning from a journey to Oggok, I met a young Necromancer 
              named Serunga. Despite my lowly status in Neriak society, we became 
              friends. Slowly, despite the stigma against it, we became entwined 
              in each other's hearts. I taught him how to feel emotions other 
              than hate, and he helped to soothe the pain of my parents' deaths 
              and my status. I now live mainly in Neriak to be with my love, and 
              I am working to learn more about Enchanting.</font></p>
