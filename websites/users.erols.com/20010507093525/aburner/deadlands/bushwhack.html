Sometimes a feller finds hisself in a position to jump down from a saloon
roof or low cliff or some such and knock a sidewindin' varmint to the
ground.  To determine if the feller is successful, make a Nimbleness roll.
A success means he's managed to knock the varmint down, doing SIZ
non-lethal (i.e. Wind) damage.  Each raise on the Nimbleness roll adds a
multiplier to the SIZ damage done by the bushwhacker.  A varmint knocked
down in this fashion immediately loses his highest action card (or his Ace
in the Hole if he has one).  This is in addition to any cards he
may have lost due to surprise.<P>

	If the bushwhacker is jumping from a height where he'd take damage as well
(i.e. from a height greater than 5 yards), the bushwhacker suffers a -4
penalty to the Nimbleness roll for each increment of 5 yards (rounded down
as usual).  Additionally, the bushwhacker takes normal falling damage (i.e.
1d6 cumulative for each 5 yards fallen), and this damage is also applied
normally to his victim.<P>

Normal movement modifiers also apply.<P>

	Examples:  Hedley Lamarr is riding down the trail when Black Bart
bushwhacks him from a low cliff (10' from the ground).  Bart is normal
sized (SIZ 6).  He scores a success and a raise on his Nimbleness roll, and
knocks Lamarr off his horse, costing Lamarr 12 points of Wind.<P>

	If the cliff had been 20' off the ground, Bart would have had a -4 penalty
to his Nimbleness roll, would have taken 1d6 normal (i.e. lethal) damage
himself, and Lamarr would take the same 1d6 lethal damage in addition to
the usual wind damage.<P>
