<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My best friend, Dr. Nukem, got me started.  I'd played D&D in
college and he'd found this yellow and orange book... some
goofy thing about the "Wierd West" or something... told me 
to read it and I did.  We've been playing ever since, though
not regularly.  Scheduling conflicts with job swapping, 
buying houses, moving, weddings, vacations, races & disputes
with the local law... our Posse is an interesting crew.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
D&D primarily.  Dabbled in Rifts but the GM was a power
freak and enjoyed pushing buttons to get the best of people
so I found a new hobby.  I'd like to try some of the others.
One of my Posse members happens to be a Vampire Hunter and
in my research to incorporate that into the game I've found
some cool stuff on Vampire RPG's... I'd like to try one some
time.  So would he.  We'll see.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Well, I have such an extensive background in gaming (that was
sarcasm) that I can't say.  I really like Deadlands though.
As the game gains popularity and it matures it should only
get better.  I can't wait.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
PC gaming, sports, outdoors, motorcycles/cars and weapons.
Oh, and beer.  Yes, beer is a hobby.  I'm learning how to
homebrew from my uncle who made a tasty chocolate stout.  I
will brew my own soon... if I quit moving every few months.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I've got off-beat sense of humor, usually a little dry.  My
homepage has nothing to do with Deadlands since Dr. Nukem has
made a really sweet page dedicated to Deadlands.  Mine is
about me... go figure.  I love the Clint Eastwood/Sergio
Leone spaghetti westerns and use them for inspiration very
heavily.
