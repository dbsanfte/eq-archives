            an orphan, </b> one might think that I'd be down on life. Such was 
            never the case, as I am a wood elf, and our little community was very 
            close-knit. When my parents died, I was left to fend for myself.</font></td>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Fending 
              for myself proved easy, however. When I was still young, families 
              would see me and pull me in for the night, feed me, give me their 
              leftover clothes. When I started to grow older, those same families 
              remembered my habit of humming to myself as I helped wash dishes, 
              scrub the floors, and do a little needlework. I didn't cook. I am 
              a lousy chef. They remembered my singing, and knew I had talent. 
              In my early years of puberty I found myself whisked off to the bardic 
              guild to be primed for a life of song, music, story, and wit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Since 
              then, I have travelled all over Norrath to gather stories and songs 
              and share them with the world. I've found people I adore and people 
              I would love to spend time with, but I've also learned that my years 
              of being the bumble bee that samples from every house's hospitality, 
              I'd find it hard to be the burrower that settles into one home, 
              one husband, and one way of life. I must sample them all.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I've 
              learned that even the bird must join a flock, and where in childhood 
              I flew with the families of my community, now I soar with my guildsisters...the 
              Amazons! </font></p>

      histories, as do the rest of my profession, I am known for my knack at weaving 
      a web of fantasy for the weary traveller to rest by. One of my favorite 
      memories involves sitting around Rivervale telling the story of the Wise 
      Fools to those who gathered to listen. All work and no play makes for a 
      very tuckered out fighter, hm?</font></td>
