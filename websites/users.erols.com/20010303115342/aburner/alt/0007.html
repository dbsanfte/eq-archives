It has been remarked elsewhere that a patriotic pro-choice American would do his absolute best to get the
Roe vs. Wade decision overturned.  This effort would have nothing whatsoever to do with his views about
abortion, and would instead have everything to do with his views about the limited scope of government,
checks and balances, and an adherence to the U.S. Constitution.  There are a number of avenues by which
the U.S. citizenry could legitimately legalize abortion.  Judicial fiat is not one of them.<P>

Conservatives who cherish the U.S. Constitution now find themselves on the horns of a similar dilemma
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act, although I suspect most of them don't realize it just yet.  The 
practical purpose of DOMA is to circumvent Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I><B>Section. 1.</B></I> Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and
judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the
Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This section is what allows you to get married in Montana and stay married if you decide to pack up and
move to Vermont.  DOMA would bypass this by not requiring Louisiana (for example) to recognize 
same-sex marriages if Hawaii chose to legalize them.  The justification being used for DOMA is that "Congress 
may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, 
and the Effect thereof."  However, if Congress can choose the "Effect" of "nullity" (which is what will 
happen if DOMA is passed), this would completely and utterly abrogate the first clause of Article IV, 
Section 1.  This would be an egregious Constitutional violation similar to using the "Commerce Clause" as 
justification for every bit of pork-barrel spending that enters deliberation.<P>

Thus, to remain true to Constitutional principles, a Constitutional conservative should oppose DOMA as
stringently as does the gay community (albeit for a different reason -- politics makes strange bedfellows and
all that -- and excuse the double entendré).<P>
