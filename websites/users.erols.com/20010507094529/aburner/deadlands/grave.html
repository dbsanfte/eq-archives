<B>Description:</B> Your character has trouble recovering from wounds and such.  All wounds are
treated as one level higher <I>for the purposes of healing only</I>.  For example, if his highest wound level is a light wound, treat it as a heavy wound for all healing attempts (be they his own attempts at natural healing, or be they attempts by 3rd parties to use a healing skill, arcane talent, or what-have-you).<P>

	This hinderance <I>is</I> cumulative with the Thin-Skinned hinderance, if you're really a glutton for punishment.  And no, you don't die from critical wounds to the head or guts just because they're treated like maimed for healing purposes.  It just makes it that much tougher to heal critical head or guts wounds.
