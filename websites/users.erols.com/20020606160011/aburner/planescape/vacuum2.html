&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As races go, the various Para- and Quasi-Genasi are among the more uncommon.  Smoke, Ice, and Lightning Genasi are the most common Para- and Quasi-Genasi, and it just goes downhill from there.  But of all the Para- and Quasi-Genasi, none is as rare as the near-mythical Vacuum Genasi.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason they're so rare should be obvious.  First, there are no known native critters of the Plane of Vacuum that are capable of mating with a humanoid.  Which means that the only way a Vacuum Genasi could come about is by being literally "touched by the Plane" while he or she was still developing in the womb.  And that only happens if the mother spends her entire pregnancy on the Plane.  Except that, since there's nothing whatsoever in the Plane of Vacuum, there ain't a whole lot of permanent humanoid settlements there either.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still and all, the Plane of Vacuum is infinitely large.  And somewhere in all that infinity is bound to be a permanent settlement or two (although we can only guess at why they're there).  And it's from these extremely rare settlements that we get the few Vacuum Genasi known to be roaming the Planes.  Of course, as things in the Multiverse tend to go, lots of berks wish that we didn't even have the few running around that we do.  Y'see, as mentioned above, the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Vacuum isn't a popular plane.  There's no air, no sound, damned few pockets of other Elemental matter, even fewer residents, and almost no visitors.  Oh sure, it has the occasional bit of excitement -- after all, in an infinitely large plane, something's bound to happen from time-to-time to break up the monotony.  But outside of the Positive and Negative Energy Planes, the Plane of Vacuum is the most difficult Inner Plane on which to survive (since <I>Airy Element</i> and <I>Breathe Element</I> spells don't work on vacuum, among other reasons).  So excitement happens here a bit less on average than on the other Inner Planes.  As a consequence, the Offspring of the Void are probably the least sophisticated race in the planes.  And that's putting it mildly.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think of the most clueless, wide-eyed Prime berk you can think of, and they'll look like Tarsheva Longreach herself next to the average Vacuum Genasi.  But whereas Primes are clueless due to their arrogant assumption that their Crystal Sphere is the Center of the Multiverse, Vacuum Genasi are clueless because they have absolutely no experience with things most everyone else takes for granted.  Like razorvine.  Or tanar'ri.  Or smog.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you couple the curiosity about the Multiverse that exists in all Para- and Quasi-Genasi with the cluelessness that exists in all Vacuum Genasi, you'll find that they often act even <I>more</I> clueless than Prime berks.  Since they come from a plane that has almost nothing in it, <I><B>everything</B></I> is new and exciting to them.  So Vacuum Genasi spend a lot of time wandering the planes with an excited, awe-filled expression pasted on their faces, and this is true whether they're looking at Mount Olympus or a pile of Bebilith droppings.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most Vacuum Genasi get over it.  Eventually.  If they live.  But it usually takes longer for them to shed their "cluelessness" than it does for even the most backward Prime.  And even experienced, powerful Vacuum Genasi still have a touch of the "wide-eyed tourist" about them.  Growing up in a nearly empty plane isn't something one loses easily, after all.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offspring of the Void all look very gaunt, sometimes to the point of seeming emaciated (although they're perfectly healthy).  Their skin is dry and cool to the touch, and never perspires.  And usually, when you get close to a Vaccum Genasi, there seems to be an area of "dead air" around them, extending about 1 foot from their bodies.  Inside this area of "dead air," sounds seem muted, the air seems a little thin, and odors are muted or non-existent.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Constitution, -2 Strength: Since Vacuum Genasi don't need to breathe, they've never had to suffer from an air-borne illness.  Consequently, their constitution is exceptionally hardy.  However, they tend to be gaunt and weak.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Vacuum Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Air-based spells and effects.  This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.
<LI>Outsider: Vacuum Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>Vapor Immunity (Ex): Vacuum Genasi do not need to breathe.  As such, they are immune to all effects and damage from inhaled vapors.
<LI><i>Silence</i> (Sp): Vacuum Genasi have the ability to cast <I>Silence</I> once per day as though they were a 5th level Cleric.
<LI>Clerical Focus: A Vacuum Genasi cleric must follow a deity of air or travelers.
<LI>Automatic Languages: Common, Auran.  Bonus Languages: Any (except secret languages such as Druidic).
<LI>Favored Class: Rogue
<LI>Level Adjustment +1: Vacuum Genasi are slightly more powerful and gain levels more slowly than most of the other common races.
