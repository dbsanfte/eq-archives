<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days of my youth (pronounced "ute," a la Joe Pesci in "My Cousin Vinny") I stumbled across a book in my local library which discussed and reviewed a number of the then-popular wargames.  One of the sections of the book was "Fantasy Wargames," and it included a discussion of the (at the time) recently released game called "Dungeons and Dragons."  I was intrigued, so I asked my mom (I was 11 at the time) to buy me the AD&D Monster Manual.  Of course, when I got it, I couldn't do a thing with it because I didn't have the actual rules.  Eventually, I rectified this situation and started playing AD&D.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Deadlands and AD&D Planescape are both tied for the #1 spot, although Paranoia is my favorite game to run.  Ringworld has the best background detail of any RPG I've ever seen.  And although I haven't played it (indeed, I've only owned the book for less than a week), Kult looks *very* promising.  It's a very dark, very atmospheric game.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I own a Rottweiler and two cats.  Favorite bands are Blue Oyster Cult and Rush.  I read lots of Science Fiction and Fantasy (surprise!).  I'm a net.cop for a living (thus the fearsome looking picture), and I stay fairly abreast of the latest issues regarding spam and its (hopeful) elimination.  Someday, I hope to have a pet skunk.
