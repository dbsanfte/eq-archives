        Most sods would think a being from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral would be a little on the hard, unfeeling side.  After all, not only is the plane comprised of stones that are harder than rock in most cases, but those stones are also usually razor sharp.  A cutter has to be extremely thick-skinned -- in the literal sense -- to survive even a day on the Plane.<P>

        But canny bloods know that things don't always turn out in the obvious, logical way, especially on the planes.  And so it is with Mineral Genasi.  Inheritors of the Glittering Stones are singularly large and imposing -- larger than even their Earth Genasi cousins -- and they've got a heart to match.<P>

        Mineral Genasi grow up on a plane where the entire collected treasury of the Merkhant sect pales in comparison to the riches littering the ground within a mile's radius from thier childhood kip.  As such they really don't understand the notion of hoarding wealth, especially just for the sake of hoarding it  (which is why you'll never see a Mineral Genasi in the Merkhants).  This doesn't mean that they don't have any use for it.  But to them, jink is part of the journey.  It ain't the destination.  So while they'll keep themselves in good repair and maybe even save some for a rainy day (being prepared ain't the same as "hoarding," after all), you'll never see an Inheritor of the Glittering Stones living in anything more opulent than a modest case.<P>

        So what do they do with the rest of their jink?  99 times out of 100, Mineral Genasi use it to help the less fortunate of the Multiverse.  Again, this goes back to their early environment; Mineral Genasi are raised around vast amounts of material wealth, and they find it a little disturbing to discover that some berks don't have two coppers to rub together.<P>

        Different Mineral Genasi have different approaches to helping out the poor and downtrodden.  Some will open up farms or smithies (or something similar) on one of the Upper Planes (or the portion of the Outlands near the Upper Planar gatetowns).  Then they'll give down-on-their-luck sods a chance to come work for 'em and learn a trade.  For those less fortunate cutters with a strong streak of pride that don't allow 'em to accept charity, this works out fairly well.  Other Inheritors will open up soup kitchens or resthouses to give luckless bashers 3 squares a day and a roof over their head at night.  And the rare Mineral Genasi thief will usually find some oppressive rich berk to steal from, and will then give this stolen loot back to the oppressed folk in question.  (It should be noted that, despite what a cutter might think, Mineral Genasi rarely join the Ring-Givers.  This is because the Ring-Givers give stuff away in hopes that they'll get <I>more</I> stuff in return.  Inheritors of the Glittering Stones, on the other hand, are genuinely altruistic.  When they help a cutter, they honestly don't expect anything in return.) <P>

        Planewalking Mineral Genasi tend to think a little bigger with regard to helping out the downtrodden, and they will usually seek out villages, towns, or occasionally entire regions that are down-on-their-luck for whatever reason (usually due to marauding bands of raiders, drought, famine, or something along those lines).  When this happens, they'll usually attempt to take whatever corrective action they feel necessary to get the village, town, or region back on its feet.<P>

        In appearance, Mineral Genasi are large, thick and imposing.  Their features are sharp and angular, like the gemstones from their native plane.  They also have a natural armor class of 8, and will have one or more of the following traits:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Rough, dark brown skin or smooth, dark grey skin.
<LI>A few small (half-inch diameter) crystalline stones of various colors embedded in their flesh (these crumble to worthless dust if somehow removed from the Mineral Genasi)
<LI>Eyes that seem faceted (like a cut diamond)
</UL>

        Inheritors of the Glittering Stones receive a +1 bonus to their Strength (big, thick Earth creatures can pack quite a wallop), but suffer a -1 to Dexterity (big, thick Earth creatures are rarely agile).  Mineral Genasi have a natural 50% magic resistance to all spells (or spell-like effects) which would turn 'em to stone.  Standard saving throws will still be applicable if the magic resistance fails.  Additionally, Mineral Genasi receive a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. earth-based magic every 5 levels.  They also can identify and appraise precious gems and jewelry with 100% accuracy.  Finally, Inheritors of the Glittering Stones can <I>Shape Stone</I> once per day, as the 3rd-level Priest spell <i>Stone Shape</I>.  They can affect 15 cubic feet of stone or rock in this fashion.<P>

        Mineral Genasi can be any class but Ranger or Druid.  Mineral Genasi Paladins must be Planewalkers, moving from plane to plane, seeking villages, towns, or regions which are being oppressed by raiders, corrupt officials, or what-have-you.  (Note:  This excludes locations on the Lower Planes, since these locations are evil by nature, and are not therefore oppressed.)  Once a Planewalking Mineral Genasi Paladin finds an oppressed area, he is bound by honor to stay until the area is no longer oppressed.  Leaving before that time will cause the permanent, irrevocable loss of Paladin status.<P>  

        Mineral Genasi thieves must steal only from oppressive rich berks (like a greedy merchant or a corrupt sheriff) and give the stolen wealth back to the folks oppressed by these knaves.<P>

        Mineral Genasi can specialize in Earth Elementalism or Necromancy.  They can also be specialty priests of Powers dealing with Earth, Wealth or Altruism.  Inheritors of the Glittering Stones can be multiclassed fighter/mages, fighter/clerics, fighter/thieves, mage/clerics, or mage/thieves.  They can be any Good alignment.<P>
