<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I blame my older brother and his tales of Traveller and D&D and T&T adventure.   Being the sort who is into consistancy, and well described things, I get to be Marshal, GM, DM, ST, you name it I do it.  I tinker with games as a hobby.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The games I LIKED playing were THieves Guild, RuneQuest, Chivalry and Sorcery,
Space Operan, Role Master, Space Master, Phoenix Command/Living Steel,
Cyberpunk and Mekton, and Champions.<p>

Currently my Deadlands Posse is on hold, as is a 9 year long Champions
campaign. I am working on a Dark Renaissance using WW types with another game system, and a
Mekton varient. I am also working hard on a 1920's magic is common setting
(a la Cast a Deadly Spell) using Deadlands rules but not the setting, and staring at converting deadlands rules into STAR WARS. Oh you know it would work great!
Thats it.
