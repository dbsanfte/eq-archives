Regarding government, the fundamental axiom of this website is that 90% of the problems we currently
face result (either directly or indirectly) from a loose interpretation of the Constitution.  I believe in strict
Constitutional interpretation.  This philosophy has two parts:
<P>

The first part of strict Constitutional interpretation accepts that, in general, a government works best when
constrained by a set of rules, and that a government maintains its ethical efficacy only if it follows these 
rules as envisioned by those who crafted the rules in the first place (i.e. "original intent").  This is true 
regardless of the Constitution in question; if a government has a Constitution to follow,  and it does not 
deviate from that Constitution, then at the very least the government can be said to maintain its internal 
integrity.  If the government chooses to violate the rules designed to constrain it, then the government no 
longer has integrity.
<P>
Note that the first part ignores the "quality" of the constitution in question.  This brings us to the second 
part of strict Constitutional interpretation.  The second part accepts that, in particular, the  U.S. 
Constitution is on the whole a well-designed document.  The specific articles and amendments of the
U.S. Constitution were crafted in such a way as to restrain government, and a government that adhered to
the original intent of the Framers' vision would maximize the productivity, wealth, living standards, and
general well-being of the population.

The best architects for a sound economy are the people involved therein.  Each day, millions of economic
transactions take place in the economic activity of the United States.  These decisions, taken cumulatively,
are a much better indicator of reality than any top-down theory imposed by the government.  The idea that
something so incredibly complex can be controlled at all (much less controlled effectively) is folly in its
purest form.
<P>

It is also the view of this website that there exists such a thing as "basic human nature."  This human
nature is a result of the 4.5 billion years of evolution that has produced the human race, and although
isolated individuals may possess traits which run counter to human nature, this nature will in general
persist throughout time in the majority of the human race.  Moreover, this human nature is resistant to
large-scale meddling.
<P>

In particular, with reference to economics, basic human nature will dictate that, for the majority of humanity,
a person will want rewards commensurate with his efforts in comparison with other members of his society.
To put it another way, Person A will, in general, not be content to receive the same recompensation as
Person B if Person A is more productive than Person B.
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

This website takes a slightly different view of international affairs and the military than the traditional
Conservative platform.
<P>

Most conservatives suggest that we should not get involved with the internal conflicts of other countries
(cf. Bosnia and Somalia for references) unless there is a clear U.S. interest at stake.  It is the view of this
website that U.S. intervention in foreign affairs is not inherently wrong provided (A) the nation in question
requests our assistance; (B) there is a clearly defined objective to achieve; and (C) the achieving of that
objective is left completely and solely up to the military, with no meddling from diplomats, Congressmen,
or other functionaries.  In other words, define a concrete objective, and then let the Top Brass in the
military -- especially those who specialize in strategy and tactics -- determine the most effective way to
achieve the objective without having some Senate sub-committee proclaim that all we should do is try to
"win the hearts and minds of the indigenous peoples" or some other such similar nonsense.
<P>

Note:  This is not to say that the U.S. should involve itself in every conflict that brings itself to our attention.
It simply means that, provided the above-mentioned guidelines are followed, it isn't <I>inherently</I> wrong.<P>

Aside from that one caveat, however, my views tend to fall more-or-less in line with the standard
conservatism as espoused by Limbaugh, Buckley, et al.  Specifically, free trade is not inherently bad, 
although the execution of that free trade can be problematic;  foreign aid to other countries is just a form
of international welfare; and a strong military is an unfortunate necessity even at the end of the 20th
Century.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here is where things get interesting.
<P>

Since the focus of this page is on those Alternative Conservatives who have one (or more) non-standard
beliefs concerning sex and/or religion, it might be expected that my views on the subject are those of 
a raving liberal.
<P>

This is not so.
<P>

Regarding religion, any Alternative Conservative must accept that this country was indeed founded on
Christian principles.  The historical record is quite clear on the issue (despite the efforts of a number of
ideologues to claim otherwise), and to deny the Christian heritage of this nation is to be deliberately blind
to the facts simply because they may be uncomfortable.  (Note, however, that accepting that this country
was founded on Christian principles is not a de facto acceptance of the theological underpinnings of
Christianity itself.  It simply means that one recognizes and acknowledges the historical record, regardless
of one's own personal religious views.)
<P>

In a broader sense, it is my view that the prosperity of the United States comes as a direct result of the
culture concommitant with Western civilization.  And Christianity is inextricably entertwined with the culture 
and values of Western civilization.  While I don't believe that Christianity should be favored to the point of 
excluding other religious beliefs, I recognize that the current culture seems to be favoring other religious 
beliefs at the expense of Christianity.  (Try to remember the last time you saw a positive portrayal of a 
fundamentalist Christian in the movies or on TV...)  The objective for the Alternative Conservative should 
be to promote wider religious tolerance for all religions (or at least, all religions which are not actively 
hostile to Western civilization and/or to conservative principles).  These days, that means fighting for the 
rights of Christians to practice their religion as freely as do other religions, and combatting the negative 
stereotype of Christians that pervades the common media.
<P>

Finally, with regard to religion, it is my view that if the city council of Hoople, ND wishes to display a 
nativity scene in front of city hall for the Christmas holidays, this should <B><I>not</I></B> be considered a threat to 
the integrity of the United States.  Anyone who suggests otherwise is simply a malcontent with a
theological axe to grind.
<P>

On the subject of morality and, in particular, sexuality, this website accepts as axiomatic the principle of
"informed consent." In this view, what Person A does with Person B in their private chambers is their
business provided that both parties give "informed consent."  A child is capable of giving
consent, but that consent is not "informed consent" because children generally lack the maturity to make
such a decision intelligently.  Thus, pedophiles have no place in the Alternative Conservative viewpoint.
Likewise, those who practice bestiality and necrophilia are also excluded because animals and corpses are
incapable of informed consent.  (Indeed, a corpse is incapable of consent, informed or otherwise.  But I
digress...)
<P>

The second axiom I accept is that families are the central cohesive unit of a society.  However, the
family in question may not always take on an accepted form.  In my view, stability, love, a work ethic,
and responsibility and accountability for ones actions are the most important values a family can have 
and promote.  Thus, a child in a stable family environment, surrounded by love, and taught responsibility 
and the work ethic will be better off in the long run than a child raised in an unstable home or a child that is
not taught these core values of love, responsibility, etc.  This is true regardless of whether the parents in 
the family are heterosexual or homosexual.  Likewise, irresponsible sexual behavior is bad, again 
regardless of whether this behavior consists of heterosexual irresponsibility or homosexual irresponsibility.
<P>

This website is also firmly opposed to the "forced outing" of gays and lesbians.  Just as many heterosexuals
don't casually trot out their sexual activities in public for all to see, many homosexuals likewise keep their
sexuality in the bedroom.  This is an issue of privacy, not one of being "in the closet."

The author of these pages considers himself to be anti-abortion, not pro-life.  As an atheist, I do not believe
in an immortal, transcendant soul.  Thus I am somewhat compelled to accept the "quality of life" argument
put forth by the pro-abortion plank.  However, my opposition to abortion -- specifically unrestricted abortion
on demand -- has nothing whatsoever to do with the question of whether or not the embryo is "life" or not.
Instead, my argument concerns itself with the overall (and subtle) negative psychological impact that 
widespread abortion has on society as a whole.
<P>

With regards to crime and punishment, this website adheres largely to Heinlein's Observation:  If it isn't
cruel or unusual, it isn't much of a punishment.  This is, of course, a very flippant and somewhat inaccurate
view of my beliefs, but it captures the essence: When convicted felons can claim that not having cable TV
is "cruel and unusual punishment," can sue the prison system based on that claim, and <I>can actually 
win these lawsuits</I>, something has gone horribly awry.  To those who claim that the death penalty is
ineffective, this website agrees, with one caveat:  The death penalty is ineffective because it has been
hamstrung by its opponents.  This website posits a challenge:  Let us have 20 years of no death penalty
anywhere in the country.  Then let us have another 20 years of death penalty enforcement without meddling
by the opponents of capital punishment.  Whoever can reduce crime the most significantly wins.
<P>

Finally, it should be stated that the author of this website believes that the elimination of negative social
phenomena like poverty and crime is categorically impossible.  Thus, pursuing public policy aimed at
<I>eliminating</I> poverty (or crime, or other negative social item as appropriate) is, at best, a waste of
time and taxpayer's money.  The best that can be hoped for is to reduce these negative social phenomena
to a mathematical minimum.  It's a subtle, but crucial, distinction.
