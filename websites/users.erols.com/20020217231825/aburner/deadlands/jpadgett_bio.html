<BLOCKQUOTE>
Back in 1980 I saw an article in the Sunday Express Magazine (Don't blame me, I can't help it if my parents are Mr & Mrs Conventional.) about this "new" & "groovy" (Well, thats how we talked at the time. Well, we did in MY neighbourhood when we were pretending we were someone cool like 'Starsky & Hutch'. Oh, the innocence of it all!) game from America called Dungeons & Dragons. I kept going on about this so much that my parents caved in and I got one Basic D&D boxed set for Christmas.

What, apart from the usual Sci-Fi and Fantasy?  Well, I read (Ray Bradbury, Julian May & Lovecraft amongst countless others.)  I listen to music almost constantly ranging from little known bands like Pink Floyd to such super nova megastars as Baader Meinhoff and The Auteurs. (...and Norman Greenbaum is a genius)  My final non-rpg vice is the little known sport of Rugby League. Unfortunately, due to my employment-exile down to this sun drenched hole (Can't stand the sun. It is evil, I tell you!), it's an addiction that struggles to be fed.

I like people I've never met before giving me large sums of money. Unfortunately they then expect me to leave.
