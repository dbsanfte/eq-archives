Hi AB,<P>

Regardless of my usage of the word "matters" in my previous
post, my point was actually that it doesn't *matter* what
"matters" to the fetus. Kids make poor judgments and we, as
adults, rarely make our decisions regarding their welfare
taking into account what "matters" to them -- if we did,
they'd eat ice cream cones and play video games all day.<P>

But just so we're not talking apples and oranges, here:
Is your argument, then, that abortion is not murder if
performed before the nervous system is fully developed?
It's been argued that the embryo isn't *really* alive until
at least the membranes break down and separate parental
chromosomes (18-24 hours), or until the activation of
paternal DNA (2 days), or until implantation in the uterus
(6 days). You say it's at least until the nervous system
is formed. The problem with all of these defintions of when
real human life begins is that they are simply arbitrary
and capricious. The only unequivocal point at which to
define life's inception is conception.<P>

Yes, on the larger issue, regarding the negative societal
consequences of abortion, we are in agreement, but I'm not
sure I want to let our smaller, semantic arguments away
like water under the bridge as our reasoning will help us
both understand the abortion issue, as a whole, more
precisely.<P>

Yours, Stephanie Herman<P>
