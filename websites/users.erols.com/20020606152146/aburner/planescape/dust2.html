&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the minds of most cutters, the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Dust conjures up images of decay, decomposition, and disintegration.  The Plane is inimical to both life and to created items, and both will quickly turn to dust without the proper magical protection.  Amid all this waste and desolation are the Loreseekers of the Eroding Sands -- the Dust Genasi.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dust Genasi are fascinated by the history of things:  Buildings, magical weapons, famous (or infamous) bloods, regions, towns, you name it.  Most sages and scholars claim this is due to the fact that Dust Genasi are raised on a plane where they routinely see the ultimate embrace which awaits all things, and have therefore developed a curiosity about the life <I>before</I> the decay.  On the other hand, some claim that it's the symbolism of accumulated dust (or sands through an hourglass) representing the passage of time.  And a few berks say it's because researching the history of dead people and ruined towns is the only thing that matches the dry, somber personality possessed by most Dust Genasi.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the reason, most Dust Genasi explore the planes in much the same manner as their Magma Genasi cousins.  Some Loreseekers of the Eroding Sands focus their research on one particular location, person, or item, and spend the rest of their lives unearthing its history.  Other Dust Genasi prefer to dabble, rather than delve.  These are the Planewalking Loreseekers, and they accumulate a broad base of knowledge by travelling around the Multiverse.  And finally, some Dust Genasi exist somewhere between the two, wandering the planes for the most part, but occasionally settling down for a year or more to more thoroughly investigate a particular item, region or person.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Dust Genasi feature a colored pattern to their skin reminiscent of sand. Most usually also have a faint dusting of sand on their bodies.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>

<UL>
<LI>+2 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity: Dust Genasi are bright, but they tend to move deliberately.
<LI>Medium-size.
<LI>Dust Genasi base speed is 30 feet.
<LI>Darkvision up to 60 feet.
<LI>+1 racial bonus to their saving throws vs. Earth-based spells and effects.  This bonus increases by +1 for every five character levels the Genasi attains.
<LI>Outsider: Dust Genasi are outsiders.  This means that they are vulnerable to any spell or weapon that affects extraplanar creatures (such as <i>Banishment</i> or a <i>Sword of the Planes</i>).  However, it also makes them immune to spells which specifically target humanoids, such as <i>Charm Person</i>, <i>Hold Person</i>, etc.
<LI>History Buffs (Ex): Dust Genasi get the Knowledge (History) skill as a class skill.  Furthermore, due to their knowledge of history, non-bard Dust Genasi have the Bardic Knowledge ability as though they were a bard four levels lower than their character level. 
<LI>Expert Historians (Ex): Dust Genasi bards can use their Bardic Knowledge ability as though they were two levels higher.  Multiclass bards can use either their bard level or their character level, whichever gives them the best results.
<LI>Disintegration Immunity (Ex): Dust Genasi are completely immune to any spell or effect that would disintegrate them or turn them to dust.
<LI><i>Shatter Rock</i> (Sp): Dust Genasi have the ability to cast <I>Shatter Rock</I> once per day.  This spell is identical to the 2nd-level Wizard spell <i>Shatter</i>, except that it works only by touch, and it only affects rock or stone.  Dust Genasi can use this ability on up to 20 cubic feet of rock or stone.
<LI>Clerical Focus: A Dust Genasi cleric must follow a deity of earth, lore, or knowledge.
<LI>Automatic Languages: Common, Terran.  Bonus Languages: Any (except secret languages such as Druidic).
<LI>Favored Class: Diviner
