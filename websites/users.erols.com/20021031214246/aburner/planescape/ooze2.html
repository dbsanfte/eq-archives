"The...er...noble beauty of a...uh...a pig wallow.
The melodious &lt;smirk&gt; sound of a...a boot <I>splorching</I>
&lt;snicker&gt; through the mud after...after...BWAHAHAHA"<br>
            --Excerpt from the last performance of Gerald the
              Straight-faced Bard, held at the Great Silt Palace,
              on the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze.<P>
</PRE>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one might guess, bashers from the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze have a hard time getting respect from the rest of the Multiverse.  After all, the other Inner Planes have something going for 'em, from the burning majesty of the Plane of Fire to the immeasurable wealth of the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Mineral to the bitter cold of the Para-Elemental Plane of Ice.  Whether it's due to the beauty, the power, the riches or the deadliness of the particular plane, the other Inner Planes inspire respect.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, there's nothing particularly inspiring about Ooze.  And Dwellers of the Mud (as they call themselves) get this repeatedly drummed into their heads from the moment they step off the Para-Elemental Plane of Ooze.  While some Ooze Genasi develop a crushing inferiority complex from all this lack of respect, most Ooze Genasi react in the following ways:<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, they become over-confident overachievers.  They push themselves to the limit, and more, just to prove their worth.  For Ooze Genasi with the skill to back it up, this can often be a boon.  Many Ooze Genasi have skyrocketed to fame and fortune due to their "I can do it if I just <I>try</I> hard enough" attitude.  For Ooze Genasi less able to put their jink where their bone-box is, this over-confidence can have sometimes humorous, sometimes  deadly, results.  While an Ooze Genasi would (almost) never be over-confident enough to do something obviously stupid like trying to best a Titan in a wrestling contest, it's not unheard of for an Ooze Genasi to imagine themselves the equal of a Pit Fiend or an Arcanoloth when it comes to understanding binding contracts and the loopholes therein.  The results of such folly are predictable.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they try to hold up mud, ooze, muck, and so forth as equally worthy of respect and admiration as the other elements (and para- and quasi-elements).  They're constantly trying to find new ways to inspire folks with mud.  From artistic creations made of mud to cosmetic mud-baths to weapons that sling mud, almost all Ooze Genasi strive to increase the respect accorded their native element.  So far, the results have been less than impressive.  But the Ooze Genasi keep trying.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooze Genasi paladins (called Silt Knights) occur when an Ooze Genasi (in typical Ooze Genasi fashion) decides that he or she will be the sworn protector of a particular town (prime or planar), region (prime or planar) or realm.  (Ooze Genasi are nothing if not big thinkers.)  In adopting this town, region, or realm, the Ooze Genasi swears to defend it from evil at all costs.  A Silt Knight might adopt the gate town of Tradegate, for instance, or the Great Glacier of Toril.  They're free to leave their designated area at any time (to visit relatives, for instance), and can even adventure away from their designated area.  But if the area under protection should somehow get destroyed during the paladin's absence, the paladin immediately (and irrevocably) loses all paladin status, and becomes a fighter of the same level.<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skin of an Ooze Genasi always has the color of mud, and sometimes even seems to drip (although this is just an optical illusion).  They also usually have the faint aroma of moist earth about them.<p>

<code><i>Racial Traits:</i>
