        For some reason, most berks expect Positai (the name Planars have given to the Positive Energy Genasi) to be serene and contemplative.  The sods just assume that anybody filled with the very essence of Life itself <I>must</I> be of a tranquil and philosophical turn of mind.  As with a lot of assumptions on the planes, it just ain't so.<P>

        Crucibles of Life, as the Positai call themselves, are filled with Life energy alright -- with the emphasis on "energy."  Positai are energetic individuals, sometimes to the point of being manic and hyperactive.  This isn't to say they're chaotic (at least, not necessarily).  Lots of Positai are quite ordered and logical in their ceaseless activity.  But it seems like Positai are always doing <I>something</I>, and many become active Planewalkers just to give 'em something to do.<P>

        Positai are, not surprisingly, fascinated with Life itself in all its abundant variety, particularly with regard to the nurturing, growing, or healing of life.  Again, most berks expect Positai to be fond of wilderness areas to the exclusion of all else, and again, most berks have it wrong.  Sure, some Positai like exploring the Wilderness, but any Positai will point out that a city is just as much a nexus of life as is a forest.  Indeed, the Positai who favor urban areas will tell you that each city, town, or village has its own personality and spirit which permeates the buildings and inhabitants.  As such, Positai can be found as rustic farmers, urban healers, and the entire gamut in between.<P>

        All Positai have vibrant yellow-white skin, and the skin itself is also warm to the touch.  Additionally, Positai have a faint glow about them.  This glow is part of their <I>Aura of Life</I>, and as such cannot be covered up by dark clothing.  While this glow only puts out the same light as a candle, it makes it impossible for the Positai to hide in shadows.  (It's also a surefire way to draw missile fire in dimly lit combat areas.  The life of a Positai ain't always mead and skittles, berk.)  Fortunately, the <I>Aura of Life</I> provides some benefits as well.  Any living thing (even a Bleaker) within 5 feet of a Positai will feel invigorated and more cheerful.  (Treat this as an innate Healing proficiency if the Positai is tending to a wounded basher.  Otherwise, the Aura confers no specific game bonuses or penalties.  Role-playing the invigorating, cheering effect is encouraged, however.  At the DM's option, this could be used to counteract the melancholy of a Bleaker.)<P>

        Due to the fact that Positai are filled with the very stuff of Life itself, they gain a +1 bonus to their Constitution.  However, their hyperactivity results in a short attention span, and results in a -1 to their Intelligence.  Additionally, since Positai are suffused with Life essence, they gain the following abilities and hindrances:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Positai are immune to Mummy Rot.
<LI>Level drain attacks are more effective on Positai, and any successful level drain attack against a Positai drains one additional level.  Undead that don't normally have a level draining attack will still drain one level from a Positai on a natural 19 or 20 attack roll (provided the Undead creature attacks barehanded).  This confers no benefit to the Undead creature, and simply reflects the baneful effect of Unlife energy vs. Life energy.
<LI>Positai can turn Negative Energy Undead (basically, everything but Mummies) as though they were a cleric of the same level.  Undead that resist being turned will always try to concentrate their attacks on the Positai.  Free-willed undead (vampires and whatnot) will alter their tactics as the need arises (such as dealing with other, more dangerous party members), but will attack the Positai first if given the opportunity.  Mindless undead (Skeletons and zombies) will attack 
Positai to the exclusion of everything else, unless given explicit instructions to do otherwise by whoever (or whatever) controls them.
<LI>Positai clerics and paladins can turn Undead as though they were two levels higher.  A 2nd level Positai Cleric turns Undead as though he were 4th level, for instance.
<LI>All Negative Energy creatures (including Negatai and most Undead) receive a 1d4+1 damage bonus when attacking a Positai barehanded.
<LI>Positai have a 50% chance of being ignored by Mummies (or other Positive Energy Undead).
<LI>They heal at twice the rate of normal bashers.  One day of rest will heal two points, and one day of complete bed rest will heal 6 points.  This effect is also extended to Positai under the care of someone with the healing and/or herbalism proficiencies. Magical healing receives a 50% bonus (roll normally for healing, divide by two, round fractions <I>up</I>, and add the result to the original roll).
<LI>Positai have the ability to <I>Cure Light Wounds</I> once per day.
<LI>Every five levels, Positai gain a +1 bonus to their saving throws vs. Necromantic magic.

        Positai can be fighters, paladins, mages, Necromancers, clerics, specialty priests, fighter/mages, fighter/Necromancers, fighter/clerics, or mage/clerics.  Specialty priests must follow a Power of Life, Healing, Fertility, or Nature.  They can be any Alignment.<P>
