<B>How I got started in this crazy hobby:</B><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The usual way, I was an awkward geek in junior high. One of my friends found some AD&D books at a garage sale, so we gave it a try to kill time after school. In college I discovered a new group, and a new way of playing. No more hack and slash (well, maybe a little) and I started branching out into different games.

<B>Games I have played/owned:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
I refuse to touch AD&D anymore, I think it's an abominably bad rule system that promotes killing everything that moves.  I got into Vampire a little just after it became popular but before all the idiot twinks started playing it.<P>

In college I discovered Warhammer FRP and to date it's still my favorite fantasy system.  My true love is Deadlands, but I also have a deep fondness for Paranoia, Cthulhu, and BTech/Mechwarrior. Oh, I forgot Feng Shui! Wonderful game!
