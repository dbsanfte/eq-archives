<B>Info:</B>  While the Reckoning has released a great deal of
supernatural energy into the world, it also existed beforehand.  
Frank "Coyote" Mulder experienced this first-hand as a young 
child when his younger sister was snatched away from under his 
care in extremely mysterious circumstances.  The trauma 
associated with this incident drove him to find out as much 
information as he could on instances of paranormal activity.<P>

When the Reckoning began in '63, Mulder somehow <I>knew</I> that
an influx of supernatural energy had just occurred.  Some claim
that this is due to the fact that he was born on Hallowe'en, but
whatever the reason, Mulder sensed a fundamental change in the
world.  When the Rangers began actively investigating strange
occurrences, he found out about it through a friend and rushed
to join the Rangers.<P>

As the years went by, Mulder impressed his superiors with his
keen eye for detail, his comprehensive reports, and his near
uncanny understanding of the true nature of the Reckoning.  
When the X-Division was founded, he was the natural choice to
become X-Division's first field agent.<P>

Mulder is driven by the Truth, in whatever form it may take.  
He wants to know the what and the why of the Reckoning, and 
he wants to make this information public knowledge in order
to combat the "aura of fear" that grips the nation.  He has
difficulty understanding that, although the truth can indeed
help lower the "aura of fear," it must be presented a certain
way to keep the people from panicking.<P>
