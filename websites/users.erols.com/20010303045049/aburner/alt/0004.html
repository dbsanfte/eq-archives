Congratulations on being the first person (other than me) to leave your mark on the Refutation Finder, Stephanie.  Let's hope this is but the first in a long list of entries here...  :-)<P>

Regarding the concept of what "matters" to the fetus, I point out that your usage of the word implies some sort of conscious decision-making process in action.  In my case, I was speaking of that finite length of time during which conscious or unconscious mental activity is simply impossible due to the incomplete construction of the nervous system.  (My understanding is that the nervous system is completely developed in the fetus sometime around the 17-19th week of pregnancy, although I readily confess that it's been some time since I debated this topic and thus my figures may be way off.)  And before the 12th week, it can be said that the fetus is wholly incapable of being aware of anything.<P>

All this is water under the bridge, of course, since we're in agreement on the larger issue:  Abortion as a form of retroactive birth control has serious consequences for society.<P>
