<BLOCKQUOTE>
Wayyyy back in 4th grade, a friend got the Basic D&D
Boxed set for Christmas. He was too dumb to figure it out and
tossed it into his closet.<P>

A year or so later, I found an AD&D display in a department
store's toy section and convinced (read: nagged) my Mom to
buy one of the books for me, because it was all about elves 
and orcs and everything else that was in the books I was 
currently reading (The Lord of the Rings!).<P>

The concept "Main Rulebook required to use this Supplement" 
was alien to my 10 year old mind. I spent a happy trip home 
in the back seat reading all about zombies and umber hulks
and dragons, Oh My! My joy was boundless until I realized a few 
days later, "What the heck do you do with all this information?"
There I sat, dejected and bored, with my very own Monster Manual 
and nothing to do with it, when who should walk by, but my 
near-illiterate friend, "Gee, I got something like this at home.
It doesn't make any sense either." <P>

The rest, as they say, is peanut butter and chocolate.

<B>Favorite Games:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Anything anyone else is running... :)
I'm willing to give any game a chance as I think enjoyment
stems more from who is playing than what is being played.<P>

If I had to limit myself to specific games (I don't know,
maybe if I'm kidnapped by aliens and placed in an intergalactic
zoo with other nerds or something.), I'd go with the following:<P>

Deadlands (Hands down, the best overall RPG I've ever played.)<BR>
Call of Cthulhu (Insanity, it's not just for breakfast anymore.)<BR>
Paranoia (How did my clones die? Let me count the ways.)<BR>
Pendragon (The opposed character stats are great.)<BR>
Gammaworld 1st Ed. (You're ignorant, poor, and even the grass can kill you.)<BR>

A few dice, a couple of beers, and a good GM and I'm happy as a clam.

<B>Other Hobbies:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
Beer, ***HOT*** foods (both cooking and eating), reading voraciously, PCs, mountain biking, cinema, seeing live music, hiking,  darts, world travel (when I can afford it), staying out of the Universe's way when it's on a rampage.

<B>Other stuff:</B><BR>

<blockquote>
It wasn't me... it was my evil twin.<P>
 
Unless you're in the Capital District and want to game.
Then you should call me instead of him.
