As mentioned elsewhere in this website, there are a few points in which I deviate from the usual conservative
standard.  In the interests of integrity, I provide further explication of these points below.

It seems reasonable to start with a discussion of my atheism, since as a practical matter my atheism
has little bearing on my conservative views.  This is because I have always, even during the darkest chapters
of my liberal elitism, maintained a great deal of respect for religion in general (and Christianity in particular).
<P>

More specifically:

<UL>
<LI><BLOCKQUOTE>I understand and accept that the United States of America was founded largely upon
Christian philosophy and values.  The historical record is quite clear on the issue, and I marvel at the
continued attempts by ideologues to claim otherwise.  I am no more threatened by the fact that the U.S. was
founded on Christian principles than I am threatened by the fact that the modern country of Jordan was
founded on Muslim principles.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><BLOCKQUOTE>I believe in religious tolerance for all religions.  This includes the religion most consistently
maligned today by the popular culture and by the government: Christianity (especially fundamentalist 
Christianity).  I have heard too many of my fellow atheists cry "I want the fundies to leave me alone!" only to
turn around and harrass Christians who choose to pray in public.  This seems to be an egregious double
standard.  What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and all that.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI><BLOCKQUOTE>I have met a number of atheists during my life.  A few have been pleasant, humble,
down-to-earth souls.  The majority, however, have been a surly and unpleasant lot.  It becomes obvious 
after even a brief conversation that these folks are not atheists so much as they are anti-religionists.  Their 
discourse generally revolves around what a sack of bastards Christians are, with a special vehemence 
reserved for the Christian Right.  This seems to be (A) largely a waste of time; and (B) a wholly transparent
attempt to justify their "atheism" and bolster their own insecurities.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>

Of course, having said all that, it still remains true that I don't believe in a higher cosmic authority.  While I
find this generally liberating in most instances, it places me on the horns of a dilemma when I am forced
to defend a higher moral order.

This is the topic in which there can be found the largest discrepancy between my views and the views most
usually described as "conservative."<P>

My view is simple: If (A) it happens in a private location; (B) it involves the informed consent of the parties
involved; and (C) society is not negatively impacted by whatever "it" is, then "it" cannot be defined as
"immoral," and sanctions against "it" are, at best, spurious.<P>

Exhibitionism, for example, does not meet either of the first two criteria.  By definition, it happens in a public
place, and the individuals to whom the exhibitionist displays his/her wares are not given an opportunity for
informed consent.  Thus, exhibitionism can be defined as "immoral."  In another example, drug use can 
meet the first two criteria, but only rarely does it meet the third.<P>

The difficulty with this view, of course, arises as a consequence of (C) above, namely "What <I>exactly</I>
constitutes a 'negative impact' on society?"  There are many who claim that homosexuality has a direct
negative impact on society chiefly as a consequence of HIV and AIDS.  However, a closer examination
of the facts will reveal that this negative impact is related more to promiscuous behavior than to
homosexuality.  A monogamous homosexual couple is just as unlikely to contract AIDS as is a monogamous
heterosexual couple.<P>

In this view, then, promiscuous homosexuality is just as immoral as promiscuous heterosexuality.
The key point being that the "immorality" stems from the promiscuousness of the acts in question, rather
than from the gender of the individuals involved.  Conversely, if stable, loving heterosexuality is moral, then
stable, loving homosexuality must likewise be moral.<P>

As one final caveat, however,  I feel it only mete to point out that I do dissent largely with the homosexual
community on one particular point, that being the automatic granting of sainthood upon those who contract
AIDS -- especially those who then "atone" for it by preaching the anti-AIDS, safe-sex message.  The most
blatant illustration of this was when Pedro (or whatever his name was), a fellow from MTV's "Real World"
program, died after a rather brief battle with AIDS.  When he died, the press became extremely moist and
runny about it, falling all over themselves to describe this fellow in the most glowing possible terms.  And
one of the phrases used repeatedly to describe this fellow was "wise beyond his years."  Time and again
was this mantra repeated.
<P>

However, as it turns out, Pedro -- <I>by his own admission</I> -- contracted AIDS via frequent, promiscuous,
unprotected sex with a known high-risk group.  Now, this doesn't sound very "wise" to me -- certainly not
"wise beyond his years."  In fact, it sounds pretty damn stupid, especially given the media attention AIDS
has received in the past 10 years or so.  The reason he was considered "wise beyond his years?"  After
he contracted AIDS, he preached the "safe-sex" message.

<A NAME="Evolution"><H2>The Theory of Evolution</H2></A>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was with some surprise that I discovered that my views on evolution differed from the view which can be
described as "classical" conservatism.  I would have had the same reaction had I discovered that "classical"
conservatism didn't believe that the earth was round.<P>

For a long time, I was genuinely puzzled by conservatism's reluctance to accept evolution.  I couldn't see
the objection.  Over time, as I have read more about the underlying principles of conservatism, I have come
to some sort of understanding about why evolution is regarded in many conservative circles as one of 
the chief weapons used to erode the foundations of conservatism.  I don't agree, of course, but I at least
can understand intellectually the origins of the arguments.<P>

The first and most obvious objection to evolution by conservatives is based on religious grounds.  Most
conservatives are, unlike myself, Christians to one degree or another.  And the common wisdom (incorrect
as it may be) is that Christianity and a belief in evolution are mutually exclusive.  I see signs of this on those
infrequent occasions when I reveal to someone that I am an atheist.  One of the first things they usually ask
is "Oh, so you probably believe in evolution."  To the minds of many, evolution and atheism are synonymous.
<P>

The problem, however, is that nothing could be further from the truth.  While I readily admit that few (if any)
atheists believe in divinely inspired Creation, there are many Christians -- conservative Christians, in fact --
who believe divinely inspired evolution.  My father is just such a Christian.  He is fundamentalist, conservative,
Christian, and someone who believes in evolution.  I have personally written many essays in defense of
the proposition that Christianity and evolution are not mutually exclusive, but the most thorough work on
the subject I have read thus far is <I>The Fourth Day</I>, by Dr. Howard Van Till.  This book is now
sadly out of print, but you might still run across it in a library or in a used bookstore.  If you do, I recommend
it highly.<P>

The second objection I have encountered is more in opposition to Social Darwinism than to evolution itself.
But since the root of Darwinism is evolution, many consider them to be inseperable.<P>

To this argument I respond in the same manner that I respond to those who try to claim that "Christianity is
responsible for more deaths than any other cause in history."  My response to these individuals is "Horse
apples.  People caused those deaths, not Christianity.  Any philosophy, no matter how noble, can be
twisted into a mockery of itself by the endless depravity of humanity."  Likewise, I point out that Darwinism
stems not from evolution, but from the manipulations of evolutionary principles by self-interested men.<P>

The third argument is that evolution removes mankind from the realm of Heaven and places him on the same
level as other, lesser animals.  There is no real refutation for this argument, since it's largely a matter of
perception.  I am an atheist and I believe that evolution is an irrefutable fact.  And yet I do not consider
humanity to be just "another animal."  Indeed, evolution itself is the handiest evidence to prove that we
<I>are</I> above the other animals.  There has been a 4.5 billion year race to the top of the food chain, and
we humans seem to have won.<P>

The fourth and final argument I've encountered is brought about by those who would try to use evolution to
"prove" that no supreme being exists.  This is a false use of the scientific method.<P>

The scientific method, while being of considerable utility, has definite boundaries on the realms in which it
can legitimately inquire.  The realms of the physical, the natural, and the material -- all these are available
to the scientific process.  This is because the physical, natural, material world is a world of concreteness,
and the scientific method is designed to probe the concrete world.<P>

However, there is another realm -- one of the metaphysical, the supernatural, and the extramaterial.  This is
the realm of abstractions and of philosophy.  The scientific method has no currency in this realm, for how
can one use test tubes and bunsen burners to investigate the nature of "Justice?"  Obviously, then, anyone
who attempts to justify a metaphysical position ("there is no God") using physical methods ("evolution
says so") is seriously misusing accepted scientific procedures.<P>

As one final aside, I point out that evolution supports many conservative viewpoints quite handily.  Chief among
these is the existence of "human nature."  By its very nature, evolution produces habits and instincts that
are deeply ingrained.  That which we call human nature is, in my eyes, a consequence of 4.5 billion years
of on-going evolution, and it is foolish indeed for the Left to assume they can significantly alter human
nature at all -- much less in any time period faster than geological time.<P>
