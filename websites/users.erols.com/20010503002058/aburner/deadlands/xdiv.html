Although the Texas Rangers are the folks responsible for
investigatin' all the goin's on of the Weird West (leastways
on the Confederate side o' things), the average Ranger just 
has to worry 'bout not getting herself killed while she 
defends the common folk from the evils of the Reckoning.  Only a few 
Rangers have been selected to really dig into the "why" of the 
Weird West.  These Rangers make up the X-Division.
<P>

To be a member of the X-Division, a body has to have an above
average understandin' of the Weird West.  He also needs
the ability to put two 'n two together better'n most folks,
and he needs a passel o' guts.  This is because while reg'lar
Rangers just try to kill evil varmints, the X-Division tries
to study 'em first (and then kill 'em).  While this may seem a
mite crazy to some folks, it has its rewards.  The folks in the
X-Division are the ones that discovered how to get rid of prairie
ticks and tummy twisters, f'r instance.
<P>

The X-Division also serves an experimental purpose.  See, the
Pinkertons and the Rangers both know that tellin' folks about
the truth of the Weird West can make things even worse.  Tell
a group o' concerned citizens that you just killed a headless
horseman in their town and you might start a panic.  But if
you tell it to folks just the right way, you'll have the opposite
effect.  Instead o' bein' scared that a headless horseman's been
runnin' about, they'll be right proud to have been involved in
the killin' of it.  This makes things better, not worse.  So
the X-Division has the job of spreadin' the truth in just the
right way to lift everybody's spirits and not cause a panic.
<P>

O' course, this don't make the X-Division very popular with 
the <A HREF="http://www.greatspirit.com/deadlands/pib.htm">People
In Black</A>.  The People In Black are the Pinkerton's answer to
the X-Division.  They're special Pinkerton agents trained to
investigate the "why" of the Weird West.  However, while the
X-Division believes in tellin' the truth about things, the
People In Black are even more secretive than reg'lar Rangers or
Pinkerton agents.  As a consequence, the People In Black view 
the X-Division as a bunch of loose cannons who will panic the 
citizens with Weird tales, while the X-Division views the People
In Black as a bunch of secretive spooks who inadvertently keep 
the fear levels high with their covering-up of the truth.  As 
you might expect, there's an intense rivalry between the two 
organizations.
<P>

(It should be noted that both organizations -- the X-Division and
the People In Black -- are correct.  Telling the truth <I>does</I>
help lower the "aura of fear" of a given place, but only if it's
done right.  Done incorrectly, telling the truth will actually
<I>increase</I> the "aura of fear."  The X-Division focuses on the
consequences of proper tale-tellin', while the People In Black
focus on the consequences of improper tale-tellin'.)
<P>

Oh, and one last thing...  The Rangers, while not as secretive
as the Pinkertons, are still pretty hush-hush about the Weird
West.  And a lot of the folks in charge of the Texas Rangers 
would like to see the X-Division shut down.  In fact, the only
thing that keeps the X-Division open and active is that a few
influential people (like Robert E. Lee) think the X-Division
needs to be given a chance.  This means that, not only do
X-Division agents have to fight the Pinkertons and the People in
Black to reveal the truth, they often have to fight the regular
Rangers as well.
