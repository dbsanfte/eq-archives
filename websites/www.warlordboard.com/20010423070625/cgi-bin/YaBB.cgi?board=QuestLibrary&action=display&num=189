ok,ok i know there are only 2 rogues in the guild and one of them is an alt. but i decided to post this anyways.... <br> <br> &nbsp; To begin the quest, talk with an NPC named Vilnius the Small <br>in West Karana (LOC 170, -6705). You discover that he is <br>waiting for some hired help that is late with an errand... <br> <br>You say, &quot;hail Vilnius the Small&quot; <br> <br>Vilnius the Small says, &quot;Montys, just because I am short don't mean I <br>can't bounce your Wood Elf rump all over these hills. Now, do you have <br>something for me, or are you just in search of a rump bouncing?&quot; <br> <br>You say, &quot;Why are you Vilnius the Small&quot; <br> <br>Vilnius the Small says, &quot;Vilnius, as I have told you. And yes, I am not as <br>large as most of my kin. But that is a blessing, because my brain is bigger <br>than that of an Erudite. I am a Facilitator. I.. facilitate.. jobs. You want <br>something somebody else has, I can arrange for you to have it.. even if <br>that something is their life. That is why I am here now, waiting on <br>something to turn up in my hands before I pass it on to my client. Though <br>I am a bit tired of waiting. My hired help seem to be delayed.&quot; <br> <br>You say, &quot;What delayed&quot; <br> <br>Vilnius the Small says, &quot;Yes, delayed. She has always been prompt in the <br>past, but she is several days overdue, and I know for a fact she completed <br>the job. I am beginning to wonder if something happened to her. I would <br>go check, but I run the risk of missing her if she shows up here.&quot; <br> <br>You say, &quot;I will help&quot; <br> <br>Vilnius the Small says, &quot;Oh, really? So you are willing to wade into Qeynos <br>to track Malka down, or to find out what happened to her? Willing to take <br>up the job if she failed? Willing to risk the wrath of the entire Circle of <br>Unseen Hands? Wonderful, I do so appreciate enthusiasm! Send Malka <br>back to me, or deliver the pouch she was hired to steal, either one. If that <br>works out, maybe we can do more business, I am always looking for new <br>people to help me... Facilitate.&quot; <br> <br>This leads you to Malka Rale, who can be found in the <br>Qeynos Aquaducts... <br> <br>You say, &quot;Hail Malka Rale&quot; <br> <br>Malka Rale says, &quot;Whew! I thought you were one of Hanns' goons. These <br>sewers are a mess, you never know what is going to turn up next. I really <br>wish I could get out of here.&quot; <br> <br>You say, &quot;I can help you get out of here&quot; <br> <br>Malka Rale says, &quot;Aye, Tyras, out of here. I am stuck until the heat dies <br>down. The Circle has all the exits covered, though they are not stupid <br>enough to send someone in here after me. I HOPE! In any case, I can't <br>get back out to West Karana to meet my contact, and I was paid quite a <br>lot of money to do this job. I hate having unfinished business.&quot; <br> <br>You say, &quot;I can help you do the job&quot; <br> <br>Malka Rale says, &quot;Ok! I am trusting you. Take this pouch to Vilnius in <br>West Karana. Last word I had from him, he was hanging out near one of <br>the bandit camps. Be careful, since he does not know you. Just give him <br>the pouch, and tell him I was.. delayed. While you are doing that, I will be <br>thinking of a way to get out of this slimehole. With any luck, the Circle will <br>learn the pouch is out of Qeynos, and will assume I got away. That means <br>they won't be looking for me here&quot; <br> <br>Handing the Pouch to Vilnius the Small will apparently get you <br>started on three jobs that need to be done... collecting sets <br>for his clients (NOTE: These subquests may not be needed to <br>finish the quest) <br> <br>Job 1: <br>Collect a set of 4 swords: Pain Bringer, Flesh Ripper, Mithral <br>Two-Hander, Giant Zwiehander. The reward is a Jagged <br>Diamond Dagger (9/22 lore, magic) <br> <br>After completing the first job, he has this to say.... <br> <br>&quot;Very good, though how you managed to lug around all these oversized <br>blades amazes me. I feel we can do business now, and Maltra still has not <br>shown up. Take this dagger. I had an old client who didn't, um.. pay.. so <br>this was extracted from him. Right after it was inserted in him. For your <br>next job, I need a collection of robes. The robe of the Ishva, some <br>Shining Metallic robes, an Oracle robe, and a Robe of the Kedge. I am not <br>even sure where all these come from, but they are on my list here, and <br>Rokyl is one of my best clients, so I figure that is your job.&quot; <br>(NOTE: Rokyl is apparently just part of the storyline and not a key <br>npc for the quest) <br> <br>Job 2: <br>Collect s set of 4 robes: Robe of the Kedge, Robe of the <br>Ishva, Shiny Metalic Robe, Robe of the Oracle. The reward is a <br>Cazic Dagger (8/23, Magic, Effect: Shadow Vortex, No Drop <br>Lore) <br> <br>Job 3: <br>Collect a set of 4 rapiers: Burning Rapier, Eyerazia, Martune <br>Rapier, Well Balanced Rapier. The reward is information to <br>further your quest. <br> <br>After this point it appears you must give the Pouch over to <br>another NPC named Anson McBale, who is in the smuggler's <br>camp in Highhold. This will spawn an NPC named Stanos. <br>Stanos gives you the most information on finishing this quest <br>and here is what is known so far about what he needs to be <br>done... <br> <br>Stanos wants 2 notes. The first note is found on Founy in <br>Kaladim and the second note is found on Tani N'Mak in Neriak <br>3rd Gate. You need to pick pocket these notes and your skill <br>should be over 200 before you attempt it. Returning the notes <br>to Stanos will result in him giving you a new note to take to <br>Eldreth in Lake Rathe. <br> <br>Eldrath will ask for some milk and 100 pp, when he then gives <br>you yet another note to take to Yendar Starpyre in <br>Steamfont. <br> <br>Yendar will give you another note back and ask you to fetch <br>the Book of Souls. The book spawns in the chambers of the <br>Maestro in the Plane of Hate. <br> <br>Handing the book and the note back to Yendar will spawn a <br>nasty mob named Redux, so have some friends close to help <br>you kill it. <br> <br>After this it seems there is another nasty mob to kill in <br>Kithicor. <br> <br>The key thing to note here is that apparently Stanos will give <br>you all the information you need to finish this quest, so the <br>above should get you well on your way to completing this <br>quest. <br> <br>Finally, the reward for all this is a very nice Rogue weapon <br>called RageBringer! <br>

Yendar Starpyre's been nerfed - hardcore <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>2 days of camping, and finally this morning, at 9am central time, he's up...i get everyone together (this sucks at 9 am sunday) and hand in the first note <br> <br>he gives me his tattered note and DESPAWNS....he despawns now when you give him eldreths note, so you gotta camp him a second time =( friends were upset, i was embarrassed.......sigh... anyways my lil tidbit <br> <br>-Zayahoue  <br> <br> <br> <br>Kendrik's response... (verant insider...) <br> <br>Re: Happened to me <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Well, he was always meant to despawn for a longish random period after you gave him the Eldrath note, and when Renux arrived, and if he wasn't doing so, something was amiss.  <br> <br>Those of you that asked around Steamfont and Ak'anon should note all the NPCs I gave text concerning Yendar, where they all mention he comes and goes as he pleases in one form or another.  <br> <br>The broken despawn on Eldrath, Yendar, and Stanos was corrected the day after the quest went live (Remember the multiple Stanos thing?), and was supposed to have been pushed over at the same time in the patch less than a week later.  <br> <br>If what you're saying is correct, then Steamfont hasn't been patched since September.  <br>( September 24th was the last time any Ragebringer quest NPC's were modified, I just double checked the database) <br> <br>But in any case, he is now working the way I meant him to work in the first place.

He is a rogue GM in the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; rogue guild hall. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – He will despawn at 8 p.m. and respawn a total of 5 times between then and <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 10 p.m. (This may be a bug) <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – He will NOT always spawn with the parchment piece. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Find Stanos Herkanor in Highpass Hold (in secret smugglers camp - must go <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through underwater tunnel) at location +10, +325, +45. Give him both the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;stained parchment top&quot; and the &quot;stained parchment bottom&quot; at the same time <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to receive the &quot;Combined Parchment.&quot; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – If Stanos is not in the camp then give Anson McBale &quot;Stanos' Pouch&quot; you <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; received from Malka Rale to spawn him. (Be sure to stand on the table behind <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Anson when giving him &quot;Stanos' Pouch&quot; or Stanos may not spawn - this <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; happens because you may be standing on Stanos' spawn point) <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – If Anson is not in the camp you will have to kill his smuggler placeholder. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - The smugglers are fairly high level and will require a full well rounded 50+ <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; group to kill. (although they can be killed with less, it is unsafe to do so) <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Stanos was found to have spawned after saying to Anson that &quot;I need to <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; see Stanos.&quot; He will say it better be important and Stanos will spawn if you <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; are not standing on his spawn point. NOTE: you may have to do the pouch <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; method first time though, cause you may need high faction for this. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Travel to Lake Rathetear and locate Eldreth in the island tower at location <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; +2600, -550. Hand Eldreth the &quot;Combined Parchment,&quot; 100 platinum, and 2 <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bottles (unstacked) of milk all at once to receive the &quot;Scribbled Parchment.&quot; If <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; you don't have at least indifferent faction with him, SNEAK when turning in the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; items. Eldreth will then despawn. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Eldreth is a totally rondom spawn spanning anywhere from many hours to a <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; few days (Real Life Time). <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5) Travel to the Plane of Hate to pick up the &quot;Book of Souls.&quot; Located at <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; location -60, +320, the spawn time is completly random, spanning anywhere <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from a few hours to 1+ days (this time still needs to be confirmed). The book <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spawns on the bedside night stand in the bedroom located in the top floor of <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maestro of Rancor's building. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Wandering NPC's and MOBs will pick up the book if left lying, so be quick in <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; picking it up! (this may have changed, I have recieved no confirmation on this. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6)Travel to the Steamfont Mountains and locate Yendar Starpyre (a gnome in <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; an SMR.) If he is not up, there is a rumor that he is a triggered spawn. Go into <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ak'anon and locate the Wizard guildmaster (name unknown atm) and say to <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; him/her &quot;Where is Yendar?&quot; After you recieve a reply head to the observatory <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at location -1500 -1500, he should have spawned near there. After he has <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; been located hail him to keep him from running (saying &quot;book&quot; also stops him) <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and give him the &quot;Scribbled Parchment&quot; you received from Eldreth. He in turn <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will give you another note called a &quot;Tattered Parchment.&quot; After you have <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; received the &quot;Tattered Parchment&quot; from him, give him back the &quot;Tattered <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parchment&quot; along with the &quot;Book of Souls&quot; (both these items together.) He will <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then despawn and a level 50 female human rogue named Renux Herkanor will <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spawn nearby (she quads for 200+ and wields a weapon which procs <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clockwork poison - a spinning stun spell.) Quickly engage combat or she will <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; despawn in a short period of time. After Renux has been killed, loot the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger&quot; and the &quot;Translated Parchment&quot; from her. She also <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drops an off-hand only 1HS sword called the Trochilc's Skean which procs <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; clockwork poison and 2 new pieces of Ravenscale armor. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – Yendar wanders the entire zone so have a tracker. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger&quot; can also be obtained through a side-quest <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; involving Vilinus the Small (See Side Quests.) <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; STRATEGY FOR DEFEATING RENUX <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ---------------------------------- <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Key Pointers <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Renux will NOT attack pets <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - She can be outrun with Jboots and/or SoW <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Do NOT melee her no matter what, you WILL die if you do. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - She will NOT summon <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Renux will go after the nearest PC on her agro list <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Renux can be feared and snared - but she has VERY high resists <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perferred Method (safest) note: I need her resistance info - anyone? <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; --------- <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Gather together a force of about 18 people (3 full groups) primarily composed <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of casters and pet classes, also, at least 1 res able cleric.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; gets a bit closer) <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

(If Stanos is not in the camp, see #3 <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; above.) <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; SIDE QUESTS <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------- <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These three side quests involve an NPC named Vilinus the Small. He can be <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; located in Western Karanas in the bandit camp at location +340, -6700. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Making him spawn will take some work. First, be sure all bandits are in the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; camp. You must kill and continue to kill the bandit which runs from the camp <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to the top of the hill until the &quot;brigand&quot; spawns. The &quot;brigand&quot; is an ultra-rare <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; spawn. Leave the &quot;brigand&quot; alone, and at 11 p.m. game time Vilinus the Small <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will spawn in his place. From here, there are 3 sub-quests you are able to <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; complete all of which earn you a different item. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The first sub quest will result in the &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger.&quot; Return to <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Vilinus the Small all at once a &quot;Fleshripper&quot; (from the &quot;Kobold King&quot; in Sol B), a <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Painbringer&quot; (from the &quot;Kobold Champion&quot; in Sol B), a &quot;Mithril Two-Handed <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sword&quot; (from the &quot;Froglok King&quot; in Lower Guk - live side), and a &quot;Gigantic <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Zwiehander&quot; (from &quot;Karg Icebear&quot; in Everfrost Peaks.) <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The second quest results in a &quot;Cazic Quill.&quot; Return to Vilinus the Small all at <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; once a &quot;Robe of the Kedge&quot; (from &quot;Phinigel Autropos&quot; in Kedge Keep OR the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Coercer&quot; in Kithicor Forest), a &quot;Robe of Ishva&quot; (from the &quot;Coercer&quot; in Kithicor <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Forest - and I think one other place), &quot;Shiny Metallic Robes&quot; (from the &quot;Ghoul <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Arch Magi&quot; in Lower Guk), and a &quot;Robe of the Oracle&quot; (from the Oracle in the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Ocean of Tears.) <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; – The third quest results in &quot;Stanos' Pouch.&quot; Yes, that is the same item Malka <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Rale gives you in Qeynos Aqueducts. Return to Vilinus the Small all at once a <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Burning Rapier&quot; (obtained from a quest), a &quot;Martune Rapier&quot; (from &quot;A Scorn <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Banshee&quot; in the Plane of Hate), an Eyerazzia (from &quot;A Scareling&quot; in the Plane of <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fear), and a &quot;Well Balanced Rapier&quot; (from the &quot;Shady Swashbuckler&quot; in East <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Commons.) <br> <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NOTE: Although the &quot;Side Quests&quot; yield many of the same items as the quest <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; needs, it soley cannot be done to complete the quest. Renux drops the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;Jagged Diamond Dagger,&quot; Malka Rale gives you &quot;Stanos' Pouch,&quot; and the <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; General drops the &quot;Cazic Quill,&quot; although the Quill is VERY rare and will most <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; likely have to be obtained though the side quest with the midgit.
