<tr><td><font size="-1"><strong><font color="#FFFFFF">So Long And Thanks For All The Fish!</font> </strong><small>Posted Thursday, November 14, 2002 by <a href="mailto:drupie@huntri.com">Drupie</a></small></font></tr></td><tr><td><font size="-1"><small>Hiyas all<br><br>This is about to be the hardest post I will ever have to make on these or any other boards, so bear with me. I'm here today to announce that as from 11pm EST Wednesday 11th December 2002 the Amici Loci Antiqui will cease to be as a guild.<br><br>You may have already heard rumours as we have been discussing for awhile now what is the best for the  guild. Believe me when I say that, this isn't easy for any of us and although,(with the exception of Myrrhia who we haven't seen) the whole of the council is in favour, the decision is ultimately down to me. So if you need to blame somebody or vent your anger, please direct it at me and not the others.<br><br>Amici was starting to get 'old' in the sense we had the core of people reach their 50's and then start to look around at what was available. Some like Caenn, Deak, Brak, Ozmo, Nova, Aber, Rekiz and others including myself chose to stick around, whilst others decided that they wanted to see if EQ could give them more than a friendly, happy family like Amici. I don't begrudge them wanting it, and I would suggest it was selfish of anyone to try and stop them looking.<br><br>What it does mean is that we are slowly loosing members faster than we recruit them and there will come a time when this guild would  simply fade away. Maybe some of you would want that? Equally we could  go into overdrive and recruit all and sundry into our guild. This may have resulted in a similar situation in why the older members formed Amici in the first place and a risk that as your GL I am not will to take.<br><br>We didn't want Amici to go out with a wimper but with a bang. So that we can all meet, get drunk, laugh and cry about the old times, get even drunker, and say 'goodbye' a party will be held in West Commons, near the lake and the wizard spire starting at 9pm EST on Wednesday 11th December 2002. It is open to all current and ex-members of Amici Loci Antiqui, and I would encourage you all to pass the word to anyone who may not be reading this board. People say they care about the guild, in that case please try and make every effort to attend.<br><br>The reason it is set for 4 weeks time is, firstly I am aware that many of you will be celebrating Thanksgiving and that is a time for you to be with your family, not necessarily in EQ. Secondly Tuurrd/Bungus is on his honeymoon and I want him to be able to attend. Thirdly I want people to have as much notice as possible. Finally and most importantly, this is YOUR guild, you are not bound by what I or your council say and if you all want to elect a new Guild Leader and continue, then that is your right. I have given anyone long enough to make arrangements and I would not prevent anyone from trying to do so.<br><br>Although I am not planning on joining another guild soon and will keep in touch with my friends there maybe some of you whom are? If that is the case then by all means, if you need to give a refrence from ALA, give my name. You all deserve the highest recommendation and will get it.<br><br>The guild bank and vault has a a minimum amount in and it is suggested that it  goes back to the person(s) who made the deposits. <br><br>Last but not least, it has been suggested that we have a chat channel so that we can keep in touch after the guild disbands. How about typing in /autojoin amici:amici?<br><br>Thank you all for being great people and the best guildies anyone could ever wish for.<br><br><br>Arminda</small></font><P></tr></td>

<img src="http://www.warlordboard.com/tab.gif" height=1 width=25 alt="">On Sunday, September 2, 2001 a group met in the Greater Faydark to discuss the formation of a new guild.  Leaders were chosen, standards decided, a name devised, and a charter written; the guild was then submitted to the gods for approval.<P>

<img src="http://www.warlordboard.com/tab.gif" height=1 width=25 alt="">Three days later, the gods of Norrath smiled...<P>
