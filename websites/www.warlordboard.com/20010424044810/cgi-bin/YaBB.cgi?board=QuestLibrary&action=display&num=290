royals are part of cleric, warrior, enchanter and necro epic weapon quests.... <br> <br>Chardok Strategies <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>The majority of my guild really enjoy this (albeit buggy) area, but we can't seem to get to the inner keep without running into a major mishap along the way and getting wiped out. <br> <br>While I attribute some of it to some players with malfunctions, they're no longer with us. But I'd like to know what other battleplans people use that work, just so we have a guide in what to do (and to see what we're doing wrong). <br> <br>Personally, I think it's that we don't move fast enough, because we do tend to have a camp-and-pull routine for a while, then when we move further in, it's a big production and we get spawned on. <br> <br>Regardless, I'd like to know what works for you guys out there <img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/smiley.gif>  <br>Tabbran Kythrandraal <br>Martyr of Tunare <br>Cultist of The Red Dragon (Innoruuk)  <br>I don't have enough middle fingers! <br> <br>Edited by: Tabbran &nbsp; at: 11/6/00 12:45:43 am <br> <br>  <br>Delph &nbsp; <br>Registered User <br>(11/6/00 12:42:55 pm) <br> <br> Re: Chardok Strategies <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>i think that's the biggest thing, gotta move fast. The mobs are not that hard, but they respawn FAST.  <br> <br>I am thinking that the keep is the castle, so I'll say what I know about that. The one thing I like about the Keep is that once we got here I didn't see another chokidai mangler for the rest of the trip down to the King. That means NOTHING sees us, we're free to scout, roam, wander, whatever. What worked for us was having the monk pull as few mobs as fast as possible. once you go into the Keep there's a hall going left to right behind the door. there are spawns to the left and right. snag those. Then there are 2 more to the left and right of the stairs, snag those. Then is the big battle royale, about 6 or 7 in the main room. This is where the rogue has gotta keep an eye peeled. A roamer will stop in the back hall for a bit, and then wander back. If you pull while this roamer is there he'll bring maybe 2 or 3 more guards. Doesn't help when clearing a room of 6. our best luck was pulling all of this outside the keep, because if you fightit inside you'll have to deal with the roamer and his friends when he comes. <br> <br>After the keep, get through that large room as fast as possible. The halls behind here make a square. If you didn't aggro them there will be 2 statics in this hall, and maybe a roamer as well. The locked door in the far side of the square is the prince's room. I suggest when entering this loop hang a left. Each corner of this square opens into a larger square with about 3 spawns each, ... each corner but the far left one. THis is where you should aim to get to. We went right the one time I got this far, and if we didn't have the BEST ENCHANTERS ON EARTH in my guild we woulda been toast. somehow they got a corner of spawns and 4 adds mez'd. <br> <br>If you make it this far you'll have no problem getting to the king/queen. Just be forewarned. After you pick the other locked door in the loop (the one not to prince) you will go down a long hall leading to 2 statics by a door. After all this is cleared, you'll go through a room that looks like a library of sorts, down a large staircase to another locked door. After this locked door, HUG THE LEFT WALL. There is a hidden drop in the floor near the right side that will drop you into the king's room, then that's all she wrote. My first time in chardok this is where it all ended. Someone fell in the hole, King shot off a AoE, pets went berserk, and there went the party. That reminds me, kill all pets while going throug here as well <img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/smiley.gif> <br> <br>So clear out the first room of the keep, then shoot for that back left corner. Clear out the statics in the hall, then wack the prince. Now you're well in the keep, good luck <img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/smiley.gif> Chardok is a fun fun place, I felt VERY useful here, especially in the castle since from here on nothing could see hide/sneak, not even the royal sarnaks. Just stay clear when the monk pulls the royals, they shoot off AEs, it'll kill your hide and you'll die real quick like.  <br> <br> <br> <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Delph F'Elon, Backstabbing, Tomb Raiding, Swill Gulping Drow. -Inner Fire- <br>  <br>Gnix <br>Registered User <br>(11/7/00 8:35:44 pm) <br> Re: Chardok Strategies <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Sorry I just have to post regarding...it's a pet peeve of mine when people say that there is a REALLY FAST respawn when there isn't. Fact is, all of the non-named mobs in Chardok that I have personally observed, which is all of them in the upper and royal area, all spawn on a 23-25 or so minute timer. That is...when a_sarnak_royal_guard_15 is killed, 23-25 minutes later a_sarnak_royal_guard_15 will respawn. There is a PERCEPTION that they spawn quickly because there are just so many of them to kill and they have a ton of hit points. <br> <br>People used to say the same thing about the efreet...that there was some crazy 10 minute spawn time or something. Imps and Lava guardians however are on the same 24 minute death timer as the rest of the zone barring FGs and naggy. Chardok is no different. <br> <br>Gnix Gnimblestan <br>56 Rogue <br>Lotus Cult, Quellious  <br> <br>  <br>Qalar Rubican &nbsp; <br>Registered User <br>(11/8/00 2:10:21 am) <br> Re: Chardok Strategies <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Bring 3-4 good enchanter and you can plow this zone.  <br> <br>We have an SK pull for us, and he pulls 1-10 mobs at a time. Great fun, lots of damage, lots of crowd control, lots of lewts. <br> <br>I think our personal best is around 23 mobs in one pull near king area. Had a mob port when you push them through the walls end up in prince area and brought back...ALOT of friends. The other enchanters and I had ~20 mezzed mobs infront of us with everyone's jaw on the floor. We closed the main warriors jaw and said, &quot;umm, attack something please.&quot; hehe.

But here are a few tips I consider useful. <br> <br>1. Dont have 30+ people move down together - the halls are too buggy imho. Instead have 2 groups move quickly to the front of the castle and CoH the rest down. <br> <br>2. Once in the safehall - CoH some twink with revive (cleric/pally) down and have that twink camp out. Have a cleric get killed (not duel) to leave a corpse - and make sure one of your rogues dont engage if you get a train (or have a low level rogue camped out in safehall). That way, should you encounter a wipeout its painless to recover. I know a rogue with a rez staff works too - but those are probably limited for most people. <br> <br>3. Dont bother getting the King alone. We rushed his room when he had 4 guards left and only lost 3 people from a 30 person raid avg level around 55. <br> <br>Mikar  <br>Templar of Brell  <br>The Companions <br>The Tribunal &nbsp; <br>

Citra <br>Newbie Poster  <br>Posts: 21 <br>Registered: Oct 2000  <br> &nbsp;posted November 13, 2000 11:38 AM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>A while back some low level enchanters brought up a tactic I had tried before and found to be effective yet a bit to risky. <br>I had to come back and say that was because I had not been a high level in kunark dungeons at that point. <br> <br>Now that I have some chardok experience under my belt I have to say it is a viable strategy in some areas. Not only viable but perhaps the optimal strategy. <br> <br>Reason? <br>1. Really fast repops <br>2. Large pulls <br>3. Multi-group raids <br> <br>I'll explain in regards to my King raid's (2 by my guild, one with another...all failures) <br> <br>Attempt #1 - We get to the area before king that has seemingly endless number of mobs and get stuck constantly pulling until we get fed up and try and rush in (at which point like 8+ caster mobs run out and catch us by surprise because they repopped already) End of attempt 1 ;-( <br> <br>Attempt #2 - Joined a Pravus Dei raid to get some king raid experience to take back to my guild. The enchanter's know of the huge pulls and we decide to AE facinate them. Fights last a bit...we get it all cleared but we got bogged down a bit in a couple lovations and it slowed us down. Pulled the king, he had like 5 friends, he started off by blinding me...I woke up at my bind point. Thier raid failed. End of Attempt #2 ;-( <br> <br>Attempt #3 - We decide (after some practice in safer locations) AE might be the way to go. We have 2 enchanters a 56 and 57. I'm the 56. I cast AE tash and then we both chain stun the 44 and 52 stuns while all the wizards, mages, druids, and yes even some AE action by the clerics.... We cleared to the library MUCH faster and with WAY LESS DEATHS. Buffing in the library when a pet runs off and brings some 10+ sarnaks unexpectedly, I think it included the king. End of attempt #3 ;-(. <br> <br>Notes on high level AE: <br>1. MUST have 2 enchanters chain stunning. AE tash is a huge plus. Enchanters must be fairly high level (high enough to stick AE stun 90% on the mobs you fight, level 52 if you want to stun very well) <br>2. You need mages and wizards. Preferably 3 of each in the raid. <br>3. Clerics can AE but if they do shaman and paladins have to heal the enchanters. <br>4. You must keep them clustered. <br>5. AoE target hits 4 targets. Point blank AoE hits unlimited targets. Use PB if available on pulls 4+. <br> <br>Now here is my question....once you leave the library through the secret door and start preparing in the hall. Can you summon pets there? Or will they run off? Any suggested pulling techniques...we keep getting too many mobs on the king pull. <br> <br>IP: Logged <br>  <br>Jamal <br>unregistered &nbsp; posted November 13, 2000 12:20 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>AoE is definately the way to go, but not on the king pull. AoE damage spells wont really hit him (unless your level 60? dunno, but the one time we tried it AE'ing his pull he aggroed and killed the mage/wizzards...and they later said he had resisted everything). The trick is to get him alone, or close to alone. <br>CoH is a wonderfull spell for that. <br> <br>Pets are EVIL in chardok =). And this is coming from an enchanter who generally likes to let mages/necros use their uber-pets...but not here. Seen the pets wander off from the herbalist room and aggro the king + everything else too many times. So, we go with no pets, pet classes keep the spell memed to cast one if alot of tanks go down (which never really happens...pets are _very_ rarely needed in big group events). <br> <br>Now as for the queen....dunno. Never seen her die, but seen her kill a few pullers and a couple of Jamals. <br> <br>IP: Logged <br>  <br>aeryl <br>Newbie Poster  <br>Posts: 19 <br>Registered: Oct 2000  <br> &nbsp;posted November 13, 2000 12:25 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Actually it's not that hard to single mez everything otw to the king, but you know you can just invis everyone and run to the &quot;safe hall&quot; area. <br>Only the dogs see invis in chardok, and possibly the king/queen/prince. <br> <br>IP: Logged <br>  <br>Citra <br>Newbie Poster  <br>Posts: 21 <br>Registered: Oct 2000  <br> &nbsp;posted November 13, 2000 01:12 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>We have a few 'purists' in the guild who tend to dislike skipping to the uber-mob. <br>For example when CoH was discussed for a fear break. It was veto'd. <br> <br>I think they will allow for CoH on the king pull though. <br> <br>How were you doing this? Our tank on the pull was like a 54 warrior and while I was not in his group..he died fast from what I heard. However he fell in the trap so maybe that was bad <img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/wink.gif> <br> <br>I assume your using a puller and CoH him then send him back and slowly seperate them? Were you using a monk or warrior for the pull? We have a 58 war and a 60 monk. The 58 war was not there that day. <br> <br>Do you FD pull? There were so many casters I assumed it was not possible. <br> <br>BTW we didn't try AoE on the king pull. I got off AoE tash. I was about to cast facinate....but I don't believe anyone planned to AE the king pull. <br> <br>As far as single mezzing to the king. Yeah, we can do it....just taking the mobs one at a time takes so long we end up with re-pops. <br> <br>BTW the cool thing about AE death fests are 54 mobs make no difference because we aren't using mez <img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/wink.gif> Not sure if we saw any 54+ mobs or not that day hehe. <br> <br>IP: Logged <br>  <br>Jamal <br>unregistered &nbsp; posted November 13, 2000 03:05 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>We just used a 60 warrior to pull with CoH. If you have hero, you dont need feign ;P. As far as how they actually DO it, I cant really help you too much...but it seems to be a run in and aggro, call, run in and aggro, call, etc etc till you get them spread out enough to pull away from king. <br>There is nothing in the area you cant dazzle, save the king, prince and queen. Everything else is 54 (maybee 55...not sure) or below. But, it is just SO much easier to deal with the respawns this way. I dont particularly enjoy AE fests (just not as much fun for me to hit 3 stun hotkeys as it is to singly mez things and charm...but im a control freak), if you have multiple wizzards and mages it is definately the quickest way to do things. <br> <br>And yeah, I guess we use a cheezy way to get in. Send a rogue, enchanter and mage to the safe hall invis, then the enchanter gates out to invite for summoning. Just a helluva lot quicker this way (not to mention less aggrivating...moving 4-5 groups around in a dungeon is the most aggrivating thing in the world). When you consider people taking wrong turns, falling off a bridge, killing all the spawns and everything else that goes along with moving there...you can really save hours on the raid. EQ has too darn many timesinks already..I try to skip as many of them as possible. <br> <br>IP: Logged <br>  <br>Trippen <br>Newbie Poster  <br>Posts: 26 <br>Registered: Oct 2000  <br> &nbsp;posted November 14, 2000 03:22 PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>King is L60+, so doing AE for his pull wouldn't be wise, as he'd go straight for the casters. <br>I'd suggest taking a few more Wizards if you're having problems with respawn. We have yet to AE through the Di`zoks, yet I don't think we've ever had a problem with respawn while trying to move around. <br> <br>And when you fall in the trap, you fall on the Kings head, so yea it's pretty bad.  <br> <br>------------------ <br>Trippen <br>Phantasmist, Terris-Thule <br>  <br>
