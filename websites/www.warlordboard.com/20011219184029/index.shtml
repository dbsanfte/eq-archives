<tr><td><font size="-1"><small>*** Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers ***<br><br>IMPORTANT: do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and download the rest of the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will not impact our other customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have your CD to do so.<br><br>TECH SUPPORT: Please visit our Tech Support Center at everquest.station.sony.co.../index.jsp if you have any problems with your Luclin installation.<br><br>/facepick - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of Luclin to change your characters face. It will only work for characters using the new models. If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is a Gnome, you will not be able to use this command on that character. And it will, obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin installed.<br><br>/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle. There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a horse.<br><br><br>*** Other Changes with this Patch ***<br><br>Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, we have made a few other changes with this patch:<br><br><br>** Gameplay Changes **<br><br>- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom scores, as well as that granted by items and spells.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a thrown weapon.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly after leveling. This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when in F10 view.<br><br><br>** PvP Changes **<br><br>- PVP looting will now display to the group.<br><br>- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses.<br><br>- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a fight. They will only come to the aid of people that they like. Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat.<br><br><br>** Item Changes **<br><br>- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, including those held by players on their characters or in their banks. This item was not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went live, and then only in Luclin zones.<br><br><br>** Spell Changes **<br><br>- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a message to the player.<br><br>- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) are no longer required to teleport to those locations. These items are also no longer soul bound.<br><br>- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion<br><br><br>** New Commands **<br><br>- /stand now implemented. We've added this command because not everyone speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit would be /sit off. <br><br>- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly without having to click it in the menus and exit the game.<br><br><br>** Some new things you'll see **<br><br>- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable. This in effect renders the NPC non-attackable as well. Clicking on one of these NPCs will cause your current target selection to clear. This functionality is used primarily for the presentation of content. For instance, if we want an NPC to spawn and tell you a story, he can tell his story without being attacked mid-sentance by other players. It also opens up some pretty interesting content avenues. As an example, we can make NPCs unharmable until you do a quest "stripping them of their power". <br><br>- There are several new item classes (types) in the world. For example, there are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. Perhaps you'll find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club. In addition we can do the same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed). We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. a +4 Fire sword). The bonus value is calculated as and increased DMG stat on the weapon, except that the elemental portion is run through the resistance system before calculating the strength of your hit. There are some items out there with bonuses to some more interesting stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out <br><br>- There's a lot more out there. Be prepared to reevaluate your assumptions and redefine the way you approach the world. Proposed solutions to situations and quests that you might have previously written off saying, "They can't do that in EverQuest", might be exactly the way you need to approach the problem at hand. As fellow gamers, we envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and waiting to be solved. And to those of you who aren't first to solve the quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you to do so with your friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it. Good luck on your journies.<br><br><br>** Note on New Features **<br><br>EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin contains many new features which have yet to stand up to the scrutiny of 400,000 experienced players. Without doubt there will be some situations where we need to reevaluate the gameplay-impact of some of those features and adjust them accordingly to maintain game integrity. As an example, we think that they might accelerate and decelerate too quickly, but will have to wait until we see them used by a broad spectrum of players before we can make a final determination. We thank you for your patience in these matters.<br><br>** Note on Impending Features **<br><br>As we approached our launch date we found that several features which are planned are also not yet ready for prime-time. We're currently working on the following items, many of which will be implemented in the very near future:<br><br>- Extra flora in outdoor zones. Sprigs of grass, small bushes, flowers, etc.<br><br>- A robuste merchantile system in the bazaar that lets you flag yourself as a merchant, set prices, and conduct business without having to conduct business manually with each buyer and seller.<br><br>- We will be polishing up issues regarding tinted items in game. In other words, things that shouldn't tint with a tinted item (e.g. your skin) won't tint when the feature is complete.<br><br>- Light beards on high elves, dark elves, half elves, and dwarf females will be tintable along with the hair color. We are going to leave in the ability for you to change your appearance until after we've added more customization options.<br><br><br>We thank you for your patience and patronage as we implement these features. Good luck with your adventures on Luclin!<br><br>- The EverQuest Team<br></small></font><P></tr></td>
