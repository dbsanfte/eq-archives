Ok, looks like we now have all the details for this quest. Here they are: <br> <br>Druid Epic Quest Walkthrough  <br> <br>The Start  <br> <br>- Telin Darkforest in Burning Woods: ask &quot;what action&quot; and you will get a note. if not, then your faction is too low. Faction can be built up fast by doing the muffin-quest in Freeport  <br> <br>- Faelin Bloodbriar in Greater Faydark: give her the note and you receive a ring. Faelin roams the northern part of the zone near Crushbone. She is a rare spawn and can have orcs as placeholders. After giving her the note she depops.  <br> <br>- Giz X'Tin Kithikor: give him the ring, get a dark metal coin. Giz roams along the path. After u hand him the ring a lvl 50 Darkelf Reaver spawns and attacks but u can run away with SoW.  <br> <br>- Go back to Telin Darkforest and give him the Coin. He will give it back to you as worn metal coin. He tells you to find Athele.  <br> <br>- Athele in East Karanas: give her the Coin and receive a worn amulet. give this amulet to Sionae, then to Nuien and finaly to Teloa. The last step is the trigger for the Dark Elf Corruptor and two Darkwlf Reavers (all about lvl 50) to spawn.  <br> <br>- Find the Corruptor and kill him fast. He will depop after 10 seconds if not attacked. The 2 Reavers will head to the 4 Druids and kill them. You dont need to kill the Reavers. Just kill the corruptor and loot the tome. If the Druids die, never mind....Athele spawns again in about 1 hour. Give Athele the tome and get an earthstained Note. Bring this to &quot;she who walks the land in service blabla...&quot;.  <br> <br>- Ella Foodcrafter in Misty Thicket is this wanted women that wanders the zone. Give her the earthstained note and she will tell you that she needs a mixture. She will give you her mixing bowl. It is a Container so you need a free slot in the Inventory. She also mentions some kind of ancient bowl that she needs.  <br> <br>The Hardened Mixture  <br> <br>- You must forage 4 items that you have to combine in Ella's mixing bowl.  <br> <br>- Frozen Tundra Root from Everfrost Peaks  <br> <br>- Sweetened Mudroots from Misty Thicket  <br> <br>- Speckled Mushrooms from Innothule Swamp  <br> <br>- Heartfruit from Greater Faydark  <br> <br>- This can take several hours. Combine those 4 items in the bowl and you get a Hardened -Mixture.  <br> <br>The Runed Bowl  <br> <br>- Go to the Chess Island (succor will take you there when you have enterd the zone) in Timorous Deep and ask Alrik Farsight &quot;how do you make an ancient bowl?&quot;. He gives you a crushed pot and sends you to Felwithe.  <br> <br>- Talk to Farios Elianos in Felwithe south. If he dont respond to you then your faction with Keepers of the Art is too low. You can build up faction fast with the batwing-quest in Felwithe south. If Farios talks to you, give him the pot and you receive a grocery list. He will give you the receipt for the bowl if you do a job for him.  <br> <br>- Bring this grocery list to Merchant Nora in Felwithe north and she gives you in return a bag of Provisions. Bring it to Farios and he gives you the receipt for the ancient bowl.  <br> <br>- Head back to Alrik Farsight in Timorous Deep . He will give you an ancient pattern when you give him the receipt.  <br> <br>- The pattern says that you have to combine it with a piece of echanted clay and platinum speckled powder in a pottery wheel.  <br> <br>- Platinum speckled poweder can be obtained through another subquest. Forage a Rose of Firiona in Firiona Vie and give it to Merdan Fleetwood in Surefall Glades. The old wooden painting that you receive has to be brought to the human skeleton that roams the western part of Frontier Mountains. Head back with the silver chained locket you got from the skeleton to Surefall Galdes and give it to Niera Farbreeze. She hands you the platinum speckled pouder.  <br> <br>- Enchanted clay can be obtained through Kinlo Strongarm in Kaladim's Everhot Forge. If you ask him &quot;what mud&quot; and &quot;do it for me&quot; he will tell you that he would like to have a colored axe for his service. This is a Jade Reaver that can be found in the City of Mist. Hand him the axe and you get the enchanted clay.  <br> <br>- Now combine the pattern, clay and powder in any pottery wheel to make the Rune Crested Bowl  <br> <br>The Stones  <br> <br>- Go Back to Misty Thicket and hand Ella Foodcrafter the hardened mixture and the rune crested bowl. She will make for you a softly glowing stone from it.  <br> <br>- Ella tells you to find one such as yourself. For the Druids this means to seek out Foloal Stormforest in Firiona Vie.  <br> <br>- Ask her &quot;are you one such as myself?&quot;, &quot;what answers?&quot; and &quot;what about Venril Sathir?&quot;. She tells you to bring her the stone you already have from Ella and the gem that can be found on Venril Sathir.  <br> <br>- Kill Venril Sathir in Karnor's Castle and be lucky to loot the rare gem he drops. Venril is a very tough Necromancer that can only be beaten by very strong guilds.  <br> <br>- Give the gem and the softly glowing stone to Foloal Stromforest and get a warm pulsating stone. Now this is the time where the quest splits up into the Druid and the Rangerpart. Foloal tells you to take the stone and walk your path.  <br> <br>- The Druid's path leads back to Ealla in Misty Thicket. Give her the stone and you will get a scimitar....now you have one of the four final pieces. She asks you to collect the Cleansed Spirits of Antonica, Faydwer and Kunark and hand them along with the scimitar to Xanuusus.  <br> <br> <br>The Cleansed Spirits  <br> <br>The Cleansed Spirit of Antonica  <br> <br>- The withered treant in North Karana tells you to find the corruption in the land. He means the Corrupted Mammoth in Everfrost Peaks, the Corrupted Aquagoblin Shaman in Lake Rathe and the Corrupted Hill Giant in Rathe Mountains.  <br> <br>- Give the 3 items looted from them to the treant to receive the treant heart. Go to Yeka Ias in South Karanas and give him the heart. He will give you the Cleansed Spirit of Antonica.  <br> <br>The Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer  <br> <br>- You will meet a pained Unicorn in lesser Faydark. Collect for him the items looted from the Corrupted Seahorse in Kedge Keep, the Corrupted Cyclops in Ocean of Tears and from the Corrupted Brownie in Lesser Faydark.  <br> <br>- The Unicorn will give you a gleaming horn for the 3 items. This has to be handed to the MISSING PRIEST (should be fixed with the megapatch) to get the Cleansed Spirit of Faydwer.  <br> <br>The Cleansed Spirit of Kunark  <br> <br>- Ulump Pujik, a named Froglok in Swamp of no Hope tells you to give his own essence along with the 3 corrupted things to the gnome that hurts the land. Kill Ulump and loot his Essence. Ulump is a warrior that doubles for 250 and he has 32k hp.  <br> <br>- The 3 corrupted mobs of Kunark are the Corrupted Gorilla in Emerald Jungle, the Corrupted Barracuda in Lake of ill Omen and the Dragon Faydedar that lives in the sea in Timorous Deep.  <br> <br>- Hand the 4 items to the Gnome Nekexin Virulence in overthere to get the Cleansed Spirit of Kunark.  <br> <br>The End  <br> <br>- Hand the 3 Cleansed Spirits and the scimitar to Xanuusus the treant in North Karanas to receive the Druid Epic Weapon. &nbsp; <br>Reward(s):  <br>Nature Walker's Scimitar  <br>
