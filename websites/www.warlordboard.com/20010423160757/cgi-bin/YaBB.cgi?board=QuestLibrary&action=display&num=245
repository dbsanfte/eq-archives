I will be posting Ranger quest spoilers here for any of the rangers to use as guides. I will be updating it fairly often so check in every now and then for new quest info. Thx  <br> <br>Falastur <br> <br> <br>Ranger Quest Armor: <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>(For any details on the info posted please state the item and zone and i will expand the genral info to exact info for u) <br> <br>Gandari and Leaf Falldim are both in huts in Kithicor Forest.  Location approx. 1500 by 2500. Theses quests are for the Ivy-Etched(RNG-only) armor. Here are the quests accordingly: <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Helm: Quest given by Gandari. <br> <br>1- Top of the Rune of Ivy from a Deathly Ushers in Mistmoore <br>2- Cyclops Charm from Tarskuk in Rathe Mountains <br>3- 1 Sapphire <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Tunic: Quest given by Gandari. <br> <br>1- Skull of Meldrath from Steamfont Mountains <br>2- Right Part of the Rune of Ivy from the Thistle Brownie in Lesser Faydark <br>3) 2 Rubies <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Sleeves: Quest giben by Gandari. <br> <br>1- Heart of Fire from an Inferno Goblin in Solusek A <br>2- Left Part of the Rune of Ivy from Grimfeather, a rare spawn named griffon in North Karana <br>3- 2 Star Rubies <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Bracer: Quest given by Gandari. <br> <br>1- Bottom of the Rune of Ivy from Redwind, a named Icy Orc Shadow Knight in Everfrost near the Permafrost entrance, he is up on a pedestal guarded by about 4 surrounding orcs, approx lvl's of each are in the 25-28 range. <br>2- A Watery Ring from Aqua Goblin Tidal Lords in Dagnor's Cauldron. <br>3- 1 Fire Emerald <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Gauntlets: Quest given by Leaf Falldim. <br> <br>1- Kill Maldyn Greenburn, a master archer in Rathe Mountains by the Hill Giant spawns and retreive Part A of Morin's Bow of Kithicor. The bow is supposedly very powerful so killing the NPC may be tough. <br>2- Kill Slaythe the Slayer, a rare spawn froglok in the Live Side of Lower Guk. He spawns near the Mino Patriarch/Jail area. He will have Part B of Morin's Bow of Kithicor. <br>3- Hand both Part A and Part B simultaneously to Leaf Falldim to receive the Gauntlets. <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Boots: Quest given by Leaf Falldim. <br> <br>1- Ronium, directions to on how to make Ronium here. <br>2- Mistmoore Granite from Leering and Jeering Gargoyles inside Mistmoore Castle <br>3- 2000 GP <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Ivy Etched Leggings: Quest given by Leaf Falldim. <br> <br>1- Quiver of Kithicor <br>- Collect 6 named arrows by killing Outcast Brownies in Lesser Faydark near the Faerie Camp, their placeholders are supposedly the wandering PixieTricksters and Pranksters. Arrows are: <br>Acknowledgement  <br>Recognition  <br>Gallantry  <br>Fortitude  <br>Defiance  <br>Bravery  <br>-Kill Wiltin Windwalker the Thief, a lvl 33 Wood Elf Rogue rare spawn on Seafury Isle in OOT (first stop coming from Freeport on the ship). His place-holder is &quot;a buccaneer.&quot; The spawn time for the buccaneer spot is approx. 90 minutes. When you kill Wiltin, he will have the Quiver in which you have to put all 6 arrows into, then hit Combine and you will have &quot;the Quiver of Kithicor.&quot; <br> <br>2- Star of Odus, purchased in Erudin. <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Orc Impaler: <br> <br>This initiates with Morin in Kithicor after you do the short sword of Morin quest, but most of the quest takes place in Lesser Faydark. Tell Bryn (wood elf camp in LFay) that &quot;Morin sent me&quot; and he'll tell you that the shadowmen are invading and need to be stopped. He sends you to kill the Shadowman Leader who spawns along the north wall in Lesser Faydark around 1800, -400. He's high 30's and has a 25 min placeholder, so it may be a long camp. Kill him and he sometimes drops a book, which you need to return to Bryn. When you give him the book, Glidara Myllar spawns by the undead marker. Bryn tells you to give her a note. Give her the note and she gives you a ring (+5 magic save) to return to her along with a Ghoul Boss codebook. The Ghoul Boss is a rare spawn at the Undead Marker in the place of a Skeleton (despite being called a ghoul, he looks like a skeleton and needs to be targetted to find out who he is). He's mid 30's. Kill him and he drops the book. Return the book and ring to Gilindar and she gives you a note to take back to Morin, in Kithicor. Give to him and he gives you a note to take back to Bryn. Give this last note to Bryn and you get their finest weaponry: The Orc Impaler.  <br> <br>A shortcut to do this is to kill the ghoul boss first, then go after the Shadowman Leader. Then turn in the Leader's Code Book to Bryn, get the ring from Glidara Myllar, and promptly return it with the Ghoul Boss's Logbook.  <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Trueshot Longbow: <br> <br>This results in a trueshot longbow. You will need a pretty decent bowyering skill for this. Start the quest by talking to Maesyn Trueshot in the ranger's guild.  <br> <br>You need four items to complete the quest.  <br> <br>(1) Spiderling silk from Spiderlings.  <br> <br>(2) A Micro Servo, which can be gotten off rogue Clockworks and runaway clockworks in Steamfont. These are no drop items.  <br> <br>(3) Some Dwarven wire, which has a side quest. You must give Tratnor Everhot in Kaladim some tumpy tonics. You can buy these from any brewer, or do the Tumpy Tonic Quest as follows. Retrieve a kiola nut and a flask of water for Tumpy Irontoe in Kaladim (so that he can make the tonics). The kiola nut is on an island in the Ocean of Tears, and a flask of water...well you can get that anywhere. Give these to Tumpy Irontoe and he makes the tonics. You give those to the dwarf Tratnor Everhot, who walks around the everhot forge and the mines, and he gives you the dwarven wire. Do this twice, because you will need two dwarven wires.  <br> <br>(4) Lastly, you need treant wood. You must travel to Freeport and give Jyle Windshots (note the Jyle you want is in West Freeport - be wary of imposters) a small lantern or, possibly if you are a Ranger, your guild tunic and he will give you some treant wood.  <br> <br>Combine these and give them to the Maesyn. He will give you a Treantwood Bowstave. If you ask him, he will reveal how you can use this to assemble a trueshot longbow.  <br> <br>In addition to the Bowstave, you need a Plane, a Microservo and some Dwarven Wire. You can use these ingredients to assemble a trueshot longbow if you have the bowyer skill.  <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Call of Flames quest spell: <br> <br>Call of Flame is a Level 49 spell, however you need to be level 50 in order for a key NPC to speak to you. <br> <br>The spell itself is given as a reward by an NPC in East Karana, Ganelorn Oast. He roams but is usually around location -3500, -1750.   The quest is broken into two parts: <br> <br>Part 1: Collect the first four items and give them to Ganelorn Oast. <br>Part 2: When you give them to Ganelorn, an NPC, Vance bearstalker will spawn nearby. Give his head to Ganelorn.  <br> <br>Part 1  <br> <br>You need to collect four items: <br> <br>A Gift  <br>An Electrum Bladed Wakizashe  <br>A Burnt Sash  <br>Adamantite Band  <br> <br>The Gift <br>The gift in itself is a smaller quest, which has positive ranger factions (Faydarks Champions).  <br> <br>First travel to Kelethin.  In a little hut that is up the ramp from the bank you will find Devin and Lily Ashwood.  You need to be at least level 50 for them to talk to you about the quest, so start by saying to Devin, &quot;I want to learn from him, and prove myself as a forester&quot;. When you say this, Lily will say something else about Ganelorn Oast and ask you to take a love letter to him, so reply &quot;yes I will take the letter&quot;. <br> <br>Take the letter to Ganelorn and he will ask you to take some rare snake eggs to a man named Kithicor, the ranger who lives in Kithicor Forest (about loc -500, 2000). Once you've given him the eggs he'll give you an Icon of Acheivement, which you need to take back to Ganelorn in East Karana. After you give him the icon he'll give you a note of credit and ask you to get for him a gift from Aanina Rockfinder in Kaladim, for Lily. <br> <br>Aanina Rockfinder lives on the upper level of Everhot Forge, in Kaladim B (North). Give her the note of credit and she'll give you the gift (this works even when apprehensive). <br> <br>Electrum Bladed Wakizashi <br>This is also another quest, based entirely in Mistmore.  The story behind this is that Maid Issis and Butler Sincladd are the Avenging Catliff's parents who are captive, he wants to kill them to free their souls.  If you help him do this he will reward you with the EBW.  <br>So to aid in this quest you need to get the fangs from both Maid Issis and Butler Sincall.  They are both rare drops (however they are tradeable). Once you have both Fangs, take them to the Avenging Catliff, he spawns on the ramp thats behind two secret walls (one is in the graveyard, the second is to the right in the room with the doors that open onto those nasty dark elf females in steel plate). He is quite a rare spawn and is usually camped, you may need to arrange with the camp group/camper to finish the quest before he is killed.  <br> <br>Give both fangs (Maid Issis fang, Butler Syncalls fang) to the Avenging Catliff and you will be rewarded with the EBW.  <br> <br>A Burnt Sash <br>These are dropped by Imp Protectors in Solusek B. They are a very common drop (you'll only need to kill one or two), but the imps themselves hit quite hard and have lots of HP. The best way to get one is to sit in the death beetle room with a group (you'll need an enchanter and a cleric), or go on an Efreeti raid.  <br>Adamantite Band <br>This is the rare drop from the hand in Lower Guk. If you get in a arch-magi group (who usually take the hand also) and if you're there for anything over a couple of hours, you'll most likely get one.  <br> <br>Part 2 <br> <br>Once you hand in the items to Ganelorn, an NPC, Vance Bearstalker, will spawn nearby (he'll be at the top of your track list). You will need a group as he is level 53, but he isn't really that hard (take pet casters and a healer). <br> <br>Once you've killed him, cut off his head (titled &quot;a poachers head&quot<img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/wink.gif> and give that to Ganelorn. He'll then hand you the Call of Flame scroll. <br>-------------------------------------------------- <br>Rain Caller Bow quest: <br> <br>Hail Kinool Goldsinger in the Enchanters' Guild of Felwithe and ask him &quot;Where can I get an Enchanted Trueshot Bow?&quot; You need several items.  <br> <br>1) Faerie Dust. You need to talk to Princess Joleena of the fairies(she's in Lesser Faydark in the center of the Fairy Camp near a Gnome Clockwork) about this. Asking her about it reveals that one of her wings was stolen by a bald person who smelled of rust and refuse. She asks you to bring her wing back and she'll give you the Fairy Dust. In Ak'Anon across from the Necro Guild there is a Gnome named Sanfyrd Featherhead. If you ask him where Princess Joleena's wing is, he will tell you that you can't have it because he read that it will make his hair grow back. He also mentions that he has no [friends]. Befriend him by saying, &quot;I'm your friend&quot; at which point he exclaims that you are &quot;just saying that to get my feather, if you are really my friend you would help me get some hair tonic.&quot; Converse with him further and he will give you a 10 slot crate to fill with hair tonics. Then go to West Freeport and visit a Gnome Merchant in a tent outside the West Gate by the name of Ping Fuzzlecutter. Ping sells the tonics you need, so just buy ten and combine them(they are not called hair tonics, there is some other wierd name for the tonics). Take the new box(no longer a container) back to Sanfyrd Featherhead and he will ask one more favor beforegiving you the wing. He will give you his tattered toupee' and ask that you get it fixed by the same man who sold him the tonic. So once again go to West Freeport to talk to Ping Fuzzlecutter again. You need to ask Ping, &quot;can you repair a toupee?&quot;(you must say &quot;repair&quot; rather than fix or he won't respond). Ping will go into the history of his wig, &quot;The Mane Attraction&quot; and tell you that he can still fix it because it is under warranty. But in order to fix it you need to fetch him two clumps of hair from a Hulking Gorilla(lvl 25 or so gorillas in the Cazic-Thule throne room) and a lock of the golden tresses from a &quot;certain mermaid&quot;. This certain mermaid is a &quot;golden haired mermaid&quot; (thats the exact name of the npc) that resides in Kedge Keep. You will absolutely need at least two well balanced 40+ groups to safely do this in Kedge. Once you retrieve the mermaid hair, go back to West Freeport and give Ping the 2 clumps of Gorilla Hair, the Golden Locke, and the Wig and you will get the Mane Attraction. Go back to Ak'Anon and give the Mane Attraction to Sanfyrd to get the &quot;glimmering fairy wing.&quot; Take the wing to Princess Joleena and she rewards you with the &quot;Faerie Dust.&quot;  <br> <br>2) A Treant Heart. Wooden Hearts are dropped by Treants, but a Ranger shouldn't attack a Treant. Instead, you can get this by giving small lanterns to Jyle Wyndshot in the Hogcaller's Inn in Freeport (which you did for the Trueshot Longbow quest originally) and about every fourth lantern or so he gives you &quot;A Treant Heart&quot; instead of just treant wood.  <br> <br>3) A Trueshot Longbow. <br> <br>4) 3000GP(must give 3000GP rather than 300PP).  <br> <br>You will then receive the Rain Caller Bow. <br> <br>
