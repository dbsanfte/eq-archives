SK Epic Quest <br> <br>This quest begins in the Overthere and results in the shadowknight's particle weapon.  <br> <br>This quest begins at an NPC named Kurron Ni who spawns near the docks in Fort Danak. This NPC is a rare spawn so don't be discouraged if he is not there the first few times you check for them.  <br> <br>Do not worry if you are killed on sight at the fort. Kurron spawns near the docks and you will be able to swim or invis yourself to get to him. He is also far enough away from other NPC's that you do not have to worry about them aggroing you when you are there. <br> <br>If you ask him what he seeks(do not ask him what his mission is or he will attack you) and then agree to his terms(tell him &quot;I agree&quot<img src=http://www.warlordboard.com/Images/wink.gif> then he will tell you that he seeks three pieces of darkforge armor(helm, chest and leggings) and 900pp.  <br> <br>Before turning in these items you need to gather up a good party and have them accompany you. Two groups would be best.  <br> <br>Handing these items in to him will simply gain a raise in TrueSpirit faction and he will say that his mission is nearly complete. He will reward you with no items. If you ask him what mission he will tell you of his treachery and then attack you. <br> <br>At this point you must kill him. Upon killing him you will find a &quot;Note to Duriek&quot; on his corpse. You will need this for the next portion of the quest. <br> <br>NOTE: You MUST first hand in these items or he will not drop the note. This has been tested and confirmed. <br> <br>Duriek can be found overlooking the newbie area in Paineel. He is upstairs in the newbie area looking out through the glass. If you hand him the note he will tell you a story of his apprentice. He will also tell you to &quot;take this for your efforts.&quot; but no item will be given. I'm not sure if this is broken or not. I have contacted Verant about it with no response. Someone has told me that Verant responded to this on a public board saying that no item is supposed to be given but I was never able to find the thread. Either way you receive TrueSpirit faction and are able to continue the quest. <br> <br>If you ask him what apprentice he will give you further background. Tell him that you will take his apprentice's place and he will ask you to prove your worth first. Duriek is aging and is in need of a cough elixir. This is obtained via a side quest in Neriak. &nbsp; <br> <br>Upon returning the cough elixir to Duriek he will inform you that he was trying to create a corrupted ghoulbane. Unfortunately he is no condition to gather the components. His previous apprentice was searching for them when he met his demise.  <br> <br>He needs you to find a tome for him. This tome can be found in The Hole on Ratman Guards. The best place to find these guards is by taking a left upon entering the first fortress and then take another left and pass down past the pool. Between this area and the old city beneath it Ratman Guards spawn fairly commonly as patrollers.  <br> <br>Beware that these rats are extremely tough. They hit for 370s, are very magic resistant and have a ton of hit points. The tome is a rare drop on them so you are likely going to have to kill several of them to obtain one. Our first encounter with one we had 7 people and no deaths but we had a high level party and Turgur's stuck on the first attempt. In later raids we had as many as 25 people and might lose 5-8 people each attempt. A lot of it depends on if you can get Turgurs or another speed reducing spell to stick early. <br> <br>Handing the Tome to Duriek will grant another faction adjustment and will reveal what items he will need to complete the corrupted ghoulbane. He requires: <br> <br>1) Blade of Abrogation from the Plane of Air <br>2) Soul Leech from Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear <br>3) Ghoulbane from upper guk.  <br>4) Decrepit Sheath from a Qeynos side quest. <br> <br>Returning this items to him will result in a corrupted ghoulbane(dmg 16 delay 34 effect dismiss undead sk only 1hslash) and will send you to seek out Lhranc in the City of Mist. This item is not much use to a shadowknight of this level but it is required for the next portion of the quest. <br> <br>Lhranc spawns approximately at location 0,0 in the City of Mist. This is just before the Reaver area near the large hut with all of the Goos. He spawns in the middle hut right past the big goo house. He spawns at the bottom and the two NPC's who spawn upstairs are not placeholders. Upon speaking with him he will reveal what he needs to forge your weapon. <br> <br>Each of these steps is accomplished by completing a sub-quest. These sub-quests all tie in together. The heart of an innocent and the will of innoruuk are wearable items that are among the best that &nbsp;shadowknight can attain. As a result these sub-quests are listed with their own seperate pages that are cross-linked together. They are listed in the neccessary order of completion. <br> <br>Heart of an Innocent <br>The Will of Innoruuk <br>Head of the Valiant <br> <br>Return these three items along with the corrupted ghoulbane to Lhranc and he will reward you by turning in to a living version of himself wielding the almighty Innoruuk's Curse. Killing him will allow you to loot the weapon. <br>  <br>  <br>

This is 1st sub quest to SK Epic: <br> <br>This quest is part of the Shadowknight Epic Quest.  <br> <br>An ogre NPC named Smaka in the Neriak Foreign Quarter can make special cures. One of these includes a bottle of cough elixir which is required in the SK Epic Quest. For a mere 1000pp he will create you some cough elixir.  <br> <br>Smaka may also be part of other subquests but none are known at this time. <br>

For those that can not find the 3 pieces of darkforge armor, this is how you can get it as well. <br> <br>Darkforge Armor <br> &nbsp; <br>  <br>This quest was submitted by: Zekris Shadowblaze <br> <br>The following is a post I placed on Everlore's message boards regarding the Darkforge Armor quest, it's components, and advice regarding how to get each. Remember the that quest begins and ends at the Undead Knights at the Temple of Solusek Ro, and you will be spending a LOT of time in Cazic Thule.  <br>I hunted in Cazic Thule for 12 levels (26 onward) in my persistant search for Darkforge. Here is some general advice regarding hunting Crusaders in CT and attaining the various other items required for the quests:  <br> <br>-When hunting in CT, your best bet for Crusaders are by the Ziggurat/Pyramid/Temple (same location, often called any of those) either on the ground outside of it, or camping the Archon and pulling from the lower levels of the temple. Crusaders will spawn where the other high lvl lizards spawn(Justicars, Zealots, Judicators). The top of the pyramid can be camped by a full group of low 30s with little difficulty (especially if you have an enchanter, as is often the case). The other place where high level Lizards spawn often is in the sewers (not the gator pools) which can be distinguished by the plank walkways over crocodile infested waters.  <br> <br>-As soon as you join the group, ALWAYS tell them that you are looking for Crusaders so you can loot pieces of decayed for quest armor. Remind them that it is No Drop. It is also often best to remind them nearing the end of a battle with a Crusader, in case someone decides to loot the corpse and grabs some decayed because &quot;it looked like banded&quot;. Countless times i have had pieces of decayed that I needed looted off of Crusaders, only to have the person claim &quot;I didn't know you were looking for it&quot; or &quot;I didn't see the message&quot;. Granted, sometimes this is actually the case, but more often then not they are getting the decayed to do the quest themselves (SKs are desperate for Darkforge, and everyone knows it). Of course, treachery is not prevalent in all groups, but if you're hunting in CT for an extended period of time, you should meet some of the same people and figure out who you can trust.  <br> <br>As a reminder, here are the components needed for each piece of Darkforge:  <br> <br>Darkforge Breastplate: Decayed Mail, Decayed Breastplate, 2 bars of enchanted platinum (not stacked)  <br> <br>Darkforge Helm: Decayed Helm, Decayed Visor, 2 Freeport Militia Helms (I believe they changed the item name on the helm, but if it was dropped by a dead FP guard, it is the right helm)  <br> <br>Darkforge Vambraces: Decayed Left Vambrace, Decayed Right Vambrace, Qeynos Kite Shield  <br> <br>Darkforge Bracer: Decayed Left Bracer, Decayed Right Bracer, Broken Minotaur Lord Horn (note, this makes one bracer, if you want 2 you need to do the quest once, turn in the items, then go back and do it again as all items required are NO DROP, LORE)  <br> <br>Darkforge Boots: Decayed Left Boot, Decayed Right Boot, 2 plies of Faerie Dust (unstacked, looks white, not yellow like pixie dust)  <br> <br>Darkforge Greaves: Decayed Left Legplate, Decayed Right Legplate, 2 bricks of Melatite  <br> <br>Darkforge Gloves: Decayed Left Glove, Decayed Right Glove, 1 bar of enchanted platinum  <br> <br>In regards to the various non-decayed pieces for the quests,here are a few small tips:  <br> <br>-When getting Faerie Dust (for DF Boots), it is best to hang around near Felwithe in Gfay and kill pixies and other small game until you see a Faerie spawn. They are usually a Faerie Royal Guard, Maiden, Princess, etc. Dust drops usually on 1 out of every 3 or 4 of them, so it shouldn't be too difficult. Remember, Faerie Dust is white, Pixie Dust is yellow, be wary if people try to sell it to you. I would also suggest resisting the urge to go to Lesser Faydark and camp the Pixie building. True, Faeries have a better potential to spawn here, but you risk running into a wandering Brownie, NPC druids who are TOUGH for their level (30-45). Your best bet is to be patient in Greater Fay.  <br> <br>-The Broken Minotaur Lord Horn (for DF bracers) is always dropped off of the Mino Lords in Steamfont. They are reasonably difficult, but if you are a good soloer you can take them alone at 33+, otherwise get another person around your level to help and they should be no trouble. One thing to watch for is that deep in the Mino caves (if you follow the left path) Mino Lords spawn and wander, dangerously close to lvl 35 gnome necro, Meldrath. Anyone who has ever fought NPC necros around their level before knows that unnecessarily engaging one is generally not the best idea. Remember that the Minotaur Hero is different from the Lord and a much higher level mob (mid to high 40s i believe).  <br> <br>-Freeport Militia Helms (for DF helm) can be gotten rather easily by sneaking into East Freeport and waiting for the guard that walks by the dock (provided no one is camping the guards by the gates). He is pretty low, and is far enough away from other guards that, as long as you have him darknessed and kill fairly quickly, he won't aggro any others.  <br> <br>-Qeynos Kite Shields (for DF vambraces)can either be attained by killing Qeynos guards (hard way) or by giving a low level 10pp to go inside the city and buy one off a vendor for you (sell for 5-8pp last time I checked). The shield you require is indeed a Qeynos Kite Shield (not a wooden kite shield, or any other form).  <br> <br>-Melatite (for DF Greaves) is found on the clockworks in Sol A. People often are selling melatite in the zone for 50pp per brick or so, but if you want to camp them it drops fairly often (1 out of 2 or 3 has it).  <br> <br>-Finally, Enchanted Platinum Bars are pretty easy to come by. Your best bet is to buy the bars yourself and then just give it to an enchanter you trust to enchant for you. Enchanters sometimes charge an excessive royalty for fetching and enchanting the bars themselves (enough to make up for whatever discount you may think they'd get for having such high CHA). The cheapest place i've found to get the platinum bars is in the Foreign Quarter in Neriak on the Ogre/Troll side at a store called Shinie Things. She usually sells the bars for 108 (with a cha of 55 or so) which is generally much cheaper than other jewelry stores from my experience.  <br> <br>
