        the beginning ...</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/guild2.jpg" width="500" height="277" alt="Tain Shari Primary Characters"></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tain Shari 
        was the last Sept to leave the world. We held back the shadow as long 
        as possible, to try and help as many people to escape. Only a handful, 
        of the Tain Shari, escaped, and most were forcibly removed from the world. 
        The honor that Tain Shari held to, would not allow them to run like the 
        rest. The few that were caught up in wizard's spells and those whose corpse 
        might have been summoned and revived, were drawn to each other in Greater 
        Faydark of the server called Test. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We have been 
        spending our time honing our skills fighting the Clan Crushbone. In this 
        effort, we have witnessed a few Tier'dal in the home of these orcs. Has 
        a feel of what happened in our home lands. We dare not fail this time, 
        or we may have no place left to go... </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We fought 
        hard to the depths of Befallen, slaying all of the foul minions that lay 
        in our way. Only to be turned away at the last moment by a massive influx 
        of Deathly ghouls, and harbingers of death. Sad to say, but we fled. We 
        will return when we feel we are stronger!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Across the 
        seas we sailed on a ship with mighty sails. At Firiona Vie we met with 
        those making a last stand against the evil forces inhabiting that land. 
        Though they warned us against it, we headed further inland to the Swamp 
        of No Hope. Our skills failed us when we encountered the massed forces 
        of the Froglok city. Many were lost and we fled to return when we have 
        grown and become more skilled.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To the city 
        of Aviaks we traveled, both on the islands of Lake Rathe and within the 
        boundaries of the Karanas. They fell like flies instead of mighty birds 
        to our swords and magic users. Much glory was gathered for the Tain Shari 
        in these battles.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next to an 
        island in the new ocean said to be populated with a tribe of fearsome 
        ogres. We found them not as fearsome as forecast and slew them with great 
        dispatch, all except their chief who was in fact a mighty warrior and 
        claimed the lives of those who sought to pull his subjects to their doom.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we find 
        ourselves again with the lands of the lizards. We hunt the Lake of Ill 
        Omen, ridding the land of Sarnaks and evil Iksars. They have lined our 
        pockets with platinum and helped us grow in skills as well. We have heard 
        rumors of late that there be giants nearby, and sleep with one eye open 
        and a guard always on watch.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our leads 
        led us to the Giant's own fort, where we found the large ones living in 
        a large community. We tested the waters and found the giants to be unworthy 
        adversaries. Though full of loot, they were weak and fell to our attack 
        like flies. Next week we seek the goblins to see if they are better sport.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Alas the 
        goblins, as a whole were disappointing fodder. They fell quickly and ran 
        easily. We slew them in mass until they sent against us one of their great 
        ones, Grachnist the Destroyer. Though we fought a mighty battle, he was 
        too strong for us. Sulin and Amethysax gave their lives to buy time for 
        the mages to escape. He too shall join the list of those we will visit 
        when we are older and more wise in the ways of battle. Next week we journey 
        across the seas to Mistmore in search of essence of sunlight to aid in 
        Yssarah's armor crafting.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ahhhh, at 
        last adversaries worthy of the might of Tain Shari. Last eve we entered 
        Mistmore and found it well suited to our abilities. Hordes did we slay 
        and well were we rewarded in both battle experience and loot. Many a gargoyle 
        parted with their eyes under our swords and flying fists. We left in such 
        good spirits that we didn't even take time to make a plan for our next 
        adventure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since the 
        evil ones of Mistmore spawn like rabbits, we have stayed an extra week 
        to make sure we clear out the evil lurking here. Unbeknownst to us, the 
        foul beasts brought in an imp to aid them. He was a mighty battle and 
        the clever bugger went after our healer, Grinch, first. Though he slew 
        Grinch the group ended the imps life and took for him a dagger with intelligence 
        enhancing properties for Lassenera. The graveyard proved beyond us and 
        aid was give to our group by Fadi the druid and Inkey the necromancer. 
        Their kindness will be long remembered within the guild.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">No one knows 
        how to have a good bar fight like those goblins in Sol A. We battled there 
        and gained much experience and much valuable loot which Yssarah sold for 
        a tidy profit. Once we discovered the safe room we suffered no losses, 
        though Grinch did give his life once to save us all. I would not be opposed 
        to remain here another week and see if we can avenge ourselves in the 
        bar. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With the 
        aid of a new friend, Cale, we strove deeper into Sol A and encountered 
        many worthy and rich foes. Countless goblins and even a Kobold Predator 
        fell to our relentless attack. In the depths of the cave we found a Reckless 
        Efreeti ... though we slew him in the end, his elemental minions destroyed 
        us. Among the many riches we took away with us were: Kobold Hide Boots, 
        an Obsidian Scimitar, and Platinum Armbands.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A fine, fine 
        night for the Tain Shari. Seven of us entered Cazic-Thule and we piled 
        the bodies of the lizards and great apes deep. Much fine experience was 
        gained and good money as well. This was our first try at a split group 
        and it worked out very well. It will be a fun experience when we can raise 
        our newer member to the point where we can field 2 mostly full groups 
        to take on an adventure.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Despite the 
        fact the Sulin pretended to be dead a little too accurately on one occasion, 
        the night was a great success. Tain Shari pressed all the way into the 
        throne room building at one point and spent a lot of the night in the 
        palace courtyard. Many lizards and their ape friends fell to our blows 
        and much platinum was garnered to help Yssarah in her jewelry making.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a brief 
        one night journey to Paw to confront the evil there, the group once again 
        returned to Cazic Thule. This time we fought our way to the room with 
        the blue pool. There we found and defeated, a steel golem and the many 
        gators that called this place home. Next we travel to The Estate of Unrest, 
        where we have been told much evil awaits us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For the first 
        time we ventured forth with 2 small groups instead of one large one. Unused 
        to this strategy we were quickly routed in Unrest. Still we did not give 
        up or give in. We reformed our groups and under the command of Ninui we 
        returned and vanquished many hags, skeletons and werebats.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We battled 
        our way deep into the icy caverns of Permafrost. Goblins fell to our mighty 
        onslaught in droves, until they called out the warriors worst fear.... 
        a diplomat. The great huge, bugger was still no match for us and we did 
        proceed to beat his large, cold arse. Then in true diplomat fashion, the 
        bugger turned tail and ran ... straight to the helpful arms of a dozen 
        or more goblins. Grinch, Amethysax, and Ninui gave their lives while the 
        others gated away. This diplomat has moved way up our list of foes to 
        re-visit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A wonderful 
        night. We started in Cazic killing in the throne room area, then moved 
        to the green pool, then we headed all the way into the temple area gathering 
        quest requirements as we went. Then off to the Rathe Mountains to finish 
        off a few paladins and some hill giants. A great night!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Christmas 
        night was spent killing giants in the Rathe Mountains. New Years night 
        was spent in Vellious and it was most exciting. With the help of Ninui's 
        killer Snow Bunny we slew our way through cats, walrus men, walruses, 
        and minotaurs to reach the Dwarven city.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After another 
        session of inflicting mass carnage upon the evil creatures of the icy 
        wastes, Tain Shari traveled to Kunark to thaw the ice from our armor. 
        We traveled through tunnels and into the crypt of Dalnir. As it was nigh 
        upon the anniversary of Sulin's birth we celebrated with gifts, ale, and 
        cake in between &quot;releasing from the burden of life&quot; the Kly 
        and their coerced minions. Alas they dropped none of the fabled armor 
        we sought from them, so perhaps we will remain to fight another day.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps we 
        should have left after the last battle. Many a fine fighter was slain 
        in tonights battle, though a travel weary Grinch rezed us. On the brighter 
        side, Sulin was pleased to find many exciting monk weapons from off the 
        evil Kly and I must admit that we removed a great number of the evil ones 
        from the world. Where shall we go next week? Who knows.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now we wish 
        we never knew. Tain Shari has always walked the very edge of our abilities 
        and on this night Kaesora was both our destination and our downfall. The 
        experience we gained in this dungeon was exceptional and all was well 
        until we were jumped by multiple creatures from out of nowhere. Many, 
        many lives were lost as retreiving the bodies of our fallen in this dungeon 
        was a nightmare. The vile creatures even hid Ivar's corpse in a wall, 
        requiring us to bring in Cynth, one of our small but capable necromancers. 
        The next time we visit Kaesora we shall be larger and there will be NO 
        MERCY! </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After a breif 
        trip to Solusek's Eye we travelled back to Cazic Thule and reaped many 
        fine rewards for our rougue, Quicksylver. The lizards fell like dominoes 
        as Sulin ran her legs off pulling them to all the Tain Shari massed in 
        the throne room courtyard. Next I think perhaps we will head for colder 
        regions. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ahh the Crystal 
        Caverns, so cold ye can see yer breath and full of evil critters. Our 
        first evening here we took on the orcs, alas we suffered several casualties. 
        Found a small enclave of dwarves living beneath the ice and took advantace 
        of their hospitality while we rested up. Next we went in search of crystal 
        spiders and terrors. We found them in abundance, living in the frozen 
        solitude of the caves. We killed so many the ground was covered with the 
        corpses. When, with the help of our friend Fadi, at last we found their 
        Queen she ran like a frightened rabbit. Still we hunted her down and killed 
        her, not once but 4 times. Much good loot was gathered and not a single 
        death among us.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In preparation 
        for our upcoming Juzzie Juicer Olympics, we headed for the Mountains of 
        Rathe where we hear the giants have platinum dripping from their pockets. 
        The rumors proved true and we spend many fruitful nights raking in the 
        money to fund our games. When at last we had prizes aplenty we met in 
        arena for a night of competitions. Under the watchful eye of a visiting 
        GM, we slew our largest member, Durgle and several visious cats the DM 
        was kind enough to summon for our amusement. Next we headed for the lake 
        and fished foro prizes. Our guild fishing master, Freaya, mopped the shore 
        with the rest of the guild. A bloodbath followed as we fought the whole 
        guild in melee and then drank to our healths and fought again. A race 
        round the arena was next with Durgle winning and Sordar and Elestria close 
        on his heals. Great prizes were awarded and everyone had a terrific time. 
        Our thanks to all those who helped make this event so much fun!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Kunark was 
        the next place to feel the force of Tain Shari. We spent a night wandering 
        in the Frontier Mountains but the terrain made it hazardous and several 
        members met with untimely ends. We moved to the Overthere and used the 
        open area to great advantage. Splitting up into 2 groups and taking the 
        east and west we managed to wreck much joyous havoc upon the evil creatures 
        wandering there.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Damn those 
        frogs and skellies! We traveled to Lower Guk, the Dead Side and the outcome 
        was very poor! The skellies started the fight and by the time they were 
        done with us, few Tain Shari lived. We will return again another day and 
        seek our vengence.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ahhhh, a 
        most enjoyable night was spend resting on the couches in Sol A. Of course 
        the goblins had to be persueded to allow is this rest but they were no 
        match for us. Next we travelled to Eastern Wastes and despite a rocky 
        start fighting a pack of ravenous wolves, much exp and fun was had. We 
        split into our usual 2 groups and hunted orcs and walrus. Those wishing 
        to stay in the area were suprised to find that the ice giants had overrun 
        the dwarf city of Thurgadin and killed all the city's people. The giants 
        will have to die!</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The group 
        has been camped for many days in the Overthere. No matter how many vile 
        creatures we slay, more set upon us. The only bright spot is that our 
        sword arms are growing stronger and our casters more versed in their arts. 
        Next we headed back to that pit of evil, Cazic Thule. There we used our 
        newly raised skills to wreck havoc among the lizard and their ape menions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Tonight we 
        head for a fabled ruin in Kunark called the City of Mist. Who knows what 
        adventures may await us. Alas we never reached the Misty City. Evil running 
        rampant near the outpost of Firona Vie took all our attention and many 
        of frogs, giants and drolvargs fell to our swords with nary a loss among 
        us. While we battled in Kunark work reached us that a new land had been 
        discovered in Odus, called the Stoneburnt Mountains. With all due haste 
        Ninui and Lassenera scooped us up and transported us to this new and unexplored 
        zone. I am pleased to report that Tain Shari were 8 of the first 44 to 
        enter this new land. We battled several cats, as we explaored and eventually 
        discovered a city of cat people. They were similar but not evactly the 
        same as those cat folk of Kerra Isle. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The icy continent 
        of Vellious now hosts Tain Shari. We have slain many creatures there, 
        from the Geonids in Crystal Caverns to Wyverns of Cobalt Scar. Our guild 
        has now grown in skill to the point where even the plains are opening 
        to us.</font></p>
