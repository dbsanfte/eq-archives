            we change with them. When Tain Shari began it was made up almost entirely 
            of members from the same geographical area, namely Huntsville, Alabama. 
            However we are now opening the guild, on a limited basis, to members 
            from other areas. It is not our goal to grow to be a huge, &quot;uber&quot; 
            guild and so we plan to take only a few new members. Our first preference 
            is to fill slots we are low on: warriors, enchanters, rogues, and 
            clerics though anyone is welcome to apply. Preference will also be 
            given to those we have played with in the past. Please note that our 
            guild plays exclusively on the Test Server.</font></p>

          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are interested 
            in joining our guild, please read the guild rules listed below and 
            fill out the guild application. Our guild rules are in a state of 
            development. What you see posted is the most current version. After 
            filling out the application, you will be invited to play with us for 
            one month to see how well we fit your needs and you fit ours.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After the&quot;get 
            to know you&quot; time of playing together the guild will decide whether 
            to invite you or not. The decision to allow new people into the guild 
            will be made by the guild membership committee, which meets each Monday 
            at noon. Applicants will be notified as soon as possible after the 
            discussion.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Guild 
            Leadership</strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tain Shari was 
            founded by Sulin, who is no longer active. It is led by a committee 
            of the original guild officers who meet each Monday at noon to discuss 
            guild issues.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What We 
            Are Looking For In Members</strong></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maturity - 
              We don't care how old you are, we care how old you act.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Fellowship 
              - We are all very good friends and we only want new guild members 
              who will also be our friends. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Responsibility 
              - This goes back to the maturity part. If you say you'll be there, 
              be there. When you have a guild as small as ours, every person really 
              counts. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Compassion 
              - Our members are noted for traveling halfway around the world to 
              rez a guildmate or help someone move to a meeting spot or help with 
              a body recovery. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Humor - Laughing 
              is good, we do it a lot. We like to torment each other but never 
              in a bad way. </font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Respect - 
              We all respect each other. We know our strengths and our weaknesses 
              and we accept those. We treat each other as we wish to be treated.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Honor - Our 
              motto is &quot;Honor Knows No Bounds&quot; and we really do try 
              and play by that. <br>
              </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What We 
            Are NOT Looking For</strong></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Loot Mongers 
              - In our guild we don't mind sharing items but if loot is your driving 
              force in the game, we are not the guild for you.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Whiners - 
              Nobody likes a whiner, why should we? </font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Elitists - 
              While there is nothing wrong with guild pride, we have no use for 
              those who are seeking L33t guild so they can get phat lootz. If 
              you are just looking for a guild to &quot;get your epic&quot; please 
              look somewhere else. <br>
              </font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What We 
            Offer To Our Members</strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Friendship. Good, 
            mature, dedicated game play. Help in achieving your goals in the game. 
            Help out of a jam when you need it. Laughter. Fun. Someone to die 
            with in a valiant effort and someone to rez you afterwards. Pride 
            in accomplishing things in a smaller group than most would believe 
            possible. Friends you will still want to talk to long after Everquest 
            is history.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Guild 
            Rules</strong></font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Attendance - If 
            you say you will be at a guild raid/event/gathering, we expect you 
            to be there. We play on set nights as a guild and the plans we make 
            involve everyone who says they will be there. On other nights we usually 
            just play with whoever shows up. You are not required to play with 
            the guild every time, but when you're needed we expect you to come 
            and help out. The nights are: <br>
            Monday - Guild Play Night. What we do is usually decided by the officers 
            at the Monday lunch meeting. Plans are posted on the message board 
            and this is also where you post places you would like to go and things 
            you would like to do. <br>
            <br>
            If your plans change post it to the message board, email a guild mate 
            or tell someone in the game. Failure to show up 3 times without letting 
            anyone know can mean removal from the guild.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trade Skills - 
            Our members have a wide variety of trade skill available to share. 
            As with most folks on Test Server, we do not usually seek to make 
            a profit and only ask to be reimbursed for the actual cost of an item. 
            If you want to chip in a little extra to further the skill level of 
            the character making the items, it is totally up to you. You can refer 
            to the skills page for a list of who does what and how well. <br>
            Loot - We have always had a very informal loot policy, but with the 
            guild growing we have to firm it up a bit. The nightly raid leader 
            determines the looting policy for that raid, and if they do not wish 
            too set one, it falls back to the most deserving gets the item. We 
            also have a pass down rule, this means that when if you upgrade a 
            piece of equipment on a guild sponsored raid then if possible you 
            pass down the piece upgraded to others who may need (kinda like how 
            they pass tink bags down on dragon raids). With maturity, loot is 
            not a problem and it is much more common for our guys to try and give 
            stuff to others than take it for themselves.</font></p>
