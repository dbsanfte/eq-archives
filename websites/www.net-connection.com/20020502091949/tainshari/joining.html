      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Times change and 
          we change with them. When Tain Shari began it was made up almost entirely 
          of members from the same geographical area, namely Huntsville, Alabama. 
          However we are now opening the guild, on a limited basis, to members 
          from other areas. It is not our goal to grow to be a huge, &quot;uber&quot; 
          guild and so we plan to take only a few new members. Our first preference 
          is to fill slots we are low on: enchanters, rogues, and clerics though 
          anyone is welcome to apply. Preference will also be given to those we 
          have played with in the past. Please note that our guild plays exclusively 
          on the Test Server.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you are interested 
          in joining our guild, please read the guild rules listed below and fill 
          out the guild application.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
          Our guild rules are in a state of development. What you see posted is 
          the most current version. After filling out the application, you will 
          be invited to play with us for a while to see how well we fit your needs 
          and you fit ours.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a suitable 
          &quot;get to know you&quot; time of playing together the guild will 
          decide whether to invite you or not. The decision to allow new people 
          into the guild will be made by the guild membership committee, which 
          meets each Monday at noon. Applicants will be notified as soon as possible 
          after the discussion.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Guild Leadership</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tain Shari was founded 
          by Sulin, who is no longer active. It is led by a committee of the original 
          guild officers who meet each Monday at noon to discuss guild issues.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What We Are Looking 
        For In Members</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Maturity - We don't 
          care how old you are, we care how old you act.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Fellowship - We 
          are all very good friends and we only want new guild members who will 
          also be our friends.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Responsibility 
          - This goes back to the maturity part. If you say you'll be there, be 
          there. When you have a guild as small as ours, every person really counts.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Compassion - Our 
          members are noted for traveling halfway around the world to rez a guildmate 
          or help someone move to a meeting spot or help with a body recovery.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Humor - Laughing 
          is good, we do it a lot. We like to torment each other but never in 
          a bad way.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Respect - We all 
          respect each other. We know our strengths and our weaknesses and we 
          accept those. We treat each other as we wish to be treated.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Honor - Our motto 
          is &quot;Honor Knows No Bounds&quot; and we really do try and play by 
          that.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What We Are NOT 
        Looking For</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Loot Mongers - 
          In our guild we don't mind sharing items but if loot is your driving 
          force in the game, we are not the guild for you.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whiners - Nobody 
          likes a whiner, why should we?</font></li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Elitists - While 
          there is nothing wrong with guild pride, we have no use for those who 
          are seeking L33t guild so they can get phat lootz. If you are just looking 
          for a guild to &quot;get your epic&quot; please look somewhere else.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>What We Offer To 
        Our Members</b></font></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Friendship. Good, 
          mature, dedicated game play. Help in achieving your goals in the game. 
          Help out of a jam when you need it. Laughter. Fun. Someone to die with 
          in a valiant effort and someone to rez you afterwards. Pride in accomplishing 
          things in a smaller group than most would believe possible. Friends 
          you will still want to talk to long after Everquest is history.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Guild Rules</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Attendance</b> 
          - If you say you will be at a guild raid/event/gathering, we expect 
          you to be there. We play on set nights as a guild and the plans we make 
          involve everyone who says they will be there. On other nights we usually 
          just play with whoever shows up. You are not required to play with the 
          guild every time, but when you're needed we expect you to come and help 
          out. The nights are:</font> 
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monday - General 
              Play. What we do is usually decided by the officers at the Monday 
              lunch meeting. Plans are posted on the message board and this is 
              also where you post places you would like to go and things you would 
              like to do.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Wednesday - 
              Juzzie's War Band. We usually play our biggest guys and go to the 
              scariest places that the troll can find.</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sunday - Durgle's 
              Quest Night. D takes us wherever we need to go to get quest items 
              for the guild.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If your plans 
            change post it to the message board, email a guild mate or tell someone 
            in the game. Failure to show up 3 times without letting anyone know 
            can mean removal from the guild.</font></p>
        </li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Trade Skills</b> 
          - Our members have a wide variety of trade skill available to share. 
          As with most folks on Test Server, we do not usually seek to make a 
          profit and only ask to be reimbursed for the actual cost of an item. 
          If you want to chip in a little extra to further the skill level of 
          the character making the items, it is totally up to you. You can refer 
          to the skills page for a list of who does what and how well.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Loot</b> - 
            We have always had a very informal loot policy, but with the guild 
            growing we have to firm it up a bit. The nightly raid leader determines 
            the looting policy for that raid, and if they do not wish too set 
            one, it falls back to the most deserving gets the item. We also have 
            a <b>pass down rule</b>, this means that when if you upgrade a piece 
            of equipment on a guild sponsored raid then if possible you pass down 
            the piece upgraded to others who may need (kinda like how they pass 
            tink bags down on dragon raids). </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">With 
            maturity, loot is not a problem and it is much more common for our 
            guys to try and give stuff to others than take it for themselves.</font></p>
        </li>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Things That 
          Will Get You Kicked Out</b> <br>
          1) Cheating, either each other or the game <br>
          2) Failure to attend, repeatedly, without letting someone know<br>
          3) Embarrassing the guild in public (acting like a wanker in shout and 
          OOC or by your actions)<br>
          4) Stealing from anyone in our guild or out of it<br>
          5) Lying in the game to anyone in our guild or out of it </font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Some Things 
          That Will <font size="4">NOT</font> Get You Kicked Out</b> <br>
          1) Having your tail fall off in the middle of a fight<br>
          2) Not agreeing the Juzzie is a very &quot;pretty trollie&quot;</font><br>
          <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3) Mocking Freaya's 
          pants.<br>
          4) Calling Crouching Lizard he.<br>
          5) Telling Ivar you still think his hat looks like a sombrero<br>
          6) Refusing to submit to Durgle's PayPal requests </font></li>
