        Guide to Baking</b></font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This guide is designed 
        for the baker who is looking for the fastest possible progerss and assumes 
        that the chef has plenty of funds (plenty meaning around 30pp depending 
        on INT and CHA. You probably won't need that much, but it can't hurt). 
        Start by putting 20 skill points into baking, if you don't have 20 skill 
        points it just means that your start will be a little slower. Buy a portable 
        spit or have one made by a blacksmith. This lets you cook in the wilderness 
        (or in the same Inn where you are shopping) instead of travelling to a 
        town everytime you want to whip something up. Make sure you have several 
        backpacks, the ingredients you will be working with will be bought in 
        quantity for the fastest progress.</font></p>

            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Sandwiches and Eddible 
              Goo. For sandwiches you need meats from bears, rats, mammouths, 
              wolves and bread. On most servers you only need to go to the vendors 
              in the newbie areas to get all the meat you need for this. Put 1 
              meat (do not use &quot;chunk of meat&quot; as it will not work) 
              and 1 bread in your spit and combine to make a sandwich. If plentiful 
              sandwich meat isn't available, change over to making edible goo. 
              Rat ears are easy to get and fire beetle eyes are sold by the Erudite 
              at Inn 3 in East Commons. Put 1 ear and 1 eye in your spit and combine, 
              this gives you 1 eddible goo. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">*You only have to get 
              2 points this way if you have put the 20 starter points in, so should 
              not take long.</font></p>

            Move to East Commons. From the vendor in Inn 1 buy frosting, lots 
            and lots of frosting. I bought it in 160 lot increments but those 
            with higher intellegnce will go up faster and may not need as much. 
            Then move to Inn 3 and buy an equal number of batwings from the Erudite. 
            Combine 1 batwing and 1 frosting in your spit to make a batwing crunchie.

            sauce, then move to the dock in Freeport and buy fish (not the fish 
            scales). Combine 1 fish and 1 jug of sauce in your spit to make 2 
            fish filets. These sell for more than they cost and you should be 
            able to recoup the money you have spent getting this far. Go back

          weighs roughly 1.0 while baked food weighs 0.1, so you can carry 10 
          homemade sandwiched for every 1 purchased ration. Monks love this since
