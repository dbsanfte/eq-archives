      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tain Shari is made 
        up entirely of members from the same geographical area, namely Huntsville, 
        Alabama. We know each other in &quot;real life&quot; and are friends and 
        family. Though we are very happy that you find us worthy enough to wish 
        to join us, we are unable to take members that do not live within driving 
        distance of Huntsville, Alabama. We would hate to take members from farther 
        away who would feel left out of the regular Wednesday guild lunch meetings 
        / planning sessions.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Though we do not take 
        members from farther away we are always happy to group with people from 
        outside the guild so feel free to ask if we have a spot open should you 
        see us online.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Organized Play 
        Nights</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tain Shari plays regularly 
        on Monday and Thursday nights starting at 7:30 pm CST. Monday nights are 
        for our original starting group of characters (the ones in the oval pictures) 
        and Thursday nights are for &quot;Juzzie's War Band&quot; our favorite 
        secondary characters. Where we play differs from week to week so please 
        check the Next Week link on the main page if you are trying to track us 
        down. </font></p>
