<p><b>The Bishop's Diary</b></p>
<p><i>(page 1)</i></p>
<p><img name="image1" src="pictures/pixie.jpg" width="191" height="221"><br>
  One of the pixies from Toxxulia Forest<br>
  Such beautiful creatures are a God-sent and as such in the service of Udaai 
  the Bishop.... Well, in his dreams and visions at least. </p>
<p><img name="image2" src="pictures/spiders.jpg" width="600" height="212"><br>
  In his youth, Udaai was a great slayer of spiders. Here he is in the Desert 
  of Northern Ro after dispatching several Desert Tarantula's. The orc raiders 
  in the background are fleeing from the ruthless violence.</p>
<p><img name="image3" src="pictures/madman.jpg" width="299" height="312"><br>
  On one of the Gauntlet's crusades, we encountered this madman who had mastered 
  the art of sleeping (read: dying) on air.</p>
<p><img name="image4" src="pictures/tarantula.jpg" width="284" height="222"><br>
  The Gauntlet slaps again! This time a dune tarantula was no match for us.</p>
<p><img name="image5" src="pictures/caiman.jpg" width="192" height="158"><br>
  Our first venture into Oasis. Needless to say, the crocs didn't like it too 
  much.</p>
<p><img name="image6" src="pictures/village.jpg" width="422" height="202"><br>
  Quite a gathering at the small fishing village in Oasis. We are waiting for 
  the goblin's pets; the other group was going to take on the goblins. 'Was', 
  since they all died. We made it out safely.</p>
<p><img name="image7" src="pictures/village2.jpg" width="323" height="195"><br>
  Uhhh.... Let me correct that. Chelsy made a fatal mistake in dropping some small 
  spells on the goblins.... Surely enough they turned on her once the original 
  assailant was dispatched.</p>
<p><img name="image8" src="pictures/spectre.jpg" width="220" height="264"><br>
  The Bishop flexes his muscles and lets arcane energies jump between his fingers 
  while he surveys his last victim. &quot;Uh hello! What are you saying? That's 
  your kill? *cough* Awfully sorry, old chap. I'll be on my way now&quot;. The 
  Bishop sneaks away.</p>
<p><img name="image9" src="pictures/lockjaw.jpg" width="257" height="234"><br>
  Does this need any explanation?</p>
<p><img name="image10" src="pictures/bixie.jpg" width="150" height="203"><br>
  Gotcha, you lil' bugger. Oh yes, those bixie crunchies taste delicious.</p>
<p><img name="image11" src="pictures/rathe.jpg" width="264" height="213"><br>
  The Rathe Mountains expedition, where the Gauntlet made some enemies with the 
  Giant skeletons and the lesser undead.</p>
<p><img name="image12" src="pictures/stick.jpg" width="250" height="152"><br>
  The Bishop casts his lethal spell &quot;Corpse Like a Stick&quot;. Amazement 
  all around, it works!</p>
<p><img name="image13" src="pictures/meeting.jpg" width="294" height="195"><br>
  The first official Council Meeting of the Order of the Gauntlet. Venue: Highkeep 
  castle.</p>
<p><img name="image14" src="pictures/centaur.jpg" width="235" height="131"><br>
  The half-human, half-horses are really an abomination to nature. I say, slay 
  them all!</p>
<p><img name="image15" src="pictures/aviaktower.jpg" width="272" height="168"><br>
  The location is Lake Rathe, the Aviak Ladder. Udaai the Bishop is here to make 
  sure these guards stay in line, and to forcefully make them see the errors of 
  their ways if they don't listen. They were lucky today, noone dared to be uppity 
  with the Bishop.</p>
<p><img name="image16" src="pictures/icegoblin.jpg" width="191" height="143"><br>
  &quot;I am the ugly ice goblin from Permafrost Keep, and I gainsay your right 
  of entry.&quot; The Bishops laughs evilly, and motions his familiar to attack....</p>
