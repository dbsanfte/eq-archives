<p><b>The Mission</b></p>
<p>The Guild's mission is to shape the choas into Order, to have people Respect 
  each other, and to do Honourly things.</p>
<p>In this Guild we have different Orders that have there own vision on how to 
  do that:<br>
  <b><img name="image1" src="gfx/gauntlet_gold.gif" align="absmiddle">The Order 
  of the Golden Gauntlet - The Guardians -</b></p>
<p><b><img name="image2" src="gfx/gauntlet_silver.gif" align="absmiddle">The 
  Order of the Silver Gauntlet - The Advisors -</b><br>
  This order has 3 major tasks. The first is the task for giving advice or solving 
  problems. Therefor this order has a Head Advisor and a ThinkTank to make solutions 
  to problems. The second task of this order is to Scribe important events and 
  news such as special Guild Events, but also special events concerning the changing 
  of the world as we know. The third task of this order is to provide in protocols 
  and to give shape to the Ceremonies of the guild.</p>
<p><b><img name="image3" src="gfx/gauntlet_bronze.gif" align="absmiddle">The 
  Order of the Bronze Gauntlet - The Protectors -</b></p>
<p><b><img name="image4" src="gfx/gauntlet_brass.gif" align="absmiddle">The 
  Order of the Brass Gauntlet - The Sages -</b><br>
  Description: *No tanks*</p>
<p> Purpose: The Order of the Brass Gauntlet is a wise choice for Wizards, Enchanters 
  and even Magicians, since you get to do what you do the best without anyone 
  looking you over the shoulder...almost.</p>
<p> The Order of the Brass Gauntlet is the Backup Demolition Crew, Tactical Air 
  Support and Crowd Controller. Our aims are to support the forward ranks with 
  tactical aerial firepower, crowd control and decimating the enemys abilities 
  by means of magic, not necessarily in that order. </p>
<p>Mana efficiency is A&O in this divsion. I - We, the Order of the Brass Gauntlet 
  - take pride in reducing downtime to a minimum, and so should you. Upholding 
  this and you're guaranteed success in this division. Let me stress that, even 
  though mana preservation is admirable, IT MUST UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE ENDANGER 
  YOU OR YOUR GUILD MEMBERS. Rather burn a litte too much, than a little too less. 
</p>
<p>A crash course in Tactical Air Support: <br>
  1. Do NOT burn everything indiscriminately, this prolonges downtime. Limit burning 
  to the tough and the fleeing foes. <br>
  2. Be careful with Area Effect spells around multiple angry foes. <br>
  3. Make sure that your group know what you're doing, BEFORE you do it. Bravery 
  is for fools - and young monks. </p>
<p>If you feel that you cannot sit idle by watching the forward ranks having all 
  the fun then practice your weapons skills by poking the critter with your stick 
  or dagger or whatever weapon you choose. The practice will come in handy at 
  a later time, I can guarantee. Or you can meditate...this also reduces downtime 
  after the battle. </p>
<p>Ranking: <br>
  The Merlin - Leader, answers only to the Crystal Gauntlet.<br>
  1st Oracle - Second in command, answers to the Merlin - Holds the responsibility 
  for several Sr.Apprentices <br>
  Sr. Apprentice - Senior member, answers to his or her appointed Oracle. <br>
  Jr. Apprentice - Junior member, answers to his or her appointed Sr. Apprentice 
</p>
<p>Oracles are numbered as they are appointed.</p>
<p> The entry level is always Jr. Apprentice. A robe for official guild use, will 
  be handed out at the inauguration ceremony. </p>
<p>Advancement within this division is possible by examplary conduct (or by necessity) 
  (No one will stay a Jr. Apprentice forever) </p>
<p><b><img name="image5" src="gfx/glove_bishop.gif">The Bishop's Canton</b><br>
  The Bishop's Canton gives spiritual guidance to our fellow guildmembers, and 
  can bless journeys, quests, battles, and so on. These blessings do not result 
  in any physical experience (like feeling stronger, or more lucky), but there 
  will be an awareness that the Gods and Goddesses themselves are walking with 
  them.</p>
<p> Ranking:<br>
  The Bishop - head of the Bishop's Canton and the only one who has direct guidance 
  from the major Gods and Goddesses.<br>
  Godly Enforcer - the senior staff of The Bishop. Only a few are strong enough 
  to grasp major deity's and force concrete answers. Not Gods though, these beings 
  are just too powerful. <br>
  Deity Questioner - junior staff of The Bishop with teaching and guiding responsibilities 
  towards the Spirit Listeners. Mind strengthened, they can now hold a deity's 
  attention long enough to direct feelings or very general 'questions' towards 
  it. <br>
  Spirit Listener - pupils who are taught to listen to minor spirits and natural 
  forces. The mind is a fragile thing, and needs to be prepared and strengthened 
  for interaction with spitits and later deities. <br>
  Novice - applicants just entering the Bishop's Canton and waiting for a space 
  to be accepted into the next rank </p>
