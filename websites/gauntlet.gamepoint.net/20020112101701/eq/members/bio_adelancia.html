      <p>Description:<br>
        Adelancia is a muscled lady that isn't afraid easily. She also has the 
        habit to bonk people on the head and get violent very easily. But she 
        upholds the Knightly manners so the fights will always be fair. Although 
        she keeps reminding people how much she hate certain things, she is always 
        welcome as she brings a certain &quot;safe&quot;-feeling among others.</p>
      <p>History:<br>
        Adelancia had a tough childhood and was raised among thieves and burglars. 
        Although her father was a true Knight, she never has met him as he saw 
        his fault when he found out that Adelancia's mother, Siradoru, was a unfamous 
        rogue. He let her live and left heart-broken. Siradoru raised her only 
        child back at her home in south Freeport among the many rogues and beggars. 
        Because she told Adelancia so much about her father, Adelancia was destined 
        to become a knight. Only the other side of her childhood caused her also 
        to become known with black magic!</p>
