<p><b>The Walk</b></p>
<p>The Walk is a formal method of moving to and from important events. The setup 
  is that the Crystal Gauntlet is at front (with the Bishop and any important 
  guests in the middle), with the Holy Circle in the middle and the rest of the 
  members at back. At the sides of this setup are guardians for protection and 
  at the front is our flag-bearer.</p>
<p> <img name="image1" src="gfx/walk.gif" width="486" height="143"> </p>
<p>If the Walk is performed in dangerous areas, special scouts can be assigned 
  to explore in front and to watch the back. Also weapons may be drawn in dangerous 
  areas. The Knight will guard over the safety of all and will tell if weapons 
  may be drawn. (Please don't keep weapons drawn in safe areas such as cities, 
  especially when we are meeting a friendly alliance!) </p>
<p>As the name says, the Walk means everyone is walking. Certain circumstances 
  can call for a run. If so, it's called by the Knight when to start running and 
  when to slow down again.</p>
