<h2><font size="3"><b>The New Member Ceremony</b></font></h2>
<p>In the next pictures is shown how the new member walks forward to the Crystal 
  Gauntlet, pays respect to the 4 fingers and the Bishop, choosing his order and 
  getting accepted (or not), and leaving the ceremony for celebrations or mournings.</p>

<p>Protocol to be followed during this ceremony:<br>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>The new member holds the rules for lower rank members and therefor doesn't 
      wear any armor better than leather. (All robes are allowed.)</td>

    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>The new member is asked to come forward by the Ceremony Master; "<i>[name 
      of candidate] come forth and kneel before the Crystal Gauntlet.</i>" </td>

    <td>The new member walks (no run and no SOW allowed) forward to the Crystal 
      Gauntlet and pays respect (by bowing) to the Brass Gauntlet, the Bronze 
      Gauntlet, the Silver Gauntlet and the Gold Gauntlet in this order.</td>

  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>

      crouched). </td>

  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td> 
      <p>The Bishop then talks: "<i>Be it known to all men and women that I, in 
        name of the Crystal Gauntlet, am minded to raise [candidate] by virtue 
        of his honour, loyalty, valour and skill, to the high rank of the Order 
        of the Gauntlet.</i>" (Note that low rank means the footfolk or common 
        people, peasants if you like.)</p>
      <p>"<i>[Name], do you swear and acknowledge the Order of the Gauntlet, and 
        the Crystal Gauntlet to be your true and lawful lead?</i>" (The candidate 
        now has to answer affermatively.)</p>
      <p>The bishop now puts his hand on the candidates head while doing a small 
        blessing and continues with the ceremonial words: "<i>Repeat after me. 
        I [name] do solemnly swear and pledge my sword and mind to the Order of 
        the Gauntlet, to defend and obey the order until the order is no more 
        or death shall take me, and to uphold the honour of the Order.</i>" (The 
        candidate repeats using his own name.)</p>
      <p>"<i>And I, in name of the Crystal Gauntlet, do swear to defend and honour 
        [candidate] as befits a true member of the Order.</i>" </p>
      <p>&quot;<i>Arise, Brother/Sister, and choose you Order to follow.</i>&quot;</p>

    <td>After getting the Bishops Blessing and after being told to go choose his 
      order he/she will stand up to the center of the Crystal Gauntlet. There 
      he/she asks the specific order if he/she may join: &quot;<i>I kneel before 
      thee in order to be accepted into your Order.</i>&quot; The Leader of that 
      Order will then say &quot;<i>I accept your offer, and you may join my Order.</i>&quot; 
      OR a simple &quot;<i>Nay!</i>&quot;.<br>
      He/she may also ask every Order 1 small question before deciding, but it's 
      common that you inform yourself of the different orders before the ceremony!</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>After acceptance he/she will take leave by walking away and accepting 
      cheers and bows from the other members. After that the new member may sit 
      down in the corresponding group as shown in the pictures.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>If not accepted he/she may try only a second time with another order. 
      He/she will accept the outcome when not accepted and leave peacefully and 
      quietly. In this case the Bishop will say the following: &quot;<i>Let it 
      be known that [Name] has not been accepted. Let him/her leave as a friend 
      and we will hope for the day that he/she is ready to join our Order.</i>&quot; 
      (Not accepted means you'll have to work harder to earn your respect of this 
      guild. It doesn't mean all your chances are gone!)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Listen closely to the Ceremony Master when this ceremony is over, because 
      he/she will tell if another ceremony will take place or if there is time 
      to celebrate.</td>
