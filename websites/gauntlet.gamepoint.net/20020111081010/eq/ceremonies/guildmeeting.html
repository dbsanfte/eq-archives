<p><b>Guildmeeting</b></p>
<p>Guildmeetings are the most common meetings of the members of the guild. The 
  guildmeetings can be open discussions or more formal held decision-taking sessions. 
  In all cases does the Crystal Gauntlet lead the meeting.</p>
<p>Rules that are to be followed are: </p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Don't talk before your turn. Raise your hand and eventually you will get 
      your turn to talk. If you are seated in the lower ranks you should tell 
      your direct officer you want to say something (this because your raised 
      hand might not be seen from far). Your direct officer will ask you forward 
      to speak up.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Always act with respect to your superiors.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>To speed up meetings it is better to speak things out in your own order 
      before discussing it at the meeting.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Decisions made at guildmeetings are official and therefor in direct effect 
      after the meeting or on another date when explicitly stated otherwise.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>During guildmeetings a raffle can be held to collect money for the guild 
      (be it for the building of the guildhouse,or the other tasks to be done 
      by the guild). This money goes directly into the treasury along with any 
      items that are given during the raffle.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Pay attention when the Ceremony Master anounces something, because a guildmeeting 
      can easily transform into a formal ceremony (such as for example a new member 
      ceremony).</td>
  </tr>
