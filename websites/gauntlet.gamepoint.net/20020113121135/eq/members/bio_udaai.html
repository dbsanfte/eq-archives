      <p>Race: Human<br>
        Profession: Bishop, Battlemage, Guildleader</p>
      <p>Description:<br>
        Udaai normally has a friendly and outgoing personality, but at times he 
        can be very withdrawn and even forgetful. This is not because he is bored 
        with what happens around him, but actually because he is chatting up the 
        beautiful and luscious godesses again. Hmmm, make that: he is intervening 
        on behalf of our Guild with all the known deities (and quite some more!) 
        to grant the Guild and its friends safety in travel, good fortune in the 
        hunt, and luck with the women (or men).<br>
        Although Udaai is a mage, he likes to throw a punch now and again and 
        often joins in the fray. Until he gets his delicate hands bruised, at 
        which time he takes a step back to 'supervise' the battle and throw a 
        spell here and there.</p>
      <p><br>
        History:<br>
        Udaai always fantasises that his mother was an angel, and as such he is 
        partly immortal as well. But alas, he will probably never know for sure 
        for his father died during the voyage on the ship to Freeport. Udaai was 
        only 3 years old at the time. His father was a practisioner of magic himself 
        too, and just returned from an extensive trip to Kunark to look for rare 
        tomes. Supposedly, Udaai's father met his wife in Kunark, where they conceived 
        Udaai. What happened with Udaai's mother is not known, for his father 
        returned alone.<br>
        In Freeport, Udaai was taken in during the first years of his life by 
        Opal Darkbriar, and was trained in the arcane arts of magic. When he was 
        sixteen years of age, he left the mage's guild after a big argument with 
        some of the older mages in the guild (which he called 'old farts' behind 
        their back). During his travels through the lands, he came in contact 
        with distant family of his father. Balifor Thistleknot, an intrepid bard, 
        and Lovidamo Gaidin'Maconar, a big brute of a barbarian, were his travel 
        companions for a long long time.<br>
        It was during these travels that they decided to form a guild and battle 
        the chaos they saw throughout the lands of Norrath.</p>

        that stain Udaai's robes</p>
