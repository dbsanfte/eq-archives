<h2><font size="4"><b>The Ceremonies</b></font></h2>
<p>Learn these ceremonies by heart. Not knowing them is to disrespect the whole 
  guild. Lessons in these ceremonies can be taken, contact the Ceremony Master. 
</p>
<p>The ceremonies will always, unless stated otherwise, have the following setup:<br>
  <img name="image1" src="ceremonies/gfx/basics_1.gif" width="151" height="213"> 
  <img name="image2" src="ceremonies/gfx/basics_2.gif" width="244" height="213"> 
</p>
<p>The higher ranks have their position close to the Bishop and his Holy Circle. 
  The Holy Circle are the 5 highest in rank of the Bishop's Canton. Other lesser 
  members of the Bishop's Canton will take seat in the place reserved for their 
  order. The lesser ranks of the different Orders take seat the fartest away from 
  the Bishop.</p>
<p>When the Bishop has arrived he holds up his hand and all will be quiet. The 
  Knight, Advisor, Priestess and Sage will then ask the Bishop for blessings. 
  He will give them and their followers the blessings. After that the ceremony 
  or meeting will commence as named by the Ceremony Master.</p>
<p>Rules that are common for almost all ceremonies are:<br>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1">
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>No weapons and no helms or hats are allowed to be wielded/worn when the 
      Bishop arrives. Showing weapons or helms is a direct offense to the Bishop. 
      (PS: Staffs are not considered weapons and may therefor be wielded.)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Lesser ranked members must also remove armor that is better then leather 
      armor (so get yourself a leather outfit for the ceremonies; to come bare 
      naked is not allowed either!). Showing full plate armor as a lesser ranked 
      member during a ceremony is a direct offense to the higher ranks. Robes 
      may be worn at all times.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Every member stands up when the Bishop makes his entry.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>No talking or by other means making noises is allowed after the Bishop 
      has raised his hand. Casting spells is not allowed either (not even for 
      making food or water).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>After the blessings have been received everyone may sit down.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Everyone must sit down when the Bishops sits down or when their direct 
      leader/officer sits down.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>No one will take leave before asking their direct superior.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>After the Bishop has left it is allowed to leave on your own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>When the Bishop or other council member calls for a council meeting the 
      lower ranked members must take leave in an orderly manner.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Lower ranked members don't talk during ceremonies, they talk via their 
      Leader. They only speak when called forward by the Crystal Gauntlet and 
      to speak.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>High ranked members positioned right behind their leader may enter open 
      discussion with their leader when started by their leader. They also stop 
      talking when their leader tells them to stop.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>The members of the Crystal Gauntlet should appoint replacements for them 
      if they have urgent or important matters at hand.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">-</td>
    <td>Try using 3rd-person view with all ceremonies, so you won't be stepping 
      on someone's toes!</td>
  </tr>
