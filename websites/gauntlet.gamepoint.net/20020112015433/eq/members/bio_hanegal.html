        Profession: Wizard, Leader of the Order of the Brass Gauntlet, member 
        of the Crystal Gauntlet.</p>
      <p>Description:<br>
        Hanegal, a handsome lad, is an optimist. He likes to fight, and is always 
        in the persuit of knowledge. Being a wizard makes him disliked by the 
        majority since they feel he is a threat to their position. But Hanegal 
        wishes no one harm. He can be harsh and lose his temper, if you were to 
        wear down his patience with you. Some might say he is arrogant, but he 
        knows better.</p>
      <p>Background:<br>
        Hanegal was born in the outskirts of Freeport as the firstborn son of 
        Hannah and Galvur Grapestomper. When Hanegal was only a child his parents 
        were abducted by a gang of unknown origin. Overwhelmed by an uncertainty 
        of what would become of him, he reached out for a strong hand to guide 
        him. The 'challenge' was picked up by the barbarian Laerer Frasaj of Clan 
        Frasaj, who took it upon himself to teach Hanegal the ways of Mithaniel 
        Marr. </p>
      <p>Later on, now a worshipper of Mithaniel Marr and no longer uncertain, 
        Hanegal delved into deeper into the mysteries of the arcane. He went to 
        the Academy of Arcane Science to study wizardry. With his new education 
        he set as a goal for himself that he would find out his parents fate, 
        even if he would have to search every nook and cranny of Norrath.</p>
