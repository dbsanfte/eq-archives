          <p class="MB_Body">Looks like the melee changes are ready to go live in next weeks patch. Head on over to <a href="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000340.html" target="_blank">this post</a> on the developers corner board to see the whole thread, but in the interests of brevity, I will snip out the part relating to monks here:<p><ul><i><b>-Monks-</b><p>While monks are an excellent class with some very useful abilities, our evaluation of monks found that they were coming up short in regards to damage output. In the progression from level 50 to level 60, monks slowly slip from doing the most toe-to-toe melee damage by a wide margin, to being very slightly better than a warrior in the high-end game.<p>Our goal for monks is to have them do significantly more damage than a similarly equipped warrior, without encroaching on the territory of rogues. We selected improvements for the monk class that place their damage output just below the midpoint of a warrior and a rogue. This is a sufficient damage advantage over a warrior to make a monk desirable in groups and raids, while leaving a large margin between the monk and the backstabbing rogue.<p>To accomplish this damage improvement, the first thing we did was move monks to new damage tables at levels 55 and 60. This means a monk will do slightly more damage than other classes when using the same weapons. This change is moderate at level 55, and a bit more noticeable at 60th.<p>In addition to new damage tables, we also gave the ability to Triple Attack to monks at level 60. This ability allows the monk to possibly attack a third time with his main hand, after each successful double attack. The final change to monks is the institution of minimum damage on Flying Kick beginning at level 51 and scaling up through level 60.<p>Also, much like the rogue, we discovered that monks do not receive a reasonable weapon selection between levels 51 and 60. We plan to add new blunt weapons for monks in the future to round out the monk class.</ul></i><p>Happy days! I will post more on my thoughts on this tomorrow, because its 5am here in London, and I just logged off after 6 hours pulling in ToV, and I need my beauty sleep.</p>

Recently we have been troubleshooting an issue with one of our ISP's. This troubleshooting is ongoing. At this time, by keeping this ISP in the mix, we feel that we can no longer provide the quality of service that EverQuest players have come to expect. We have therefore temporarily turned down our connection to this ISP and re-routed this traffic to our other ISP's. Best efforts are being made to resolve this issue. Once we are convinced the solution has been found we will bring this ISP back online. We apologize for any inconvenience this has caused and will provide an update to the community once the situation is resolved.

</p>
<p>
Here is the preliminary list of rules. To read this information later, you can refer to the testeqnews.txt file in your EverQuest folder.
</p>
<p>
* Firiona Vie Server Feature List *
</p>
<p>
· This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any transfers to this server.
</p>
<p>
· Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.
</p>
<p>
· This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words, it's a standard 'blue' server with the same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the 'Zeks'. 
</p>
<p>
· Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin. 
</p>
<p>
· Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster. 
</p>
<p>
· Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the same location the their Deity is described).
</p>
<p>
· Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required to change alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based on their race, class and deity. 
</p>
<p>
· A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or guild with other characters. (Note: The Guild portion of this code has not yet been implemented, and no guilds will be forming on this server until we can get it working).
</p>
<p>
· A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters. 
</p>
<p>
· A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including resurrections). 
</p>
<p>
· Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone and from /say. 
</p>
<p>
· Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points. 
</p>
<p>
· Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made easily available to certain races. 
</p>
<p>
· One character per account. 
</p>
<p>
· The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. 
</p>
<p>
· Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.
</p>
<p>
· Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on other servers. 
</p>
<p>
· /emote will be language specific 
</p>
<p>
· All characters will be /roleplay. 
</p>
<p>
· /alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that alignment. 
</p>
<p>


* Trivial Loot Code *
</p>
<p>

Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot Code takes effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.

<p>
My question is - if its on the Test Server setup, does this mean the Melee changes that are undergoing testing on "Test" are LIVE on this server as well?

<p>It's a funny little comic starring all your favorite Final Fantasy characters. I like Fighter, he's dreamy, tee-hee!</p>
