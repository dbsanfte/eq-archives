<p><b>Comments</b>

      <p>This sub-area is excellent for newbies.  The zone rarely has anyone else in it.  It can be hunted
	  easily from level 1 to 10, although very little experience will be gained at level 10 as nearly
	  all the creatures in the area would be high greens at best.  With the bank being directly above
	  the area, selling loot, visiting the bank, etc, are a breeze.  Also, the sub-area is nicely sectioned
	  off such that you'd have to make an effort to get to the more dangerous parts of the dungeon.  Ie, 
	  you'd have to swim a nice ways through some of the tunnels cropped off the image above.
	  <br><br>
	  MOBS wander, in various directions, about the paths shown in red above.  If injured, they will attempt
	  to flee via one of the blue paths, based on their proximity to the given path.  NOTE:  An injured MOB
	  can swim at SOW speeds in the water, unless it is VERY low on health.  To get your swimming up, I'd
	  recommend swimming after them a short distance.  But, the moment you get the "xxx is out of range"
	  message, turn back and get back to your camp spot.  After a few moments, 10-15 seconds or so, the MOB
	  will return to greet you.
	  <br><br>
	  For monks, the frogloks are most welcoming.  They randomly drop pieces of netted armor that are
	  very light weight.  At the lower levels, it is imperative that you bring a friend, but from level
	  5 and up, you should be able to take the loks without *too* much hastle, assuming a good spawn :).  
	  Unlike the Frogloks of Guk and other places, there is no faction hit for killing these.  For that 
	  matter, there is no faction hit for killing any of the creatures listed in the table below, with the 
	  beggar being an "unknown" exception (as noted). 	  
	  <br><br>
	  Beggars will sometimes spawn in place of the MOBS.  I hear tale that it is bad faction with the
	  Qeynos Guards to kill them, but I don't know first hand.  I've left them alone.
	  <br><br>
      The only MOBS that showed any outright aggression was the Frogloks, mangy rat, piranha, and Cuburt.  
	  Even then, I had to nearly trip over them to get them to aggro on me.  Everything else seems to ignore 
	  you, even if you are sitting.  The most convenient place to setup camp is the white area directly above
	  the frogloks (#11 on the map above). 
	  <br><br>
	  Killing the miscellaneous MOBS that spawn on the surface (ie, not underwater) will cause Cuburt to
	  occasionally spawn.  Cuburt occassionally drops a "tattered dress".  The dress is a quest item that
	  can be turned in to Zamel (near the pool by the bank in South Qeynos) or to a guard (see 
	  <a href="http://www.allakhazam.com">Allakhazam</a> for more info...) Rewards vary but can be as good 
	  as a +3 INT earring or a Golden Locket with +5 charges of courage, depending on who you decide to turn 
	  the dress in to. 
	  <br><br>
	  Another plus to the area is the various spell components that drop.  Fish scales, Snake scales, Bat wings,
	  and Fire Beetle eyes are relatively abundant over a given period of time.  It's easy to save them in the
	  bank until you have a stack or three, then sell them to your local Druid, Shaman, Magician, etc. 
	  <br><br>
	  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Level 1 - 5, grab a partner and head down (solo not bad either :)).  The two of you will 
	  have a blast.  Level 6 - 9, solo is fine, a partner is better as the two of you can destroy the area.  Once
	  you hit level 10, head out to other parts unknown.  I only tried a group larger than 2 here once, and XP
	  seemed to creep along.  Keep it solo or a partner and you'll see the xp move right along.
	  <br><br>
	  As a point of reference, I did this as a non-twinked newbie.  My played time from level 1 to 25 was 7 days.  
	  Levels 1-10 were spent mostly in the Catacombs with some jaunts out to Blackburrow to break the monotony.  
	  Levels 11-14 were split between Blackburrow and Bandits in West Karana.  Levels 15 - 20 was spent at the 
	  Gorge entrance in East Karana.  Levels 20-25 I varied between Unrest and Splitpaw spires.
