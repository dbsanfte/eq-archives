Nothing much is happening in the world of MMoG's Atm.
</p>
<p>
I got my planetside Beta Info and am playing that game - BADLY - i suck at FPS games esp against other live people. the good news is my motion sickness isn't cropping up. I am currently having fun. good fun game, needs a bit more "depth" but it is fun playing. now to master the art of throwing a grenade.....
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Galaxies - not much there lately, beta 3 is in full swing - i did see a june16th release day on one of the gaming sites and that looks reasonable, they are at ~20k testers with 30k to go, no i am not in the beta, if anyone has an add a frend info thing SEND IT TO ME!!.
</p>
<p>
Horizons - beta 1 going on, not much info
</p>
<p>
Shadowbane is live and doing "OK" so far everything is working, but i have no heard much about the game-however from looking at eq etc, it is not making a significant dent in everquest's popularity.
</p>
<p>
Everquest- the Adjustment to the ring event keying process in poeb means you CAN get 50+ flagged doing the ring once, now if they fixed the Rathe Event.....
</p>
<p>
WoW - nothing new but beta IS rapidly approaching, i know ALOT of eqers are looking forward to trying this one. hoipefully i'll be one of the lucky ones and get into the beta afap. i've beta's alot of games lately. trying to break em all, and finding bugs can be fun esp since its not EXPLOITING in beta :P

** Plane of Earth - part II ** 
</p>
<p>
We're making another change to the method of access to the Plane of Earth B due to the feedback we've received from the community. 
</p>
<p>
If you have an Eroded Passkey, talk to Muzzrap Dirtdigger in the Plane of Tranquility. He will create a planar projection that will allow you to flag 6 members of your raid for entrance into the depths of the Plane of Earth. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the Mystical Arbitor will now spawn a planar projection upon his death that will allow you to flag many more members of your raid. 
</p>

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
Never did an official Editorial...critics be nice
</p>
<p>
Since the dps generated by a single raid is insufficient to kill all 12 of the Rathe(its  "being looked at" by SoE), someone had an idea, 
</p>
<p>
Only need one key per raid, why not bring......
</p>
<p>
MORE PEOPLE...
</p>
<p>
SoE upon hearing of the 200+ trying the rathe, implemented a change to the access to plane of earth b that -upset i think is putting it EXTREMELY mildly- the upper raid guilds</p>
<p>
Single key per person entry to Plane of Earth B.-
</p>
<p>
 AT THE SAME TIME, SoE made the key a random drop off of the ring bosses, with the gnome in knowledge handing out 6 keys per shard you get. so even if you win the event you could get Zero keys after several HRS of the ring event.
</p>
<p>
While the IDEA and the reasoning behind this change might have worked, unfortunately due to the out and out BUGGINESS of the ring event code - after getting 1-3 keys, none of the guilds did the ring event again.
</p>
<p>
SoE ASSUMED(never assume) that the guilds like FoH Afterlife etc were farming the shards, But, they were not. Each guild got enough keys to get into plane of earth b and NEVER touched the ring events again.
</p>
<p>
Thus the problem we have today, pretty much EVERY guild that was in plane of earth B is locked out due to not having sufficient keys to give to the gnome to equip their guild with access... 
</p>
<p>
I have heard they just rebooted PoE A so hopefully the lack of a Definate shard drop EVERY time got fixed. 
</p>
<p>
Sorry Guys in the Top Raid guilds, you've put up with alot of shit, but this one pretty much sucks.
</p>
<p>
Personally, I think SoE should have a GM-Dev logon to EACH server and give all guilds that have fought the Rathe Event enough keys to distribute to all their members. of course this will never happen, though it would be the right thing to do, AND would be a good move by them to improve developer/user relations.
</p>
<P>
EDIT: i knew i forgot something last nite when i did this 
</p>
<p>
There is only one reason i can think of for this change...Plane of Time is NOT ready for "PrimeTime".
</p>
<p>
 SoE says the Plane of Time is ready, i say to them. 
</p>
<p>
Prove it.
</p>
<p>
Fix the buggyness of the Plane of Earth ring events, and fix the Rathe. and make it so the players can get all the keys needed in under a month
</p>
<p>
Prove the majority of players wrong when they say that the plane of time is not ready and that is the reason why the Rathe event is broken.

SoE has a big countdownon the main Everquest Site - they had a nice Teaser puzzle, that everyone pretty much broke in an hr or two(i think Fatal and i were the ones that got the allakhazam one first, or some ranger, we were close in finding it) going for the EQ RTS..eta is 1hr and 15 minutes atm. While this is big news to the EQ "franchise", i think most of the players of EQ are going "oh nice", ie. there is not much excitement about it. 
</p>
<p>
Personally, i have no interest in an EQ RTS. but i'll check it out just to satisfy my curiousity to see what makes it so much different than say WCIII, then go back to camping my mailbox...

** Plane of Earth **
</p>
<p>
We have made some changes to the Earth-Infused Crystal.  If you have one of these crystals, you need to talk to Muzzrap Dirtdigger in the Plane of Tranquility.  He will help you to obtain what you need.
</p>
<p>
From Reading(mostly FoH's Board) what changed is The earth-infused Crystal was the key to PoEb...ie The Rathe. What it was BEFORE the change was, one key per Group, which means one person could bring a whole guild in, the change is, give the crystal to muzzrap, and he gives you in exchange 6 "keys"(forget the name offhand). ie EVERYONE needs a key to PoEB now. now if your guild has several of these keys, you can give lots of new keys out, otherswise, its back to farming buggy ring events every 3 days to get a key/many keys(depends if they changed the drops or not) since its a key and not a flag, i doubt the "15% unflagged rule" will apply. :/
</p>
<p>
What will be interesting to find out is if they FINALLY FIXED the Rathe Encounter when they implemented this change.
