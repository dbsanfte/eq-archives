In order to help our players avoid these scams, we're taking action in the patch on Tuesday. We first considered popping up a confirmation box when attempting to drop coin on the ground, however upon reflection we could not determine a reason why anyone would want to do this, except perhaps when attempting to "self-trade" items and coin between characters. However dropping things on the ground is as you can imagine an extremely unsafe and unsupported way to trade items, and has created more headaches for players and our CS staff than it has done them good. </p><p>To that end, beginning on Tuesday the dropping of coinage will no longer be allowed by the client. Players will of course still be able to destroy it if they wish, for instance, to releave themselves of unwanted copper.</p><p>We look forward to hearing your comments. If there are any reasons that dropping coinage should be allowed that we haven't thought of, please reply and let us know.</p><p>Thanks,</P><p>Gordon Wrinn<br>Associate Producer<br>EverQuest Live and Expansions<br>Sony Online Entertainment<br></p></ul></i></p>        </ul>                <p class="MB_Submit"><br>          <span class="MB_SubHead"><a name="204"></a>Equipment Database Update</span>                     <br>          Submitted by <a href="mailto:zinj@monkly-business.com">Zinj</a> on 11/5/2001 9:58:42 AM</p>        <ul>          <p class="MB_Body"><p>Yep, I did miss some of the hand slot items.

We will be opening a move log from all servers to the new server on November first. We will be giving priority to European players when we move characters, and we will only be accepting a limited number of moves. Obviously we want this server to be used primarily by our European players and we don't want to move so many characters to the server that it becomes too crowded.Here is a schedule for the movelog.</p><p>11/1/01 &#8211; Thursday at 8 am (pst) - Movelog opens.<br>11/5/01 &#8211; Monday at 8 am (pst) - Movelog closes.<br>11/6/01 &#8211; Wednesday &#8211; Moves begin and characters start becoming available to play.<br>11/7/01 &#8211; Thursday &#8211; We expect to finish moving the characters and have them all available to play.<br></p><p>Due to the shear volume of players that we expect will be putting in a request to move, we expect to have to cut the list short. Again, priority will be given to European players on a first come, first served basis.</p><p>If you want to have your characters moved to the new server, here's what you should do.</p><p>Log in on the account and server that you want your characters to be moved from. Pick any character that you have on that server and enter Norrath.</p><p>Then all you have to do is type "/movelog yes" (without the quotation marks) and Enter and you will be on the list to have your characters moved to the new server.</p><p>Alan</p></ul></i></p>        </ul>                <p class="MB_Submit"><br>          <span class="MB_SubHead"><a name="197"></a>2 Patches coming 10/31 and 11/7</span>                     <br>          Submitted by <a href="mailto:lenardo@monkly-business.com">Lenardo</a> on 10/30/2001 4:36:04 PM</p>        <ul>          <p class="MB_Body"><p><i><ul>On Wednesday, October 31st, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch.
