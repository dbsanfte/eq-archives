Giants</em>|Relentless&gt;</font></h1>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Overview</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fire Giant run is considered
one of the &quot;big accomplishments&quot; of any group of
adventurers in their high levels. They can be done with a group
of 6 extremely good players, but to be safe, you will usually
want to bring along 2 groups. Many guilds choose to use 18-24
people as well. There are many different ways of doing Fire
Giants. The method here is the method that my guild uses, and it
has worked very well for us.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Fire Giants are especially fun
to do because they require no camping. It is truly like an
adventure to do Fire Giants. You start at the beginning and work
your way deep into the lair of the Fire Giants, killing the three
powerful Fire Giants, King Tranix, Warlord Skarlon, and Magi
Rokyl. At the end of the adventure, you are treated to a glimpse
of Nagafen's lair, and if the dragon is alive, you can even say
hi to Lord Nagafen himself. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The entire run can take from two
to four hours, depending on your luck, patience, and teamwork.
Our average time for a group of 12 is about 3 hours from start to
finish. If done right, no one needs to die on the run, although
the puller is always at risk, and a failed feign by your puller
can oftentime lead to his death. The initial fight at the
starting of the run can also claim a few lives if it is not done
properly - it is the only part of the run where you must fight
more than one giant at a time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of the named monsters are 100%
spawns, so you are guaranteed to get three good items from this
run every time you do it, assuming you finish it. The run is
necessary to do if you plan on tackling Lord Nagafen, although
usually the number of groups required to do Nagafen will have no
trouble killing the giants on the way.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The respawn for the Fire Giants is
about 6 hours. Because this respawn time is so long, you will
rarely find yourself in the situation where you are camping Fire
Giants, waiting for them to respawn. The only time this really
happens is when you get to the Fire Giants early after knowing
when the previous group killed them. Killing Fire Giants on
respawn is kind of boring, and I don't recommend it. It's alot
more fun to do it properly, with a fully spawned Fire Giant
castle.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Monsters</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are two types of regular
Fire Giants that you will find. Fire Giant Warriors are the
common ones, and once in a while, one of these giants will spawn
instead as a Fire Giant Wizard. You will also usually encounter a
wandering Lava Duct Crawler or two while setting up the run. Fire
Giants range from the rare level 46 one to level 51. On average,
they are level 50. They have a ton of hit points, hit hard (Most
hit for about 135), and cannot be stunned or mesmerized. They
also have the ability to summon their target to their feet if
their target isn't in melee range. This leads to the amusing
&quot;You will not evade me, Jekhar!&quot; lines that are
broadcast throughout the zone. In order to cast spells on them,
casters need to be in melee range or the spell will always be
resisted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fire Giant wizards are wizard
monsters, have less hit points, but can cast Force Strike (about
550 damage). Whenever confronted with multiple giants, kill the
wizards first.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fire Giants typically drop high
level research components (including level 49 ones), throwing
boulders, and fine steel weapons.</font></p>

<h3><font size="3" face="Arial"><u>Chain Pulling</u></font></h3>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The easiest and safest way to
single pull Fire Giants is to use chain pulling. If your puller
hasn't had any practice with this method of pulling, it's
suggested that you practice it in Lower Guk at the King and Lord
camps. For those that don't know how to do this, here's a brief
description:</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are at least two people
involved in the pulling. The first, or primary puller, is a monk
or shadowknight. The second, or chain puller, can be any tank
class, although a monk or shadowknight is safest in case of an
error. Any class with a good range attack can serve this role as
well. He should be in the same group as the puller, should have
his hitpoints buffed as well, and everyone should be set to
assist the chain puller.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">When all groups are ready for a
pull, the primary puller goes out to the monsters, and aggros a
group of them. He runs back towards the group, and when he's
outside the aggro range of all of the monsters that are being
pulled, he feigns death. At this point, the monsters that were
pulled will hang around the feigned puller's body for awhile, and
then start to go home. Hopefully, one of the group will linger
around for longer than the others. When there is just one left,
and the others have had enough time to get a good distane away
from the lingerer, the chain puller comes up and smacks the last
one, and runs it back to the group. If done properly, the others
will be outside of aggro range and will not assist the single
lingerer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The primary puller stays on the
ground till the fight has started, and then he can either lie
there, or check to see if his aggro is clear. Only if he is
certain that nothing is still aggro to him should he return to
the group and help them out.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">There are several variations to
this, including multiple chainings and special casing wanderers
and statics. These intracacies are not necessary, although it is
suggested that your puller learn them in time. For Fire Giants,
you don't need to use any special tricks. Just make sure the
puller knows when he has a wanderer on him, and not to return to
the group unless he's sure that wanderer is no longer aggro.</font></p>

    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Nxx - </strong>Notes</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Break-In</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first part of the Fire GIant
run is, probably, the hardest part. If people are going to die on
the run, chances are this is where it will occur. There may be a
better way to do this, but we haven't found it out. Basically,
you are going to have to deal with at least two Fire Giants at
once, and possibly a third depending on how fast you are.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Have your puller go into the first
room at <strong>C1</strong> and feign there. He should stay
feigned and wait for the patroller, <strong>G3</strong>, to come
and go. Once he thinks <strong>G3</strong> is far enough out of
aggro range, all the groups should be buffed up and run into the
room <strong>C1</strong> and attack the giants. How to best deal
with fighting two or three at once is up to the group. Usually
Togor's Insects and a secondary tank taunting the second giant
will do the trick. After the first two giants (<strong>G1 </strong>and
<strong>G2</strong>), the patroller <strong>G3</strong> should
about be ready to come back. Your party should be ready for him
and kill him. After these three giants are dead, the area is
secure and your party is pretty much good to go. No other giants
come near here, so your group can rest up and get full. Patience
is an important virtue when doing Fire Giants, and with a 6 hour
spawn time, there is no need to rush things, especially on your
first few runs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After you ressurect everyone that
died and get everyone to full, you can start pulling the Fire
Giants.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em>Note: Currently on
Cazic-Thule, and perhaps other servers, the wanderers in the Fire
Giant area are bugged, and instead of walking around, they
teleport from place to place. If allowed to run, they can call
reinforcements from anywhere along their path, even if the
reinforcements are way out of aggro range. The first wanderer can
pull Tranix if this teleport bug exists. Beware.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tranix Section</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">For this entire section, your
party should be fighting at <strong>C1</strong>. No one should
leave the room except the pullers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first pull will be painful for
the puller. The puller should move forward up to the entrance to
the castle. Just past the doors at <strong>N2</strong> are two
Fire Giants. The puller should aggro these guys and run back
towards the group, feigning at <strong>F1</strong>. On this first
pull, you will aggro King Tranix, who is close enough to the
other giants to come charging at you. King Tranix is a
shadowknight, and has a nasty Harm Touch which the puller will
definitely notice. In any of the next 5 pulls you might get King
Tranix. Treat Tranix as any other Fire GIant, and he should fall
pretty easily when alone. The chain puller should be waiting
around the corner for the signal from the primary puller. When
the primary puller tells him, he should round the corner and
aggro the (hopefully) single fire giant standing above the
puller's body.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Depending on which Fire Giants you
kill in this round, you should get either one or two FGs on the
next pull. If you get Tranix early, it will make the rest of this
a little easier. I'll assume you don't get Tranix on these, and
instead kill <strong>G4</strong> and <strong>G5</strong>.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If Tranix is alive, and you get
unlucky, you will now have to pull the throne room, which include
Tranix, <strong>G6, G7, </strong>and possible <strong>G8.</strong>
The puller should pull these in the same way, although the run
will now be longer, and the door at N2 might make things hurt a
little more. If you have a spare necro, shadowknight, or monk
handy, they should be able to stay at the door and keep it open
for the puller, saving him a few hit points.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">After running all four of these
guys back to <strong>F1</strong> and killing them one by one, you
should be clear to do Skarlon. By this point, all the giants from
<strong>G1-G8</strong> and <strong>Tranix</strong> should all be
dead. Tranix drops the </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/polishedmithriltorque.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Polished Mithril Torque</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> (common) and the </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/crownoftranix.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Crown of King Tranix</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). The Torque is generally considered
an item for hybrids (rangers, paladins, and shadowknights), while
the crown is mainly used by enchanters and bards, as well as
monks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Skarlon Section</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, depending on how much trust
you have in your party's abilities to follow directions, you can
either have everyone move forward to <strong>C2</strong>, or have
everyone stay at <strong>C1</strong> for the next two pulls. If
your group chooses to stay at <strong>C1, </strong>the puller
will have a painful pull, but since it's only two giants, it
shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you choose to move up to <strong>C2</strong>,
make sure that everyone knows that they should stay along the <strong>left</strong>
(That is the <strong>east</strong>) wall in the throne room, and <strong>not</strong>
to fight near the west wall, where they can end up aggroing FGs
through the wall.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If staying at <strong>C1</strong>,
pull <strong>Skarlon</strong> and <strong>G9</strong> the same
was that you pulled Tranix, and then have everyone move up to <strong>C2</strong>.
If you decide to fight at <strong>C2</strong>, then have everyone
stay up against the wall, have the primary puller feign at <strong>F2</strong>,
such that the chain puller can see the giants through the
doorway. When the puller gives the signal, the chain puller
should get the single FG and bring it back to the party at <strong>C2</strong>.
After killing <strong>G9 </strong>and<strong> Skarlon</strong>,
you are now clear to wander around the throne room, take
screenshots, etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Skarlon drops the </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/mithvambraces.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Mithril Vambraces</font></a><font size="2"
face="Arial"> (rare), the </font><a

size="2" face="Arial">Mithril Greaves</font></a><font size="2"
face="Arial"> (common), and the </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/razingsw.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Razing Sword of Skarlon</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> (very rare). The Greaves are mainly for
Rogues and Rangers, the Vambraces are good for Warriors,
Paladins, Shadowknights, Rangers, and Rogues. The Razing Sword is
great for Paladins and Shadowknights, and good for Warriors as
well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Bridge Section</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next few pulls are probably
the easiest set. Your group should be set up at <strong>C2</strong>,
and your puller needs to pull <strong>G10, G11, </strong>and the
wanderer, <strong>G12</strong> from across the drawbridge, and
feign at <strong>F3</strong>. Standard chain pulling works fine
here, and the chain puller has a very short run back to the
group. The only thing to watch out for here is the drawbridge
closing. If it does close, it can be opened by the chain puller
on the near side, or a lever on the far side located at <strong>N3</strong>.
After killing these three guys, have your puller get all the hp
buffs possible and prepare for the hardest set of pulls. If you
have multiple monks/shadowknights, now is the best time to make
use of them and set up a chain.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Dragon Head Room</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">These pulls are especially hard
because you will have a total of four giants attacking you, and
need to pull them a pretty good distance. Plus, due to the
location of the drawbridge, your chain puller will have slight
difficulty as well. The way we handle this is to have a 3rd party
member, usually a warrior or other tank, assigned to drawbridge
duty. They will stand before the drawbridge, off to the side and
out of line of sight. Whenever the drawbridge closes, they will
re-open it. This is a must, because if your chain puller can't
feign, and the drawbridge is up when he is chaining, he will
almost certainly die.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The primary puller should aggro
the four giants in what is called the dragon head room (<strong>G13
- G16</strong>). He should then run back towards the bridge and
feign at <strong>F4</strong>. If he can't make it that far,
feigning anywhere on the bridge is fine as well. Some pullers
prefer to have Dead Man Floating for this part, because of the
danger of falling into the lava. I'm not too scared of the lava,
and prefer not to have DMF on me, mostly so that I can jump to
make the pull just that much faster.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The secondary puller should be
waiting by the drawbridge and out of line of sight. When the monk
says it's clear to pull, he'll run across the drawbridge, tag the
single fire giant, and run back to the party. The person on
drawbridge duty will follow behind the chain puller as well and
the group will work on killing the giant. The primary puller can
stand up, make sure he's clear, and open the drawbridge himself
with the lever.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The second pull will be slightly
easier, since there will only be three giants left. And the third
pull should be quite easy. Rather than pull the fourth guy all
the way, I have my party move up to the next point and fight him
there.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Rokyl Section</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final part of the Fire Giant
run is the coolest, where the party gets to see some awesome
architecture, and maybe Nagafen himself. At this point, you
should only have one giant in <strong>G13-G16</strong> left. The
entire party should move up to <strong>C3</strong>. when doing
this, have one person in the party assigned to open the
drawbridge. Make sure everyone else knows not to touch it. If
your party isn't the brightest lot, have a necro cast Dead Man
Floating on all of them. I can't tell you how many times I've
seen people die because someone else closed the drawbridge at the
wrong time. If someone does fall in the lava, don't panic.
There's an easy way out at <strong>N1</strong>. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once everyone in the group has
gotten to <strong>C3</strong>, you are ready for the final set of
pulls. First pull the last remaining giant in the dragon head
room. After he's been eliminated, get your puller buffed up with
magic resist, and have him get ready for the final 1-3 pulls. By
this time everyone is usually tired, so alot of times it's best
to just get Rokyl on the first pull. Especially if Nagafen is in,
where pulling Rokyl when he's the last one alive is quite a pain.
Rokyl is a wanderer, so pulling him alone shouldn't be too hard
if you know how to isolate wanderers.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If the puller aggros either <strong>G17
</strong>of <strong>G18</strong>, Rokyl may or may not aggro to
you depending on where along his path he is. It's best to get him
to aggro to you for reasons I'll explain later. If Nagafen is in,
he'll aggro as well. Enjoy the claws for 225, and run as quickly
as possible to <strong>F5</strong>. Feign there. Nagafen won't
follow you this far, but the other 3 will. If you think you can
get Rokyl easily alone, get him now. Once you kill Rokyl, you can
consider the FG run over. Or, you might want to finish the job
and get <strong>G17 </strong>and <strong>G18</strong> as well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you kill <strong>G17 </strong>and
<strong>G18 </strong>before killing Rokyl, you have one of two
situations to deal with. If Nagafen isn't alive, your party can
pretend Rokyl is Nagafen, and charge him in Naggy's lair and kill
him off. This is probably the most fun. If Nagafen is alive, then
buff your puller and pray. Have him run into the lair and aggro
either Nagafen or Rokyl. They will both obviously aggro. Now your
puller has to make a somewhat long run back to <strong>F5</strong>,
where your chain puller can pick off Rokyl and finish him off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">Magi Rokyl is a wizard, and drops
the </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/polishedmithmask.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Polished Mithril Mask</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> (common), and </font><a
href="http://www.gameznet.com/eq/equipment/rokylscrystal.html"><font
size="2" face="Arial">Rokyl's Channeling Crystal</font></a><font
size="2" face="Arial"> (rare). The mask is great for int casters,
and good for priest classes as well (for the AC). The channeling
crystal is pretty good for int casters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial">And now you should be finished
with the Fire Giants, and you can pack up and head out. Evac the
tanks out, unless they feel confident running through the bats
and bugs to get to lavastorm. If everyone still wants to do
something, head to the Efreeti Lord or kill the stone spider.
There's no real point to waiting around for a respawn, since it
is 6+ hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Notes</strong></font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N1 - </strong>If you
        fall into the lava here, most likely due to a drawbridge
        problem, don't panic. Swim around to N1, where you can
        get back onto dry land.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N2 - </strong>There's
        a door here that you need to open. If you are pulling
        Tranix's room, the door will probably close before you
        get back. This means you'll take a couple more seconds of
        damage waiting for it to open.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N3 - </strong>There
        is a switch here that will open the drawbridge from this
        side.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N4 - </strong>There
        is a door here which is considered the final door to
        Nagafen's Lair. If you don't open this door, nothing on
        the inside (Two guards, Rokyl, and Nagafen) should aggro
        to you. If you are planning on charging the lair, have
        your group line up before the door, but don't open the
        door till you are ready to charge.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>N5</strong> - If you
        fall into the lava here, usually during the initial
        break, you can swim up the lava river to the northwest.
        You should arrive at land near the stone spider room. If
        you keep swimming up this way, you'll get to near the
        noble room. If someone dies in the lava here, you'll need
        to drag their corpse to the stone spider area.</font></li>
