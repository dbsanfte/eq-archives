<p><b>Comments</b>
	
      <p>The Sewer Run *should* be no problem from level 1 on, although some of the mobs may be a bit too
	  high just yet.  Safest bet is to hit the run from level 5+.  From level 10, little to no experience 
	  will be gained, but the items make it worth the effort.  With the Bank being at one end of the run
	  and the Gates being at the other end, "The Sewer Run" is well suited for those runs in from BlackBurrow
	  or back out to BlackBurrow.  The path is nicely sectioned off such that you'd have to make an effort 
	  to get to the more dangerous parts of the dungeon.  
	  <br><br>
	  On the map above, various rats, snakes, spiders, bats, etc spawn around the site marked as 1.  Vin Moltor, a
	  Quest NPC, can be found here as well.  
	  <br><br>
	  Around mark 2, Bait Masterson can be found, although it is more common to find a skeleton or wimpy skeleton.  
      <br><br>
	  At mark 3 you can acquire a Limestone Ring from an Undead Knight.  He is actually swimming in the niche.  His
	  placeholder is typically a fish.  The Limestone ring grants +5 hp.  He was green to me when I first encountered
	  him but appeared to be similiar in power to a normal skeleton.
	  <br><br>
	  Mark 4 is where the "a small alligator" or "a bloated alligator" spawns.  No real significance that I've seen.
	  <br><br>
	  The "Alligator Tooth Earring" is found on "an injured rat" at mark 5.  This is a two spawn location that seems to
	  vary between the "an injured rat" and "a large rat".  Either are easily killed.  Spawn rate seems to be about 5
	  mins.  The "an injured rat" always dropped one earring.
	  <br><br>
	  The "a shady mercenary" (drops the Thick Black Cape) and "a mercenary" are at mark 6.  They con'd indifferent to
	  me, an agnostic monk.  I didn't attack as they were green, I wasn't sure of the faction hit I'd take, and really
	  don't care to have the Thick Black Cape.  The "a sepsis rat" spawns here as well, but poses no threat.
	  <br><br>
      Three rats and a gelatinous cube congregate at mark 7.  The "a nesting rat" drops the Golden Locket.  The "a large 
	  rat" will sometimes show as a placeholder.  The rats and the cube seem to be on different spawn timers.  The rats
	  spawned after roughly 5 mins, the cube seemed to take 10 or more.  A zombie walked up on us while we were killing
	  the rats once.  He showed no aggression.  We attacked and took him out with ease.  He dropped "a sealed letter" that
	  is lore.  The note goes to Wolten Grafe at the South Qeynos Paladin Guild.
	  <br><br>
	  **See the <a href="http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=151">Qeynos Catacombs Subsection Analysis I - Froglok</a> Guide for more info on 
	  the Froglok Area.	    
	  <br><br>
	  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Level 1 - 4, if solo, run the path, but only hit the "An Injured Rat" and Cuburt if they con
	  within your range.  During those levels, two HP +5 earrings and/or a +3 INT earring are nice to have or sell.  
	  If grouped, add "A Nesting Rat" and the Frogloks to the hit list.  Level 5+, wreak havoc :), just be careful
	  of 3 "blue" Frogloks.
	  <br><br>
	  As a point of reference, I did this as a non-twinked newbie.  My played time from level 1 to 25 was 7 days.  
	  Levels 1-10 were spent mostly in the Catacombs with some jaunts out to Blackburrow to break the monotony.  
	  Levels 11-14 were split between Blackburrow and Bandits in West Karana.  Levels 15 - 20 was spent at the 
	  Gorge entrance in East Karana.  Levels 20-25 I varied between Unrest and Splitpaw spires.
