Wtf is that, Vacation?
</p>
<p>
this is to let you all know that the news from the 11th to the 15th will be really really slow since I will not be working(I ususally do the news from work). By vacation I mean, I'll be packing the 12 years worth of stuff I accumulated in my apartment and tossing it in boxes for the 21st when the movers arrive and move into the house that the wife & I purchased in june. 
</p>
<p>
I also lose my DSL service the 21st until earthlink gets it up and running again (put the call in, just have to wait til it is reinstalled). until then I will have dialup. Now I just have to remember where the modem is.

          <p class="MB_Body"><p>
here is what happened:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
On Thursday July 24 CR Gaming experienced a massive hardware failure which took out our primary database server. This failure had the result of preventing any of our websites to function.
</p>
<p>
Over the last week we have been working feverishly to rebuild a replacement server and recover the data from the old server in order to get ourselves back online.
</p>
<p>
I would like to send out an enormous thanks to Paul Denning our Senior Programmer and Drew Goya our System Engineer who have worked miracles to get us back online as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
The large delay in getting back online was due to our hosting company failing to provide backups we had been paying them to do. This has resulted in, amongst other things, our plans to relocate our servers to a new location. We hope that any further downtime during our DNS change will be very small given the recent issues but in the end our servers should find themsleves in a happier home.
</p>
<p>
I would also like to thank all of you who emailed in offering servics or support in assisting us to get back online. We appreciate your generosity enormously.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, thanks to all of you who visit our website network. We will be working hard to get the websites back up to date with all that has happened while we were down. -Baelish

SoE has just put their August future plans up - pretty much exactly the same as the July Plans - with LDoN a month a way..i don't expect anything to be done except for the zone revamps until after LDoN..of course the LAST melee "adjustment" (Monk Nerf) went into effect about a week or two before PoP's Release-and screwed up monks for months.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<i>
Future Plans for August, 2003
</p>
<p>
Those of us behind the scenes here on the EverQuest team have plans for the future of the game.  Further Down the Line is where we will keep you informed about what those plans are.  Please understand that these are our long-term plans and may require a fair amount of research or development time.
</p>
<p>
Several partial zone revamps coming to the Live servers.  Though delayed several weeks, we are working to complete the partial revamps of several zones:  The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and Velketor's Labyrinth.  We chose these zones to update based on feedback from players, and plan to implement changes that will make these zones more entertaining to play in.
</p>
<p>
Plane of Mischief changes going to the Legends server later next month.  The Plane of Mischief is the home of the trickster, Bristlebane.  One of the most unusual places to visit in EverQuest, this zone is in need of a revamp.  We're looking at it now and plan to have changes ready for Legends later in August.  We'll be keeping the wacky style of the place while at the same time making it a bit more playable.
</p>
<p>
Items in the Planes of Power
</p>
<p>
We will be looking at the quality of Planes of Power item rewards and improving them where appropriate.  Items for many of the lower tier gods will be upgraded and more rare items and NPCs will be added to the following zones as needed:
</p>
<p>
Crypt of Decay<br>
Plane of Torment<br>
Halls of Honor<br>
Plane of Tactics<br>
Plane of Innovation<br>
Bastion of Thunder
</p>
<p>
Class Balance
</p>
<p>
We're still planning to take a look at improving the damage capabilities of melee classes, as they've fallen behind their magic-using counterparts at the very high end of the game.  Finding the proper solutions for this situation will take some time.  Some options being considered are:
</p>
<p>
Improve melee damage-increasing disciplines<br> 
Improve Planes of Power melee weapons 
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we're looking at the concerns from players about their spells, and changing them where appropriate.  The goal here is to remove annoying issues with spells, not necessarily to increase caster power overall.
</p>
<p>
Shields and blocking
</p>
<p>
We're planning on reviewing the possibility of giving an innate chance to block when using a shield.  We've been hoping to do this for a while, and it should be getting a realistic review in the near future.  We'd like to increase the value of shields, and make it a worthwhile choice for players who might normally dual-wield weapons or use a two-handed weapon.  We plan on balancing this against classes which use shields by default, and therefore wouldn't be making any trade-offs to equip a shield.

SoE has not updated their scheduled downtime page yet so there is no time given for length, but this is what is going in -Hmm Deeper Nagafen's Lair? for LDoN?:
<p>
<p>
Upcoming for August 6th, 2003
</p>
<p>
It's been a little hectic around here lately, with all the Live, Legends and expansion work going on.  We're busy in that good way, where you get a lot done every day but tomorrow there's just as much to do.
</p>
<p>
New adventure unearthed in Lavastorm!  In the depths of the Lavastorm mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he's already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn't have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he's a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?
</p>
<p>
We will be adding platinum to the Shared Bank.  In order to allow folks to transfer money between characters on the same account in the same way that they can now transfer items, we will be adding a spot in the Shared Bank for placing platinum. 
</p>
<p>
New filters and chat message options will be added.  We have separated pet melee messages into their own category.  You will be able to send them to whichever chat window you want, or filter them out completely in the Options window.  We have also added the ability to send /random messages to any chat window you'd like.  There is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, you can't claim that you didn't see the /random that you lost just to force a re-roll).
</p>
<p>
New fletching recipes will be added.  We're adding a few new fletching recipes.  The resultant items will only be usable by Rangers that worship Karana, and will be comparable to their Tunare counterparts.
</p>
<p>
Guktan Illusion will be implemented.  Yup, the long-awaited new illusions will be available.  While the old Illusion: Froglok spell is just as popular as ever, folks have been asking for an illusion based on the new Froglok models.  After our next update, both will be available.
</p>
<p>
Adding summoned Burning Affliction items to the Magician's arsenal.  Four new summoned items with the new Burning Affliction focus ability will be introduced.  This rounds out the Magician's ability to create summoned focus items.
</p>
<p>
/memspellset command will be added.  This new command will allow you to memorize the spell set you indicate (using the corresponding number) from the command line or from a hot button.
</p>
<p>
Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we expect to change next week.

Apparently only for 36 people or less but - going back to the less "massive" raid size is good imo- with the instancing, can we say multiple raids at once?
</p>

Lost Dungeons of Norrath - Raid Content
</p>
<p>
In designing Lost Dungeons of Norrath, we haven't forgotten about those who enjoy raiding. In addition to the multitude of rewarding single-group adventures, LDoN also includes exciting and challenging events targeted at six groups or less.
</p>
<p>
For the first time, raids take place in truly private zones, where your groups can test their mettle and focus solely on the task at hand. Instead of limiting the availability of content by who can get there first, this new system only limits participation based on whether or not you have recently succeeded or failed at each event within a given period. This allows us to place a heavy emphasis on skill, while remaining in control of the influx of new items into the game.
</p>
<p>
While our primary focus for LDoN is the single group experience, we are working diligently to ensure that these new raids are centered around the principles of organizational tactics, individual skill, and most importantly - fun. 
</p>
<p>
We feel that the core content and rewards in the Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will entertain and benefit even the most experienced players. We are aware of the desire for high-end raid content and will continue to address and meet those needs over time.
