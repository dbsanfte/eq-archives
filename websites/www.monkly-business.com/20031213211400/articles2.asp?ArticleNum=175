Caelum Infinitum Guild

<p>
This is a guide to the item : Crown of Deceit

<p>
Step 1 : Faction
</p>
<p>
This faction work is just as bad, if not worse, than the faction associated
with the chardok quests. For this quest, you need to work up your faction
with the live side (upper) guk frogs to warmly or better. Warmly is 1 step
below ally. To get your faction up, you need to kill the dead side frogs in
lower guk. Pretty much anything with the word "Undead" in the title of
their name. I personally leveled from 50-55 and got 3 AA points soloing
dead side frogs, and was STILL scowling when i started doing this quest.
Luckily, some races (humans) start at dubious, unless you killed live frogs
like myself in your younger years. Its a lot of work, and is a bit harder
than chardok faction because the monsters you need to kill are higher
level. Lower guk is generally a 35-50th level dungeon (at least it used to
be). My recommendations are to find a wizard and/or mage to go down with
you and start AE'ing mobs, getting a lot of faction. At the time i'm
writing this guide, the quest is relatively new and a lot of players are
after the item, so if your lucky you might find some AE groups down there.
Remember, it only takes you being on the hate list of the monster to get a
faction hit, so if you're not pulling for the AE group, get an insta-click
item (bracer of the hidden for example) and spam it on the puller. Since
its a buff (see invis), it makes the mobs angry at you and you'll get the
faction hits. If you don't have a bracer of the hidden, you're velious
quest legs (if you have them) work alright, but its a VERY long cast time,
and lots of frogs will be dead by the time it goes off. I suggest just
trying to smack as many frogs as you can at least once. 
</p>
<p>
Another thing to note is that the frogs in Old Seb now give live side guk
faction. So if you're in the mid to upper 50's, hunt in old seb. The exp is
good, and the faction is a nice bonus. Much better than slaughtering
hundreds of just-barely green mobs. 
</p>
<p>
Also, the lord now rarely drops an item : 
</p>
<p>
GHOUL LORD SCALP<br>
MAGIC ITEM LORE NO DROP<br>
Slot: HEAD<br>
AC: 5<br>
This item has a faction modifier.<br>
CHA+2<br>
WT: 0.5 Size: TINY<br>
Class: WAR CLR SHD MNK ROG SHM NEC WIZ MAG ENC BST<br>
Race: HUM ERU DEF HEF TRL OGR GNM IKS<br>
Deity: Bertoxxulous Cazic-Thule Innoruuk Rallos Zek<br>
</p>
<p>
IDs as: This item gives positive faction to Frogloks of Guk. 
</p>
<p>
It will raise you several levels, but notice that it is Evil Gods only.
That means no hummies (like me). Another way to get your faction higher is
have an enchanter cast Trickster's Augmentation on you, it will raise you
another couple levels. 
</p>
<p>
Another thing to note, if you are an Iksar you start off at KOS. Another
monk here at monkly business, Sloe Moe, Parsed his faction hits and
reported that it took 3,000 hits to get to threatening WITH the scalp, and
another 500 to dubious. At 4,000 faction hits (total) his faction maxed out
at indifferent (without the scalp). He was amiable with the scalp on.
Amiable is LOWER than warmly, so iksars *NEED* to have tricksters cast on
them to raise their faction. Humans, on the other hand, can reach ally
faction without any modifiers (tricksters or the scalp). 
</p>
<p>
This faction work WILL take a long time, probably longer than chardok if
you're an iksar, or killed the live side frogs before. 
</p>
<p>
Step 2 : Sage Ballic
</p>
<p>
You need to find Sage Ballic in the Plane of Knowlege at Loc -12, +62
</p>
<p>
You say, 'Hail, Sage Ballic'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic says, 'Greetings friend. Welcome to my place of private
contemplation. I relax here and leaf through my old studies, admiring at
creations from the past made by races we thought would never amount to
anything. My favorite tomes to look at are those that deal with Frogloks.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What frogloks?'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic says 'A surprising race to study is the Frogloks of Antonica.
While we may think their magic was weak, it was at one time so powerful the
Gods reached down and smote them for their creations. Balls of energy that
made life into magic! Their High Enchanter even made a mask that
transformed the wearer into a Teir'Dal! Quite an interesting race worthy of
some study if you ask me, someday I shall like to go and see these
frogloks, especially to learn more knowledge of the magical mask.
</p>
<p>
You say, 'What magical mask?'
</p>
<p>
Sage Ballic blinks and looks at you. 'I have told you all that I know, for
more knowledge you will need to seek it's creator. The enchanter is more
than likely very old, the mask having been made at the height of the power
of the Froglok Race. Here take this picture book to aid you in your quest.'
Sage Ballic hands you a book.
</p>
<p>
Step 3 : The old Froglok
</p>
<p>
Here's where your guk faction comes in. You need to find "An old froglok"
in upper guk. The Old Froglok is a mid 30's enchanter, and spawns near the
3 walkway pool near the big ramp up to priest. Hand him the book and : 
an old froglok backflips and says, 'Frroooaaaaaakkkk! I'm in this book! You
see me! Owww that flip hurt my old bones! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! Look there is a
picture of my maaask from long ago! Frroooaaaaaakkkk! I keep book! You
taaake this recipe! Maaaybe more! I'm in book! Frroooaaaaaakkkk!'<br>
Your faction standing with Frogloks of Guk got better.
</p>
<p>
He gives you an Elf Essence Recipe LORE NO DROP note. It says:
</p>
<p>
"Grind up the parts of both the elves of dark and the elves of light, of
which descended from the same tree. A source of celestial liquid as the
base and the fungus from this scroll shall cause a reaction that will
decant the pure essence. 
</p>
<p>
Step 4 : The Ingredients
</p>
<p>
You need 4 ingredients : <br>
Reet Froglok crown<br>
Elf Essence<br>
Velium Mastadon fur cloak<br>
Vial of purified Mana<br>
</p>
<p>
A) Elf Essence, according to the recipe is the following. These need to be
combined in a mortar and pistol, and is a no-fail combine.<br> 
1x woodelf part<br>
1x dark elf part<br>
recipe<br>
1x celes essence<br>
</p>
<p>
Woodelf and Darkelf parts can be found in the following areas.
</p>
<p>
Dark Elf Parts <br>
 Dark elf casters in Najena<br> 
 Kizdean Gix in West Commons <br>
 Dragoon Zytl in West Commons <br>
 Coerced dark elves in Dalnir <br>
 Dark elf pirates in Ocean of Tears<br> 
 Tempus in Upper Guk <br>
 Giz Dintree in East Freeport<br> 
 Lockjaw the crocodile in Oasis <br>
 Ambassador Dvinn in Crushbone <br>
 Dark elves in Befallen <br>
Wood Elf Parts <br>
 Wood Elf bandits in Greater and Lesser Faydarks<br> 
 Wood Elf slaves in Crushbone <br>
 Rangers at station in Lesser Faydark<br> 
 Wood Elves on Sister Island in Ocean of Tears<br> 
 Lockjaw the crocodile in Oasis <br>
</p>
<p>
Celestial Essence can be made in a mortar and pistol (another no-fail
combine). If you have PoP, then visit Darius Gandril (52, 1530) in Plane of
Knowledge for celestial solvent, and Loran Thu`Leth (-112, 1407) in Plane
of Knowledge for Scent of Marr. Combine them for Celestial Essence. 
</p>
<p>
B) The Reet Froglok Crown is dropped by Reet Frogs in Old Sebelis. Its a
semi-rare drop, but not ultra rare (i got 2 in about 2 hours there with a
group, and a friend of mine said he saw 4 in a couple hours, so it seems to
drop approx. 1 per hour, which isn't very rare at all). Unfortunately it is
NO-DROP. The reet frogs are approximately level 55 and are found near the
sebelite juggernauts, just before the area leading to trakanon.
</p>
<p>
C) Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak
</p>
<p>
The reciple is 4x Velium mastodon furs + 1x vial of purified mana (see part
D) + 1x platinum thread + 1x Cloak Pattern. This is NOT trivial to a 250
tailor with a geerlok. All the items, however, are droppable, and the final
item is this : 
</p>
<p>
Velium Mastodon Fur Cloak<br>
MAGIC ITEM<br>
Slot: BACK<br>
AC: 10<br>
STR: +10 STA: +10<br>
SV COLD: +10<br>
Weight: 4.0 Size: MEDIUM<br>
Class: ALL<br>
Race: ALL<br>
</p>
<p>
The Cloak is also droppable. I suggest finding a master tailor on your
server, and finding out how much they charge for a combine. When i did this
quest, my tailor (250 skill with geerlok) failed the first one, and didn't
charge me, then suceeded on the second and charged me 3k (fennin ro), which
i felt was resonable considering how hard tailoring is to raise to 250.
Also this was when the quest first came out. As for difficulty, i asked him
and he said he was 10 for 13, 10 for 14 after failing my first. 
</p>
<p>
Velium Mastodon furs : 
</p>
<p>
Velium Mastodon Fur<br>
WT: 0.8 Size: SMALL<br>
Class: ALL<br>
Race: ALL<br>
stackable<br>
</p>
<p>
These drop in western wastes off of "A glacier mastodon". They are
semi-rare drops, but the mastodons themselves are also rare, and hard to
find without a tracker. Velium hounds appear to be the placeholders, but
this is not comfirmed. At level 61 with half-decent gear i was able to solo
them, some were light blue. They are also commonly sold in bazaar, since
people know they are used for the quest. I spoke to people who said they
were out there soloing for several hours and only got a couple furs. If you
have the money, i suggest buying in bazaar if you can find a decent price,
if not then soloing them (or if you have a druid friend, all the better),
is a good idea as well.
</p>
<p>
Platinum threads and Cloak Pattern are both vendor baught items. 
</p>
<p>
D) Vial of Purified Mana : 
</p>
<p>
This is an enchanter made item. Use the level 49 spell "Purify Mana", which
requires 4x rubies and 1x poison vial as components. It creates a "Vial of
Purified mana". As you may notice you really need 2 of these overall for
the quest. Poison Vials are sold in West Karana off Gindlin Toxfodder
(-2989 , -13399), or made with the pottery skill. 
</p>
<p>
Step 4. The Turnin
</p>
<p>
Congratulations, You've just collected all the items. Now pay the Old
Froglok in Guk another visit, and hand him the 4 items : Reet Froglok
crown, Elf Essence, Velium Mastadon fur cloak, Vial of purified Mana to
receive your Crown of Deceit.
