	<STRONG>Vision:</STRONG><BR>
	<BR>
	To create a guild that is self sufficient and able to tackle the most difficult places in Norrath while maintaining strong interaction with the Knights of Eternal Good. [With our relationship with KEG be able to have 2 war parties on the norrath at the same time.<BR>
	<BR>

	<STRONG>COP defined:</STRONG><BR>
	<BR>
	COP is the set of people that have decided to follow the Way of Plilo.  Many of them can not define what exactly the way is but they know it in their hearts.  They feel invigorated from it.  They have chose to cast off their previous lives and follow their new master; Plilo.

	<STRONG>Membership:</STRONG><BR>
	<BR>
	
	To become a member of COP you need to talk to the recruiting officer or your particular <A HREF="../../memberInfo/currLeaders/currLeaders.html#classLeaders">class leader</A>.  Basically our requirements are as follows:<BR>
	
	<BR>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    not be an asshole. (ie have good standing among the everquesters)
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    not be loot focused.  loot is important and we all understand that but it needs to be secondary to having fun.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    need to show interest in the guild and make strong effort to go on guild raids.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    Be a strong player.  If you don't have the skills I am sorry COP is not the place for you.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	    Be level 42+.  COP wants to do the HARD zones in norrath and low level folx just don't further that goal.  In addition by lvl 42 you have hopefully evolved out of the newbie stages of life.
	  </LI>
	  <LI>
	  </LI>
	</UL>

	<STRONG>COP organizational structure defined:</STRONG><BR>
	<BR>
	<UL>
	  <LI>
	    COP is a dictatorship for all intensive purposes.  Normally dictatorships don't really scale as all decisions must go through a single point.  So, we add a delegation factor in which we can delegate authority (this allows us to scale).
	  </LI>
	  
	  <LI>
	    COP is lead by a dictator who's word is final in all disagreements and decisions.
	  </LI>
	  
	  <LI>
	    The dictator has a council of whom he may ask advice from.  The council consists of 5 people.
	  </LI>
	  
	  <LI>
	    In addition for EACH class there is a class leader who is the representative for that class. The dictator will decide when a class leader is needed.
	  </LI>    
	  
	  <LI>
	    For EACH warparty that is created there is a warparty coordinator/leader.  This person is called the FIST.  Their job is to be in charge of the raid.  They may delegate the coordination/invite task to another.
	  </LI>
