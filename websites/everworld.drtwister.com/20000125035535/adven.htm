  <p><b>In a land far far away (well not to far but far enough), Lived a dwarf 
    a misguided dwarf called Dardolur who was raped and patched everyday by his 
    father VERANT. Then one day he had enough of the continuous patching he beat 
    his father Verant to death with JM BOOTS which his father took away a week 
    beforehand in this patch. Standing over his Verants corpse for a few minutes 
    he heard shouts of &quot;has anyone seen my corpse&quot; and he stood there 
    laughing &quot;muahhahah&quot; he cackled,&quot;That's it I've had enough&quot;he 
    said . As he stepped over the bloody corpse he thought that he would go and 
    fuck up norrath for good (but I think Verant has done a good enough job at 
    it already). So later the day he gathered his friend KARIK a dwarf with many 
    talents like jumping though walls and roofs(<a href="jump.jpg">see pic 1</a> 
    <a href="roof.jpg">pic 2</a>) and of course his main skill dying quite a bit.Dardolur 
    thought to himself &quot;I know my father will be back to wreak my plans but 
    I will dupe all my cash which he had banned me and others from doing to get 
    the best gear&quot;. So he set of to get exp so he could carry out his plans 
    so he took the way of a cleric and set of on his travels and on the way he 
    met a dwarf called Dengor a weird dwarf paladin,doesn't talk much, dies allot 
    and runs in circles quite a bit and together with his other friend karik they 
    hunted. They started on small monsters since they were new to fighting nearly 
    every cool place was not suited to them so they went rat bashing (which got 
    fucking boring but they must do it for 5 years).</b></p>
