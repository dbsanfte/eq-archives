  <p><b>Sorry if ive been away for a while theres been nothing to rant about really 
    but in the past couple of week verant and cerf-net have been having problems 
    which verant claim they know whats going on but they dont know shit. </b></p>
  <p><b>Right the other day on karanas server in blackburrow this cunt decided 
    to KS from me so i shouted him to stop fucking doing it and this dickhead 
    called wendy or something like that a lvl 9+ barb shaman decided to report 
    me for swearing and she started to really piss me off with tells so if anyone 
    sees her Train some shit on her arse for me with and send a pic in to prove 
    it.</b></p>

  <p><b>IM back haven't updated in a while but IM back and have I got some rants 
    this time. This rant is about Gkers or guard killers I hate them or the past 
    week on tunare in steamfront there has been gkers everynight camping every 
    guard in the zone normally this doesn't bother me but there taking every fucking 
    guard even the ones at the town entrance so with my new char I keep dying 
    cause IM training so the guards will help me but no guards I think this will 
    ruin the game for newbies who depends on the guards allot. If there playing 
    a evil class ie: dark elf,troll or even a necro it don't bother me cause there 
    rpging but these blokes are fucking gnome and high elf wizards and woodelf 
    druids there not playing the game there just being dicks trying to gain there 
    lvl really fast. I emailed verant about changing the guards to no exp gain 
    but wtf did they say well not much email below:</b></p>

  <p><b>&quot;today is going to the day that there going to throw it back to you&quot; 
    . Dday is coming for everquest as microsoft report that they are going for 
    a release of AC by christmas in the uk but will it be better, Personally i 
    think if microsoft give a rats arse about there costumers it will do really 
    well like i have said before everquest and ultima are great games but there 
    surrport staff are shit thats the vital part of an online game if u ask me. 
    Another thing that pisses me of is the cost of spells in the game what im 
    on about after playing a warrior my 1st and only char ive just started a cleric 
    got him to lvl8 and bang i cant afford spells theres like a jump of 5pp from 
    lvl 9 to 14. So why dont verant change this in one of there patches instead 
    of changing things that arn't broken. Other news any played unreal tournament 
    fuck me is ace get it now.</b></p>

  <p><b>Not much to talk about except all the sodding servers were down the other 
    day and couldnt play for ages but started a new char twinked of course.Also 
    nearly got a new layout with java and shit being sent to me by gamiar and 
    started writing my wacky story about the real norrath. Check it out the <a href="adven.htm">misadventures</a> 
    of my dwarf thats all for today.</b></p>

  <p><b>It's been 9 days since my last update sorry about that but lifes been 
    shit to me and cant be bothered with anything anyhow IM back and back with 
    vengeance. What's been going on in the last week well the new quests are being 
    found and rubicite and jm boots are no longer spawning :( , and there's some 
    news about GMs being arseholes but I cant see cause there's never anyone on 
    to be a gm. Why aren't there any GMs god knows but we do need more guides 
    IM sure there are ppls out there that can be a guide all u need is 2 lv 20 
    chars and answer a few questions its easy. I've been thinking IM ranting like 
    shit but I don't hate the game I hate what's going on in the game with all 
    these patches changing chars and items so IM thinking where's everquest heading 
    and I keep think UO UO.... . I really hope it doesn't head the same way as 
    uo did it will be a shame. A new server went up last Thursday the nameless 
    server everyone on there has nolife trying to get the 1st lv 50 char. IM on 
    there but I can never seem to lvl fast enough but I am doing 1 lv an hour 
    which ant bad. I've found another bad clipping problem <a href="clip3.jpg">pic 
    1</a> half this npc is stuck in a door heheh. Also some changes soon new layout 
    again this time done by someone called gamiar which ill thank now for doing 
    it. Also the adventures of the misguided dwarf will be up soon a little story 
    about a u guessed it a misguided dwarf and his wacky adventures. Also this 
    give me the opportunity to practice my writing skills.</b></p>

  <p><b>OK so what's been going on in my everworld today, well I nearly died helped 
    a newbie cause he cant play and nothing much else. OK so Wednesday the rubicite 
    armor and JM boots are being taken out of the spawns all I can say is bullocks 
    but they are adding them in as quest items but what's the fucking point I 
    don't know where to look for the quest but if anyone knows a page other than 
    the<a href="http://gameznet.com/eq/"> EQLIZER</a> for quests tell me. I found 
    a cool link over at <a href="http://www.wtfman.com/">WTF</a> check it out 
    ron and friends have changed there site and fuck its good anyhow this site 
    is called <a href="http://www.pulpphantom.com/">pulp phantom </a>. Got some 
    funny pics showing how fucked up there clipping is <a href="clip1.jpg">pic1</a>, 
    <a href="clip2.jpg">pic 2</a>, after that my head hurt all night. Anyone who 
    plays on tunare server give me a call and say something funny and u will get 
    1pp :) the names keaas. Anyhow that's all I found fucked up except no dupe 
    yet :( .</b></p>

  <p><b><font size="4">10/10/99</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font size="3">sorry for the lack of updates real life shit and all but 
    IM back just got a new flash movie I really like this one feedback and all 
    would be help full cause IM new to this shit. The eq equipment list is a dead 
    link but will send it to anyone who asks me to. Anyone hear got a warrior 
    char I have and anyone hear who thinks warriors are the biggest pile of shit 
    ever written I do . What IM getting at is the shit healing time when soloing 
    I've got it up to lv 15 and can take me up to 20 mins healing and they charge 
    a fortune for these healing potions and there is hardly anyone who wants to 
    heal you, So what's the fucking point of them then. Another thing is this 
    shit player run encomey and the npc one they charge a grand to get some stuff 
    this is where UO rules monsters carry good loot and things are cheap i reckon 
    we should get together and pention this crap loot and high prices thing.</font></b></p>
