    <p>INTERVIEW &#150; Zavaish De Lavichana. April 26<sup>th</sup>, 2001.</p>
    <hr width="90%" color="#000080">
    <p>Storm: We&#146;re here today discussing the supernatural aspect of our lives, and
    exploring the possibilities of alternate beings viably living inside or among us. My guest
    today is Zavaish De Lavichana. Zavaish, welcome.</p>
    <p><br>
    Zavaish: Thank you. </p>
    <p>Storm: I thought my parents hated me for naming me something as boring as
    Joseph&#133;but damn, how exactly does one come about getting the name Zavaish De
    Lavichana?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Zavaish is my &quot;true&quot;name. The name I have been called by since the
    old time. It is the name of my being, of my spirit, of that which predates my existence as
    a human in this plane. Its translation would mean something like &quot;storm&quot; or
    &quot;fury&quot; in the english language. De Lavichana is the romanized pronunciation of
    my surname.</p>
    <p>Storm: When you speak of your being and its existence outside of this plane, can you
    give me a brief overview of what you mean?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: It is death in the Astral Plane that has transformed the energy of my being
    from that world into the representation of energy on this plane as a human being. Although
    the body has died, the spirit lives on. So even though I am here now, I did not originate
    here. My kind lives here when death in our natural home forces the energy of our beings to
    escape from spirit death into this plane.</p>
    <p>Storm: Your kind?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Yes. I am what would literally be known as a Demon. </p>
    <p>Storm: You say &quot;literally.&quot; It seems you use the word intentionally.</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Yes, my spirit originated in the Land of Darkness on the Astral Plane, and is
    a member of the race that would be called Demon.</p>
    <p>Storm: Ok, let me slow down and try to get a better view of this. The Astral Plane
    would be what? The other side? The place we go after we&#146;re dead?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Yes.</p>
    <p>Storm: Ok, and on this plane is an actual place that is called the Land of Darkness?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Yes. On the Astral Plane, there are three main places. Language is a
    completely different thing there, but they would translate basically to the Land of Light,
    the Land of Darkness, and Home of the Psi-Vamps. The Land of Darkness is where those like
    me live.</p>
    <p>Storm: So how exactly does your being on this plane differ from the lives of other
    people? </p>
    <p>Zavaish: Are you asking what abilities I have that are different from normal humans?</p>
    <p>Storm: Yes, to start with. Does the fact that you have come through whatever veil
    seperates the planes with some semblance of your spirit intact have any influence on the
    capabilities and limitations you have on this world? </p>
    <p>Zavaish: Well, I have generally the same structure as any other person. I live my life,
    work, sleep and pay bills like any other. Although my physical structure is generally the
    same, the functions seem to be enhanced in relation to others. I have unnatural strength
    in relation to my body type, my metabolism is hightened greatly, and I heal at probably
    four times the rate of the what is commonly considered normal. </p>
    <p>Storm: So you wouldn&#146;t attribute these oddities to genetic &quot;luck?&quot;</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Its like going some place you&#146;ve been before with a group of people who
    havent. You have the same landscape as the whole group, however you can interpret the
    environment much faster and more efficiently because you have the latent awareness of it
    that they do not. If you were in a perilous situation twice, your body would naturally
    achieve the hightened state of awareness and danger better than the first time.</p>
    <p>Storm: That makes sense. Are there any differences of note beyond the anatomical
    anomolies or is that pretty much it?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: I have the ability to feel the energy of other life directly, so I can be
    thought of as empathic as well as being able to connect to the energy of another via a
    kind of telepathy.</p>
    <p>Storm: Do you think that those in this world have those abilities too, or do you
    attribute them to the nature of your &quot;continuous life&quot; on the other side?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: I have no direct knowledge of what it would be like to be completely
    &quot;of&quot; this world, so I cannot say for sure. </p>
    <p>Storm: Fair enough. You were talking about places in the Astral Plane. Lets get back to
    that for a moment. Can you describe for us the differences between the them?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: The Demons live in a place that can be called the Land of Darkness. The
    Psi-Vamps inhabit another place that I do not know how to convey in the language. The
    third &quot;encampment&quot; is the Land of Light. This is like the idea of
    &quot;heaven&quot; and is where most humans originating in this world go. Over time, the
    beings of each haven have evolved to become what are basically different races. It is the
    way we each have evolved that seperates each of us into different &quot;races&quot;of
    being.</p>
    <p>Storm: So when a human dies here, you say most of them go to the Land of Light. What
    determines where the person will go?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Their choice. </p>
    <p>Storm: So if I died today, I would be presented with the opportunity to go to whichever
    place I wanted?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Basically, yes. Though the Land of Light is your &quot;Natural&quot; home.</p>
    <p>Storm : What advantage does the land of darkness hold over the land of light then? Why
    would anyone not choose the light if it is like heaven?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: There is no describable advantage.</p>
    <p>Storm: And do those choosing the land of darkness generally become those who return, as
    you have, across the veil back to this world upon death?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Here are the answers: The only definable advantage is that Demons and
    Vampires, for reasons I don&#146;t know, seem to have learned to use far more
    &quot;talents&quot;than those of the land of Light, although they have the potential to do
    all that we can.</p>
    <p>Storm: Possibly because they were faced with more adversity, and therefore more NEED to
    adapt while alive?</p>
    <p>Zavaish: Yes.<br>
    <br>
    Storm: I see.<br>
    <br>
    Zavaish: As for returning to this side, neither race is more likely. In these times it is
    not an issue. In times LONG gone though. There was not always peace between the races.
    Millions suffered, but thankfully all that is now past.</p>
