        By Sarah Tippit<br>
        Reuters<br>
        <br>
        LOS ANGELES - A British scientist studying heart attack patients says he is finding
        evidence that suggests that consciousness may continue after the brain has stopped
        functioning and a patient is clinically dead. <br>
        <br>
        The research, presented to scientists last week at the California Institute of Technology
        (Caltech), resurrects the debate over whether there is life after death and whether there
        is such a thing as the human soul. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;The studies are very significant in that we have a group of people with no brain
        function ... who have well-structured, lucid thought processes with reasoning and memory
        formation at a time when their brains are shown not to function,&quot; Sam Parnia, one of
        two doctors from Southampton General Hospital in England who have been studying so-called
        near-death experiences (NDEs), told Reuters in an interview. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;We need to do much larger-scale studies, but the possibility is certainly
        there&quot; to suggest that consciousness, or the soul, keeps thinking and reasoning even
        if a person's heart has stopped, he is not breathing and his brain activity is nil, Parnia
        said. <br>
        <br>
        He said he and colleagues conducted an initial yearlong study, the results of which
        appeared in the February issue of the journal Resuscitation. The study was so promising
        the doctors formed a foundation to fund further research and continue collecting data. <br>
        <br>
        During the initial study, Parnia said, 63 heart attack patients who were deemed clinically
        dead but were later revived were interviewed within a week of their experiences. <br>
        <br>
        Of those, 56 said they had no recollection of the time they were unconscious and seven
        reported having memories. Of those, four were labeled NDEs in that they reported lucid
        memories of thinking, reasoning, moving about and communicating with others after doctors
        determined their brains were not functioning. <br>
        <br>
        FEELINGS OF PEACE <br>
        <br>
        Among other things, the patients reported remembering feelings of peace, joy and harmony.
        For some, time sped up, senses heightened and they lost awareness of their bodies. <br>
        <br>
        The patients also reported seeing a bright light, entering another realm and communicating
        with dead relatives. One, who called himself a lapsed Catholic and Pagan, reported a close
        encounter with a mystical being. <br>
        <br>
        Near-death experiences have been reported for centuries but in Parnia's study none of the
        patients were found to have received low oxygen levels, which some skeptics believe may
        contribute to the phenomenon. <br>
        <br>
        When the brain is deprived of oxygen people become totally confused, thrash around and
        usually have no memories at all, Parnia said. &quot;Here you have a severe insult to the
        brain but perfect memory.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        Skeptics have also suggested that patients' memories occurred in the moments they were
        leaving or returning to consciousness. But Parnia said when a brain is traumatized by a
        seizure or car wreck a patient generally does not remember moments just before or after
        losing consciousness. <br>
        <br>
        Rather, there is usually a memory lapse of hours or days. &quot;Talk to them. They'll tell
        you something like: 'I just remember seeing the car and the next thing I knew I was in the
        hospital,&quot;' he said. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;With cardiac arrest, the insult to the brain is so severe it stops the brain
        completely. Therefore, I would expect profound memory loss before and after the
        incident,&quot; he added. <br>
        <br>
        Since the initial experiment, Parnia and his colleagues have found more than 3,500 people
        with lucid memories that apparently occurred at times they were thought to be clinically
        dead. Many of the patients, he said, were reluctant to share their experiences fearing
        they would be thought crazy. <br>
        <br>
        A TODDLER'S TALE <br>
        <br>
        One patient was 2-1/2 years old when he had a seizure and his heart stopped. His parents
        contacted Parnia after the boy &quot;drew a picture of himself as if out of his body
        looking down at himself. It was drawn like there was a balloon stuck to him. When they
        asked what the balloon was he said, 'When you die you see a bright light and you are
        connected to a cord.' He wasn't even 3 when had the experience,&quot; Parnia said. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;What his parents noticed was that after he had been discharged from hospital, six
        months after the incident, he kept drawing the same scene.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        The brain function these patients were found to have while unconscious is commonly
        believed to be incapable of sustaining lucid thought processes or allowing lasting
        memories to form, Parnia said -- pointing to the fact that nobody fully grasps how the
        brain generates thoughts. <br>
        <br>
        The brain itself is made up of cells, like all the body's organs, and is not really
        capable of producing the subjective phenomenon of thought that people have, he said. <br>
        <br>
        He speculated that human consciousness may work independently of the brain, using the gray
        matter as a mechanism to manifest the thoughts, just as a television set translates waves
        in the air into picture and sound. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;When you damage the brain or lose some of the aspects of mind or personality, that
        doesn't necessarily mean the mind is being produced by the brain. All it shows is that the
        apparatus is damaged,&quot; Parnia said, adding that further research might reveal the
        existence of a soul. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;When these people are having experiences they say, 'I had this intense pain in my
        chest and suddenly I was drifting in the corner of my room and I was so happy, so
        comfortable. I looked down and realized I was seeing my body and doctors all around me
        trying to save me and I didn't want to go back. <br>
        <br>
        &quot;The point is they are describing seeing this thing in the room, which is their body.
        Nobody ever says, 'I had this pain and the next thing I knew my soul left me.&quot;' </font></p>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; I've gotten alot of response to the interview with a demon and to the site in
        general. I think this email best sums up the dissenting view, so I figure I'd throw it out
        there to the folks.<br>
        <br>
        -Storm</p>
        <p><font color="#0080FF">Storm,<br>
        There are not demons, no other worlds, only poor frightened<br>
        people creating illusions and delusions. I think your project<br>
        of making a better world, where people feel safe, would better<br>
        be served by not encouraging magical thinking as reality.<br>
        As myth, as fantasy, imagination is a wonderful thing, but <br>
        pretending it is real is what has created most of the hate,<br>
        war, and meanness in the world. Organized religion, new<br>
        age philosophy, all lead to conflict and, or despair.<br>
        <br>
        Your desires are well-intentioned ... perhaps you should rethink<br>
        how to accomplish them. You can't succeed by repeating what<br>
        had failed humankind since he crawled out of the caves.<br>
        <br>
        Warmly,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura<br>
        <br>
        </font><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; Dear Laura,</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also believe you are well intentioned.
        I think every man goes through alternating chains of thought similar to yours and similar
        to mine.&nbsp; The unmistakable flaw of reality is that there simply is no objective
        reality. Its an easy way out. While any dip into the unknown represents a risk of
        failure... it is, and always will be, the timeless adventure of man to explore what he
        does not know, discover what he does not know, and to see what cannot be seen. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if we look at the question from a
        realist's point of view, it is very difficult to find one point in which the dreamer does
        not hold the advantage. Without the dreamers, without those dedicated to the endeavors
        outside the reach of the common man, we would have no electricity, no space shuttle, no
        microwave ovens or cars. I shudder to think that the Wright brothers would ever have
        listened to the teeming masses screaming that the insane dream of human flight was nothing
        short of heresy. <br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking again at the realist perspective, pure data shows that prayer
        or meditation or simple compassion all influence the energies around us. If anything, this
        research demands us to question our beliefs even more. I am as saddened by the dogmatic,
        blind worshipper who cannot see beyond his walls as I am by the dogmatic realist who can
        only see whats right in front of him. Do realists believe in atoms? How do you REALLY know
        the world is round?&nbsp; They are both equally screwed.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's my personal perspective :&nbsp; I will never accept death
        as the end of everything. Why not? Because as long as I am alive, there is hope that I may
        discover how to either understand the afterlife, or in the case that there is no
        afterlife, how to avoid it permanently. Even if life goes on, if I cannot retain the
        memories of my life and choose it again, I do not want it. I would sooner download my
        memories onto a computer chip and live on the internet than die and go to a place where I
        was one with the universe. There is good only when compared to bad. I dont want to go to
        any place that does not have some of both. It is the struggle in life that is it's true
        prize. Having said that, I would rather believe in one cause with all of my heart, and die
        in the pursuit of that dream than live a million years in the grind. I think you would
        too.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the Demon interview, I understand
        your point. Is this a demon who somehow retained memory from the other side, or just a
        dude who needs attention. Who cares? Its information. Absorb the new information, weight
        it against what you currently know, and make future decisions and judgements based upon
        the sum knowledge. How simple is that?&nbsp; It would seem to me that this is the most
        &quot;realistic&quot; approach to life that can be found. Do I appreciate the interview
        and the information that I gleaned from it? Yes. I am well aware of my perspective on
        life. At any moment wherein I am able to share the perspective of another, it is an
        opportunity to learn. The particular person it is, however, is relatively unimportant.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, I dont discourage your way of
        thinking. We all must choose our own path. It is a difficult series of choices that we
        must make in life and I dont pretend to oversimplify it or overcomplicate it. It is what
        it is and we all do the best we can.&nbsp; It is important to remember that no two people
        on earth have the same religion or philosophy, they only gang together to share in what
        they have in common. We, as a people are bound by our commonalities as well as that which
        makes us different. I welcome your thought in our discussions and if you have any
        productive ideas at all, please bring them forward. </font></p>
        <p><font color="#FFFFFF">--CUT---&quot;Your desires are well-intentioned ... perhaps you
        should rethink<br>
        how to accomplish them.&quot;--CUT---<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm open to your thoughts. Tell us your way, so that we may learn from
        you as well. Criticism without providing methods of improvement is not rain, its pissing
        on someone's hand.&nbsp; It seems to me that saying &quot;Your ways suck but I dont know
        how to do it better&quot; is kinda chickenshit. I apologize if I am wrong. I also
        apologize for using your email to illustrate a few points. Been waiting on this one.
        Forgive me.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think its time to admit something to each other. Society, in
        general, is suffering from a serious loss of meaning in life. Alarm clocks wake us up, our
        lives are micromanaged and twisted awry by the insane schedules we keep up, and every day
        we find new ways to avoid being wrong. We are losing the spirit of brotherhood, of
        community, and the basic fraggin expectation that your fellow man will not stab you in the
        throat if it would get him a promotion or his name in a newspaper.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many ways that mankind is discovering to begin to tear
        down the walls we have built all around us. Religious philosophies of all kinds, theories
        of perceptual evolution (psychic development), scientific approaches to life in virtual
        space or higher spatial dimensions, reaching out to universal life, and rediscovering
        magic in a time where we are still left with the ideological biases associated with the
        Industrial revolution... are all ways in which man is trying to inject hope into a society
        that has become very bleak and very cold. I want to help.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These basic ideas and this small chunk of virtual space is the
        construct. The people who inhabit it are the seeds. This is the absolute basic framework,
        and consists of one page and some message boards. How it grows and the directions it takes
        will be completely shaped by those of you who choose to call it home. </p>
        <p>Our Journey begins.</p>
