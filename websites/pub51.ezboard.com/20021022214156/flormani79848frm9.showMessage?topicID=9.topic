Gorm? You guys want this?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gladriel was scouting the horizon, looking for another giant to unleash her fury on. She turned slightly, glanced at the earring, and returned to her scouting, &quot;No Alle, you keep it.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gormadoc was deep in his meditations, but the halfling nodded his agreement. Gladriel sat down on the grass beside her friends with a soft thud, and a few clanks from her metallic armor. &quot;There's nothing out there,&quot; she whined.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion laughed, pulling out her spellbook as she sat down for some meditating. &quot;Just wait Glad, they will come with time.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly a voice broke through the trance both Alleusion and Gormadoc were in. The ogre is up, said the voice, come now. Gladriel jumped up. Gormadoc closed his book. Only Alleusion remained sitting. &quot;What was that about?&quot; she asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gladriel looked at Alleusion, &quot;The sleeping ogre. Phobose has been waiting for him. Come, we must get Syllie.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gormadoc flipped through his book, looking for the spell that would transport himself and his group to the Dreadlands where they would pick up Syllie the cleric, and Uggmugg the warrior. The guild had called for help and it was time for action. &quot;Alle, your level is not high enough for you to help out much in any way. Stand back, do what is asked of you, and watch carefully.&quot; Gormadoc stood, called his friends closer to him, and with a whisper, he cast.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion felt the familiar sensation of being jerked from one location and put down in another. She was the first to arrive in the Dreadlands, as they were called. I wonder why they call this place Dreadlands, she thought to herself. The trees near the druid rings were alive with bright fall colors. Reds and oranges battled with vibrant yellows for the eyes' attention. The hills near the rings were lush and green, while the mountains in the distance were covered with snow. Alleusion could feel the chill in the air from the nearby snow. &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A giggle at her side could only mean one thing, Syllie was here. Looking down, Alleusion saw the dwarven cleric standing next to her. &quot;It's beautiful isn't it? I never get used to seeing it, no matter how many times I come here,&quot; Syllie looked behind her at the lumbering ogre. &quot;Come on Ugg, Phobose has waited for this long enough.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uggmugg looked at the frail enchanter, sighing because he knew how much trouble they could get into with a child in tow, he fixed a stone like glance on Alleusion, &quot;Follow.&quot; Never being much for words, the ogre began to run towards the snow covered mountains.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion and Syllie ran to keep up with his long strides, pausing slightly when they came to an ice cave. Ducking his head a bit, Uggmugg managed to get through the opening to lead his group to the other side. He stopped suddenly at the exit of the cave, causing Syllie and Alleusion to bump into his solid back.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ow,&quot; Alleusion said, rubbing her forehead.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uggmugg didn't even spare a backward glance as he scanned the horizon. &quot;There,&quot; he said pointing, &quot;Gorenaire.&quot; Alleusion looked to where he was pointing and her breath caught as she spied the dragon. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alle,&quot; Syllie said, &quot;can you levitate us and invis yourself? Most things here will still be able to see you, but some will not. We need to keep you alive. Phobose would never forgive us if we missed this because of a corpse run.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Grabbing three bat wings from one of her packs, Alleusion closed her eyes, and willed the wings into a levitating entity that lifted them off the ground. Then, she made herself invisible as silent bubbles of air rose from the place she had been standing. Without a word, Uggmugg took off along the mountain tops.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The trio ran across the mountain tops, visibility obscured because of the sudden snow flurries. Alleusion, having never been in this area before was completely lost. Syllie, who was always lost, just kept her eye on Uggmugg and followed him. As they neared the ground, Alleusion spied some pillars near an opening in the mountain...ruins, half the pillars were on their sides. Because she was not paying attention, Alleusion did not see the creature that was sneaking up on her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp A gust of hot, fetid breath blew across her shoulder, causing Alleusion to spin around with fright. With one slash of his razor sharp claws, the ravishing drolvarg broke through her magic skin. Syllie cried out, &quot;Ugg! On Alle.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uggmugg rolled his eyes to the heavens wondering why he had been appointed babysitter for today. He turned to attack the drolvarg and in seconds it was dead. Fixing a glare upon the trembling high elf, he said, &quot;Come now, and don't get into any more trouble.&quot; With those words, he led them through yet another tunnel and into Frontier Mountains.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion had been in these mountains, she had in fact been there just moments before with Gladriel and Gormadoc, but she had never been in this section. The view was the same, she left the tunnel, looking up into a blue sky, swaying trees all around. Off in the distance she could see a few giants wandering around. This was their home after all. Alleusion cast a spell of invisibility again, and they were off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Along the way they gathered friends who had come to help out with this epic monster. Qana with her control of the elements, Nenasya with her weapons gleaming, sharpened and ready for blood. Entering the mines, Alleusion was awed by how many people had come out to help take down this creature.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The shamans quickly shrunk the larger races so there would be no problems with getting stuck in the smaller passageways. Qana looked at Alleusion, pointing to a waterfall up ahead, &quot;The quickest way to get there is up that waterfall, just keep swimming, you'll make it up there eventually.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When she reached the top of the falls, Alleusion stood, dripping wet, in front of Phobose. The iksar looked at her slowly, &quot;So this is you. At last we meet. Stay by Syllie, keep out of trouble.&quot; Too stunned by her encounter with her guild leader, Alleusion just stood there, not sure what to do.  The events of the next hour or so went by to quickly to keep track of everything. Syllie stood by Alleusion's side pointing out creatures that would not attack and in general doing her best to keep the young enchanter out of trouble. The call came for battle and the raid sprung into action. Quasqueton laughed maniacally as he flung damaging bolts of fire and ice at the hideous monster. Flashes of light and the clang of weapons could be seen and heard throughout the small cavern. At last, it was over, the creature had been slain. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion smiled as she prepared her gate spell. Her first raid. Chuckling to herself, she marveled at all that could have gone wrong. The group congratulated each other and Phobose, who was now one step closer to completing his epic quest. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Later that evening, sitting in the Sarnak fort meditating, Alleusion reflected on the days events. She took the time to write down her memories, including a vision she remembered, recording it for future posterity.....<br>
