Above her loomed the guilds of the magical arts, her own designation included amongst them, and every so often she could hear the workings of different defensive spells coming from above. Her momentary solitude was dedicated to toying with a pouch of runes, identifying each of the marks upon them to further her research for greater spells. Quasqueton had promised her even greater runes when he returned back from his quest, but the days seemed to grow longer and longer in his absence. It was in this moment of study and reflection that she distinctly heard the soft footfalls of the sure-footed ranger approaching her.<br><br>A smile crept across the delicately defined high Elven face as she let the initial shock of the visit wear away, and Shio rose to her feet. She stood taller than the ranger, though her frame more willowy, and her hair was quite obviously flame kissed by her deity of the arts, Solusek Ro, whom she called upon for the power of her spells. She reached out her hands to the ranger as she spoke softly in the language of the elves &quot;Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare. It is good to see you home cousin.&quot; Millikin gripped her hands in return though her present mood was unreadable, as often it was, by her kin. &quot;Diol'lle, Shiobahn. It is good to return once again.&quot;<br><br>Shiobahn studied her a moment, certain there was a tale to be told, but not knowing when the ranger would tell it, if she decided to speak of it at all. &quot;We shall catch up over a glass of Elven wine. The day is still early and the tavern is open across town. Just allow me to pack my things.&quot; Shio did not offer much room for argument, though then she rarely did. She quickly bent down to retrieve her runes, pouring them back into a small pouch that hung from her belt. She carried a small myriad of trinkets this way, including a finely crafted golden bowl bearing a few small dings in the bottom which hinted at the fact she was not afraid to swing it at something if one of her spells was going awry, no matter how futile the attempt was. Tucking her blanket into a backpack she then set off on foot along side her cousin to the tavern.<br><br>........................<br>Felwith - Northern District<br><br>A glass of Elven wine and a treat of a small fruit tart later the two sat together in an out of the way corner of the bar. It was an enjoyable time filled with tales of adventure, many of Millikin's taking place in the frozen lands of Velious which intrigued Shio and much of Shio's having taken place another great distance away, in the newly explored moon of Luclin. It was Millikin's comments of the wastelands in the far west reaches of the frozen continent that perked Shio's attention. &quot;Cousin, why have you come home from such great adventures? And have you heard word of a Quasqueton? He has been in those far reaching lands for some time up to now under quest of the Coldain. I know he is allied to the dragon beasts that survive out there, but he has not sent word recently and I worry. The last I knew he had enlisted the aid of the Troubadour Autumnwyld, but it is still a harsh land for wizard and bard alone.&quot;<br><br>She quickly saw the look of recognition in Millikin's eyes as she uttered the names, and a look of hope appeared upon her face. She felt the matter bore further explanation and she quickly added in &quot;Quas and I were bound together just this spring in a quiet ceremony under Ro's watchful eye. It is a difficult balance some days, love and magic. We did not make a spectacle of our union, I am sorry to have not informed you but it is nearly impossible to track the tracker.&quot; <br><br>...............................<br><br>Creoso eska, tinu en'Tunare - Welcome home daughter of Tunare<br>Diol'lle, Shiobahn - Thank you, Shiobahn<br><br>Shiobahn Fyrestrike is the sole property of her creator and used only for role playing purposes.

Had she heard of Quasqueton?  Of course she had.  Her thoughts momentarily turned to her initial meeting with him.  Autumn had invited her to venture into Charasis, the Howling Stones with some of her recent adventuring companions.  The purpose of the foray into the tomb of the late Drusilla Sathir was for archaeological reasons:  Quasqueton wished to complete a set of Kylong armor and had spent considerable time gathering up the different pieces of armor once worn by the Iksar tribe.<br><br>He had seemed a bit unconventional, to say the least.  Instead of wielding magic with the calculating efficiency of Valdayana D`Varr or passionate devotion of Saldaria Snowspirit, Quasqueton blithely hurled lightning or fire at the walking dead or golem sentries that protected the place as if he were playing a game of catch.  Eventually they obtained the final piece of armor for his collection, a chainmail tunic.  Millikin had been surprised that the enchantment placed on by its iksar creators granting the wearer enhanced strength had remained in tact despite the onslaught of magic and melee required to destroy the iksar skeletal remains that had been wearing it.<br><br>She had met him subsequently a few more times, once in the Umbral Plains, but more commonly in Velious.  During a Coldain assault on the Ry`Gorr fort, a gem mining expedition in the Siren's Grotto, and once while exploring the Dragon Necropolis.  Millikin snapped out of her mental reverie as Shiobahn explained that they had been married recently.<br><br>  &quot;Yes, I do know him.  I've met him and adventured with him, the last time was while in Velious.&quot;  Millikin rubbed the back of her neck, idly wondering how such a detail could have been forgotten to have been mentioned by her parents or her sister in their correspondence.  Then it occurred to her that even they may not know.  Acting on spontaneous impulse was a common trait, particularly in the Goldbrooke family and Millikin could not honestly say she always acted only after careful deliberation.<br><br>Nor could she exactly sum up her feelings on hearing the news except that she somehow expected it to come back and haunt her.  Somehow.  Millikin reached for the black medicine pouch she was wearing around her neck to make sure it was still there as she downed the last of her wine then took a deep breath, hoping her offer wouldn't turn out to be more than she bargained for.<br><br>  &quot;It appears my list of errands for arcanists is expanding.

She still had a few pieces of parchment left over from her last endeavors and certainly enough of everything else she needed.  The barkeep looked at Shiobahn with a raised brow as she was intent to spread her things across his freshly polished bar top, yet she opted not to notice his less than amused expression.<br><br>  &quot;Thank you Millikin, this means a great deal to me.&quot;<br><br>  She focused on her note while her cousin finished off her drink, her writing in an elegant Koada`Dal script.  A hundred questions and thoughts came to mind, but for the sake of her cousin she attempted to be brief.  She enclosed a tiny packet of mistletoe to the finished note, and she folded it with great care not to damage the leaves.  She caught Millikin's curious glance to the not so often used component and Shio simply smiled.<br><br>  &quot;I do not ask cousin, I simply gathered this upon his request.  He was ranting about cabbage at the time.&quot;<br><br>  She pressed the letter into the bewildered Ranger's hands.  It was impossible to explain to Millikin how such a strange pair came to be.  She then let out a small sigh, as she longed to explore the depths of the wastes herself.  She did not know how far she could push Millikin's gestures of kindness though, as she was certain she already was on a mission.  Testing the waters she asked with some uncertainty.<br><br>  &quot;Cousin, do you think you could lead me as far as Iceclad if you are headed that way?  I would like to try and meet up with Quas in the Dwarven City and I included in my note I would try to get there.

If you are going to wander in that region beware of the Ry`Gorr orcs and Kromrif giants.  The orcs and giants have an alliance and are at war against the Coldain.  The dwarves actually built their city in a mountainside and is hidden behind a waterfall to prevent invasion by the frost giants.&quot;  The ranger reached for an unused piece of parchment and quill, and drew a rough map as she explained how to access the city.<br><br>~~~<br><br>The Dragon Portal of the Great Divide.<br><br>A tear in the fabric of time and space opened up and allowed the Feir`Dal ranger, the Koada`Dal wizard, and half elven druid to appear within the obsidian ring.  Millikin habitually turned and looked up at the statue of the dragon guardian.  After an exchange of coin and word of thanks, the druid traced a rectangular pattern in midair and vanished in a swirl of mist. <br><br>The biting chill wind was the first thing to grab Shiobahn's attention as she examined the landscape.  For as far as the eye could see was snow, looming black cliffsides or mountain peaks.  She pulled her cloak closer around her form and followed Millikin's direction in the south.<br><br>  &quot;The mad sorceror Velketor makes his lair in one of the caves that way.  The Coldain say he sometimes kidnaps their people for experiments and even his own people, the Kromzek spurn him.  I've explored the caves a bit.  He has golem constructs and gargoyles guarding the entrances to his castle.  Mostly I've encountered giant spiders or kobolds there though.  There's also whispers of a dissident sect of Coldain making a hideout in the caves out here.  I've not had the chance to confirm that as of yet though.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;It sounds as if you've gotten involved in the politics of the Coldain, Cousin.  Despite your experiences in Freeport.&quot;  Shiobahn smiled to the ranger.<br><br>Millikin shrugged slightly.  &quot;They are at war with the those who encroach upon the Tunarean Court.  'The enemy of my enemy is my friend' I suppose you could say.  And Thurgadin, our destination, is due north.  Barring any accidents or delays, we should reach the city in an hour or so.  It gets cold out here at night.&quot;<br><br>As the two headed north, the ranger continued her discourse of the local inhabitants and creatures of the area and how to best combat or avoid them.  Shardwurms roamed near the mountain peaks near their lairs within and seemed to blend into the background with their white scales.  Until they unleashed their chilling breath weapon.  The primitive yaklike humanoid tizmak made their home in a network of caves in the western mountain sides.  Feral kodiaks wandered the eastern and southern mountain range.  Finally Shiobahn saw the outline of a Coldain guard tower near a river and faintly heard the roar of a waterfall.  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw a shadowy outline rushing towards them... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uautumncrescendo.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Autumn Crescendo</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>this one time, at bard camp...</span><br>  Posts: 354<br> <font color=#333333>(7/14/02 2:54:40 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=4>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse (one chapter in a larger story)</span><hr size=1>   Despite the enchantment of a magical skin Shiobahn was slapped to the side by a large paw that nearly encompassed half of her torso.  The second slap hit her and again though unscathed by her shielding it did not stop her from getting a bit dazed.  It would break through in a few more hits, but what was it.  Pulling herself up from the deep snow that bogged the pass, her eyes lifted to face her assailant, and she was face to face with the Kodiak.  Its eyes gleamed with raw fury, and its claws were in full extension from its paws, and again it tried mauling and maiming in large swinging strokes, a third and fourth glancing off her shield.  <br><br>  Millikin was swift on the scene; she knew this type of combat was not one her cousin would last in.  Shiobahn was uttering the words to shackle the beast while dodging blows, and just as the spell took off Millikin was in control.  Energy crackled from the duel blades she wielded and she went into a fast and furious combat, the beast scarcely landing a solid hit on the nimble elf.  Shiobahn regained her composure as swiftly as she could, reaching her arms out as she called upon the power of the elements and invoked them into a fiery rain pelting down upon the Kodiak in waves.  Before she could even utter another spell though the beast was run through and crumpled to the ground.<br><br>  Millikin gave a quick assessment of her cousin, assuring that there was nothing more than minor damage to be had.  Her eyes scanned down either side of the pass before falling more particularly on the snow.  Her tracking skills were keen and she wanted to make certain that their attacker had been alone.  Satisfied he was simply a wanderer she glanced back at her cousin.  <br><br>&quot;Perhaps you will want to use a shield of invisibility until we are safely at the city lines.&quot;<br><br>Shiobahn nodded in agreement, glanced around a moment with some trepidation, then withdrew her spell book flipping with haste to the area she had her invisibility spell marked.  It took but a second to refresh the incantation to her mind before she felt certain enough to cast it.  Her fingers traced a series of runes in the air and in a moment she was cloaked in the stealth of invisibility.  <br><br>&quot;I am ready.&quot;  Shiobahn murmured to her cousin.<br><br>&quot;This way then.&quot;  Millikin gave a small tilt of her head to indicate direction before again into the snow.<br><br>  Shiobahn marveled at how many people she saw in a mimicked fashion, skirting in the shadows of invisibility with her.  She touched the slim bone hoop earring Quasqueton had brought her as a gift from his travels, the enchantment allowing her the sight to spot those hiding in the folds of invisibility.  It was good to know she was not so alone as she lurked in the cold wastes.  The frozen stream caught her attention ahead.  The water was crisp and an icy blue, and the sounds of the waterfall that kept it moving came into hearing distance.  Curving around the river they ended up at the base of the falls and Millikin turned to regard her cousin.<br><br>&quot;Follow me around back, we will go behind the falls.&quot;  She called out over the heavy rush of water.<br><br>&quot;Behind?  This is what you spoke of when you mentioned their protection from the Giants, yes?&quot;<br><br>  Millikin nodded then slipped behind the falls, and passing by the guards that held the outposts at the front of the city.  Shiobahn scampered behind the waterfall as well and blinked coming into site of the Dwarves.  She was raised not so far from the city of Kaladim, and these Dwarves looked nothing like the ones of her homelands.  Their skin was so pale it was near transparent coming from years of never seeing the sun.  Their features were harsher, and more chiseled, almost a reflection of the world that surrounded them.  It was after a series of gates that the two parted ways.  A brief discussion on where the basic essentials could be found took place.<br><br>&quot;Be safe cousin, and good luck finding Quas…&quot;  Shiobahn gave the ranger a quick embrace.<br><br>&quot;Thank you.&quot;  Millikin murmured, taken aback by the affection of her cousin.  &quot;I should not have too much trouble finding him, he leaves a trail of disaster in his wake.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know, isn't it fantastic?&quot;  Shiobahn beamed.<br><br>&quot;I will never understand wizards…&quot;  Millikin muttered as she walked off in search of a few fletching supplies for the road. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Friend</span><br>  Posts: 10<br> <font color=#333333>(7/17/02 1:09:07 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=5>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse (one chapter in a larger story)</span><hr size=1> Millikin exited Thurgadin, Shiobahn's letter was safely stowed in her backpack.  By nightfall she had reached the Eastern Wastes and the temperature was dropping rapidly.  Millikin looked at the rapidly darkening sky, a storm was approaching.  She smiled grimly to herself as she made her way to a Coldain shelter she knew was nearby.  An explosion and flash of orange light caught her attention.  The aroma of burning flesh and charred fur assailed her sense of smell and made her eyes water.<br><br>The ranger quickly headed in that direction.  On occasion she saw the corpses of tundra kodiaks, dire wolves, orc scouts, even a snow griffin.  She sighed inwardly as she knelt down and inspected the snow for tracks.  None were visible, which means the perpetrator was most likely a spellcaster.  Why didn't people make use of the remains?  Corpses tended to attract scavengers.  Soon the snow was falling faster and the wind grew louder so that she almost didn't hear the approaching Kromrif.<br><br>  &quot;Die Outlander!&quot;  The sight of forged velium flashed before her and ripped through the chain mesh tunic she wore, spilling blood on the white snow in front of her.  The ranger fell backwards and immediately rolled sideways to avoid the follow-up strike.  In moments she was on her feet, weapons drawn, a healing cantra passed her lips and the wounds immediately began to close.  Millikin circled behind the Kromrif as he turned with a slashing arc towards her.  In a blur of motion, she ran between his legs and slashed at the back of his knees.  The giant howled in fury and lashed out with his fist to connect with a solid crunch to her back as she ran in front of him.  The ranger stumbled a few paces and spun around in time to block his weapon thrust and counterblow to his elbow with Swiftwind.  The giant was wielding a dagger, but the blade was long enough to be considered a short sword by the elf's estimation.  The Kromrif scout swung his foot sideways to sweep the elf to the ground and was mildly surprised to see she only staggered slightly.  <br><br>  &quot;By Rallos, you are more resilient than I expected, Outlander.  Mayhap there is a place for you alive as a servant.&quot;  The giant bantered as he saw the outline of the ranger backing away, he could hear her breath was ragged and grinned thinking this encounter would be over all too soon.<br><br>  &quot;I've no intention of finding out.&quot;  Swords still in hand, the elven ranger traced a sigil in midair.  Magical energy coalesced briefly then flickered out.  Somehow she had miscast the spell.  &quot;Valdayana's thrice damned curse.&quot;  She sighed again.  Swiftly wiping her blades and sheathing them, Millikin turned and ran relying on the darkness from the approaching storm for cover.  The giant quickly followed, though his vision was not as good as the elf's.  The protective enchantment the ranger had enabling her to regenerate from injuries at an accelerated rate without calling upon a healing cantra would fade soon.  She quickly pulled herself up into the branches of a tree and readied her bow.  Soon she saw the Kromrif's outline and took aim.  The arrow tore through the giant's chest and he staggered.  He reached for the piece of wood and ripped it out, cursing.  The arrowhead was barbed.  Another arrow found itself imbedded in his shoulder and a third grazed his temple.  Hastily the giant turned and ran.  Millikin watched his departure as she dropped down from the tree more intent on finding cover from the approaching storm than giving chase.  She smelled smoke from a nearby campfire, and unless she was hopelessly lost she was fairly sure that Garadain Glacierbane's encampment wasn't too far away.  She headed in that direction.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>The Kromrif scout grumbled as he made his way back to Kael Drakkel, limping and bleeding.  Far too many outlanders of late have been seen in the area and working with the Coldain.  And the fact that he had been bested by one would not be viewed favorably by Sergeant Tellsren.<br><br>  &quot;Kromrif.  I want a few words with you.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Eh?&quot;  The giant turned around and looked down to see a small framed creature hidden beneath a hooded travel cloak and his brow furrowed.  Another outlander.  The person was armed with a stave of some sort, he couldn't quite make out the details.  His first thought was to step on the person and move on, hoping this one's death would salvage his reputation somewhat after his defeat at the hands of the Feir`Dal.<br><br>  &quot;The ranger you fought earlier.  Her blood is still on your weapon, no?&quot;  <br><br>The giant glanced down at the dagger in his hand.  The blood was slowly drying on the velium blade.<br><br>  &quot;Yes.

Begone, before I crush your bones to dust.  You've wasted enough of my time.&quot;   The frost giant turned and headed down the ramp to Kael, ignoring the arcane syllables carried on the wind when suddenly he stopped.<br><br>  &quot;On second thought ... here.&quot;  The Kromrif scout handed the dagger to the stranger. <br><br>  &quot;Bel' la dos.&quot;  A faint note of ironic humor laced the speaker's tone as she whispered an arcane phrase and vanished from sight.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/umillikinerreene.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Millikin Erreene</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Friend</span><br>  Posts: 11<br> <font color=#333333>(8/5/02 4:44:31 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=15.topic&index=6>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The Curse (one chapter in a larger story)</span><hr size=1> Closing In<br><br>Authors:  Autumnwyld Crescendo (pseudonymn) and Millikin Erreene (pseudonymn)<br><br><br>Millikin poked her head out from the tunnel that led down to Siren's Grotto and looked around, though her clothing had long since dried from her swim through the grotto waterways, she still shivered reflexively.  The freezing winds were biting and there were not many architectural structures or arboreal features to serve as a windbreak out in the Western Wastes.  Millikin whispered a few words and her features contorted as shaggy cinnamon colored fur grew from her body.  Her teeth elongated and were noticeably sharper as she dropped down to all fours, the transformation into a dire wolf complete.  She sniffed the tracks she had found in the snow and after detecting the same scent on the wind she ran off in the direction of one of Veeshan's Scars.<br><br><br>  &quot;I hate this place.&quot;  Autumnwyld Crescendo repeated for the umpteenth time.  She had spent the past few days tracking and killing the savage velium hounds for their furs.  They had proven to be annoyingly difficult to find.  Adding to her aggravation was the fact that rangers and druids, with their superior understanding of animal behavior and habitats, were often able to locate the dens, hunting territories, and watering holes of these creatures and dispatch them, ofttimes before she could even find one in her vicinity.  The Coldain's ruler, Dain Colin Frostreaver IV had commissioned the creation of fine armor for the Coldain army and anyone capable of meeting the specifications was rewarded handsomely for their efforts.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike was confident he was one of those people and had spent the past few weeks gathering the materials he needed, preparing the parts of the armor short of formally forging the pieces as time and equipment permitted.  Obsessively lost in his work, he was not paying any attention to the bard, then he jabbed his hand with his leather puncher and cursed profusely.  Autumn snickered.<br><br>  &quot;The length of time it takes me to complete this padding impacts how long we stay here.  Hopefully this will be enough.  But if I ruin a pelt I'll need to replace it.&quot;  The silver haired wizard pointed to the silvery white furs stacked near a plethora of tailoring and leatherworking tools scattered around.  &quot;So we can't leave yet.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Alright, alright.&quot;  Autumn sighed and looked around.  She saw a small outline in the distance.  Even after donning the mask to take the appearance of a dark elf with their superior ultravision, she couldn't quite make out the form but it looked like another velium hound on the prowl.  She readied her sword, once more Quasqueton was engrossed in his work and didn't seem to notice her actions.  Singing the song of Selo's, Autumn broke into a run and headed off in that direction.  After following a somewhat circular path, Autumn realized the hound was heading deliberately for Quasqueton, not in the stalker's pace though.  Slowing down, she figured it was likely someone intent on requesting that the wizard transport them somewhere out of this barren wasteland.<br><br>Millikin saw the wizard some distance away and trotted closer.  She quickly noticed that he was leatherworking and waited silently for several moments.  Feeling he was being watched, Quasqueton looked up to see a dire wolf staring at him.  He quickly jumped to his feet and whispered an incantation.  Motes of flame erupted from his fingertips, when he realized the wolf had not attacked and he closed his hand into a fist to quickly dissipate the fiery energy he was gathering in anticipation of an attack.  He studied it closer.  Druids that were capable of surviving out in the Western Wastes usually opted to travel in the guise of a small jet black wolf.  This one was larger and brown.  <br><br>  &quot;May I help you, Ranger?&quot;  Quasqueton queried after a moment.<br><br>  &quot;I have a message for you.  From...&quot;  Millikin paused, still considering the irony.  &quot;your wife.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Shio?  What did she possibly say to persuade you to track me all the way out here?&quot;<br><br>  &quot;She is a kinsman of mine.&quot;  Millikin mentally willed the transformation back into her elven form and reached into her backpack searching for the letter.  &quot;And for most intents and purposes, now so are you.&quot;  She handed him Shiobahn's note as Autumn came up from behind her, still wearing her dark elven disguise.<br><br>  &quot;A family reunion?&quot;  Autumn laughed.  Millikin turned around<br>  <br>  &quot;You're still wearing that damned dark elf disguise?&quot;  <br><br>  &quot;Oh hush up, Ranger.  You'd be surprised at how well I can see when using it.&quot;  Autumn quipped.<br><br>  &quot;Why hadn't she mentioned it before?&quot;  Quas took the letter and opened it to read.<br><br>  &quot;I found out Shiobahn was recently married.  The entire prospect is rather frightening to dwell on.&quot;  Millikin replied.<br><br>  &quot;Well, it was somewhat impromptu.&quot;  Quasqueton looked up from the letter.  &quot;Don't worry.  Your cousin is in good hands and capable of fending for herself fairly well.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I was more concerned about the safety of the general population of Norrath.&quot;  Autumn snickered softly at Millikin's comment.<br><br>  &quot;And just what is THAT supposed to mean?&quot;  Quasqueton huffed.  Millikin glanced northwards, in the direction of the Temple of Veeshan, her thoughts distracted.  &quot;Can I send you somewhere, &quot;cousin&quot;?  He asked, his tone laced with a touch of sarcasm.  Millikin looked at him after a moment.<br><br>  &quot;Just the thought of two fire crazy wizards running loose and working in concert is...&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Frightening.&quot;  Autumn stated deadpan.<br><br>  &quot;... disconcerting.&quot;  Millikin tacked on.  Grinning slightly to Autumn.<br><br>  &quot;I'll be sure to torch a tree or two just for you.&quot;  Quasqueton gazed poignantly at Millikin, his eyes glinted with a trace of humor.<br><br>  &quot;I know of a very large one you can't possibly miss.&quot;  The ranger replied dryly.  &quot;It's called the Earthmelder.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;Hrmph.&quot;  Quasqueton sniffed, knowing exactly the &quot;tree&quot; that the ranger was referring to.  <br><br>  &quot;Actually, I don't know if you're familiar with her or not, nor if you keep up with practitioners of enchantment but do you know the Luhtmauyar Valdayana D`Varr?  I've something for her.&quot;<br><br>Quasqueton tucked the letter away into a pocket and a sudden rumbling was heard in the distance, indicative that a storm was approaching.<br><br>  &quot;D`Varr?  The name's familiar but I'm fairly sure I haven't met her formally.  Sorry.&quot;  He replied.<br><br>  &quot;Its almost as if she's fallen from the face of Norrath.&quot;  Millikin shook her head.  Snow began to fall at a steady pace and even gave Millikin pause.  Why didn't the animals seek cover beforehand?<br><br>  &quot;It seems almost unnatural.&quot;  She remarked mostly to herself.<br><br>  &quot;If you've a hunch of where she is, I can send you there.  Or close by.&quot;  Quasqueton offered, presuming that Millikin was speaking of the one whom she was searching for. <br><br>  &quot;If you could, the Nexus of Luclin please.  It will be easier to start from there.&quot;<br><br>  &quot;I really hate this place.&quot;  Autumn mumbled.  Quasqueton Fyrestrike gripped his staff and began another incantation, summoning energies to tear through the borders of time and space.  He calmly watched as they gathered around the ranger.  <br><br>  &quot;To the Great Divide, Autumn?&quot;  He paused.  For a brief second the eldritch beams that gathered around the ranger had disjoined but they quickly reformed and then she was gone.<br><br>~~~~~<br><br>Luhtmauyar - Elvish for Enchanter.
