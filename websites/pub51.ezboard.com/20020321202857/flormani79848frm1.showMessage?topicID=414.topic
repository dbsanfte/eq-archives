As I read all the posts I found myself drifting back a year ago and laughing as I relived sooo many fond memories. One thing I noticed as I was reading these posts was that most of the replies were connected to our &quot;newbie&quot; ages.  <br><br>Do you remember those days??  When we didn't have a care in the world except killing our first snake or bat or * shiver* spider????.  A time where LOOT meant getting a &quot;rusty sword&quot;????? Take a step back in time and try to remember your funniest or favorite incident . . .  <br><br>This is one that I added to the DoSG boards:<br><br>OH my - sooooo many fun times to remember - makes me laugh out loud!!! But my times on the JV TEAM were the BEST ever . . . We grew up together - Chanto/Montyy, Quas/Huzya, Nehi, Uggmugg, Syllie - we laughed - died and explored together and OMG how we LAUGHED!!!! We laughed at ourselves - at each other - at everyone else - at our mistakes - at our triumphs - dam - we never stopped laughing. We were surrounded by all Level 50's - and here we were in our 20's (that's why we were referred to as the JVers)<br><br>But 1 comes to mind immediately.<br><br>It was my first Hate raid - when Brice et al were still in LM. I was still part of the &quot;JV Team&quot; and we were asked to go on the Hate raid. Well Brice put me in the PULL GROUP. (to give me experience) This was a first and I immediately went NUMB with FEAR. I paced in front of my computer (really I did), I BEGGED everyone to take me out of it that they were making a HUGE mistake!! Didn't they know I had no idea what I was doing? Didn't they know they were ALL about to DIE???? I still break into a cold sweat when I recall that time. I can LAUGH about it now - but at the time I wanted to reach inside my computer and shake Brice by his neck!!! <br><br>How did the raid turn out . . Hell if I remember!!! Most likely everyone died  My God - how far we have all come since those days . . and you know what??? . . .<br><br>We are STILL LAUGHING!!!! And if Chanto/Montyy and Nehi come back to us - we will LAUGH even harder!! <br> <p><center><Br><B>Syllie</B><Br>58th Season Templar<Br> Officer of Lor Mani<Br>"She's short.  She's Purple.

I think my favorite memory was my 1st day in EQ.  I somehow got lost and wound up in LFay.  As I wandered around all alone, I saw a Giant Spider off in the distance, just wandering around in the morning forest.  I was terrified, and hid behind a tree (Note: I didnt even understand how to CON stuff at this point).  I kept peeking out from behind the tree to watch it, praying that it didnt see and eat me.  <br><br>It was an awesome rush.<br><br>Since then, I've killed dragons, attained my epic, and seen most everything... but nothing will ever take my breath away like that spider did. <p><center><Br><B>Quas</B><Br>24th Season Runemaster<Br>Peon of Gudar Och Myter<Br><Br><B>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</B><Br>56th Season Cabbie<Br> Officer of Lor Mani<Br>"Warning!

I just remembered Syllie's &quot;birth&quot; day in EQ.  I was given this game and told just to go out and &quot;get the feel&quot; of the game - kill a few bats - but to stick close to Kaladim and to have fun. Remember this is my first RP game - I am an adventure game convert!!! OK I do as I am told and all is fine until I start getting curious about what is over that yonder hill and down that path. So I start &quot;exploring&quot; a little.  Next thing I know I am *cough* lost *cough*. Yes folks my directional skills started when I was quite &quot;young&quot;<br><br>I now started calling Quas on the phone begging him to help me (I didn't know how to send a tell yet!! Well the harder I cried - the MORE he laughed and told me to figure it out.  I was too TERRIFIED to move - but after I realized that I was on my own - I started peeking around. <br><br>In the distance I saw light from a blazing fire with some comfy looking huts around it. I didn't see anything else. So I ran for the huts. As I rounded one of the huts there were strange looking creatures . . . all green and hunched over like.  LOADING, PLEASE WAIT<br><br>Ahhh - the good ol' days<br><br>Funny thing is - I STILL get curious as to what is around that next turn or down that next path!

I have too many memories unfortunatly most I am sure I have forgotten. But one I experienced recently will always stand out in my mind....<br><br>Life as a monk is pretty basic ... we are the only ones stupid enough to want to place ourselves in an area full of monsters that want to kill us that are all around us. Then just get one or two out while eluding the rest.<br><br>Well this task was slightly different. It's quest time ... here I am .. at my pinicle ... a lvl 60 grandmaster. My task is to sneak into the middle of the DE Outpost in OT and get a quest piece from Tektite(A garg that was dark blue to me). While on my way in invis, which I am praying doesn't drop because Zhale is too far out to reinvis me, I walk past hoards of dark blue mobs to include a cliff golem that towers above me. Now I had no idea where this garg was so I am running around on my tip toes as fast as possible looking for this thing all the while hearing that golem stomp about near by. My heart is of course racing. Well, I spot out the corner of my eye a pair of gargs. I run over and one of them is the one I need. So I quickly scout the area before dropping my invis. I start to sneak and turn the invis off and wait a moment because I am sure I am just gonna get destroyed. Well after about 30 seconds I figure I am ok so I turn it in and get what I need. So now the new problem ..... how do I get out. I have to run my ass off that's how. So I quickly say a small prayer to CT and turn off the sneak and bolt. While I am running I hear shouts from pissed off mobs all around me and I think my heart was beating so fast it might have blown had it gone any faster. When I am about 100yards from Zhale I start screaming at her to &quot;Hit it Hit it Hit it!&quot;(even I panic) which was the cue to start the evac. I get to her and she is still sitting there invis so I turn around in a panic .... yes there is about half the town running at us ... Dragoons, Golems, Ogres .... etc. I FD quickly ... but .. a Dragoon is too close! It agros Zhale as she then stands and starts to cast ... it comes bolting at her and due to the proximity the rest start coming again too. It hit her and I thought it was going to interrupt so we were dead for sure.

So there Keif lay crumpled up in front of the statue waiting for Quas to run his ass in there and evac them out.

I can recall another memory with Taludana, Lothius, Quilaren, Landaar, Koramin and Dalizar when we went to Crystal Caverns.  We had been hunting there for the past few days soaking up the xp.  The orcs in the caverns were getting easy so we had moved on to the queen spider lady the night before.  The loot, xp and fun were just great.<br><br>Arriving the next day in Crystal Caverns, Lothius (Nagram) in all his wisdom said, &quot;Hey, lets just lev to the bottom and head right for the queen&quot;.  In hindsight I think I would have recommended invis but then Quilaren would not have been able to send us some nice screenshots of the orcs we aggroed on the way down that slaughtered us. <br><br>The fight went something like the following.  Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman stop half way down to help reduce train to bottom.  Cleric and Enchanter head straight for the bottom.  Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman fight orcs unaware cleric and enchanter are now at the bottom.  Enchanter's AE mez drops and so does the enchanter a few moments later.  Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman think hmmmm why is our enchanter dead and why is the cleric getting hurt so badly.  Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman rush to bottom in attempts to save cleric.  Cleric gates out.... Warrior, Rogue, Druid, and Shaman... DIE. <br><br>The night ended quite nice with us all getting far more xp than what we lost, some decent loot off queen and company, a ton of fun, and a memory I will never forget.<br> <p><a target="new" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=7564">Dalizar</a> 52nd lvl Shaman of Lor Mani</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Roadkill Cabbie</span><br>  Posts: 865<br> <font color=#333333>(2/1/02 3:57:44 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=414.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Embarrassing Moment</span><hr size=1> Hehehehe!  I was in CC once with TooShort (Montyy's Pally) and a monk.  We were killing spiders down near the Queen (camped at the exit ramp).  We had a cleric, but quickly booted the putz when he tried to charge us for buffs.  Sooo.. Shorty took over as healer.  Well... he was drunk and got pissed cause the monk was a whining coward... so he started pullin.  It went well for a while.... until I went oom.  While I was medding, he asked for an invis.  I gave it to him (BIIIGGG Mistake).  He ran halfway down to the Queen and found that the Crystal Grinder was up.  <br><br>Next thing I hear (he was on a PC next to me) was &quot;I'm pullin the Grinder.  I'm pullin it&quot;.  To which I yelled &quot;Oh HELLLL no&quot;.  These 2 responses went back and forth about 4-5 times until I hear the dreaded battle music... which was almost completely drowned out by demented laughter... before I thought to look over at his PC, I see Shorty round the corner to camp.  Afterwards, my screen went completely white as 10+ spiders overran us.  The monk must've pissed himself, cause he forgot to FD.  Shorty died soon after, laughing his ass off.  Me?  I turned and ran... and ran... and zoned.... right into a Rygorr scout.  As an OOM wizzie wielding a 10/100 Staff of the Wheel... it wasnt much of a fight.<br><br>To this day, we still laugh about it.<br><br> <p><center><Br><B>Quas</B><Br>24th Season Runemaster<Br>Peon of Gudar Och Myter<Br><Br><B>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</B><Br>56th Season Cabbie<Br> Officer of Lor Mani<Br>"Warning!
