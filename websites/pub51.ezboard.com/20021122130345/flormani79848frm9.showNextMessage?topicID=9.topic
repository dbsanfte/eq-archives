I'm working on individual events now, so enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
       Alleusion wandered slowly out of Felwithe, she was in no hurry to get anywhere. Still reeling from the news that Laryssa had given her, Alleusion was in somewhat of a daze. She didn't notice the bats or wasps. She didn't see the new casters struggling to try out their new spells. From force of habit rather than real will, Alleusion walked toward Kelethin, towards Ebos and the comfort she knew she could find there.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Because Alleusion was not paying attention to where she was going, she did not see the black figure before she bumped into it. Falling to the ground had a way of breaking her daze, and she looked up at the tall thing standing there. It wasn't a man, she wasn't quite sure what he was. Garbed in the armor of a warrior, he had the face and body of a cat, standing on two legs.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp He reached out a hand to help her up and Alleusion noticed it was covered in fur. Shakily, warily, Alleusion took his offered hand and felt that his fur was soft, sleek even. The two stared at each other for quite some time before the stranger finally spoke. &quot;I am sorry my lady,&quot; came the stranger's deep voice, &quot;I was blocking the path. I am afraid that I am lost.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked up into his eyes, &quot;I was not watching where I was going. It seems we are both at fault here.&quot; Her voice was as shaky as she felt, for she was still in shock a little.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;No, but it does not matter, could you show my the way to the tree city? I wish to have my soul bound there.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked at the stranger, feeling she could trust him. &quot;I can bind you sir, come with me, we will go there together.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Thank you kind lady. Before we would walk off together, I would have your name please.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Laughing, she told him, and asked for his name in return. &quot;I am Obsidyan, a Khala Dun warrior from the town of Shar Vahl.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Well, Obsidyan, let's get you bound and begin to learn the wonders of Norrath. I take it this is your first time down from Luclin?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp They walked on through the forest as Obsidyan told her of his journey, from the time he stepped in front of his guild master, to learning the ways of the smith. He talked of the dangerous trek through Paludal Caverns, and the wonders I saw in Shadow Heaven. Alleusion nodded and smiled at all the right times, but her heart was not in the conversation. It was the silence she noticed first, then she noticed that Obsidyan was no longer by her side. She turned around to find him standing a few paces ahead of her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Are you alright m'lady?&quot; He asked.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion hadn't even realized that she had stopped walking. &quot;No, Obsidyan, I'm not. But don't please do not worry about me, I will be fine.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Upon reaching the lifts at the base of the tree city, Kelethin, Alleusion bound Obsidyan. With a few enhancing spells, she sent him on his way. Once again, alone, she sank down to the grass a few feet away from the lift. The world faded away as she retreated into her thoughts. Thoughts of her home, her family, her friends, and more recently her adventures. She was so deep in her thoughts that she barely heard the soft tread of boots on the ground near her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alle,&quot; Ebos began warily, for she did not look like someone who had just come from a joyful reunion with her family. In all honesty, he had not expected her back so soon.  &quot;How did it go?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked up, and all at once the events of the past hour caught up with her. She stood, looked down at Ebos and promptly collapsed at his feet. Ebos knelt down beside her still form, wondering what could have happened to cause her faint. Sighing, he smoothed the hair away from her forehead and took them to a place that he thought might help her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Water, she thought, I hear water. There is no water near Kelethin. I must be home. I'm home again. Sighing softly Alleusion opened her eyes and looked around. Hopes were dashed as she realized that she was not in Felwithe, but in Surefall Glade. Memories of the morning rushed up to her as she began to sit up. Ebos, was by her side in an instant. They were sitting near the waterfall, the water that Alleusion had heard earlier.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ebos took her hand, and turned her face to look at him, &quot;Tell me. Alle tell me what happened.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a very quiet, and oddly calm voice, Alleusion told Ebos all that Laryssa had told her. She showed him the note, and the robe. She spoke until tears ran silently down her face. Quietly he wiped them away and waited.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion pushed him away, a sudden anger dotting her cheeks bright pink, &quot;I should never have left. I should have stayed home, then they wouldn't be gone.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alle, if you had stayed then you might have been caught with them, and where would I be then?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp She looked at her hands, twisting her ring around her finger, &quot;Ebos, please, it's going to take me some time to deal with this. I know it wasn't my fault, there was nothing I could have done to prevent this, but maybe, just maybe if I hadn't left...&quot; she trailed off.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alle, listen to me. We don't have the time.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Confused, she looked up, &quot;What do you mean, ?we don't have the time'?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Halting, he didn't know where to begin, &quot;I have to go. There's a war out there Alle.&quot; Sensing that she was about to interrupt him, he rushed on, &quot;I know that you know all about it, that you've been fighting it too. But this one is different. When I went to my guild I learned of an expedition in Luclin. The men and women who left to explore the area just off of Shadeweaver's Thicket have been lost. They need to be found. I have been asked to go. To provide healing and strength to the battle group,&quot; he paused for a moment to catch his breath. &quot;I have nine days.&quot; Not a word was said as Alleusion took in this new information. Then, he told her, &quot;We leave from the Dreadlands portal in nine days.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Color drained from Alleusion's face as she realized she was losing him. &quot;You're leaving me?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;NO!,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I'm not leaving you, I'm fighting for you, I'm going to find these lost travelers, to find out what happened to them so that others can learn too. I'm not leaving you,&quot; he repeated with a whisper.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Why you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Because it's my job. It's what I pledged to do when I first became a druid. You know this Alle.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;So that's it then? You go and leave me alone here. I may never see you again, and you ask me to just accept this and go on? No...I can't.&quot; Without another word, Alleusion spun around and in a circle of glowing bubbles, she vanished.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alleusion!,&quot; Ebos called, sending her thoughts, but getting no response. Sinking down to the grass, he placed his head in his hands. He sat there for a long while, not moving, barely breathing, but knowing that she needed to be alone, that the time she needed, he couldn't give her. Hearing steps nearby, Ebos looked up, hoping to see Alleusion, but it was Syllie.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Without saying anything, Syllie sat down, next to Ebos, and stared out across the water. They sat this way for a very long time, neither on moving or speaking. Then with barely a whisper Ebos asked, &quot;You know?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Syllie nodded, &quot;Yes, I knew before she did. I didn't expect her to take it any differently, added to your news.&quot; Syllie nodded again as Ebos looked up sharply, &quot;Oh yes, Ebos I knew about your news too. Alleusion will come around, she loves you remember that.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the days passed and Ebos's departure neared, he feared that Alleusion would not be there to see him off. He saw her a few times, but she was always quiet, and acted as though her thoughts were far away. Ebos tried to get her to talk to him, to work through her pain, but she was not responding. Then, the day before he was to leave, she came to him.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Please,&quot; she began, &quot;do not ask me to be there. Do not ask me to stand there as you leave and know that there is nothing I can do. I don't think I would be able to handle that.&quot; With those words, she turned away, leaving Ebos to gather the belongings he would need for his trip.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The next morning, Ebos left, by himself to go to the Dreadlands spires to meet up with his team. The air was crisp and cold, as it always was in the lost valley. The trees were losing the green color of summer and beginning to turn red and yellow with the coming fall.  After obtaining the stone from the Nexus Scion, Ebos sat down to wait. At the sound of footsteps, Ebos looked up.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Syllie was walking towards him, along with other members of their guild. The guild leader Phobose walked with Zhale, Uggmugg, Quasqueton, Vindinian, Kegnar, Allus, Nagram, Dalizar, Taludana, and Rithum.  Ebos looked around, but did not see Alleusion. Sadly, he rose to his feet. Greeting his guild members one by one, noticing that there were some missing.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Not everyone could come to see you off, Ebos,&quot; Zhale began, &quot;but those of us that could, are here. We tried, but we couldn't find Alleusion.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;That's because she's here,&quot; said a familiar voice. &quot;I tried, god how I tried, but I couldn't leave you like this.&quot; Alleusion changed her form into that of a halfling so that she could look eye to eye with her friend. Lowering her voice, so that only he could hear her, she whispered, &quot;No matter what happens, I will be there. Look around you and I am always with you. When you look up into the skies of Luclin and see Norrath so far away, remember that I am there. Come home to me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion stepped away from Ebos, once more taking her natural form. &quot;We will be here when you return, friend,&quot; said Rithum, the bard who started his journey with Ebos and Alleusion so many years ago.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Uggmugg simply grunted, &quot;Be safe.&quot; The mighty ogre, was not much for words.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp One by one, they said their farewells. Ebos could hear the voice calling to him, that it was time to gather at the spires. He looked again to his friends, to his love, &quot;I will miss you all, please take care of her.:<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Syllie stepped forward, &quot;Safe travels, Ebos,&quot; she said, covering him with a mystic symbol. &quot;We will all take care of each other. That's is what we are here for.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Do not worry, Ebos,&quot; said Vindinian softly, &quot;she will be well taken care of.&quot; His gaze traveled to the high elf standing nearby, &quot;She is in good hands.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp With a flash of blue light, Ebos, the rescue party, and other travelers going to Luclin vanished. Alleusion, also, vanished, but was only invisible to the eye. She could not bear to see the faces of her friends, well meaning though they were. In time, she would come to move on, to put these things behind her. She would once again laugh at something funny that Syllie or Zhale had said. She would find friends to confide in.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Taking a deep breath, Alleusion vowed to put the past behind her and start out fresh from this day. She would not forget Ebos, for he would be back, but she knew, there was no use agonizing over events that she could not change.<br>
