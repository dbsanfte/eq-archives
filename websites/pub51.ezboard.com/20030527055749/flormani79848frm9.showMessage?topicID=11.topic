        Syllie stared at the paper she held in her hand. With disgust she read the letter that the priest had given her. &quot;Cleric,&quot; she practically spat the words out, &quot;I don't want to be a cleric.&quot; Slowly, shuffling her feet as she walked, Syllie headed to South Kaladim to hand in her guild letter and get her tunic. As she passed the gleaming white stairs to the warrior guild, she looked up. Anyone passing by would know that this young dwarf wanted to be a member of that guild. Heaving a sigh, she walked on.<br>
        Deep inside this dwarf was a desire to help people, she didn't see it yet, but obviously the priest had. Reluctantly and with great trepidation, Syllie opened the door to the cleric's guild. Standing in the doorway, she stopped and stared, her mouth hanging open. Lining the walls were dwarves in shiny plate armor, some had wicked looking blunt weapons in their hands, others were casting beneficial spells on themselves and on others. <br>
        Somehow, Syllie got her feet to move her forward. She handed in her letter and was welcomed into the guild, given a tunic, a club, and a few spells to start her on her way. She still wanted to be a warrior, but for the time being, she was going to try her hand at this whole healing thing. <br>
        Syllie sat down outside the guildhall, quill in one hand, spell book wide open on her lap. She picked up one of the scrolls that she had been given and began to scribe. Syllie repeated this with the other scroll. Putting away her quill, she looked at the words she had just written. Slowly and softly speaking the words to herself, she memorized first one spell, a healing spell, then the other one, a spell called strike.<br>
        Sighing deeply, she stood. Looking down at her club, she said softly to herself, &quot;Might as well get this started.&quot; Turning down the passageways that she knew so well, having grown up in Kaladim, she didn't worry about getting lost. She passed the guards standing by the firs on her way out of the gates, and saw before her mountains and valleys and places to get lost in.<br>
        Well, thought Syllie, they gave me a club, looks like I can bash things around a bit. Who needs these spells anyways. Glancing around, she spotted a goblin. Never having seen one before, Syllie walked closer. As the goblin spotted her, it shrieked, an ear shattering sound. &quot;Dwarves like you are better left dead! You have ruined your own lands, you'll NOT ruin mine!&quot; The goblin ran after the terrified little dwarf.<br>
        Raising her club to protect herself, Syllie hit the goblin. Shocked, she swung again...amazing herself that she was actually hitting it. She didn't notice too much that she was taking almost as much damage as she was giving, she kept on swinging her club, until the goblin lay dead at her feet. Blowing her hair out of her eyes, she said to the goblin's corpse, &quot;Ha! That's what you get for running after me.! What's this?&quot; Syllie spotted something on the ground, near the dead goblin. Picking it up, she noticed it was a backpack. &quot;Hey I can use this,&quot; she slung the bag on her back after putting her food and water inside of it, then picked up the few shiny coins that had dropped from the goblin.<br>
        Stepping back, Syllie now realized how badly hurt she was. Mumbling to herself, she searched for her spell book. &quot;What was that stupid spell again,&quot; she whispered. Flipping through all the pages, she finally found where she had scribed the healing spell. Calling upon her inner strength and the strength of her god, Syllie healed her wounds.  Hey, she thought, I could get used to this. <br>
         It seemed Syllie was getting used to the idea of being a cleric. Wandering around the mountains, close to the gates, she bashed things, she healed herself, and she gained experience. With the day's end, Syllie found herself having grown to the next spell level. Using the coins and items she had found off the creatures outside of her home, she bought her new spells.<br>
         After taking the time to scribe her new spells, Syllie once again set off for the mountains. Determined this time to do some more adventuring. On her way out of the town, she passed the warrior's guild again. Knowing now that the priest had been right, that her calling was not that of the warrior, but that of a healer.                                                       <br>
         This time, when she left the gates, she took a path that she had never ventured down before. Passing the few huts that sold goods to the travelers, she spied a fire burning in the distance. Curious about what was down there, she set off, leaving Kaladim behind.<br>
         &quot;Interesting,&quot; she said once she got to the fire in the center of some animal-hide huts, &quot;there's nothing here.&quot; Almost as soon as she said that, shrieks split the air as Syllie found herself surrounded by three of the gleaming green goblins. Backing away slowly, Syllie knew she was in trouble.<br>
         Looking around, Syllie could not tell which direction she had come from. Resigning herself to a long corpse run, Syllie fought with all she had. Stuns and force spells flew from the tiny dwarf as she fought bravely against the three evil goblins. Alas, she was not meant to win this battle. <br>
         A short time later, Syllie bravely ventured out towards the fire again. This time to collect her corpse and her belongings. Once again the huts were empty, but the young cleric had learned her lesson...she was not going to stay around for long.<br>
         Nervously glancing around her as she grabbed her things, Syllie could feel her hands shaking. Quickly, she stood, preparing to run back to town. Looking all around her, she realized, she didn't know which way to go. &quot;Oh where is that spell,&quot; she moaned as she frantically searched her book. Fingers running down the pages, she finally found it. After the incantation, Syllie was spun around to face a northern direction. &quot;Okay,&quot; she said to no one in particular, &quot;if I'm facing north, then town must be this way,&quot; and off she ran to the west, sighing in relief as she spotted the giant dwarf statue outside her home town.<br>

.....I'm going to leave it here......I have a few more ideas, but I need to give them time to grow. Syllie I hope this keeps you happy for now <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :b --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/tongue.gif ALT=":b"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>

It had been a long and tiring day and I was ready to sit down, get a much needed drink and just relax for a bit. My short Dwarvian legs were hurting from all the running and my back still ached from all the beatings I had taken.  As I plopped myself down in front of one of the cute friendly guards I wondered to myself just why I continued to put myself through such torture.  If I just stayed here - close to the guards - I would be safe. But being a Dorf I am just naturally curious - so after a brief respite I jumped up and brushed off my torn and battered tunic and turned my sights once more to adventure!!!<br>
<br>
Just as I was ready to venture out I heard my name being yelled from high upon a distant hill. <br>
<br>
&quot;Syllie . . . meet me at the Crossroads. I have a surprise for you,&quot; yelled Quasqueton.<br>
<br>
Now naturally, being a Dorf, I love surprises, so I hurridly set out on the path to the heavily guarded Crossroads. As I neared the Crossroads I spied my friend sitting with a group of strangers. All were deep in converstion and did not notice my approach.  I noticed that they were all laughing with strange looks upon their faces. I heard one rather tall ugly fellow say,<br>
<br>
&quot;Quas, ol' buddy - that is just too mean even for your devious mind. Syllie won't ever speak to us again! Are . . . &quot; Just then I walked into their circle and all conversation stopped.<br>
<br>
Quasqueton blushed a bit and with an evil grin on his lips, said . . . <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=11.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showNextMessage?topicID=11.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=11.topic&index=2><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.threadControl?topicID=11.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=11.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub51.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lormani79848frm22">Recruiting OPEN<option value="lormani79848frm23">Potential Members<option value="lormani79848frm1">General Information<option value="lormani79848frm3">Public Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm9">Stories & The Like<option value="lormani79848frm12">Trade Skills<option value="lormani79848frm25">Kegnar's Corner<option value="lormani79848frm11">Private Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm2">LM Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm8">Epic Quest (LM Members)<option value="lormani79848frm13">Resources<option value="lormani79848frm14">Members List<option value="lormani79848frm19">Sig Test and Title Requests<option value="lormani79848frm26">DAoC Members List<option value="lormani79848frm15">General DAoC<option value="lormani79848frm16">DAoC Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm18">Guild Bank<option value="lormani79848frm17">DAoC Officers</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/blormani79848>Lor Mani</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9>Stories & The Like</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.calendars.net/cals/eqlormani">Lor Mani Web Page</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br><br><br>Powered By <a href=http://www.ezboard.com/>ezboard®</a> Ver. 7.240<br>Copyright ©1999-2003 ezboard, Inc.</center></body></html>
