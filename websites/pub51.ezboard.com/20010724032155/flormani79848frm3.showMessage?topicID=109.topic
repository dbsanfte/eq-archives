<br>
<br>
Rules:<br>
1) The first rule of fight club is you DO NOT talk about fight club.<br>
2) The second rule of fight club is you DO NOT talk about fight club.<br>
3) Pull team is god, everyone listens to god or the next words you will see are ....LOADING PLEASE WAIT.....<br>
4) All class armor loots will be rolled on a 0 to 200 basis, Breastplates included, once you win a roll, you are out of rolling until everyone from your class has won a piece.  If you pass on a drop so that someone else will be out of the running later on, you will be the one who is out of the running.  For example if you pass on say a bracer so that if a bp drops there is one less person in your class that you have to roll against, it will be you who gets neither and you will be bumped to the bottom of the list. A Lor Mani member will be appointed as loot master and will be keeping track of who wins what items.<br>
5) Cash item loots - only your group leaders should be looting the corpses unless the group leader can not find the corpse.  When cash items are looted, they should be handed to the appointed Lor Mani member who is holding cash loots.  Lor Mani will be paying for the port up gems and cleric/chanter peridots for this raid, so we will be needing these cash items to recoup the costs.<br>
6) Rare gems (Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, Black sapphires, Jacinth) - These are to be handed to loot master to be distributed at random intervals during the raid.<br>
7) If the pull team is god, then the Main Assist and Secondary Assist are saints.  ALWAYS use your assist key to select the mob to fight if more than one is in camp.  If you don't assist, the enchanters will die and then we will all die.<br>
8)   Epic Drops: Enchanter epic drop, first goes to Strashana (if you don't like it, TFB!!!!) Other classes epic drops will be rolled upon 0 to 200 unless otherwis noted.<br>
9)  If you don't like these rules....TFB!!!<br>
<br>

One question - any chance at all that we might move upstairs? I'm not particularly fussed, 'cos it's gonna be a laugh whatever we do and I'm going to get the opportunity to die LOADS of times, lol; but it might be nice to actually visit Hate and leave with some form of druidy souvenir at some point. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :hat --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/pimp.gif ALT=":hat"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

<br>
Nice to see that our Hate raid is (?) being well-organised!<br>
<br>
I was skimming thru some sites looking for info on Hate and came across this lil gem of a post.<br>
<br>
Went on to say if you sit in the portal room, you'll get agroed and subsequently trained / wiped out. Secondly, I read that if you touch the walls you'll get trained / wiped out.<br>
<br>
Well, hopefully see you all on the 22nd!<br>

Things to note about this map are the mini-boss spawn locations are not marked, as well as the roamer patroll routs have been changed slightly.  The Red Circle marke SWC is our camp spot for when we get to PoH, the bright green line represents the path that should be taken to camp from the point marked GGP.  The point marked GGP is where you zone into the plane when a wizard ports you up.<br>
<br>
<!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i>   Mobs:<br>
<br>
There are 14 different mobs in Hate, and each is different.<br>
<br>
Cleric of Innoruuk - Cleric - They look like a Dark Elf guard. They have high magic resist, so harder to mez, and they love to complete heal. They also buff the mobs they pass with cleric buffs. Keep them stunned (bash/ slam) while fighting and kill them fast. They drop cleric gear. They do not see rogues or even normal invisible. They have a normal aggro range.<br>
<br>
Ire Ghast - undead Shadow Knight - They look like a ghoul and have low magic resist, so easy to mez, but love to HarmTouch, and do it a lot. Undead magic works on them. They drop some Paladin weapons (mace and sword) and a shield, and can also drop the druid shield, though extremely rare. They do not see rogues, but do see normal player invisible (although invis to undead would work). They have a small aggro range.<br>
<br>
Revultant Rat - Warrior - They look like a giant diseased rat and have low magic resist, but proc Deadly Poison. Only drop is a Ranger Whip. They do not see rogues, but may or may not see normal invis (some do, some don't). They have a small aggro range.<br>
<br>
Spite Golem - Shaman - They look like a rock golem. They have insane magic resist (although poison, disease, and the wizard Lure spells will usually stick). This is the most important target most times. If you get 2, one warrior, usually the backup assist, will keep second one busy while the group kills number 1. It is possible to kill several, but very, very tough, so be careful. They love to cast SoW and other Alacrity on everything close to them. They drop shaman armor including a shield, and a druid shield. They do not see a rogue, but see everything else. They have a large aggro range.<br>
<br>
Loathing Lich - undead Wizard - They look like a spectre and have very low magic resist but more hp than most mobs in Hate, plus are undead so undead magic works well, so usually easy kills. But they will cast the wizard damage shield (the annoying 2 damage spam shield). They drop a Necromancer rod. They DO see a rogue as well as anything else. *** BE CAREFUL *** They have a small self-aggro range, but will pass chain-aggro other mobs a very large range.<br>
<br>
Abhorrent - Rogue - They look like gargoyles and have very low magic resist, but love to backstab, so make sure the puller is careful pulling them. They drop rogue gear. They do not see rogues or normal invisible. They have a small aggro range.<br>
<br>
Haunted Chest - Warrior - They look like a bog box with teeth. They will proc a Nullify Magic, so they will strip your buffs. They can drop any armor item from the Planes of Fear, and possibly from Hate. They do not see a rogue, but do see others. They have an extremely small aggro range and are very slow. When pulling, the puller has to stay close, or the box will forget and go home. They even aggro other mobs at a very short range. Boxes spawn only in fixed locations. They are not on any other spawn table.<br>
<br>
Kiraikueis - undead Monk - They look like a mummy and have low magic resist. They will proc Strong Disease. They are undead, so undead magic works well on them. They drop warrior gear and a monk Shuriken. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis, though invis to undead would work. They have a very large aggro range, but a small pass-on range, so they will aggro with anything close, but not aggro the mobs around them... usually.<br>
<br>
Scorn Banshee - undead Warrior - They look like a female zombie and have low magic resist, but proc Strong Disease and hit a ton. But undead magic works. They drop Bard gear. They DO see rogues and all invis, including invis to undead, regardless of what con says. *** BE CAREFUL *** They do have a small aggro range, though.<br>
<br>
Forsaken Revanant, Male - undead Magician - They look like male vampires and have normal magic resistance. They also cast a mean damage shield and nasty AE direct damage. Undead magic does work. They drop mage gear. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.<br>
<br>
Forsaken Revanant, Female - undead Enchanter - They look like female vampires and have high magic resistance, but they do not cast charm. They do cast a damage shield, though. Undead magic works. They drop Enchanter gear. They do not see rogues but do see normal invis. They have normal aggro range.<br>
<br>
Ashenbone Drake - Necromancer - Looks like a skeletal dragon or a small DracoLiche from Fear. They have high magic resist and love to cast Fear, plus they hit like a tank. They drop a tank axe or a Shadow Knight shield or weapon. They do not see rogues, but do see normal invis. They have an insane aggro range and have been known to aggro stuff across the zone. Be extremely careful on this one's aggro.<br>
<br>
Maestro of Rancor - Bard - Looks like Lord Mistmoore, but since he hasn't been seen in a long time, I guess Mistmoore looks like Maestro. He is a Bard, but since NPCs do not use BardSong, you could say he's a warrior. He hits a TON and has an ae lifetap on everything in melee range. And if he has dual weapons, he hits extremely fast. He normally drops 2 items, mostly Bard stuff, though a few monk items and a nice dropable shield. He sees rogues and all normal invis, but his back is usually to the door so no problem. He is the lesser boss of Hate.</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> (full guide can be found from <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://www.thesafehouse.org">The Safehouse</a><!--EZCODE LINK END--> <!--EZCODE LINK START--><a href="http://pub13.ezboard.com/fthesafehouselibraryreadonly.showMessage?topicID=70.topic">here</a><!--EZCODE LINK END-->)<br>

<br>
The most important thing when you port in is NOT to train the camp. If you get aggro Die where you stand.. dont run, and most importantly dont run to the camp.. that would be bad.<br>
<br>
The old method for zoning in was to get to the top of the wall and run round to the camp. This is a bad idea now since you might aggro upstairs mobs now. I spoke to strash and it seems that if you run half way up the wall now you stand the best chance of making the trip trouble free.<br>

I don't see anything in there about last drops.  Honestly I'm going along to help Strashana get his epic drop, I've not got anything left up there (well except sleeves but I have better already), but poor old moley's been on the EM BP for the last 5 hate raids.<br>
<br>
She's lost roll on Cleric BP not less than 6 times (twice when it was 50/50).  Every hate raid I've been on operates on a rule where last piece is defaulted (unless 2 or more are on same last piece then its a roll).  However I appreciate that neither of us is in LM, and that the BP is one of the best pieces.<br>
<br>
RE 2nd floor twice.  Many of the mobs are 55+, can get enraged and hit very hard.  Mezzing was hard for a lvl 59 enchanter, ended up off tanking when got 2 mobs.  I'm not sure of the levels we have for this raid but its worth bearing in mind that its no cake walk up there <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   <br>
<br>
2nd floor rewards are slim (probably in the range one drop every 25 mobs) but worthwhile (nice ranger and druid armor,  seen a nice caster crown and a great 2hs war/rang culler, and superb 1hs sk/pal).<br>

I happened to have a minute and figured that I'd ask for clarification on one of the raid rules.<br>
<br>
4) All class armor loots will be rolled on a 0 to 200 basis, Breastplates included, once you win a roll, you are out of rolling until everyone from your class has won a piece. If you pass on a drop so that someone else will be out of the running later on, you will be the one who is out of the running. For example if you pass on say a bracer so that if a bp drops there is one less person in your class that you have to roll against, it will be you who gets neither and you will be bumped to the bottom of the list. A Lor Mani member will be appointed as loot master and will be keeping track of who wins what items.<br>
<br>
While I think this is a very fair rule, I am curious if there are any exceptions.  What happens if the drop in question is not as good as the item you are already using (and both items are no drop... so ya can't even sell one of them)?  Do you get penalized for not rolling?<br>
<br>
The only reason I ask this is cause I first thought about it back in Fear, where Wizzies can use both Cyrosilk AND Carmine. <p><center>

<br>
 I would be happiest if every one rolled on their class specific item if they don't already have the dropped item.<br>
For classes that dont get an item drop in Hate i would suggest waiting to the raid end when we can evaluate what cash items are available, bearing in mind that we need to cover the costs of gems for Clerics;the exception being any NO DROP items. *I* will be covering the cost of port gems as i instigated this raid for my Epic drop,but being a cheap ass impoverished Chanter i cannot also cover the costs of the clerics gems(Sorry)<br>
 To the Questions posed recently i am more than happy for anyone who has rolled on an item but NOT won anything to roll on items dropped by Bosses on a can + will use basis. I wont even begin to tell you what i think of people who say 'oh i can use that and i will' then have a twink try to sell it soon after. THAT really F^%$'s me off.<br>
 As to the Question of 'an item drops but is worse than what your already using' .I will not be happy if Items Rot because 'i don't need it' Happily with all the new Planes people going this time i dont think this will be a big issue, but i WILL insist you have the 'better' item with you as proof otherwise you will be booted to the base of the roll list(hehe) but may then pass on the roll with the approval of LM Officers prior to the raid.<br>
 I am uncertain as to the 'i won a roll but better has dropped' but i think it will be a case of TFB! IMHO you have won a roll and its just luck as to what dropped. If better drops later that is also Luck and i'd like to avoid re-rolling as it causes confusion and often resentment. At this time i'm not willing to risk disention in the ranks of LM and Friends. Example:I would Love Moley to win the roll for an EM BP as i have personal knowledge of how many times she's been stiffed on this piece but to avoid dissention i will not allow any defaulting other than the Chanter Epic Drop to me as i set this up. <br>
 What i will suggest is that you chat among yourselves before a nice items drop and if you can reach a mutually acceptable agreement then let myself,Brice, Adus, or Brunosi know before hand so we know what is going on. Otherwise it will be a case of all roll /0 200 and may the Gods be with you ! <br>
  Alternatively we *MAY* get several of the Good Items drop. I myself will NOT be rolling on anything unless i have my Epic drop AND all other Chanters have an item.<br>
 On a side note *this* post is subject to Editing in light of any future beatings (erm..discussions) i have with LM Officers hehe..... <p><BR><B><FONT FACE="dauphin" SIZE=4 COLOR="#800080">Strashana DweomerCrafter</FONT></B></BR><B><FONT FACE="gothic" SIZE=2 COLOR="#E6E6FA"><MARQUEE BEHAVIOR=alternate>~~~Righteously Vindicated~~~</FONT></B></MARQUEE><BR><font face="beckett" size=2 color="00FF00"><marquee behavior=alternate> J Booots </font></marquee></BR></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/ustrashana.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Strashana</A> at: 6/14/01 1:12:00 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Friend</span><br>  Posts: 157<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/01 1:07:56 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=109.topic&index=20>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Plane of Hate - June 22-24, 2001 (A new Thread)</span><hr size=1> /auc WTS Shield of the Stalwart Seas - 10k cp or trade for a Lasnik's Staff<br>
