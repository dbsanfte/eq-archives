<br>
<br>
The crisp cool air biting the tips of his pointy ears, the darkened elf walked down the long twisting tunnel.<br>
<br>
&quot;Damn the overworld&quot;, He muttered in distaste as he held his robes around his thin, fragile body, hoping to gather at least a bit of warmth.  Though the bitter cold he was really feeling wasn't from the biting wind, but a coldness from the soul.  This coming as a surprise to the elf, usually evil has a warm feeling to him, he embraces it.  Not this one it seems, something odd about this evil.<br>
<br>
As he neared the end of the tunnel, screams of torment surrounded him.  The pained screams of the spectres of fear.  Peering around the last corner, sure enough standing.. well rather floating.. with scythe in hand, a spectre.<br>
<br>
&quot;Great, as always, right in front of where you want to go.  I don't have time for this. &quot; he thought to himself shrugging.<br>
<br>
Pangs of forceful energy surged through his arms as he let loose a blast upon the spectre, wounding it badly.  He then blast it again, just for good measure as it feel over, a pile of wasted bones, and caked on flesh.<br>
<br>
&quot;Simple enough.&quot; He said with a sigh as he pressed onward finally reaching the end of the tunnel.  Taking one step in he knew where he was, a blast of bitter cold swept over him, though not a physical cold, just as before, numbing from the soul.<br>
<br>
&quot;I thought I told you not to come here..&quot; The Dark Elf said with a sigh as he turned to face a young female wood elf.<br>
<br>
Stopping abruptly, she looked up at him.  &quot;But...&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;No but's.. I told you this is something I need to do on my own&quot; he snapped at her.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vinny.. you can't go on thinking that you can do everything on your own, you are mortal, you need help sometime.&quot;  She said with a bit of whining in her voice. <br>
<br>
&quot;You feel it.. don't you?&quot; He waved his hand around sort of pointing out the cave they were in, &quot; You feel it's overwhelming power, right?&quot;<br>
<br>
With a slow nod is all the lighter skinned elf could answer.<br>
<br>
&quot;If you follow me, the feeling gets worse from here, and eventually, so strong you can't resist it's calling.  You'll become me.&quot;  He said this with a bit of brotherly love from his voice, &quot;And I cannot let that happen&quot;  Throwing his hands forward towards her, a loud crackle surrounded the young elf.  &quot;This breaks when I make it, or whenever I die...... I'm sorry&quot; The last word barely a breath.<br>
<br>
Pounding on the force furiously, but to no end, she finally sat down, with a bit of a pout &quot;Fine, I'll wait here for you then.&quot;<br>
<br>
He shrugged and turned his back to her, walking the way he was, the farther he walked, the colder he felt, the louder the voices became &quot;Kill them all, I command you child, destroy them!&quot;  He pressed onward, reaching the gate.<br>
A swirling mass of, nothingness, soul's trapped in it's very being warding those of the pure hearts out.  He knew that he wouldn't be stopped, though the keeper of this hell knew why he was here.  Stepping forward he reached his hand through the gate, then, with another deep sigh he marches forward again pulling he whole body through.  His body felt like it was being ripped apart, the very fiber of his being torn to shreds, his mind slowly devouring itself.  But he knew that this was all just a trick, nothing was happening to him, it just felt that way.<br>
<br>
Finally appearing on the other side, he was thrown to the ground, panting and groaning.  He clutched his chest as he stood to his feet, amazed at what he was looking at.<br>
<br>
&quot;The god of fear.. has trees in his hell?&quot; He said while blinking it off, he looked around him.  Though it didn't take him long to realize, burning trees, trees of death trapping the souls of the people that had died here an eternity of nothingness, if he's not careful he'll be one of them.<br>
<br>
As he pressed forward deeper into the hells, he knew it was too quite, not a sound, no demons, nothing.. Cazic Thule must have been waiting for him.<br>
<br>
&quot;At least he gets right to the point,&quot; Muttering to himself as he reached the gates to the castle, the coldness within was much stronger now, stronger than he's ever felt before.<br>
<br>
&quot;Cazic Thule! God of Fear! Show yourself, we have some business to attend to, you and I!&quot;  The elf yelled this quite forcefully, the disdain for the god in his voice.<br>
<br>
A loud crackle, and a pop as lightning struck around him, not even flinching he was so in tune to the god appearing, the coldness faded as he was so temperate.  A tall figure sort of there.. but not there, as the lightning flashed around it.<br>
<br>
&quot;What is it you want, Mortal?&quot;  The figure emphasized the word mortal. &quot;Why have you come looking for me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;You know damn well why I'm here Cazic Thule, I don't need to explain myself to you.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ah.. your sister, well if you want, I could send you to see her&quot;  It looked to be grinning but hard to tell.<br>
<br>
Boiling with fury, he let out a scream, charging his spell up, the figure stood.. figuring he could take anything this mortal could dish out.  The fury overtaking the small elf, he let loose his blast on the creature, knocking it backwards, dropping to one knee.<br>
<br>
With a groan the figure spoke &quot;Impressive, even for a mortal, I must ask.. how did you do that?&quot;<br>
<br>
Without answering the elf charged another blast to hit the creature, though this time he didn't stand around to find out how strong the mortal was, Cazic Thule hit him with the back of his hand, sending him flying into a tree.  The pain was unbearable, he wasn't meant for physical combat, the elf was a necromancer, based around magic, not fighting with brawn.  Standing to his feet with a limp, he awaited the tall figure, charging at him. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uvindinian.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Vindinian</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Friend</span><br>  Posts: 14<br> <font color=#333333>(4/26/02 11:09:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Revenge</span><hr size=1> I'll finish the story another time.. that's sorta, part 1 Lol Anyway yeah have fun. <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=13.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showNextMessage?topicID=13.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=13.topic&index=1><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.threadControl?topicID=13.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=13.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub51.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lormani79848frm22">Recruiting OPEN<option value="lormani79848frm1">General Information<option value="lormani79848frm3">Public Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm9">Stories & The Like<option value="lormani79848frm12">Trade Skills<option value="lormani79848frm11">Private Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm2">LM Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm8">Epic Quest (LM Members)<option value="lormani79848frm13">Resources<option value="lormani79848frm14">Members List<option value="lormani79848frm19">Sig Test and Title Requests<option value="lormani79848frm15">General DAoC<option value="lormani79848frm16">DAoC Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm18">Guild Bank<option value="lormani79848frm17">Officers<option value="lormani79848frm23">Potential Members<option value="lormani79848frm25">Kegnar's Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/blormani79848>Lor Mani</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9>Stories & The Like</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.calendars.net/cals/eqlormani">Lor Mani Web Page</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br> <!-- Start of TheCounter.com Code -->
