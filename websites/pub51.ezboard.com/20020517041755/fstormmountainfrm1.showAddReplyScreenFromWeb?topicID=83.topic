It shames me to see one of the members &lt;officers even&gt; would leave so soon after I trusted her with Leadership in the absents of Shaddai &lt;retired leader&gt; and Myself &lt;Leader awaiting a Co- Leader&gt;.  This shows me that noone in this guild is in full understanding of why SM was formed.  I thought it was to have fun and laugh and play together as a game and a means of passing time.  EQ has turned into a sick and twisted gotta-level, gotta-raid, gotta-have, addiction for some of us and has blinded many to the fact that ITS A GAME.  To get stressed out about it is easy and yes i am guilty of it.  But its still kinda silly if you think about it.  I have had many reaks from EQ lately and it gives me a chance to look back on it and laugh at some of the things that I have done.  I suggest anyone that is frustrated, stressed, pissed off, strung out, or just plain fed up with some of this stuff take a one week break and do other things Think about EQ and why you get mad at it when its not Real Life.  Because we all know if it was Real Life i would have killed you all and fed you to my pet LONG AGO.  I will see you all  in 12 days.<br>
Please keep me posted on anything that might have happened <br>

I think she didn't leave because she wanted 'bigger and better'. I think she left simply because she felt overwhelmed. I left because a large portion of my friends have, and SM no longer feels the same. My loyalty is to my friends personally, and I hope you remain one, not to the guild itself.<br>
<br>
I am not moving on to bigger things. I am considering joining a guild an old friend is in, but at the same time, I may very well go solo. You have every right to be angry at me, but I certainly hope you aren't. Sonnya's case was probably very similar to my own. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/ulochlannsm.showPublicProfile?language=EN>LochlannSM</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All-weather Mountaineer</span><br>  Posts: 2<br> <font color=#333333>(2/27/02 3:10:57 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fstormmountainfrm1.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=83.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Checking In</span><hr size=1> I think the link below describes what happens to those who DON'T take breaks from EQ here and there, and the whole &quot;bigger and better&quot; thing that affects a lot of us sometimes..and can make us think of the game as &quot;work&quot; and a frustrating experience.<br>

(Not saying that this is the mindset of those who left recently.  Not at all.  Just saying that getting too involved with EQ and everything that goes with it can have determinal effects.)<br>

<br>
I love SM, but honestly, I couldn't deal with the stress of trying to hold this guild together anymore. My loyalty has lain with my friends since I started playing this game, and it always will; I still consider SM my friends. But the bickering, sniping, and whining was going to drive me insane.<br>
<br>
You said it yourself, you've been on break a while. Please don't judge someone elses' actions when you may not understand the motivation behind them. I understand your anger because of the timing- 2 days after accepting leadership is soon- but know she had her reasons, too.<br>

You should have full support of their decision, like we all have, even if you don't agree with it. The reason Rennae left was because, well I just wanted to and it felt right. Thats the same with a lot of people. Would you rather have had the people that left leave EQ and never talk to them, or just leave the guild and easily send them /tells..? I also think that you shouldn't get stress over a game, but for some they have tried to but it takes time and sometimes, a few changes...<br>

I'm sorry i'm stressed out, i'm sorry i can't be like you,  i'm sorry im facing a divorce, i'm sorry im by myself with two kids and its not easy...  my baby just had surgery ,  and in it things could have gone wrong {luckily} they didn't and i just got home from an all day hospital trip! <br>
I'm sorry i thought we were friends enough that you would be a real friend and simply say im sorry you left at the time you did im here for you if you need me, cause thats what FRIENDS do! <br>
I'm sorry I started playing this game to relieve stress and a get away from everyday bullshit! And i never started playing this game with the intention of making friends, and not at all to lvl and join SM and stick around in a dead guild where 95% of my friends are GONE !!!!<br>
You yourself were about to go to Grey Soldiers and wait weren't you trying to get a certain officer i know to go with you????  So how dare you criticize me for anything ive done!<br>
 Yes i joined Fifth Eclipse, for some reasons NOT being lewt!<br>
I haven't played Sonnya since i quit SM, and further more <br>
probably won't even start recruiting til i get back from the long vacation i need at my parents home and thats 6 months down the road that i'll be getting back! So yeah there's my &quot; eq vacation&quot;  for ya!<br>
<br>
I've never outright blasted on you or anyone else for leaving ,  i didn't like it but we all play this game WHY b/c we all want an escape from reality and damnit i pay for it so why should you or anyone else have the right to flame me or be upset at me for what i choose to do with my char???? Exactly, you don't have that right,..... IF you want to be a friend fine be one but don't dare sit behind your comp in your own unhappy little world and put me down for what i do to make ME feel better and enjoy eq with ok!<br>
As for leadership nobody wants co-leadership geez as if its not obvious enough!  Lauriston has it on his little twink gnome he'll gladly give it to you when you get back,  I hope you enjoy your vacation with your wife and kids  G'day Steve <br>
