Very important stuff on a raid.<br><br>In my on-going effort to “be that all I can be” I’ve been researching strategies, techniques, and rule of thumbs of being the “main tank”. I thought I’d pass along my nuggets of wisdom so that I may share them with the gang.<br><br>Whether it is a 6-man group or a full-scale raid, agro management is a major issue. Keeping a mob on one person, instead of all six saves mana and it saves lives. Typically, the man for this job is the tank – be it a warrior, pally, sk, ranger (laugh), or even a monk. It’s the tanks job to keep the mob on him at all times. Otherwise you’ll have a caster running around like a chicken with his head cut off and a healer bitching for said caster to sit still. However, having some quick weapons and a quick finger on the taunt button is not all it takes to keep a mob focused on the main tank. Really, it depends on what everyone else does (and does not) do, that allows the main tank to keep agro on him. This is where the “management” comes in.<br><br>But Blitzfeld, how can I be put on the fast track to Agro Management?<br><br>Well, let’s start by looking at the screenshot:<br><br>www.legacyofsteel.com/ima...uezerg.jpg<br><br>The first thing you will notice is the location of all the players. Proximity has a big impact on a mob’s hate list. Mobs like to hit the guy closest to them. They are lazy; they don’t want to run after you if they don’t have to. Don’t believe me? Then agro a mob and get him real pissed. Then root his ass and run off a bit while you sucker a friend into standing close to the rooted mob. Your friend will get smacked around like a redheaded stepchild. Sure the mob hates YOU, but your friend is more convenient at the moment. He’s not going to wait for root to break, he wants to hit something NOW! Well in the picture, the two tanks are the closest people to the mob. All other melee players are surrounding the mob on all sides at the farthest possible melee range. And casters? You can’t see any casters in the pic because they are even farther away! Healers only have to be close enough to heal the tanks, nukers only have to be close enough to blast the mob. There is no reason for anyone to be up close and personal with the target EXCEPT for the main tank. Something else to keep in my mind here. All mobs have different melee ranges. The bigger the mob, the farther away you can be and still hit it. If you are fighting a wisp, then the whole group has to squeeze in tight to get a whack at it. If you are fighting a giant, then you can get relatively far away and still be able to do damage. <br><br>Is there anything else I need to know Mr. Thunderwrath?<br><br>Yes! Proximity to a mob isn’t the only thing you need to know. Knowing your abilities and your spells is the next step. Every action you take in battle can increase your location on a mob’s hate list. If you are not the primary or secondary tank, you better be damn sure you keep yourself below them on the Hate list. If you are a melee character and find yourself pulling a mob off the main tank, stop attacking! Take your hits but don’t hit back. Let the main tank regain agro on the mob, maintain it, and then resume your fight. Now if you are a caster, you know how much mobs hate it when you cast spells. Whether it be healing another player, or applying that DoT – it pisses mobs off something fierce. It’s up to your judgment to know when and how often you should cast. So what if that big bad mob keeps resisting your DD, don’t keep repeatedly hitting that spell gem when it refreshes. Even a resisted spell moves you up a mob’s hate list. Unless it’s a matter of life or death (and often it can be), take a break between casts to let the main tank reassert themself on the hate list. <br><br>But wait! There’s more!<br><br>When it comes time to fight a mob, give the main tank 5 – 10 seconds of private time with the creature. If the casters start blasting right away, the mob is going to be ping-ponging around the room. And if the melee players jump in too early, the healers are stuck trying to heal multiple targets with a limited mana pool. I make a habit of counting the hits of the main tank before I even hit my /assist button. This makes sure I’m not getting slapped upside the head AND I’m attacking the correct mob (not the mezzed mob main tank had targeted 30 seconds ago). Speaking of mezzed mobs, let the main tank hit the taunt button a few times before everyone decides to “wake it up”. The enchanters will thank you for it and so will the cleric who doesn’t have to heal the wimpy enchanter. <br><br>Most of this stuff is common knowledge, but it never hurts to share strategies and tatics no matter how simple. There is no right or wrong way to play, but as a tank I think these little rules can make all the difference. Growing up in Halas, I used to get yelled at for not taunting enough (yet I was hitting the button every chance I got). Now I realized that those were just crappy players who were dumping all their mana on a mob the minute it spawned. No wonder I had a hard time pulling mobs off them. These rules don’t always work, but they can apply in many situations. In large scale raids, its often the only way to go. <br><br>P.S. If you are not the main tank – DON'T HIT YOUR TAUNT BUTTON.<br><br>Follow these simple steps and you two can have a successful career as an Agro Manager.<br> <p><center><img src=http://www.knology.net/~kbpalmer/images/manac1.jpg></center><p><br><a target="New" href="http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=54119"><b><font color=black><font size="3">Items of Death</a></font size></font color><br><font color=black><i>In my 52nd Season of Summoning the Dead</i></b></font color></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/bstormmountain.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=dyarriglawne>Dyarrig Lawne</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Drunken (smithing) Master</span><br>  Posts: 22<br> <font color=#333333>(1/19/02 12:11:47 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fstormmountainfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aggro Management</span><hr size=1> NIce post Manac,<br><br>I would like to add some thoughts to this as well.<br><br>A successfull tuant places that person at the top of the hate list by one point.  IF the person who previously had the aggro focus does ANYTHING before the tuanter can add to his Hate score, the last hated can easily regain aggro.<br><br>If a caster or melee gains the Aggro focus, he must allow the MA to rebuild Aggro - especially in the case of lvl 50 + mobs.<br><br>For the main Aggro, there are some other things he can do to add to his hate score while holding the focus.  As was said - Build a nice hate score by having a one to one time before others engage.  Also, he can do Hate adding skills while fighting - mainly Disarm attempts and Begging attempts.  Both will add hate points in addition to regular melee actions.<br><br>As a Ranger, I can often peel aggroed mobs off other casters (such as a failed mezz of adds on the enchanter) and once successful - draw them to the MA, hold them for a reMezz attempt, or pull them to the side and root them. Having that tuant button at the ready is very usefull to quickly gain the aggro, then stop attacking for the mez.  However, when simply being a damage dealer, I follow the calls of the MA and attempt to stand right behind him that way I know I am not closer to him.<br> <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/ubumadan.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Bumadan</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>All-weather Mountaineer</span><br>  Posts: 7<br> <font color=#333333>(1/20/02 1:18:29 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fstormmountainfrm2.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=18.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Aggro Management</span><hr size=1> I have heard rumors that the mobs in Fungus Grove act a bit differently regarding aggro.
