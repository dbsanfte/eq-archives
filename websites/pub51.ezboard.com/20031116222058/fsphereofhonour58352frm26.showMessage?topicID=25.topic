<br>
Our legions defeated wave after wave of enemy forces...<br>
<br>
Sarnak...<br>
<br>
Goblin...<br>
<br>
Outlanders...<br>
<br>
The sun was bright... without a cloud obscuring it.. truly a wonderous day of victorys for the legions of cabilis...<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
As I lifted my hand and wiped the dust and Outlander blood from my eyes, I saw her...<br>
<br>
Her tail swayed hypnotically from side to side almost instantly gaining my attention from a distance...<br>
<br>
There was something differnt about this monk, that much was obvious...<br>
<br>
She stod atop a large pile of the bodies, obviously she had killed them herself as no one else was near her...<br>
<br>
The sun glistened off her blood and sweat covered scales...  something differnt indeed...<br>
<br>
I smiled at her from across the field and the years of training under Grand Master Gloxx enabled me to see her as she looked back and smiled in my direction...<br>
<br>
For a moment the world ended as we stared at each other....<br>
<br>
Then she made a tiny moment with her tail pointing in my direction...<br>
<br>
I smiled...<br>
<br>
Then kicked backward hitting a goblin in the stomache.  As it arched over in pain i grabbed it's head and twisted, snapping its neck.<br>
<br>
I looked up to see her gone...<br>
<br>
&quot;Where did she go?&quot;  I asked myself...<br>
<br>
As the days carnage continued I looked through our ranks for her but she was no where to be seen... <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/umysticmonik.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MysticMonik</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#330000>(4/30/02 4:23 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cabilis</span><hr size=1> A wonderous story indeed fine Monk.<br>
<br>
I do remember a day long ago when I also fought this battle. Many a Goblin, Sarnak and Outlander did I kill.<br>
So many so that I too stood atop a mound of dead. Many dead. This happens so often I cringe to think of it.<br>
Battles that never seem to end, but alas we go on and do what is indeed our duty. A duty that although, we dont like it, we do it because it must be done.<br>
<br>
But that day was to become a day as I have never had happen to me before...<br>
<br>
As I stood on this hill assessing my situation. I noticed on a hill a ways away from me an Iksar of fine bearing and noticably regal lineage. I could tell by the way he held his tail that he was a Prince of Iksars. He had much fine armament on him. He was a fighter indeed. I watched as he dispatched many Goblins, Sarnaks and hordes of Outlanders. He killed many with just his bare hands. He was indeed a fighter to be recond with.<br>
<br>
As I stared at him, he finished off his latest oponent and noticed me staring at him. I smiled, he smiled back. I thought, &quot;Wow, what a handsome monk is he. I must meet him when we are through here.&quot;<br>
<br>
But alas this was not to happen. As he stood there a goblin came at him. I just saw as he kicked, and that was all I saw...<br>
<br>
I seemed to have been whisked away. I know not what happend. I just know that I was one place then all of a sudden I was someplace else...<br>
<br>
It has been many weeks now, as I sit here. I am imprisoned in a tower. I know not where. I am fed by a loathsome small goblin of some kind. He smells horribly and looks the same. <br>
<br>
I dont know what is expected of me as no one talks with me. I practice my training every day. It seems the only thing that will help keep me sane here.<br>
<br>
I only hope that the handsome Iksar I saw from that hill will take it upon himself to find out what has happend to me. Mayhaps he can find me and find out what happend and rescue me from this tower. <br>
<br>
I do hear noises outside, they are growling noises. I cannot distinguish what kind of animal they come from but I dont like the sound of it....<br>

<br>
She motioned for me to sit in front of him.  I did so most quietly...<br>
<br>
Apprehension filed my heart as i remembered the story of a young student of the Grand Masters that had interrupted his meditation.  The Grand Master had heard foot steps running twoards him and simply struck at the noise.  The resulting impact shattered the pupil's sternum and compressed his chest to such a degree that the ribs broke free from one another and some protruded out of his body along the sides of the unlucky one.  Of course there was nothing the healers could do.  A terrible way to die.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grand Master&quot;, Master Niska started,  &quot;this one wishes to speak to you.&quot;  Grand Master Gloxx did not seem to hear her words in any sense as she motioned for me to speak up.<br>
<br>
&quot;Grand Master, &quot;  I started in the sturdest tone i could muster, &quot;I beleave I am ready to advance to the 38th rung of our order...&quot;<br>
<br>
The Grand Masters eyes opened, My heart filled with fear as an almost inaudible wisper came from his lips &quot;What do you see in front of your fist.&quot;  He asked, starring intently at me, seeing through me...  knowing i was afraid... <br>
<br>
My eyes could not bear to look upon the Grand Masters face as much from reverance as fear as i shifted my gaze downward upon the dirt of the Court of Pain, hoping the answer would be written somewhere there.<br>
<br>
What seemed like forever passed as i continued to look at the dirt upon which i sat, having no idea what to answer... Afraid TO even answer, thinking the wrong one might bring disaster upon me...<br>
<br>
Then suddenly i jumped as Master Niska's hand touched my shoulder... <br>
<br>
&quot;It is time for you to leave.&quot;  She said matter of factly...<br>
<br>
As I stood up to leave the Grand Masters presence, I stole a fast glance at him to see that he had mearly returned to his meditations...  <br>
<br>
My heart sighed in releif as I left the courtyard and returned to the city...<br>
<br>
Then I realized he had not answered my petition to advance and my heart sank lower then when I cowered before him...<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The next day found me at the local pub.  A small tent pitched outside the bank in an obvious attempt to seperate fools from their money.<br>
<br>
I walked in somewhat still down for my poor showing the day before with the Grand Master and ordered a brandy.<br>
<br>
As I downed shot after shot in one gulp I continued to hear his words, the only words I had ever heard the Grand Master speak  &quot;What do you see in front of your fist...&quot;<br>
<br>
I took another gulp of brandy as I held my other fist out in front of me and looked at it intently...<br>
<br>
What indead I thought...  What could possibly he be asking me about?<br>
<br>
War?<br>
<br>
Creation?<br>
<br>
Power?<br>
<br>
Death?<br>
<br>
Life?<br>
<br>
I looked at the knuckles for a moment... Wondering about the legacy of fist and tail, about how Grand Master Gloxx's teacher was the Iksar that brought the ways of fist and tail to our legions... could that be it?<br>
<br>
As I contiplated these things my eyes wandered just past my fist to a pair of legionaries and a mystic.... <br>
<br>
From the sound of it they appeared to be laughing about the misfortune of some female monk in the other days battle against the goblins...<br>
<br>
Then she flashed in my mind again, the thought of how the sun glistened off her blood bathed scales intoxicated me...  The almost hypnotic swaying of her tail as it went from side to side... then how it pointed at me...<br>
<br>
Then the image was shattered as one of the legionares slammed his mug down on the table, laughing loudly, shouting mocking words against those of fist and tail to the crowd...<br>
<br>
Several of the younger monks glared at him threateningly, the older wiser got up and left.<br>
<br>
I to stood for a moment.  But not to leave.  I walked over to their table and staring him in the eyes hissed &quot;Where is she?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is who monkey?&quot;  He laughed... &quot;I have no idea of whom your refering to...&quot;  Smirking he raised his mug again to take a swig of his ale only to find it swatted with a fierce stroke of my hand across the tent and into the canal.<br>
<br>
The legonaire stood up and began to draw his sword.  I fell back a foot and began to throw a punch when we heard a shout &quot;If you have a dispute take it up in the arena, ALL OF YOU!&quot;  There were at least a dozen Crusaders and Legonaires gathering around the tent to enforce the peace... It seems like this has happened before...  &quot;The streets of Cabilis are no place for your acts of mock tyrrany.  Any attack against a citizen of this city will result in the immediate accension of that person to Cazic Thule... Any questions?&quot;<br>
<br>
I smirked...<br>
<br>
&quot;I'll be in the arena&quot;  I said looking at all three of them and backing out of the tent...  I then took a single step backward falling back-first into the canals...<br>
<br>
Ahhh... the cool refreashing canals of Cabilis... How I love them so...<br>
<br>
A few moments latter, I found myself in the other section of town....<br>
<br>
Climbing out of the canal, I walked up the stairs to the gauntlet...  It was here that the first monk, Grand Master Gloxx's teacher, proved the ways of fist and tail... It was here that he defeated three of the cities warlords to prove a point... And it will be here that more legion blood is spilled.  Everything, including DEATH is legal here.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
About an hour latter a sizable crowd had began to form to see this dispute resolved.  Many of the patrons of the bar, including the local authorities on gambling, had shown up and began to place bets on the outcome.<br>
<br>
Suddenly like a wave of the ocean, the sea of Iksars parted as they all almost jump backwards at the approach of a small group of Iksars.  The masters from the Court of Pain were here, perhaps they had reconsidered and allowed me to advance.  Or perhaps they were here to watch my abilities then make a judgement.<br>
<br>
MY HEART FROZE!<br>
<br>
I swear to you it did not beat for more then a minute as I saw who stood in the middle of the circle of Masters.  <br>
<br>
It was Grand Master Gloxx. <br>
<br>
I had never, EVER, heard of him leaving the Court of Pain before, much less watching a gauntlet fight.<br>
<br>
The frightened crowd did not make a sound as the Grand Master made his way to the side of the gauntlet at its very edge.  He sat down, in perfect view of the whole field and closed his eyes as if meditating.<br>
<br>
No one made a sound, none dared to after hearing the report of what happened to the pupil.  It was an accident, granted, but no one made a sound anyway.  Mostly out of fear then respect.<br>
<br>
&lt;SUDDENLY&gt; the shear silence was broken as the sound of metal clanging against itself filled the block.  The two legionaires walked forward in their total regala accompied by the mystic in all his pious garb, clanging his stave on the ground as he walked...<br>
<br>
They steped into the gauntlet and the crowed still remained silent out of fear.<br>
<br>
The legonaires began to curse me and the order of Fist and Tail, as only a legonaire could, as the shaman smiled.<br>
<br>
I was not foolish in the least bit.  The taunting did not affect me.  I smiled at them and turned my back on them.  I reached into my belt pouch and took out a blind fold.  Placing it firmly over my eyes i could feel the admazment in the crowd.<br>
<br>
Everything went silent.<br>
<br>
Concentrate....<br>
<br>
Listen....<br>
<br>
The heavy breathers....  Listen for the heavy breathers....<br>
<br>
There they were... the legonaires are so predictable...<br>
<br>
&quot;Move like water&quot;  The first lesson a monk learns...  It took me twenty seasons to understand... untill I fought in the battle to wipe out the sarnak in their fort in the lake of ill omen...<br>
<br>
&quot;Move like water&quot;  Flow.  Take the path of least resistance.<br>
<br>
I took a deep breath, and relaxed.<br>
<br>
The legonaires seeing this lunged forward.  As they approached within a foot of me I dropped to my knees and rolled backwards.  Once behind them I kick each one in the back of one knee so hard it shattered it and they flew backwards smashing into the ground on their backs.<br>
<br>
I rolled to my feet and in a blinding instant puched both of them in the throat crushing their voice boxes.<br>
<br>
I as I stood up I pulled the blindfold off.  A look of shock, horror and total disbelief was fixated on their faces as the blood spurted from their mouths.  They chocked to death, slowly and painfully as their eyes glazed over.<br>
<br>
I turned around and looked at the shaman.  He had frozen in his place... afraid to move without his friends...<br>
<br>
I walked over to him and took his staff from his hands, starring into his eyes daring him to move.<br>
<br>
Then I brought it down with an explosive crackle on my knee.  It exploaded with the force of it's magical energy burning both of us.<br>
<br>
&quot;Where is she?&quot;  Was all I had to say..<br>
<br>
&quot;The tower of Kurn, we ...we...&quot; He voice shook in extrem fear barley able to get the words out.. &quot; We saw a goblin shaman cast a spell on her and his squad carry her away......&quot;<br>
<br>
I turned around and walked out of the gauntlet... and just as I had almost set foot to jump into the canal I heard mystic words being spoken...  I recognized them... apparently the shaman had gotten his courage back and was casting a frost spell at me....  I smiled...<br>
<br>
Suddenly I heard the shaman scream in the grip of agony as a dozen Crusaders harm touched him for trying to harm a citizen of the city while they were not in the gauntlet...<br>
<br>
As the Grand Master got up to leave, the smell of smoldering Iksarian flesh filled the block.<br>
<br>
I knelt, most humbly, before him as he walked by me...  My head held as low as I could possibly get it..<br>
<br>
After he had left the sound of the crowd begain to fill the block again as winners and losers collected exchanged their gold.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The sun was shinning as I walked past the gates of the city into the feild of bone.  An epic battle was once fought here, with neither side winning.  I wonder if that means anything.<br>
<br>
AN OUTLANDER!  My senses jumped... It was female.. clad in armor with sword and shield.<br>
<br>
&quot;I do not condone the magical disappearance of people... I fight this bad magic with all my skills...&quot; She said..<br>
<br>
&quot;Sssssoft  Ssssskin&quot; I spit the word out as a curse at her...  &quot;Go back to your outpost...  I would kill you where you stand if it were not for the fact you were the ONLY person to even ask, much less care, about this missing member of my order&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Now leave or suffer the fate of those foolish enough to tempt the anger of The Fist and Tail.&quot;  I snareled<br>

I have heard of your plight.  My magic and my hounds I offer to your aid.  This disappearnce of your guild mate is very disturbing.  We will rectify this.  We also need to teach these goblins that they need to stay in their own lands and leave us more civillize beings alone.<br>
Please Victorryy accept my help.  I wish to help you in retreiving your sister monk.<br>

<br>
If Victoryy will not accept my help I would ask that you accompany me. We shall follow him at a distance and when and if he needs our help we shall be there for him. <br>
<br>
I know this Mysticmonik. I met her once long ago when she was still much younger than she is now. She, at that time, was a monk of reckoning, but did make friends easily and we forged a friendship at that time. I have not seen her since, but would help Victoryy and her to overcome this evil that has moved into their lands.<br>
<br>
My magic should help us to some degree and my sword shall do the rest.<br>
<br>
With your magic and healing powers we shall be a force that all will run from. <br>

Iskars can be so proud at times.  It is one of their few faults.  I do not boast of my powers but as you know I am one of the more powerful Wise Ones of my land.   Between the three of us we should be able to send those foul goblins surring in terror.  My hounds can find Mysticmonks sent and lead us to her. <p>Love and Respect Always<BR>Reoki Phyreheart<BR>Shaman and Officer of the Sphere of Honour</p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/usornwolf.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Sorn Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Registered User</span><br>  Posts: 18<br> <font color=#330000>(5/11/02 5:06 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=25.topic&index=9>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Cabilis</span><hr size=1> Humm.

Well Sis your not going without me.<br>
