By the Associated Pixies<br>
<br>
Neriak 3rd Gate -  The mistress of Innoruuk took on an obscure mentality late Thursday night.  While asking for the 100th time “Hail what is the next symbol quest!” of all the members of the Priests of Hate she finally asked “What is beyond the Regent symbol?!  Surely you hosemonkeys have something better than this damn charm I earned at level 32!”  <br>
<br>
The guards out front had overheard the conversation and were beginning to assemble outside the moat in case there was a throw down inside the church.  The argument ensued and Perrier Zexus’s cousin, Atemol Zexus of the Dread Guards was sent in to negotiate.  <br>
<br>
Shortly thereafter the aforementioned Mistress of Innoruuk, Zyla began to /shout to the rest of the zone for some answers.  Tension was building in this serene little zone where the largest events are newbies getting lost trying to find the Nektulous Forest.  Clearly this was not going to be settled by mere mortals.<br>
<br>
Vorshar the despised traveled from Neriak Commons (complaining about the zoneline between the two places indicating that his condo in Lavastorm was larger and he did not have to zone when he wanted to get a snack from the kitchen from the torture room.)  Despite his powerful stance, Zyla disregarded Vorshar’s words as though he were a peasant from Freeport begging for buffs.  The crowd was growing steadily larger as people from East Commons were bored from trading and soon invis’d to the Third gate to see a Dark Elven cleric on the brink of insanity take our her own church and guildhall.<br>
<br>
The Indigo brotherhood decided this had turned to a terrorist attack against Innoruuk himself and were planning a full-scale war against the lone cleric.  The Dead were called in along with reinforcements from the Overthere.  Venril Sathir himself was summoned along with the Generals battalion of guards from the Outpost in Kunark.  Even the Cliff Golems were brought in just to make sure they had the upperhand in this matter.<br>
<br>
The cleric was sitting down, at the top of the temple looking at the small mass of evil surrounding the moat where the Priests of Innoruuk normally sat peacefully singing their songs to their god.  Yes this Mr. Rogers neighborhood had quickly turned downhill.<br>
<br>
Member of her guild, Lor Mani, were rushed in from around the globe and planes in an effort to resolve this matter.  Montyy went on record saying, “She dis a strange darky.  She wus nice to me und everyone.  She remedied those around her all da time.”<br>
<br>
Reyu-chu was asked to try and talk to Zyla however he was quickly thrown out of the temple and into the moat before he had the chance to say “Hai…….aiiiiiieeieeeeee!” *Splash*<br>
<br>
The Indigo brotherhood was nearing its swift strike against the cleric when information passed from an old Gnome Nuprin (aka little, yellow, different).  Nuprin informed Dragoon Z’tyl that Zyla was last seen in Befallen, Unrest, EC, Najena, and Rathe Mountains.  As the dragoon said “ Away with the gnome and off with his head!” Nuprin screamed out, “Beware the staff of Ankexfen!”<br>
<br>
While many people were chanting ‘GNOOOOOME!’ a few of the old school characters began to change their face to a look of terror.  Whispers in the crowd started talking about the Staff of Ankexfen being more powerful than the fabled Tome of Ages.<br>
<br>
While this commotion was going on, Zyla single handedly threw out the guildmaster Perrier Zexus stating that, “You take your French Ass and purify it in our water for a change!”  Rogues inside said Zyla broke the bottle of Perrier on Zexus’s head and picked him up like a rag doll and heaved him three stories through the roof and laughed as he landed in the moat below.  The remaining NPC’s ran for their lives out the front entrance that was already swarming with guards and rubberneckers trying to get a glimpse of the action.  Two gnomes were trampled to death, and one halfling sustained major injuries.  He was transported to the maidens fancy where he died of ecstasy before he was treated.<br>
<br>
The demands came forth from inside the temple and boomed in the already overcrowded zone.  Zyla shouted, “Bring me Mayong Mistmoore, you have five minutes before someone is killed from the crowd.”  The crowd outside roared with laughter.  After a few minutes silence fell and nobody had moved.  Suddenly <br>
<br>
BOOOOMMM!     Astarix fell dead in the middle of a cackle.  The crowd was shunned and fell cowerous to the now threating voice of Zyla in the Priests Church.  Thoras Stormhammer said, “Ok this is really getting out of hand, she’s totally flipped out.  Its one thing to take out a newbie who will not miss the xp but Astarix?  She’s really gone off kilter…”<br>
<br>
Maloeni interrupted “Something is seriously wrong with this scene, yeah Zyla hasn’t always been like the rest of the girls, but nobody ever held it against her.  This is not the time to push her buttons”<br>
<br>
BOOOOOOOMMMM!!!!!  A Cliff Golem let out a huge sigh as its body crumbled falling to the earth killing 3 dwarves and 1 high elf that was touching up her makeup.<br>
<br>
“Where is Mayong Mistmoore!” she echoed. “You have 3 minutes before I take on the lot of ya”  <br>
<br>
Sounds of drinking came from within as Zyla put down 20 shots of flaming Neriak blood.   *Belccchh* <br>
<br>
Zexus had no choice but to pull the onlookers back and tell his cousin to go ahead with the assault on the church.  Zexus said, “If she’s going to pick on people all by herself then rip the temple from its roots.  She knows better than to take all the pleasure for herself and not share it with the other clerics.”<br>
<br>
Sweetypie Beggarslayer said, “She has been a little irritable about things lately, I never thought she’d go to this extreme.  I even offered her OS and she said no, she is in a serious state of disarray.”<br>
<br>
Brice Lee who was on medical leave from the hospital after his outbreak in Freeport last week said, “I thought I went bonkers.  Look at this chick, where does she get off just killing people in one shot.  Oh the humanity….”<br>
<br>
“Brice shutup!  She’ll hear you!”  said Pogue Mahone.  It was too late.  <br>
<br>
“Bring me BRICE LEE!”  She shouted. “and take him out of that straight jacket!”<br>
<br>
Pogue proclaimed, “Dude she’s really pissed now…here take this mod rod.”  <br>
<br>
Lee backhanded Pogue and everyone looked away as Brice entered the temple.  A huge rumble began inside and Zyla was screaming with pain suddenly a huge magic spell erupted and everyone standing on the outside was blown over.  Two high elves were killed in the blowover.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Lee emerged in nothing more than his skivvies on the front ramp sucking his thump and holding a mod rod in his hand from Pogue.  Brice’s body was limp from his near death experience.  <br>
<br>
“You have two choices Brice, you can die from the Regents of Innoruuk or modulate yourself to death.  Do you have any final requests?”  Zyla stated.<br>
<br>
Lee trembled as he said, “Give me liberty or give me……….” And with that pain and suffering pummeled his weak body to a bloody pulp with his remains flowing into the moat below.  <br>
<br>
Stormhammer said, “Great now we get to put humpty dumpty back together again….I guess he deserves it for wasting that keg last week”<br>
<br>
The Indigo brotherhood was ashamed that a cleric who couldn’t defend herself against a fire goblin has caused so much trouble.  Zexus himself told all Rogues on reconnaissance to pull out and ordered everyone to buff up for a battle they had never seen.  Pets were summoned, Warriors were drooling at the chance to get a whack on this cleric.  Rangers steadied their bows for an aerial attack.<br>
<br>
Beads of sweat were pouring from the army of 200 people surrounding the temple.  Everyone was sure they were going to win, however a doubt remained they might not make it.<br>
<br>
A deep fog emerged from the moat engulfing everyone in the zone.  Nobody could see the person next to them.  Fandrell said, “Where’s Sweetypie?  And wait a minute, Ayinger was on my lap a minute ago….who is this?”  A bearded halfling cleric looked away in shame that even Fandrell did not want her.<br>
<br>
Screams of delight were coming from inside, then torture.  Sweetypie and Ayinger emerged from the entrance as thick fog was pouring out from it, though they had changed a little.  Sweetypie was now a dark elf, and both women were hunched over like undead.  Sweetypie was now Kiss of Death, and Ayinger’s body was transparent with the title of The Immortal.<br>
<br>
“Look around you, for this is the last time you will see your friends alive!  Innoruuk will be pleased with so many fresh souls, we may have a feast with who’s leftover!”  Zyla shouted.<br>
<br>
Many people began to throw up at the mere thought of becoming the Chilled Monkey brain for Innoruuk himself to eat.  The moat itself turned from a silky red to a putrid red and green swirl.  <br>
<br>
The General shouted for the attack, and the bloodthirsty attackers stormed the temple.  The fight ensued for over an hour before Zyla was taken down.  All the highest-level warriors and guards lay slain.  The lone cliff golem sat to the side crying with a fraction of his life left.  Every gnome and halfling was dismembered not by the fight but from the stampede to get a shot in at Zyla.  Several High elves stood naked stark white their clothes ripped from their bodies like Kleenex.  Swords and shields line the walls surrounding the temple sticking out like toothpicks.  All four walls were shattered and lay out like a huge explosion occurred in the middle.  <br>
<br>
It was just as predicted, Zyla was a mortal and did not last long once her defenses were broken.  Montyy was cheering since he landed a crippling blow for 1458.  <br>
<br>
Suddenly Mayong Mistmoore appeared with a cadecau of flame in the middle of the now blown over church.  General D’Veers blurted, “Nice of you to show up Mayong, too busy porking the Queen?”<br>
<br>
Mayong drew a small grin, and flicked his eyebrow at the lvl 60 SK.  Soon D’Veers was fighting himself to death.  “Anyone else?”  Mistmoore said, “Why was Reyu the only person to reach me?”<br>
<br>
Nobody answered.  “See how her body glows?  Notice the staff she is wielding, did nobody bother to ask what she wanted or offer to help?  She has a staff that even I am too weak to possess.  It is the Staff of Ankexfen.  I suggest letting her body to rest where it lies.  Her corpse will not decay and your typical reviviscence is not going to bring her back.  Let her rest peacefully, and the next time a Dark Elf cries for my help, heed their words.  You are all lucky this continent is not erupting in anarchy as we speak.”<br>
<br>
With his final words, Mistmoore disappeared.  <br>
<br>
Many Lor Mani and old Forsaken Avengers erected a shrine next to her body for those who wanted to visit her.  Murmurs of when she will be back drifted, for now though she is erased from existence.<br>
