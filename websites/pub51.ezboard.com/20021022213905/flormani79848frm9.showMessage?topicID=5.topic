On the last level of her 3rd circle, she was desperately trying to gain experience that would push her over. If it meant the slaying of a few foul orcs, so be it. She was deep inside Crushbone, sitting up against a wall. It was nice here, if one removed the orcs, she thought, smiling. The bricks were cool, the grass a vibrant green color, and nearby a stream flowed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Incoming!!&quot; Kaeaman, a human warrior in her band of brethren, yelled as he burst out of the castle doors. Chasing after him was not one or two of the creatures they were hunting, but four. Four loathsome Crushbone orcs had ganged up on the brave warrior, among them was Emperor Crush himself.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion stood, ready to do battle. Getting a legionnaire in her sights she chanted the words to bring him to a stop. She could feel his thoughts coursing, he was wondering why he could not move, why he could not join his commander in the fight to kill the elves and humans that had encroached upon their land. One by one, Alleusion mesmerized the orcs, until only the Emperor was left. Stepping back from the battle to get a clearer view of things, Alleusion felt a jolt. Her spell had worn off!<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Standing in front of her, his hot, fetid breath in her face, was an orc legionnaire. Most of the orcs dealt in hand to hand combat, forsaking weapons in order to use their meaty fists instead. This one, however, wielded a hatchet. Because Alleusion had not yet entered her 4th circle, she did not have access to the spell that would give her a magical skin. In slow motion, Alleusion could see the orc's hand swing down, she felt the blade slice into her shoulder.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In that instant, time sped up again. Gasping, she grabbed her shoulder, hot blood flowing through her fingers. She had time enough to root the orc into place with a simple, &quot;Be still!&quot;. Glaring at her with hate in his eyes, the orc grunted at her one time before swinging at the warrior who had stepped in. Kaeaman had the strength and the health to take the damage these being dealt. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ignoring her wound, and brushing off the cleric, who although skilled in her class, was only impeding her at this moment, Alleusion once again mesmerized the additional orcs. The battle was fierce and lengthy, spells flew through the air as the orcs fell. They were no match for this brave crew.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Finally with a mighty cry, the warrior swung his massive sword and split the last orc in two. The orc uttered a death cry on his way down that brought chills to Alleusion's spine and stood the hair on the back of her neck on end. She slumped down next to the warrior, out of breath but grinning. Alleusion rested her head on the stones of the wall and closed her eyes. She had entered her 4th circle. &quot;I have reached level 16, Kaeaman. I must leave this place now, these creatures are no match for me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But, Alleusion,&quot; sputtered the cleric,&quot;where will you go?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I will wait for my friend, Ebos to gain his 4th circle, and then we will journey to Kunark.&quot; Alleusion reached into her pack and pulled out the parchment pages she had bought from her guild just that morning. For written on these pages in ink of gold, were new spells that she was finally experienced enough to use. She opened her book and began to scribe, slowly, each one had to be perfect, or she would never be able to use them.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;The land of the Iksar, Alleusion? Are you sure you want to journey there? I have heard there are many dangers to be found. &quot; The small, gnomish wizard looked up at her, reaching only to her knees. He was far from home himself, and the idea of a land so far away gave him shivers.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Placing her hand out towards the wizard, Alleusion spoke low soft words. In an instant, the gnome felt calm, tranquil even. His eyes glazed over for a second, then sharpened. &quot;Wow! What was that?&quot;, he exclaimed.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Giggling, Alleusion replied, &quot;That my little friend was breeze, you will regain your mana quicker with that.&quot; Going to each of the spell casters in her group, Alleusion spoke the same low words to them all. Then she turned to Kaeaman. &quot;For you brave warrior I have something else.&quot; She placed her palm on his mighty chest and closed her eyes. Then she spoke the words she had only just now memorized. Kaeaman felt tingles all through his bones, he felt faster now than ever before.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I must go now,&quot; Alleusion spoke, softly, sadly. She had spent many nights here with these fine fighters and was sad to be leaving them. However, the thought of the journey ahead of her erased all traces of sadness from her mind. Standing up she waved to them one last time, removing herself from their group. The air filled with large bubbles and in an instant, Alleusion was back at her bind point, in the tree city of the wood elves, Kelethin.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Off to the south lay her home. Felwithe. Alleusion had not been back to see her parents since the day she left. Oh she had been back to the city, for one could not stay away from the quiet tranquil place she had been born in, but she had not gone to her home. She knew she had disgraced her family when she walked out, and could not bear the shame in seeing them just yet.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Selling the few items she had collected while in Crushbone, Alleusion set off for the bank. Here she traded in her copper for silver, silver for gold, and gold for platinum. One day she would have enough to buy her next set of spells. Finishing here, she left the small wooden building. Stepping slowly and carefully, so she wouldn't fall, she made her way down to the lifts, down to safety. Behind her, she could hear a spell being cast, not thinking anything of it. Then suddenly she felt a lupine spirit enter her. Whirling around, she saw the grinning face of her adorable halfling friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Ebos!&quot; She cried. &quot;I thought you were in Rivervale tonight.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I finished my business early and have come to join you Alle. What do you have planned for us tonight? I hope it's nothing like the last time when you had me traipsing through Mistmoore in search of Karana knows what,&quot; his tone, although chastising was filled with the affection he felt for his dear friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Smirking, Alleusion placed her hand on Ebos's, and began casting breeze on him. Smiling wider at the way his eyes lit up, she nodded at him. &quot;Yes dear, it's time to journey to Kunark. It's time to kick some goblin tail.&quot;<br>
