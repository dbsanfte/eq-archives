Granting them the benifit of her spells of speed, streangth, and health she sends them to the parents of her dearest friend and companion, Rhapsodey.  Commanding them to rush a message of great import to them.<br>
 <br>
<br>
   &quot;Dear Olendra and Donal,<br>
You know I am true.  I have travelled with your dear daughter for many years, more than I can remeber.  I remeber when I was but a young shaman just learning the ways of the spirits.<br>
  In my brash youth I decided you needed to get to know me and to put aside your wariness of me aside.  To do so I decided to come to your home and make you see who I truely was.  Here I was a BARBARIAN, and a shaman who still did not see the world as a place of danger but just as many wonders to see.  I can barging in and told you to stop being stupid.  If I remeber correctly you where astounded that I would take you on in your own city, and your own home.  <br>
   But, in me doing so I made you stop and think.  Adventually you came to love me as another if younger daughter.  I have loved you as another set of parents.  You have made me feel at home and safe when I felt lost in your world.  You helped me see some of the wonders that non elves never can slow down enough to see.  If it wasn't for you I would have never gotten to where I am now in my powers.<br>
    Now, as your adopted daughter, that young BRASH BARBARIAN, and as someone who loves you as much as Rhapsodey does, I'm going to tell you something you used to tell me over and over.   STOP AND THINK WITH YOUR HEADS NOT YOUR EMOTIONS!!!!!!!!!<br>
   Do you REALLY want assasins to KILL your only daughter?  Do you really wnat to ruin the happiness she has found???   If so then you are not the GOOD and HONOURABLE people you lead me to believe that you are.  If so then everything you taught me is a LIE.<br>
 <br>
    I can tell you true.  Rhapsodey is not the child whom ran off to see the world with me.  She has grown up and is making her own decisions.  You need to let her grown on her own.  She has grown into her own power as well.  In so doing she has seen most of the YOUNG court men to be shallow.  She found some one who loves her for herself and not for the power that being her consort or spouce would bring because she is YOUR DAUGHTER.  If you can not accept this then you have lost her and all of her love.  I cannot believe that you would be willing to do that.  <br>
 <br>
   Olendra,  as a woman you KNOW that she NEEDS to feel love and to have some one to cherish.  Even if she can only cherish him for a little while and him her that love will last forever.  Who is to say that when he must pass from this life that because of his love for her that she will not be STRONGER for it.<br>
 <br>
   I love you truely.  Please let them be.  I have met this Phreezin.  He is brave, stronge, caring, and has the heart of a noble.  As to his liniage,  You know we have no &quot;nobles&quot; in our lands.  But, I can tell you he has passed the MOST rigorous trials we have to chose our cheifs.  If he where not still hunting the great lands beyond our frozen peaks he would be considered one of our greatest cheifs.  He has also helped save many lands from evil forces.<br>
   If this is not enough to make him more &quot;appropriate&quot; then think on this,  I have spoken with the sprits of my land and they have fortold many  things that he will accomplish.  You know my oath to the spirits to not state a lie,  so please consider carefully what you want to do.<br>
 <br>
<br>
       Love, Respect,  and may the Sprits Guide You,<br>
 <br>
        Your Loving Barbarian Shaman<br>

And Daughter Returned Safely</span><hr size=1> A couple of days After her discussion with Kulwein in the Tavern in East Freeport we find Rhapsodey Quietly ghosting through the foothills located in East Karana in Search of the bandits that have killed several young Bard Messengers in the last few days and who have recently captured a young wizard that was travelling from Queynos to Freeport.  <br>
<br>
Shortly she has arrived outside of the Bandit camp.  The whimpers of pain from the Captive tears at her heart as she carefully surveys the camp and the surroundings to be shore that their is to be no surprises awaiting her.  Finally the cry of her ancient weapons desire for vengeance for the crimes committed to the young bards and the cry of Mercy from their <br>
prisoner overcome her wariness.  With a Scream of rage Rhapsodey appears among the bandits her ancient mace Flameweaver delivering fiery death in one hand and the Sword Frostbringer delivering icy death in the other.  Her every attack is aimed to deliver instant death.<br>
<br>
Quickly the battle is over.  She quickly check her surroundings and the bodies to make sure their are no survivors.  Tears coming to her eyes as she softly sings a song of passing <br>
for those that have been killed by the bandits and for the Bandits themselves to ease their passage to the afterlife.<br>
<br>
She turns to the Bandits prisoner and finds him staring wide eyed at her from the tree they had him tied to.  Sheathing her weapons she quickly cuts the prisoner free.  As she gently<br>
lowers him to the ground.  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey.&quot; you are safe.  Stay still now im going to check you injuries.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey quickly checks the young wizards injuries as she sings a song of healing and comfort.  Her attention is so focused on her work that she does not notice the actions of<br>
the young wizzard as he draws a Dagger from his robes.  With Practiced ease he locates a weak Point in her Dark Blue armor and rams the dagger home into her side.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Screams in pain at the sudden pain in her side.  Her years of training quickly take over as she tumbles away from the threat.  Coming quickly to her feet she draws <br>
her Sword Frostbringer as she turns her now useless right arm away from her enemy.<br>
<br>
Young Wizard,&quot;Sorry Rhapsodey the reward for you was just to much to resist.  Nothing Personal I hope you understand.  Your Fathers Agents provided me with the poison that <br>
coats the blade that I used on you.  I would advise against killing me because the poison is lethal over time without the antidote and I don't have the antidote with me so their is<br>
no use killing me and taking it from my body.  Now why don't you be a good girl and put your weapons away before the poison paralyzes you.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Screams with Rage and with every ounce of her strength Throws her Sword at the young Wizard.  Her aim proves true and she strikes her Target through the heart.  Flames of rage still burning in her eyes she walks to the body and pulls her sword from the now Frozen corpse.  As she does Frostbringer turns his every effort to saving his Wielder as he quickly chills her body to slow the spread of the lethal poison.<br>
<br>
Frostbringer having now chilled her nearly to freezing begins to prompt her now cold stricken mind to head to the safety of the Barbarian fishing village and to the Safety Of her Sword Sister Reoki who is their seeing to the injured from a recent Rabid bear Attack.   <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#deddbf><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/bsphereofhonour58352.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=kulwein>Kulwein</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brother of the Sphere</span><br>  Posts: 72<br> <font color=#330000>(12/31/01 6:16 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=18>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Villian Wanted Dead.

Now, all you need to do is rest for a few days and you will be as good as new,” I said.    “You where lucky that bear didn’t get any closer to any vital spots”<br>
      Unbeknown to me my dearest friend was in the greatest need of me in her life.<br>
      As I finished up with Trenton my faithful hounds came barging into the local midwife/healers house where I was working.  Trying to push them back out the door I suddenly know they need me somewhere with all haste.  I rush out the door and into the village I grab all of my medicine bags.  Yelling, “Men I need a few of you to come with me now.”  Trenton’s two brothers, Jakath and Klartoth, join in my mad rush to follow my hounds.<br>
      My hounds lead me out into the Plains of Western Karana.  Finally, in the distance I see a form laying prone on the ground.  As I approach I notice that is holding a sword and that it is slowly moving in my direction as if being dragged.  The closer I get the more worried I get, for the form is in Blue armor.  When I get to the body it stops moving.  <br>
      I stop by the body and start crying.<br>
      The body at my feet is Rhapsodey, my sword sister.   She is frozen solid.  I bend over and pick up her frostweaver.  She has told me it was alive and I have seen stranger things.<br>
      Quietly, in the deepest part of my soul I hear a voice that I have never heard before.  “Thank you for coming.  My bondmate needs your help.  I know I can trust you.  I have frozen her because she has been poisoned.  She would not have made it to you if she were not frozen.  But hurry time is against her,” it whispers.<br>
       Standing up straight so fast I startle the two men. “All right, Donal if this is how you wish it I will have no sympathy for you.   You and your SHALL suffer,” I scream.<br>
      Digging through my medicine bags I start to get everything I need to deal with poisons.  “Jakath, I need you to start a fire.  Klartoth, go get some water from the stream and get it boiling over the fire,” I tell them.<br>
     I wrap Rhapsodey in all the blankets and spare cloth in my packs.  I then start to pray, “Oh Great Spirits hear my plead.  I plead with you to take the poison out of my swordsister’s blood and purify her.  Save her life and do not let it leave this body yet.  She has done no wrong here, her father who does not want to see the truth has injured her in more ways than just this poison that he has let evil persons put in her blood.”<br>
     As I pray my hands start to glow.  Steam begins to form off of Rhapsodey's body as she warms.   Soon, thick black ooze starts to appear out of her mouth.  This I wipe away.  All of a sudden she starts to cough.  <br>
     “She is breathing.  Thank You Great Spirit,” I pray.<br>
      I have the men start to make a camp for us.  While they do that I check Rhapsodey over to make sure there are no other wounds to be dealt with.  Thankfully there are no other wounds, but I am still worried.  She should be waking up now.  I then pick up the sword again.<br>
       “What is still wrong?” I ask.  <br>
       “Her soul was hurt more deeply than even I feared by her father’s treachery.  She will not awake till she is called by her true love.” It replied.  “And, because her heart is still tied to music she must be called by song.”<br>
         With this advice in mind I call one of my hounds.  Scribbling a message to Phreezin, I then stuff it into her collar.<br>
         “Go.  Go find Phreezin.  Hurry my dear.”  I tell her.<br>
          She starts to run away into the plains.  She starts to go faster and faster.  Soon she is going faster than any mortal mutt can go.  I know she will find Phreezin in time.<br>
           Time passes, and Rhapsodey does not stir.  Finally Phreezin appears.<br>
           I tell him what has happened as quickly as I can.  I also tell him what he must do.<br>
           “Me, I am to sing her back?  Why can’t you do something?  I do not know how to sing.”  He says with tear filled eyes.<br>
            “It has been given to you to do.  Sing her what comes from your heart.  Do not care for the words or tune, just that what you sing to her be true.”<br>

<br>
Tears of joy stream down the faces of all gathered. But the tears that hold the most joy are those of Phreezin, and to a lesser extent, those of Reoki.<br>

Phreezin holds Rhapsodey close to him and fiercly whispers over and over again &quot;I love you&quot;.<br>
