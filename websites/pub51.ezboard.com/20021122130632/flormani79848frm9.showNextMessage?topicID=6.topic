<br>
     Alleusion sat on the grassy hill near the entrance to her home in Felwithe. She looked all around her, at the weak sun filtering through the trees, at the huge bats flying close by. She could hear the drone of the giant wasps, the ones she knew to avoid. The day was perfect, weather wise, but she was not happy. For this day Alleusion had spoken to her parents, and secretly, to the Priest of Discord.<br>
     It was the priest that guided the young into their chosen fields. For high elves, they had many choices. They could be clerics, the healers of Norrath, or paladins, a hybrid of healer and fighter, or they could forsake hand to hand combat and become a pure caster. The casters could be either a magaician, one who had control of the elements and could summon powerful creatures to assist them, a wizard, one who could call upon massive amounts of fire, ice, and lighting, or they could become enchanters. Enchanters were the mind masters, the ones who could become any race, any object, and the ones who could make even the most powerful monster a weak and willing pet. It was an enchanter that Alleusion wanted to be.<br>
     Her parents, however, had other plans. They were merchants. Jewel crafters from far and wide came to them for the necessary parts to their craft. Her father had put his foot down, in a heated battle the night before. Alleusion was forbidden from going to Northern Felwithe to speak to the guildmaster, she was never to leave Felwithe.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?Alleusion', came a voice in her head. ?Alleusion, I have wonderful news.' The voice came from her friend Ebos, the halfling. Ebos lived far away in a town called Rivervale. A pretty town, Alleusion thought, she had been there once with her parents when they were making a delivery. It was there that she met her short, hairy friend. They had been sending each other mental messages since they were small children. ?I've been accepted into the druid guild,' Ebos told her. ?I began my training this morning. I have spells and everything.' Ebos could not keep the excitement from his voice.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?Great, Ebos, I'm happy for you.' Alleusion thought back to him, she was not able to keep the sadness from her voice. Alleusion knew she would never see Ebos again, unless he came to her, and it was too much to hope that THAT would ever happen.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sensing her disquiet, Ebos asked her what was wrong. Alleusion sighed deeply, ?I am fine, friend. I am to be a merchant, like my parents.' As she finished her thought, her voice trailed off in Ebos' mind, he knew she was greatly upset.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?But, Alleusion, what about...what about your dreams, your plans, what we talked about, what about all that?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion took a long time before answering, she was watching the new casters fighting bravely out on the hill, wishing she were one of them. She absentmindedly plucked a blade of grass from the damp earth and held it in her hand. ?I have been forbidden to follow my dreams,' she finally answered, bitterly.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?Have you spoken to the priest?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?I have, and he gave me a letter. Ebos I'm afraid to hand in the letter, what will my father say?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ebos spoke, slowly, carefully, as one might speak to a frightened child, ?Alleusion, you have come of age now. You are able to chose your own path, your own destiny. I have an idea.' He began to tell her his idea, as she sat, with her back against the city walls, listening with rapt attention. Alleusion was paying so much attention to Ebos that she didn't see the orc coming up stealthily beside her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Your foul deeds have earned my contempt. High elves like you are better left dead that alive,&quot; screamed the foul smelling orc, and he tried to hit her, but missed. Alleusion jumped up, grabbed the dagger she kept with her for protection, and after some time, managed to triumph. She stood over the corpse of the orc, his brackish blood staining the grass of her homeland. It was in that moment that she knew she could not live the live her parents had mapped out for her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Wiping the foul blood off her dagger, she sat back down, in a different spot this time, and calmly asked Ebos what she had to do.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Later that night, Alleusion left the house, queitly, under the cover of darkness. As she walked out the door, she turned, her hand on the worn wooden frame. All her memories were in this house, everything she had ever been, was here. She was leaving with nothing but the letter the priest had given her and a dagger. Alleusion left a note for her mother, telling her not to worry, she was following her heart. A single, hot tear fell down her cheek as she walked out the door for the last time, resolve strengthing her spine and helping her do what she knew was right.<br>
<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After meeting with the guildmaster and getting her training robe and a few spells, Alleusion set off for the dangerous journey that awaited her. Her soft, slippered feet making no noise as they passed quickly over the cold cobblestones of her city. ?Ebos,' she sent through her mind. ?Ebos are you there?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?Did you do it Alle? Are you ready?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?Yes,' she answered breathlessly, for she was extremely excited. ?Now what do I do?'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp ?I'm waiting for you in West Freeport, Alle, you need to get here. I've been speaking to a wizard, an Erudite, Alle, he's going to take you here. Listen, you need to follow the path to the wizard spires, and when you get there hail a dark man. His name is Dacatur, he will take you to me.' Ebos knew how hard this was for her to be leaving her home, but was excited to be seeing his friend once again.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So Alleusion set off, the chill October air making her breath appear before her. She didn't give the guards much thought as she stepped away from safety and into the unknown. Spying the path down the hill, she made her way to it. First one foot, then the other, crunching through the gravely path. Along the way, she saw other travelers, caster in brilliant robes, with magical weapons at their side, great fighters in shiny armor, clanking as the ran. She could hear shouts from fighters at nearby Crushbone. People were calling out all kinds of things, asking for heals, asking for buffs, and asking for something called spirit of the wolf. Alleusion's heart raced as she left the walls of Felwithe behind. She could see the giant bats and wasps up ahead and began to run. With her head down she ran until she could sense the power of the wizard spires close by.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Standing in the center of the spires was the dark man Ebos had told her about. &quot;Hail, Dacatur&quot;, she said.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Hail, Alleusion. I am to take you to the common lands, a little man is waiting for you I hear,&quot; he said with a chuckle in his voice. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked at him with wonder in her eyes, &quot;Yes, I am ready&quot;, she spoke out loud, while inside, she thought to Ebos, ?Here I come, I'll see you in a bit.'<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dacatur muttered some words and a crack split the air, as Alleusion felt herself being catapulted through space. Her feet landed in soft sand, as a hot desert sun beat down on her light brown hair. Dacatur appeared at her side as instructed her to follow him. They set off across the desert towards an inn and a sandy but somewhat grassy area. &quot;This is the Northern Desert of Ro,&quot; Dacatur told her, &quot;there are powerful creatures here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After a few moments, they left the grass behind and entered more sand. This sand was hard packed and looked well traveled, unlike the soft dunes of the desert they had just left. &quot;Welcome to East Freeport, Alleusion. You need to bind here.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Bind?&quot; She asked in confusion, still in awe at the brick walls ahead of her, filled with merchants, noisly calling out their wares, so unlike the quiet, calm streets of her homeland.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Dacatur sat down and consulted his spellbook. Standing, he wove his hand while speaking words in a language Alleusion had just begun to learn. A soft blue light filled the air all around her, she felt her soul adhere to this very spot. &quot;This, little lady, is where your soul will go should you be slain. Your body will be left behind and you will have to go and claim your possessions. Now, I have business elsewhere, you do know how to get to West Freeport don't you?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion did not want this powerful wizard to think she was a fool, so she said yes. Once more the wizard said some words and after a loud crack, he vanished. Alone, Alleusion set off, checking which direction she was heading with every step. Signs pointed her to West Freeport, and after asking a few travelers which way to the gate, she found her way. Standing there, nervously looking around him, was a small man. A man Alleusion had never seen before, for the last time she had seen Ebos he was still a child. Alleusion picked up her pace and began to run to her childhood friend.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Wow, now that is one fine looking elf, &quot;said a man standing next to Ebos. It was his friend, a man he had met on his journeys here, named Rithum. Rithum was a half elf, a mixture of elf and human, who had elected to study the teachings of the bards.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ebos turned to see who Rithum was talking about and his eyes lit up with joy as he saw the girl who had grown up into a woman. Excitement lit her face as she took in everything around her, full of questions about things she had never seen. She joined their group and they set off, with Rithum in the lead, taking them to a place called &quot;the ruins&quot;.<br>
<br>
And so they began their journey, into the world, with the paths they had chosen. What would the future bring for them...time would only tell. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title><A HREF="http://www.ezboard.com/promotions/csc.html" TARGET="_blank" ><IMG SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/image/cscicon.gif" WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="20" BORDER="0" align="absmiddle"></A> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uzhale.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Zhale</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Little Stinker</span><br>  Posts: 131<br> <font color=#333333>(1/25/02 12:00:29 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=4.topic&index=1>Reply</a>    <br>ezSupporter<br> <BR><img src=http://home.tampabay.rr.com/soleil/SKUNK1.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Alleusion's beginning</span><hr size=1> Very nice, Alle!<br>
