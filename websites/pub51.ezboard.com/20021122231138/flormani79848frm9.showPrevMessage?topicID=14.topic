It laughed at her attempts to ward off the chill. Alleusion stood, in defiance fo the wind, letting her hood fall back, exposing her pale skin to the harsh environment. She moved slowly forward, her boots sinking into the soft snow. Behind her, Alleusion sensed the prensence of her traveling companion, Cablatinu.<br>
<br>
Standing in snow up to her knees, the young gnome glared at Alleusion. The ground shook with the force of the steps from a nearby shardwurm, turning the small wizard's glare into one of alarm. With a slight turn of her wrist, the enchanter vanished. Amusement lit her eyes as she watched her young friend fumble through her spellbook. Standing, shivering violently, Cablatinu tried to channel her thoughts into her invisibility spell, failing once, then twice.<br>
<br>
Growing increasingly nervous at the nearing steps of the wurm, Cablatinu turned her frustrations on to her friend. &quot;Json thon wikb, nuy json you Alleusion ior dhaggyer mk meee.&quot;<br>
<br>
Shedding her veil of invisibility, Alleusion turned to her companion, &quot;He ic sqqug mf friin. I am sorry my friend. Seshaps nhor hilq help. Perhaps this will help.&quot; Speaking in both the native tongue of the gnomes and the crude common tongue, Alleusion began the long cast of the calming spell her Koa'dal ancestors had passed down from long ago - Koadic's Endless Intellect.<br>
<br>
Vanishing once again, patiently waiting for the wizard to do the same, Alleusion turned to the wind. Even though the high elf did not posess the skill of the tracker, she knew she was headed in the right direction.<br>
<br>
Head bent, using her withered staff for support, the enchanter pushed through the wall of wind. It was almost as if the winf knew her destination and would do whatever it took to keep her away. With her destination in sight along with the stout Coldain dwarves, Alleusion let her thoughts wander.<br>
<br>
Absentmindedly, the tall, pale high elf took a piece of parchment from a dwarf that had come rushing up to her. Ignoring it and reaching into her robes, her fingers fluttered over a well worn piece of paper, the words burned into her mind.<br>
<br>
     Sister, I've left for Thurgadin. My quest for my prayer shawlis nearing completion. You have always watched over me, possibly too closely. I need to do this on my own. Do not follow me.<br>
                                   Caony<br>
<br>
Hot, unshed tears burned behind her eyes. Her heart begged for their release, but her pride would not allow them to fall. It felt like yesterday that the squalling baby had been thrust into her hands. Images raced in her mind...the toddler taking her first steps...the joy in her eyes when she learned the gift of healing...the frustration...the anger, and finally the sadness that drove Caony away.<br>
<br>
Cablatinu glanced at Alleusion as she watched her friend open the letter the dwarf had given her. Then she openly stared in shock as she watched the calm face of the enchanter she had come to love turn into one twisted with a mixture of pain and rage. Clutched in her hand, knuckles white with force, was the crumpled letter...forgotten. A single whisper, followed by a single tear, followed by a shout of fury that caused even the far away giants to pause, ripped through the wind and across the hills.<br>
<br>
&quot;CAONY!!&quot;<br>
<br>
Letting the parchment fal to the snow, Alleusion turned and stalked into the Coldain city. Still in shock, the small gnome stared as her friend vanished into the velium waterfall. Bending, with shaking fingers, she reached for the paper. Fear widening her eyes, she read the clumsy script of the Kromriff Giants.<br>
<br>

Ducking her head, narrowly missing the spokes of the gate she was passing under, the elf saw who she was looking for. Lying on the ground, appearing to all to be either sleeping or dead, was Stidellos.<br>
<br>
In a low voice, Alleusion growled, &quot;Get up,&quot; and waited impatiently for the monk to stand. With lightning speed and strength highly uncommon for an enchanter, she grabbed the iksar by the throat and slammed him against the wall. &quot;Where is she Stid?&quot;<br>
<br>
Dazed and astonished at the violent action of his peaceful friend, it took a moment for him to answer her. &quot;Alle, I....I don't know what happened.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Wrong answer iksar. When I heard about her plan for her shawl quest, I sent for you. Because I knew you above all people would keep her safe. Now I get word from the Kromriff that she's been captured.&quot; Her fury began to be replaced by fear at the terror she knew Caony must have felt, must still be feeling. She relaxed her grip on the iksar as he slumped against the wall.<br>
<br>
Stidellos looked up into the red eyes of the one person who he knew could calm Alleusion down. The newcomer whispered something to the monk that sent him off in a hurry. Alleusion stood, head bent, looking defeated. She knew without words who now stood at her side. It had been many months since she had last seen him, but the fire between them was still there.<br>
<br>
Sensing the curious glances of the guards and passersby, Vindinian lightly touched her elbow and guided her away from the main square. They walked down the passageways carved out of the ice by time and dwarven hands. Alleusion walked blindly, letting the necromancer guide her, pain clouding her vision. She didn't see the well worn ice path, or the tavern she was led into. She didn't notice the table in the corner or the stout Coldain bartender bringing over mugs of dark dwarven ale.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alleusion,&quot; the warm tones of the Teir'dal across from her made her lift her head. &quot;Your anger will not help Caony. Nor will your tears. She may have been taken mere hours ago, but she has been lost to you for a long time, hasn't she?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;She knew Vin,&quot; Alleusion whispered, her voice thick with the tears she could not shed. &quot;She read the letters and asked me if they were true. What could I tell her? That I've deprived her of a mother and father all these years?&quot;<br>
<br>
Cablatinu entered the tavern and spotted the couple off in the corner. Out of breath, the gnome sat down and began to tell them what she had learned. Through her alliance with both the giants and the Coldain, she was able to travel to both cities without harm.<br>
<br>
She told how after Alleusion left, she braved the snow and headed for the fort high in the mountains. For once, her small size came to her advantage as she slipped past the guards. Under her cloak of invisibility, she was able to hear the frost giant sentries speak of their latest capture.<br>
<br>
Time came to a stand still as Alleusion heard the tale unfolding in front of her. Caony had been in the Eastern Wastes gathering eggs when the Kromriff Death Squad had come across her camp. There was little fight as the cleric was no match for the eight giants. They carried her to Kael Drakkel where she was being held by the Avatar of War as a prize in the arena.<br>
<br>
Fear for the high elf gave Alleusion a burst of energy as she botled upright. The crash of her chair against the floor caused the tavern's other patrons to stop and stare. The ale and her anger gave Alleusion's features a flushed look, her eyes darting back and forth like a caged animal.<br>
<br>
The tavern door opened and a familiar face locked eyes with the restless enchanter. The dwarf, clad in the purple and blue armor that told of her profession, walked slowly to the trio. Her news was not happy, and she was deeply saddened that this duty fell on her shoulders.<br>
<br>
&quot;Vindinian,&quot; Syllie said in greeting, embracing her dark elven friend. Although she had not seen him in many years, she knew their reunion would have to wait. Walking to the other side of the table, Syllie reached for the distraught Koa'dal's hands. Grasping them, Syllie pulled Alleusion down to a kneeling position so that they were eye to eye.<br>
<br>
&quot;Alleusion,&quot; Syllie began, keeping the eye contact. &quot;They've found her.&quot; From inside one of her packs, Syllie pulled out a worn, cloth shawl. Alleusion's eyes widened as she recognized the Coldain prayer shawl as Caony's. Tugging on the slim hands of the elf to get her attention again, Sylle said, &quot;Naldass found this outside the arena in Kael Drakkel, where he tracked her to. He lost the trail there, so Adus went in to scout. Alleusion, you <!--EZCODE ITALIC START--><i> must</i><!--EZCODE ITALIC END--> listen to me now. He is bringing her body back so I can perform the forbidden rites.&quot;<br>
<br>
Color drained from the already pale elf's face. She let go of the preistess's hands as she stood, grasping the table for support. From far away, she could hear Vindinian talking to her. &quot;Alleusion, they're bringing her body home. We will have our daughter back.&quot; Those were the last words she heard before the blackness mercifully claimed her and for a brief moment, she felt no more pain. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#dcdeed><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/ualleusion.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Alleusion</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://www.ezboard.com/ezgfx/gicons/black_fire.gif" BORDER=0></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Crack Dealer</span><br>  Posts: 383<br> <font color=#333333>(6/21/02 10:56:27 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=2>Reply</a>   <BR><img src=http://a0.cpimg.com/image/E8/51/8367080-0c53-005F0080-.jpg WIDTH=60 HEIGHT=60></td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Lost part 3</span><hr size=1> Alleusion opened her eyes, letting her surroundings come in to focus. Thick trees overhead blocked out the sun, grass replaced the icy ground of the town she just left. Rising out of the ground, were four massive marble spires. Standing in the center of them was an elf dressed in white. Alleusion heard a voice whisper that the portal to the newly discovered lands of Luclin was about to open, and she moved numbly away from the spires.'<br>
<br>
Appearing beside her, one by one, were her friends. Cablatinu smiled at Alleusion. &quot;Welcome home.&quot;'<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand,&quot; Alleusion shook her head in confusion. &quot;I'm not welcome here anymore. Not since...well not since the killing of Tunare's creatures. And Vin, he has never been welcome here.&quot;<br>
<br>
Alleusion's mind wandered back to the day she was brought before the court of Tunare. The elders passed down the sentence that she already knew was coming. For her actions against Tunare she was to be banned from Kelethin and Felwithe for all eternity. The punishment was death should she ever return. It was after a long silence that they gave her the punishment that ripped her heart from her. &quot;You have forged a bond while severing another.&quot; She could hear the lead elder just like it was yesterday. &quot;You were able to hide your marriage to the Teir'dal for a long time Alleusion. Per yavi bemperhk yo dokluxp etthfnter. For that you will leave here now. You will walk through these gates with nothing but the clothes on your back and your weapons.&quot; The ancient elf saw his words finally sinking in to the proud, but young and foolish enchanter standing before him. &quot;Yes, squng uny. The child will stay here. 'She has already begun her studies and we will not let you or the evil one that sired her corrupt her pure mind. She is now a child of Tunare. Her parents are here and now dead to her.&quot;<br>
<br>
A gentle nudge brought the elf back to her senses. &quot;They are allowing you in today because of Caony. Yes, Alle, they are opening the gates to a dark elf today as well. We must hurry now, her time is drawing to a close.&quot; Syllie set off to the west, stopped and shook her head, mumbling under her breath, &quot;Felwithe is to the east.&quot; Walking down the correct path this time, the four hurried to attend to Caony.'<br>
<br>
Nervously, Alleusion walked through the marble gates of the high elf city. She could feel the threatening glances of the guards they passed, hands on the weapons at their sides, just waiting for the excuse to use them. The group stopped at the door to the cleric's training hall. &quot;Syllie,&quot; worry and fear were evident in her words,&quot; I can't go in there.&quot;<br>
<br>
The dwarf spun around, the sun glinting off of the horns on her helm. Impatiently, she glared at the enchanter, &quot;You can and you will, now march!&quot;'<br>
<br>
A magical hand opened the heavy stone door. Vindinian, who spent most of his life hidden in the shadows, had to hide his eyes against the glaring white light coming from inside. The entrance hall was lined with guards. All of them servants of Tunare, and all of them scowling at the pair of elves. It was obvious they were not welcome, but would be tolerated for the sake of the ceremony about to be performed.'<br>
<br>
Waiting at a door at the back of the hallway, was the very same elder that had banished Alleusion years earlier. He looked over the elf with a bit of censure, but without the hatred of the other occupants. He noticed the years had been graceful to the proud enchanter. Her brash cockiness had been replaced by a quiet self-assurance that only came with time and training.'<br>
<br>
As the door opened, he stepped aside, letting the group pass. A cry ripped from Alleusion as she started to rush forward. Stepping out from the shadows, startling the enchanter was the formidable form of Adus, the rogue who had recovered Caony's body. Speaking softly, Adus told the others, &quot;Her spirit is slipping away. The hold on this like is not strong. Move her and she is lost to us forever.&quot;<br>
<br>
Syllie pulled a golden mace from her pack, the end glowing with a soft blue light. She walked around the body, praying to Brell Serilis. Passing the mace over the still form of Caony, Syllie pleaded with her god to renew life into the high elf. Alleusion and Vindinian watched and waited while the High Priestess performed the forbidden rites. Her prayers done, Syllie stepped back. All that was left now was to wait. It was up to Caony now to return to this world.'<br>
<br>
Alleusion held her breath as a soft, glowing light filled the room. A low moan came from the still form on the altar. The color slowly returned to the young cleric's face as Syllie chanted healing prayers over Caony. <br>
<br>
Caony began to sit up, her arms shaking from the effects of the ressurection. She placed a slender, pale hand against the side of her head, a sharp contrast to her flaming red hair. Slowly she looked up to see Syllie, her mentor and tutor in the ways of the healer. A slow, shaky smile worked it's way across Caony's face, evidently relieved to be sitting in familiar surroundings, rather then tied up in Kael.'<br>
<br>
Turning slowly at the sound of her name behind her, Caony took in the other occupants of the room: Baerlan - the elder of the High Elves, Syllie - High Priestess, mentor, friend, Adus - an assassin formidable to look at but with a heart of gold, Cablatinu mistress of fire and ice. She stopped when she came to the last two. One was an elf she did not recognize, but somehow, instinctively, she knew him. His expression unreadable, red eyes burning inside a face that betrayed his profession. She knew without a doubt that this was the father she had read about in the letters.'<br>
<br>
His gaze held hers for long seconds. It was as if he was trying to memorize the delicate features of the child that, by rights was half his, but because of fate he had never seen. Confused and unsure of herself, Caony broke the piercing gaze of the dark elf. She didn't want to look at the woman next to him, but she could not resist the pull of Alleusion's silent plea.'<br>
<br>
Eyes filled with tears and a raw, naked pain looked into Caony's. Reminded of the betrayal of the enchanter who for the past two years had claimed to be no more then a sister, Caony could feel the hurt returning. Forcing herself to harder her gaze as her sould was breaking down, Caony fixed Alleusion with a cold stare. No words needed to be said, her expression was clear to all. It said quite plainly, &quot;I do not know you, nor do I wish to know someone so deceitful.Holding the stare for one second longer, Caony then looked away and whispered, &quot;I wish to be alone.&quot;<br>

Her legs tucked up underneath her, on hand absentmindedly playing in the cool, clear water. This mystical spot was perfect for one who needed to be alone with her thoughts. Off to her left, robed elves were teleported to one of three magical guilds surrounding the lake. Why she had picked here of all places to sort out her thoughts, she did not know. Perhaps, deep inside, she wanted to be closer to the mother she had never known.<br>
<br>
     She thought back to her first memory of Alleusion. She had been in the desert for most of the day, and was taking a short rest on the docks of an oasis. There had been many others wandering by that day, most were just resting before moving on, others were waiting for a boat, Alleusion was doing neither. She was waiting for a giant.<br>
<br>
     Caony had been struggling with her meditations when she felt a soft breeze float past her. She blinked her eyes and looked up. It was as if all her surroundings had disappeared and she was able to focus all her thoughts into the spells she was trying to learn. Caony heard a soft thud in front of her and shook her head to bring herself back to the present. The face she suddenly found herself looking into could very well have been her own. The features were almost identical, except the elf in front of her was a bit older.<br>
<br>
     She introduced herself as Alleusion, a Beguiler in her 55th level of learning. Alleusion told of the quest she had been given, and the spoon she was supposed to get from the giant named Cazel. &quot;.....and since I don't think he's going to kindly hand it over to me, I'm going to have to obtained it by other means. Namely, I'm going to have to kill him,&quot; Alleusion said with a wry grin. All this had been said without Caony introducing herself. It was as if Alleusion knew who she was.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Of course I know who you are.&quot; Caony was startled, she didn't think she had said that out loud. &quot;You are the child I've searched for. There is no mistaking that you look like me.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Confusing thoughts and emotions raced through Caony's mind. Haltingly, she asked, &quot;Am I...your child?&quot; Caony watched as she saw what looked like pain enter the elf's eyes.<br>
<br>
     Shaking her head sadly, she whispered, &quot;No, not my child, Tunare's child. You and I are sisters, nay more then sisters. &quot; Reaching out, Alleusion grasped the pale hands before her, &quot;Other then my husband, you are the only family I have left.&quot;. . . . .<br>
<br>
     So deep in her thoughts, Caony did not hear the elder elf walking up behind her. After sensing his presence, she did not glance up. Slowly rising to her feet, she looked into the piercing gaze of the ancient leader. With a slight tilt of his head, they began to walk.<br>
<br>
     In silence, the pair walked along the water's edge through Felwithe. Leaning heavily on his staff, the old wizard motioned toward a path cut into the side of the hill. Smiling, he reached his hand out to the young cleric, offering her assistance. Odd, Caony though, he looks as though a good strong wind will blow him over, and yet he's offering me his strength to climb the hill.<br>
<br>
     When they reached the top, Caony paused to catch her breath. Layed out before her was the city of Felwithe. Nestled deep into the mountains the peaceful city had been her home for as long as she could remember. &quot;Why...&quot; she began, but a look from Baerlan made her stop short.<br>
<br>
     &quot;Many years ago, a young and foolish elf stood before me,&quot; looking out across the city rooftops, Baerlan began his tale. &quot;She had committed serious crimes against Tunare. Although she was not alone in her actions, however, she was the only one who had once allied herself with the goddess. She stood before the elven council and all her transgressions were laid out for everyone to see. This elf had turned against her people in the Plane of Growth, but that was not all. In secret, she had married. A Tier`Dal, a defiler, a creature of the night. With their union, they produced a child. You were that child.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Caony started to speak, but a sharp look from the wizard made her close her mouth. &quot;For her actions in Tunare's realm, she was banished from Felwithe forever. For turning her back on her own people and forging a bond with the dark one, we took away her child. You had already begun to show tremendous power in the healing arts, and we did not want the Teir`Dal to corrupt you and further.&quot; Baerlan turned to face the astonished cleric, sadness and regret were heavy in his final words, &quot;So you see, Caony, it was I, not Alleusion that kept you apart. She did not abandon you. I had not been able to forsee that she would seek you out. We could not protect you forever. If we had known this would never have happened. When Alleusion told you that you were not her child, she told the truth. The day we cast her out, we declared you to be Tunare's child.&quot;<br>
<br>
     The silence after Baerlan had finished speaking was heavy. He reached a shaky hand deep into the pockets of his robe. Slowly and with much regret, he pulled out a roll of parchment. A faded ribbon held the roll together. His watery grey gaze met the confused stare of the cleric. Recognition lit her eyes and Baerlan could see that Caony knew what it was that he held in his hand.<br>
<br>
     &quot;My letters,&quot; she said somewhat startled to see them in his hands, &quot;where did you find them?&quot;<br>
<br>
     &quot;Well now, Caony, they aren't exactly your letters are they?&quot; He asked softly as he watched the bright blush stain the pretty elf's cheeks. &quot;When Syllie was overseeing your training, she was writing to Alleusion. That is how she knew where to find you. While we could take away her rights to raise you, her determination and spirit sought you out. She did what she could to be near you, without breaking the bonds placed on her by myself and the other elders.&quot; His voice dropped to a whisper as he placed the letters in Caony's hands. &quot;So you see child, she did not abandon you, she did everything in her power to be with you.&quot;<br>
<br>
     With those words the ancient wizard vanished. Caony sat down, high atop the ivy covered city of her birth, alone with her thoughts. Her mother had not left her after all. When Caony had found the letters two years earlier, she had been deeply hurt. Stidellos had sent a request for help with the giants and she accepted, knowing that the mission would be dangerous. While she had been gathering her things, Alleusion walked in to the home they had been sharing in Freeport.<br>
  <br>
     She confronted Alleusion with the letters and as she watched the unmistakable look of guilt cross teh enchanter's faces, Caony flew into a rage. She threw her things into her bags as she hurled accusations at her sister, nay, her mother. Looking back one last time, she tossed a letter of her own onto the bed, and with Alleusion begging her to stay so she could explain, Caony opened a portal and left.<br>
<br>
*****<br>
<br>
     Baerlan turned from the ancient scrolls he was copying as he heard the heavy marble door slide open. Standing in the doorway was the elf he had left on the hilltop three hours earlier. There was a new resolve in her eyes and she looked to have aged a bit in the few hours she was alone.<br>
<br>
     &quot;I want to find her,&quot; Caony said shakily. She took a deep breath and looked down at her hands. Hesitating a moment, she fixed her gaze on Baerlan. &quot;What she did was wrong. The crimes against Tunare I mean. And as for her love for one of Innoruk's own? Well, even I know that we can not help who our hearts chose for us.&quot; Silence fell as Caony finished her outburst. She lowered her head from the piercing gaze the old wizard had fixed her with. He slowly closed his book, braced both hands on either side of the heavy tome and stood.<br>
<br>
     &quot;For you, child, that would be most impossible. Alleusion was last seen entering the realm of Cazic-Thule himself. The Plane of Fear is very unforgiving. Only the most advanced have been known to leave the plane alive.&quot; The door opened behind Caony, and in walked a young apprentice, barely into his first level of learning. He handed Baerlan a letter then left as silently as he had entered.<br>
<br>
     A knowing look entered the eyes of the elder. &quot;Ah Caony, it is time. There is someone that would like to meet you.&quot;<br>
<br>
     Confused and a little worried, Caony took the letter and began to read.....<br>
<br>
---Caony Coventine, you have been summoned to server the Court of Tunare. Your training will begin within the week.---<br>
<br>
     &quot;Baerlan? I don't understand.&quot;<br>
<br>
     &quot;My dear child. You have been summoned by your god. Take this time that she has given you. There is much healing and learning to be done before you will truely be at peace with the events of your past.&quot; <p></p><i></i></td></tr></table> </td></tr></table> <table border=0 width=95%><tr><td align=left valign="top"> </td><td align=right valign="top"><a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showPrevMessage?topicID=16.topic"> << Prev Topic</a>&nbsp;| <a href="http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showNextMessage?topicID=16.topic"> Next Topic >> </a><br><br><a self href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=16.topic&index=5><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/addReply.gif border=0 alt="Add Reply"></a> </td></tr></table><br><table width=95% border=0><td valign="top"> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.emailToFriend?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/image/email.gif border=0 alt="Email This To a Friend"> Email This To a Friend</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.threadControl?topicID=16.topic><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/themes/softsky/deleteThread.gif border=0 alt="Topic Control Image"> Topic Commands</a><br> <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.subscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Subscribe</a> Click to receive email notification of replies<br>  <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.unsubscribeUnregisteredToTopic?topicID=16.topic>Unsubscribe</a> Click to stop receiving email notification of replies<br> </td><td align="right" valign="top"></td></tr><tr align="right"><td colspan=2><form action=http://pub51.ezboard.com/BBSForum.jumpShowForum method=post><table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1"><tr><td><b>jump to:</b><select name=forumName><option value="lormani79848frm22">Recruiting OPEN<option value="lormani79848frm1">General Information<option value="lormani79848frm3">Public Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm9">Stories & The Like<option value="lormani79848frm12">Trade Skills<option value="lormani79848frm11">Private Events/Raids<option value="lormani79848frm2">LM Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm8">Epic Quest (LM Members)<option value="lormani79848frm13">Resources<option value="lormani79848frm14">Members List<option value="lormani79848frm19">Sig Test and Title Requests<option value="lormani79848frm15">General DAoC<option value="lormani79848frm16">DAoC Members Only<option value="lormani79848frm18">Guild Bank<option value="lormani79848frm17">Officers<option value="lormani79848frm23">Potential Members<option value="lormani79848frm25">Kegnar's Corner</select></td><td><input type=submit value="Go" class=inputbutton></td></tr></table></form></td></tr></table><br><font color=#333333>- </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/blormani79848>Lor Mani</a><font color=#333333> - </font><a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9>Stories & The Like</a> <font color=#333333> - </font><a href="http://www.calendars.net/cals/eqlormani">Lor Mani Web Page</a><font color=#333333> - </font><br><br> <!-- Start of TheCounter.com Code -->
