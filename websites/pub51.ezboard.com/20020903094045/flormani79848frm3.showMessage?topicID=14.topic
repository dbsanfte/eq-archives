Many guildies showed up as well as friends to help take down the golems.  The three were up, and luckily the broken popped while I was LD later.  Toof came back from LD with about a minute to spare to loot his 8).<br><br>Special thanks to the following peeps for FRIDAY:<br><br>Dordaek,Alndera AoA,Rymira Vis Major,Montyy Rel in Por,our friends in Dosg,Uggmugg,Syllie,Alleusion,Toofas,Fandrell/Keif,Padade,Taludana,Taim,Guikui,Cirebela,Naladar,Taim,Smokiex,Nagram,Impudent,Erzinen,Cizzle,Sodina,Vestiz,Nena,Gweenaveere,Dalizar,Zhale,Pistonn/Quasqueton,Phobose,<br><br>Special thanks for Saturday:  EXTRA special thanks to the 5 people who actually showed up on time: Alleusion(early),Impudent,Fuzzy(not attending),Stidellos,Bennin/thoricc, - note: there was some confusion with those not aware of the last minute chat room - next time ill pick a channel in the raid post for both days - sorry<br>Thanks to al who attending SATurday : Caladur/Abathes Radiant,Connavar(unfortunately had to leave due to rl - thanks bro for comin its ok) DOsg, Gomersaule,Slasra, Toofas,Bennin,Impudent,Gulok (Crumm),Erzinen,Nhiaa,Smokiex,Quasqueton,Naladar,Taim,Aleusion,Zmak - Reviv,Vestiz,<br><br>Extra special thanks to Fandrell for pulling and dying on Day 1, Syllie for duel boxing Ugg to MA, Montyy for Tanking everything else 8), Dordaek for pulling my golem and Rymira for coming up to mez it and help out last minute, Alleusion Sodina and Taim for mezzing everything and Alle for dying two days in a row for me, 4 clicker clerics for making CR easy, Autumnwyld for pulling day 2 with no exp, Impudent for being the first cleric to show and hold the camp, all those brave souls who tried various   techniques for the break in, Erzinen for being a 47 paly new to the planes and TAKING The DT from the golems for us more than once 8) way to go Mr. Steel nads<br><br>Thanks everyone for giving us practice in fear, supporting me and your mates, and making this a good time.  If I missed anyone Im sorry, if anyone felt like favoritism existed on epic rolls I meant none of it cept my own, and I want to help you ALL get yours equally - I was very swamped with the organization and while i have helped lead many that is the first plane raid I totally ran - please forgive my learning process and support our team.<br><br>I like what Ive seen and enough friends tend to show up to support us to show that we have some good peeps here.  <br><br>Now the "need to improve areas"<br><br>Guys - we lost the shissar Sat morning cause we didnt have enough support on time - the point of being early is to beat the other guilds out.  This will be important in the future.  Some stressing of keeping the camp tight, assisting, and general mezzing rocedures was necessary - need to pplay these raids by the books.  Also - less chat spam in the raid channel - tell jokes in guild chat so that the important commands can be easily seen in battle spam red plz.<br><br>Next time will be even smoother.  AS you can see from the amount of loot that rotted, bringing more of the 46+ members wwill be well worth it to add to their gear.  Also - farming these plains for gems to outfit us all with resist gear is a must.<br><br>I look forward to raiding with u all again soon you made me proud - the good far outweighed the bad.<br><br>Good hunting,<br><br>MalFri and Sat for sure)<br>*************************************<br>Confirmed Attendees: (For Fri/Sat Sunday is tentative)<br><br>War: Connavar(60?DosG),Cizzle(48),Gulok(53 War/Crumm 60Shm),Taludana(54)<br>Paly: Minelwood(57), Erzinen(47)<br>Sk:   Keif(57)<br>Mnk: Nagram(54-Cire), Pistonn(54-Q), Phobose(60)<br>Clr: Syllie(60), Impudent(53), Cirebela(57),Dordaek(60 AoA)<br>Rngr: Millikin(60), Tanolan(Autmn)<br>Rog:Padade(54),Fandrell(60)<br>Brd: Autumnwyld (56),<br>Dru: Naldaas(53), Gomersaul(60-Dosg), Kaleen(53)<br>Shm: Jennadha(59), Toofas(60), Dalizar(57)<br>Bst: <br>Wiz: Malikye (57), Quasqueton(60), Naladar(59)<br>Mag: Smokiex(58), Alendera(57 AoA)<br>Enc: Alleusion(60), Reiss(57), Sodina(60)<br>Nec:<br><br>Unconfirmed:Lezerd,Clavendale(60 Paly LC),Redlance(60 Clr LC),Gurunt (60 War Wraith),Stidellos(49 Mnk),Zarrof(60Enc),Tenebrosity(58 Rngr CoC),Noobo(52 shm), Guikui?,<br><br>Informed guilds/friends of Epic objective: Lotus Cult,Wraith,Aliance of the Arcane,Contollers of Chaos,Radiant,DOSG,LM,Vis Major,<br><br>Go take a pic of and print a map to Fear at <a href="http://everquest.allakhazam.com/maps/Plane_of_Fear.html">FEAR_MAP</a><br><br>Hello all<br><br>Heres the breakdown for the action----------------<br><br>This golem is a non-aggro 'broken golem' that is found in the Plane of Fear (-720, -109). Hand the broken golem the golem sprocket -<br><br>an enraged golem says 'Error! Malfunction! Destroy! <br>an enraged golem says 'Warriors like you always bring out the worst in me.'<br><br>You now have an enraged golem on your hands that is aggro. The enraged golem can double hit for 400 each, has approximately 150k HP and is not a caster. Flame based spells and lures are most efficient to use in bringing him down. Once he is dead, loot the green oil from his corpse. Take this green oil back to Kandin in the ButcherBlock Mountains.<br><br>The other two golems have two guards each and AE dispell and fun things. I know we can do them all. <br><br>--------------LOOT: This will be primarily a LM raid, with an open invite to signup for DOSG members, and friends of the guild/members.<br><br>:::All individuals attending the raid must be present for 3 hours prior to an item dropping before they can roll, with the exception of an item no one else needs, or something worked out for a quest prior to the start of the raid. (Or its the start of the raid haha).<br><br>::::Anyone needing Epic pieces will talk to myself or another raid/guild leader prior to the raid - Certain pre-determined Epic items will be defaulted prior to the raid (ex: Broken Golem is obviously mine). -----Any non essential epic items and all armor/drops will be on a 0-200 roll basis for classes needing the armor only- with the exception of any classes LAST piece to complete a full set of usable armor will get it defaulted (EX: The Cleric who has every purple piece who is there for the MAJORITY of the raid gets his last piece defaulted). <br>This is mostly to avoid those non-guildies who are taken in and leave an hour after looting. We all realize that not everyone can stay for 3 days. ------Blue Diamonds/Diamonds will be rolled on or awarded to/by those who have not won any drops (not including rots) at the end of the Raid Sat. and again on Sunday as best we can judge fairly to accomadate all those attending in either their raw form, or as jewelry given the master jewler & material is available. <br>------The point of the old ORQ was always to better aliianced guilds strength as a whole, to learn to work together better as a group, and to have fun while owning the zone. I would like to continue that raiding spirit.<br><br>BREAK IN:::::::::::::: FRI night 6PM CST (7 EST)<br>by 7 :15  EST TOPS I want to have everyone gathered. Find a ride (dont get a trans to Caizc 8) or jog but get there early. Stock up on gems, food, pearls, coffins, water, beer, whatever the night before.<br>I have a few K in reserve to buy the Peridots for the raid. Clerics will get them from me.<br>SAT: 6AM CST (7am EST, 5am(sorry)PST) the raid will continue from whatever corner we all decided to camp out in the night before. Raiders will once again meet in a pre determined chat room before logging in. Its early, but we may need to beat the others to the Epics.<br>Sunday will have to be decided at the end of Saturday as to what needs to be aaccomplished still, and who is available.<br><br>______-----__________-------------________________-----<br>STRATEREGECT (The strategy of the warped)<br>-------____----------------______-----------__________--_<br><br>Due to recent mob/caster changes especially in Fear we will most likely be heading to the SW crnr upon breakin. The raid will receive the /loc and a reminder several times before break in. I am told the NC is not safe at this time. We will try to confirm prior.<br>I need a volunteer to pop in and track, and its a good idea to have a couple FD around the zone in and F9 view to scout and call to the masses when is the clearest time to zone in. This will lessen the number who die on the run. <br><br>Once we zone in -Dont stop runnin no matter what. The second you get hit START HITTING YOUR /LOCATION button while you run. This will make CR that much easier. We all camp to chat ... briefly.. let zone settle down, come back Res buff and kick the snot out of the zone working our way to the golem that night if he is up. If not, we fight until its bed time and start again Sat. morning for armor and named who pop during the day. Members of numerous guilds will know I am going after the golem so there wont be as big a KS chance. <br><br>Lemme know if you can come - its a good practice for an outdoor raid for those members not used to such, some good armor will be had for all - any at least 47 can come - and hopefully a few of us get our epic pieces. <br><br>Plz post if you have had prior pull team experience in Fear. <br><br>Good hunting <br>Malikye <br>57 Wizard<br><br>Master of Disaster<br> <p>Malikye<br>57 Wizard</br><br>Master of Disaster</br></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/umalikyemadonemoon.showPublicProfile?language=EN>MalikyeMadoneMoon</A>&nbsp; <IMG HEIGHT=10 WIDTH=10 SRC="http://home.earthlink.net/~malikye/Malikye4.jpg" BORDER=0> at: 7/14/02 2:05:44 am<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uquasquetonfyrestrike.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Quasqueton Fyrestrike</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Roadkill Cabbie</span><br>  Posts: 1558<br> <font color=#333333>(6/14/02 6:33:36 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm3.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=14.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: Fear me July 12-14 public mirrored page</span><hr size=1> It's looking like I'll be there, so count me in.<br><br>Note on the break in though...
