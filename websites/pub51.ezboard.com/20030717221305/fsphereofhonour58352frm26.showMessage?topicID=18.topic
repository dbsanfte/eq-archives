All hallows Eve.<br>
<br>
Personal Entry,<br>
Captain General of the Followers<br>
Dain Frostbringer<br>
<br>
The hills are alive with undead. We have tracked Nellen to this area but lost him after we were attacked. I have sent trackers out to find and locate him. If we do not find him then the Lady Mysticcat will be much displeased. But I do not worry for we WILL find him. I just hope that we are in time... Wait, a messenger approaches.<br>
<br>
&quot;M'Lord! We have found Lord Nellen. He is near the ranger sanctuary of Surefall glade. He is there with Lord Phreezin also. It looks like that Earthquake was caused by them.&quot;<br>
<br>
The earthqauke.... I should have known! That magic will draw every undead scum from leagues around. Let me know as soon as the remounts are gathered. Send orders for the pikemen and archers to form ranks and prepare to march!<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish my Lord!&quot; The liuetenant bangs his right fist against his BP over his heart and departs.<br>
<br>
How will we ever get to him in time? That scout was one of our furthest ones... CLEAVER!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
A tall barbarian warrior walks into the tent. As he steps further in you can see the scar on his left cheek that he got from fighting the goblins in Permafrost keep. He has more battle experience behind him than anyone... except Lord Dain Frostbringer.<br>
<br>
Cleaver! Send orders for the pikemen and archers to advance. We MUST reach Lord Nellen. Put three ranks of archers in front followed by 6 ranks of pikemen. If things get tight have the pikemen make a Porcupine formation with the archers in the middle. We cant afford to lose any men.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye My Lord&quot;. Cleaver leaves without a salute... the only man here who can get away with that.<br>
<br>
As the Followers advance the air is filled with the crisp TWANG of bowstrings and the crunching of the undead underfoot. All too soon the command is given from the commander of the Pikemen...<br>
<br>
&quot;Porcupine Formation assemble!&quot;<br>
<br>
The archers release their last arrows and gather in a square, six rows wide and six rows deep. The pikemen form up around them, four deep. Sheilds interlocked with just enough room to let the pikes through. A formation that fills in for its lost without leaving a hole. The best chance of making it through...<br>
<br>
Soon the bone chilling sound of cold steel on hard bone, and rusty iron on wooden shields fills the air. But the losses of the Followers are minimal. Only 10 dead... and 7 times that in undead. The ratio wasnt always this good; much practice has formed a cohesive team of the men. Practice... and the will to live.<br>
<br>
The company crests a ridge in time to see Nellen and Phreezin enter the cave that leads to Surefall Glades. Undoubtably they are going to see if the Rangers and Druids are alright. But they do not see the hundreds of undead that are following them in. But why cant they see them? They are looking straight at them.... Wait... a one way invisibility spell? Then that means... a Necro!<br>
<br>
Captain General Dain Frostbringer knows that Lords Nellen and Phreezin are doomed if they are not helped. For surelly Surefall Glade is under attack or the rangers would be out here fighting. They are walking into a trap! <br>
<br>
&quot;Forward the Followers!&quot;<br>
<br>
Forward the Followers.... the command rings up and down the line. The company of archers and pikemen are now joined by the rest of the Batallion.<br>
<br>
The Special Calvalry advances at a thunderous rate. Centaurs and riders alike firing arrow after arrow into the mass of undead. When they are too close for arrows to be effective the humans take the bows from the centaurs and pass them shields and swords, then take up arms themselves.<br>
<br>
The Special Calvalry clear a path through the undead.... until they all fall to the ground dead, and a shadowy figure emerges. A Shadownight!<br>
<br>
Cleaver rushes into the gap to confront the Shadownight in combat. The cold air is filled with thunder as blades meet. Boulders are smashed to pebbles with the force of deflected blows. The Shadownight cuts Cleaver across the left forearm.... but not before Cleaver cuts its right arm completely off. Arm and sword fallto the ground, useless. Cleaver takes one more swing and releives it of its head.<br>
<br>
The Followers move into the cave after clearing the few remaining undead and search for Lords Nellen and Phreezin.<br>
<br>
As they emerge into the Glade they can see that undead are swarming the waterfall and entering the caves. Nellen and Phreezin are taking the stragglers one by one but they cant do enough to stem the flow.<br>
<br>
The archers release a volley into the milling throng and take out twenty of the undead. But there are just too many. Nellen and Phreezin are surrounded as well. Things look grim...<br>
<br>
Above the cacaphony of battle a voice rings out. Clear as a crystal, more beautiful than any sunset, more regal and commanding than any queen.<br>
<br>
&quot;Halt! Thou shall NOT harm M'Lord Nellen!&quot;<br>
<br>
As her words fall across the armies they all stop in their tracks. Swords half swung, bows partly drawn, even the fallen are silent.<br>
<br>
Mysticcat! my love!&quot; Nellen yells with joy.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye tis I my beloved. I am here&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that she casts a spell. A glowing ball of fire appears above the Glade. Above the mountains that form the Glade. High enough to be seen in Halas in and Qeynos. <br>
<br>
The ball spins to a stop... Then shatters like a dropped glass. Beams of fire lance to the earth to strike every skeleton, zombie, and ghoul dead. <br>
<br>
A faint movement grabs the eye of Captain General Dain. he looks to his left to see the remaining Rangers and Druids emerge from the caves. The fireball must have killed all the undead in there also.<br>
<br>
&quot;With Peace and Good health we leave you now, to assist the land in other fights this eve,&quot; the Lord Nellen calls out, &quot;May Peace favor you all&quot;<br>
<br>
And with that the Lords Nellen and Phreezin and the Lady Mysticcat disappear in a flash of light. The Followers form up to follow the Master Tracker. he will lead them off in search of Nellen yet again.<br>
<br>
**********************************************<br>
<br>
There ya'll go. had a great time with that one. Lunch time now so I'm outta here. take care and &lt;hugs&gt; to all. Peace out!<br>

body of the necro that she has just slain.  Hum.   This is not a good sign when these ancient necros start prowling about raising armys.  Humm now if those fools can keep from getting Lady Mysticcat's husband dead it will be a good thing.<br>
<br>
Suddenly Mysticcat  herself arrives above the battle.  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Giggles softly to herself with the appearance of Mysticcat.   <br>
<br>
Well Now that the Lady herself is here I Most definitely will not need to do anything she will definitely take great pleasure in setting those blasted undead  on  their ears. <br>
<br>
  Well then  I guess I should be off  to investigate this situation further.   As Rhapsodey quickly checks the body of the necro at her feet for any items that may assist her in her search she finds an ancient ring engraved with the symbol of unrest.   Interesting a ring of unrest.   Humm this  may be more than I can handle alone but I do not have time wait for my Sword Sister Reoki to return from the meeting she had with the High Shaman of her village.  <br>
<br>
Sigh   We live for the one we die for the one.  I guess I had better get going and see what is happening before this insanity gets worse.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Quickly stands and Pulls a small amulet out.  She quietly says some ancient words of power in an unknown tongue and a Portal opens before her.  She looks around quickly tears coming to her eyes from the destruction and death that lay about her.  I hope I can determine what is causing this and that I can stop it before anymore innocent people are harmed.  And with that she steps through the glowing portal that takes her to the lands of unrest.    <br>
