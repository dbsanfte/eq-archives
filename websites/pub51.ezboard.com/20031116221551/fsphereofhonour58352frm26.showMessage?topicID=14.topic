She is humming Softly and seems to be writing in a tattered book. The gentle touch of clouding magic can be felt in the area.<br>
<br>
<br>
I successfully tracked down the scribe that has been writing Ballads of the Druid Nellen.  I confronted him this day Demanding to know why he has been writing such distortions of the truth.  I also demanded of him the location of The Arch Druid Aeaden that I have been tasked with finding.  He denied any knowledge of the Location of the Arch Druid.  I believe his word when he said he did not know for I could hear the notes of truth in his words.  I also detected the notes of truth and belief in what he has written of the Druid Nellen.  I have spoke to my friend the Arch Druidess Jaelynn and she has indicated to me that the Druid Nellen has great promise if he survives these dangerous lands.  I will have to make time to keep an eye on these two to make sure that the evil forces that roam the lands do not corrupt them.  Tomorrow I will continue my search for the Arch Druid Aeaden.  I fear that evil Forces have taken him.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey stops writing as the sounds of battle come to her on the wind.  Her sensitive ears can pick out the cries for help.  She Quickly dons her armor and Grabs her weapons and follows the sounds of battle.  Shortly she arrives near the Great wooden bridge leading to the northern Karranas.  She can see one of the ancient hill giants attacking a group of adventures she can see a number of their members are already down and the rest will be shortly joining them.  Why must those stupid young fools attack him they should have run?  The Arch Druidess Jaelynn wont even attack him.  I should just let him kill them.  She turns to walk away. And stops after two steps.  Why Milady must I be so protective of fools as she turns and charges toward the battle.  She quickly closes the distance being careful to approach the giant from behind.  She swings her ancient magical mace at the back of the giant’s knee and she hits it with a solid crunch of breaking bone.  And then her ancient mace releases a blast of magical fire that Staggers the giant and causes it to turn on her.  It roars in pain and swings at her trying to rip her head from her shoulders.  She dodges the giant clumsy attack and watches as the party of young fools flee across the bridge.  Well Rhapsodey what are we going to do now.  If this big fool hits me it will be all over.  In her moment of distraction she fails to notice the other massive fist coming at her right side and it connects with the shattering crash of buckling armor and breaking bones.  The brutal impact throws her body into the river.  The hill giant quickly stomps into the river to recover his dinner but to his disgust the current has taken the body and he cannot find it.  He eventually wanders off in search of a new dinner of adventurers.  A short time after the giant departs from the area a form raises from the water and slowly and painfully drags itself under the foot of the bridge.  There the form collapses and does not move again.  <br>

   I, Reoki K’vatra, a shaman of great standing among my tribe, have been called upon a great quest for knowledge.  To gain the knowledge I seek I had to leave my favored hunting grounds of the glorious mountains of the Everfrost Peaks. <br>
   In my many travels I have met many.   One of the ones I have met in passing is a young bard.  She is quite pretty in her strange looking way.  She is so tiny to me that I have been afraid to touch her without hurting her.  She claims to be wood elf……   I have heard of such beings but never thought that I would meet one.  Over my travels I have passed ways with her many times, and of course we have become friends over the course of time.<br>
    <br>
<br>
    Well, enough of remincing.  I have far to go this day.  I am heading to go back home to tell my tribe of some of the wonders I have seen.  It’s a long journey from High Hold Keep. <br>
    As I leav the pass from High Hold Keep I hear a Roar of anger and victory.  It doesn’t sound like it came from a natural throat, but as if it came from the Gods.  Thinking to my self,” Oh, No.  It must be a giant.  Hmmmm I don’t have the strength to meddle with one of those evil beings.  But, I can not leave those whom it will harm to die alone. “<br>
    Sigh.  Hear I came to help another hapless person who doesn’t know when to flee when the fleeing is good.  Ohh well, that is the life of a shaman.<br>
     As I get nearer I see a group of adventurers hounding this giant.  Then as I start to head their way to help those I see laying on the ground, I see a person sneaking up behind the giant.  I lose sight of what happens then because I have my hands full keeping a warrior, who’s ribs are broken and who is bleeding all of his life’s blood on the ground, alive.<br>
    Praying to the spirits,” Please Oh Great Spirits, fill this brave and courageous warrior the strength and vitality of your will.”   As soon as I finish praying he starts to breathe again, and the blood loss has stopped.  “Thank You, Oh Great Spirits for you favor.”<br>
<br>
    I finally start to look around puzzled.  All of this warriors companions have left him for dead, and the giant has left too.  With this turn of events I grow very wary and concerned.  Looking around al I see is a vast plain.  Way off in the distance I can see a bridge.  Then, I hear a roar of disappointment.  Looking closer I see a giant thrashing in the water looking for something.  Hoping to my self that all got a way.  Eventually the giant gives up his search.  <br>
    I hide the warrior I saved in a dense thicket.  He should be fine here.  He will be waking up soon, and then he can find his comrades.  <br>
    I then start heading to the area that the giant left hoping to find what ever had his interest.   When I get to the bank of the river, I see where the giant had torn up the bank.  But, what is this???   I see a blood trail.  Following this bloody trail to the footing of the bridge what do I find?  “Oh Great Spirits hear my call.  Please bring Rhapsodey back from the brink of death.  Do not let her pass the final veil,” this I pray with all of my might.  <br>
    For hear underneath the bridge lies the bashed and battered body of my dear little fragile little bard.  “Oh please don’t leave me my friend. “ I mutter under my breath.  “Spirits IF you never grant me your favor again, Please, OH Please, don’t let my friend die.  Please don’t let her be harmed.”   <br>
    As I cry over my friend a blue nimbus starts to surround her.  All of the sudden she starts to cough.  Tears of joy start to stream down my face.  “Thank You.  Thank You Great Spirits.  I reaffirm my ties with you,” I cry out with over whealming happiness.  <br>
   When Rhapsodey awakes I take her in my arms.  She is so tiny; I could hold her up in one hand. <br>
    “Well, my friend are you feeling alright?”  I ask.  <br>
    She says,” Yes, But will you please remind me next time I see an idiot trying to kill a giant to head the other way?”<br>
    “Sure.  But, I can only do so if we travel together.”  I state.  “ Would you mind seeing this great world with me?”<br>
    Of course you all know how she answered, because we are still hunting and learning about this great world together.<br>
