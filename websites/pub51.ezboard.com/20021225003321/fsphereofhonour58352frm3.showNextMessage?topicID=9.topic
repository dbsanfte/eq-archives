<br>
Remember, if one person in the raid messes up, its not him/her that looks bad...its all of us. Everyone will pay for it. It’s the Raid Leader's job to make sure that doesn’t happen. <br>
<br>
1. Raids are not always about EXP. Anyone caught continually complaining about EXP will be Translocated out or asked to leave a raid. Raids are about achieving goals, not always EXP. There will be raids designed to get EXP. On those raids if you are not getting any Exp please let the Raid Leader know. Because of level differences, it may not be possible for all to get EXP. In this case, just have fun. Another big reason for raids is so that the guild can have fun playing together.<br>
<br>
2. People will be asked to fulfill certain rolls (puller, main assist, snarer, etc.), please perform only your roll unless asked to do otherwise. Doing more than your asked can create chaos. Everyone is important: Main Buffer, Main Assist, Main Healer, Main Mezzer, etc. The Leader will put the most appropriate person for the job in each roll. <br>
<br>
3. Talk only in the channel the leader designates to you. The raid leader will designate one channel to be used by people with raid jobs. Slower, mezzer, puller, lotto person, will all use this channel and NO ONE ELSE!<br>
<br>
4. No wandering off. Some people have a tendency to get bored and wander away from the group and try to explore on their own. This WILL get everyone killed. Stay put and wait for the Raid Leader to tell you what to do. We are going to be severe here and will have a very low tolerance.<br>
<br>
5. No one speaks for the raid except the Raid Leader and the Officers. If another group wants to share space with us, the general raid populace does not say a thing in representation of the raid. People not with us might be using SHOUT and AUCTION, but do not answer them. Only the Raid Leaders and Officers speak to them. REMEMBER THIS ALWAYS!!!!!<br>
<br>
6. Try to BE EARLY. If you think there is even a chance you might be late, camp out at the starting location the night before. WE WILL BE TURNING AWAY PEOPLE WHO COME TOO LATE.... now here’s the qualifier to that... IF there are still slots open, and IF we can get you to where we are, and IF this can all be achieved WITHOUT disturbing the flow of the raid TOO much, than you MAY be allowed to join. NO ONE who shows up late is PROMISED a spot, even if there is one. <br>
<br>
7. No one calls clerics to camp except the Raid Leader or the person designated by the raid leader. NO ONE ELSE CAMPS!!! No melee should ever camp. And no other spell casters camp until at least one cleric is known for sure to be out. Sometimes only the name of the person the leader or officer tells to camp will be camping.<br>
<br>
8. ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! ASSIST! We will be watching for people who are NOT assisting. You WILL be publicly called out if you are on a different mob than the Main Assist when you shouldn’t be. Consider this your First, Second, and Last warning on THAT subject. <br>
<br>
9. Auto Split is set to always on unless the leader changes this. Characters not wanting loot (i.e. monks or other Str. conscious chars) can use the split command to give away the extra cash.  Any items that drop and are quest related and are no drop will go to the characters that are closest to having the (quest) item completed first. Following that the item will be lottoed among all guild members and invited friends who can use the item on their primary character.  If a character has an item already that would be better than the quested item they should refrain from rolling. All other items that drop, that are not quest related and are no drop, will go primarily to anyone who is attending that is of appropriate race or class for that item(s).  If no one is of the appropriate class or race to use then primary alternates may be considered to receive the item.  If more than one person has a primary alternate that can use an item or would make an improvement, a random roll on the item to see who gets it will occur.  If no one has a character that can use the item or it makes no improvement then a random roll between all hunting parties will occur to see who gets it.  If no one is interested in the item, it  will be looted by an officer or leader and deposited within the Guild Bank or sold at the discretion of the officer or leader. The cash will be donated to the guild bank for improvements. NEED before GREED is the primary rule.<br>
<br>
10. &quot;No loot for me so I am not going on the raid.&quot; Everyone will want help on their epics eventually OR with getting that one uber item in a particular dungeon, thus we had better not hear of people using this logic to justify not coming to raids. We would rather hear, &quot;I just don't feel like raiding today&quot;. Just come to the raids and have fun and eventually you will be rewarded. Let me tell you, I like helping people who help others and themselves. <br>
<br>
11. No complaining about the kind of REZ you get. Period. Level or no level. <br>
<br>
12. And while we are at it...NO COMPLAINING about anything. Loot, EXP, what you had for lunch...keep it to yourself. This lowers the guild morale, and makes things tougher on everyone. As the old saying goes, &quot;If you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all.&quot;<br>
<br>
13. Once an Officer or Raid Leader is on sight making groups, then the raid is officially on, and ALL the above rules apply.<br>
<br>
14. Try to keep excess chatter to a minimum while groups are being established. Its very hard to actually get all the tells for who is and who isn’t there when you're suffering from a horrid scroll because everyone is chatting vigorously. It’s also hard for everyone to see any instructions they are supposed to be getting when they have to deal with that same scroll issue. Too many times we've heard people say &quot;I didn’t see that&quot;. <br>
<br>
15. Don’t ask who Main Assist, Mezzer and Slower, will be, as it WILL be announced, if the raid begins and it has not been announced, let the Raid Leader know, and they'll handle it.<br>
<br>
16. REMEMBER... Only the Raid Leaders should be giving instruction of ANY kind. This includes telling people who is doing what job.<br>
<br>
17. ONLY The Raid Leader, the Main Assist, and The Main Mezzer will EVER call targets. In the event of multiple groups, a group leader will be established by the Raid Leader and a puller will then be assigned for each group. NOONE else pulls. This has caused many trains and death.<br>
-----------------------------------------------------------<br>
READ THIS:<br>
<br>
Everyone in the guild is invited and encouraged to set up raids. Here are a few pointers to consider:<br>
<br>
1. Variety! Have a variety of raid ideas in mind to appeal to various players. Examples, language fair, PVP events, Hide &amp; Seek with prizes! Get Creative!<br>
<br>
2. Scope out your raid area before the raid starts. Find the safe areas for groups to med and rest. Print out maps if possible!. Print out maps if possible!<br>
<br>
3. Log on early for your own raid. Help facilitate ports if you are a porting class or speak with porting classes in advance to help members attend the raid.<br>
<br>
4. Many of our members are talented in various skills such as baking, smithing, etc. If anyone feels that his or her skills may be utilized to help a raid please feel free to offer this to the leader of the raid. For example, a smith may want to ‘sharpen’ weapons for pets or a Baker may want to create some +wisdom food for the wisdom based casters.<br>
<br>
NOTE: These are the Raid Rules as they stand now, they can and will be edited as necessary, and any time they are changed we will be posting a reminder to re-read them. Raid Leader may adjust rules as necessary.  <br>
