<br>
     <br>
      Hi... I am Tippie Thunderclaws... <br>
I serve my king, race and country I was on my own on the moon eager to fight battles and explore new lands. To become a citizen of Luclin is an extremely time consuming and annoying adventure and I won't bore you with those details....<br>
<br>
    I hunted in the pit all the way up to lvl 6 when I say the pit I mean the moat type area around the city of Shar Vahl. It has all sorts of nasty little surprises for us everyday kitties like evil rockhoppers hungry for blood and scorpions galore....<br>
   <br>
    One Particular scorpion rules in the pit by the name of Tail Fang oh how I despise this creature killed me 3 or 4 times thats close to half of my life spans out the window <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START >: --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/mad.gif ALT=">:"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
    Anyhow I did all this as a kitten and couldn't figure my way past the stupid ruler of the pit.... when I saw an absolutly stunningly gorgeous experienced KITTTY KAT in the city.... and I mean she was everything a Cat could want. Like drop the mouth open beautiful <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :eek --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/eek.gif ALT=":eek"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->  <br>
<br>
     When she looked my way I thought'd I'd die and then she started walking over to me just as I got to the bank... she was soooooooo nice to me and got my first thru my 5th lvl spells. Complete pocket change for her class and I could not stop gawking....<br>
<br>
     I have absolutly no idea what she saw in a young kit foolish and unexperienced as I but she took me under her wing and has been helping me level ever since... <br>
<br>
    She helped sneek me into the sphere family because she had huge connections and coul hide the fact from anybody cause of her position... I really didn't want anyone to know I was Sheldone's Vassal and Ambassador to the moon. But Sphere being as close knit as they are and me and my foolish tounge people kept finding out it was just me and her to about lvl 9 and at 10 people started finding out first 1 then 3 then 5 and arrghh I had to give it up so when I got to 20 I announced who I was and what I was to the guild and they accepted me and I have loved the family with all my heart as I also can proudly say I serve the Sphere....<br>
<br>
    I am still seeing my wonderful sweetheart Myssticcat and believe I am in love with her though I do not see in me at all what she see's even now with the time that I have been away I must be a juvenile again compared to her lvl and experience. but I do love her and we have every intention to get married which may surprise some of you but may not because we have announced our intentions. <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START ;) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/wink.gif ALT=";)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
<br>
         Well I must be off....<br>

<br>
I am Myssticcat the BeastLord. I am of the guild of Sphere of Honour. <br>
<br>
I had walked and hunted the moons of Luclin for many years and had gone to the bank one morn to make a withdrawal, when I spotted this handsome young Shaman kitty. I knew he was a Shaman by his weapons and his aura. He had a beautiful coat on him of the most silken furr. I was stunned ! <br>
I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I had to meet him. So I said to my self &quot;you need to just walk right over there and talk to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The next thing you know I did just that. We talked and talked and well... lets just say we became very good friends. I was very much so taken with him. <br>
<br>
I knew this Shaman would have potential. I thought to myself I will get him clothes and weapons and bring him along with me. I knew I wanted him from the first moment I laid eyes on him. I would kill for him and hunt for him and he would keep us safe from harm and make us run like the wind so nothing would ever catch us. <br>
<br>
I am his kitty for now and ever and would never think of leaving him. He is my wonder kitty. I would marry him and have his kits and bring them up in his shadow to be just like him. <br>
<br>
I do love him with all my heart and cannot wait to see him again. I have not seen him in many moons and have just been pinning away waiting on his return. I do hope it is soon. <br>
<br>
When we get together again all of Norrath and Luclin and Velious shall know of our love. We shall have a big wedding and all shall be invited. We shall dance and drink and sing the night away with all our friends. Then we shall run away on our honeymoon and none shall find us for days !!!<br>
<br>
<br>
Myssticcat the Beast Lord and love of Tippie Thunderclaws<br>

<br>
    Being in a new place is always a little scary.... This is my first time in Highpass Keep, the goblins here are many and fierce. As I came out from the bank I heard Isabella (an NPC) crying out for help. I thought their must be something I can do to save her poor soul from these wretched beings. <br>
    <br>
    Suddenly I saw the evil green thing their with her backed into a corner, I chanted and rooted him to the floor. He was quite unhappy with me for this and I began a chant anew and hit him for 84 dmg with my spirit strike spell. Now I could tell I had his attention but he was still rooted quickly I chanted my Affliction spell and he began to choke... as I nuked him again my root spell wore off and instead of fighting he ran of course I proceede to chase him but the little thing knew it's home well and I could not catch him as I was led deeper and deeper into the dungeons of highpass. He lost me and I am alone hungry and turned around in this unfamiliar dungeon and I can only hope I will get to see my beloved wife again and that she will forgive me for missing are most sacred day. I am doomed to wander these halls killing until I finally run into something that is finally able to vanquish me, but I fear that is a just punishment for the fact that I have let my wife and family down. <p>Sheldone Windruner

Alas I could not find one for hire until to late. <br>
The wedding was long past its due time and the guests had come and gone. I could not find anyone to do this job.  <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :( --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/frown.gif ALT=":("><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>

I have Traveled unto the Strange place Called Highpass with My faithful Warder to Start a fight and get a bit of Revenge on these evil creatures that delayed my Clan Sisters Wedding.<br>
<br>
Sassha:  Explain to Me warder why did I go off and come down to this Strange Planet to hunt Little Green Point eared Freaks.  This Place stinks It will take me weeks To clean the smell from my Fur.  Sassha sniffs At her Hands and rolls her eyes in Disdain of the smell.   Her Warder watches her and purrs in contentment of just being in the presence of his Master.  His Keen sense soon note the presence of a goblin coming down the tunnel.  In the silent Language of Warder and Beastlord he informs his loving master of a play thing approaching.   <br>
<br>
Sassha Eyes light up at the prospect of having something to take her aggravation out on as her Ears perk and fix the location of her prey.  The unsuspecting Goblin Walks directly in front of her Hiding spot.  A soft rumble draws its attention and as it turns it freezes in fear as Tiger Leaps from a ledge down onto it.  It fangs bared and Reaching for it Throat.  A scream of Terror escapes its mouth as an even Larger Tiger Leaps from the ledge and lands on two feet and approaches Wicked Blades held in its hands Prepared to finish the work that the Smaller Tiger has Begun.  The Struggle is soon over but the sounds have drawn unwanted company to the scene of the attack.  Sassha and her warders Keen Feline sense quickly note the new danger.  Sassha Quietly surveys the gathering crowd of Goblins as they quickly surround her and her warder with obvious intent to avenge their fallen kin.<br>
<br>
Sassha:  Well little one it looks like we may get a bit more of a workout then we intended.  Sassha's warders tail Snaps back in forth in anticipation.  He knows that they are way outnumbered and in extreme danger but he is more than willing to give his life to protect his Companion so that she may live to fight another day.  With a Deafening Roar He launches himself at a Goblin that has moved to close.  Sassha's battle Roar Joins the Roar of her Little Warder as she Launches herself among the Goblin's Her Slashing Blades Drawing Goblin Blood at every Swing.<br>
