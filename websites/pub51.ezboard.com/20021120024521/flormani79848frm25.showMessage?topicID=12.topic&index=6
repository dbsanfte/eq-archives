It had the smell of a Halfling whore on a summers morning, it possibly could have been the very sticky substance that was oozing out of their rectums. The question around the &quot;igloo&quot; is where did that awful stench come from. Kegnar spoke up and said he recognized that smell from &quot;the end of his finger&quot;, which made the rest of the crowd cower in &quot;fear&quot;. Suddenly outside came the sound of squeeling tires. This could only mean Bricey had come back. <br>
<br>
It was time for Kegnar and the gang to put their pants back on.As they were cleaning off the vasoline. Bargurin pulled out his lizard on a stick, hoping it wouldn't be limp.  Much to Kegnar's dismay, the lizard on a stick was limp, and a limp lizard cannot perform the bunny flop, shlop and hop of pernicious pleasure. Bargurin knew that it was time to smack it up, flip it, and rub it down because he dissapointed &quot;his momma&quot;.<br>

These questionable activities had no sooner been completed when the door whipped open, revealing &quot;Brice&quot; standing with a rather pleased look upon his face.
