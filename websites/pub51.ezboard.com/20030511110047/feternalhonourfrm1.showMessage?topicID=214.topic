<br>
I'd like to introduce myself.  I am Kazadeth, or Kaza or Kaz.  Whatever you prefer, I'm not too picky.  I'm a 52 SK and I also suppose I am the &quot;squeaky&quot; wheel on this whole merger thing.<br>
<br>
Let me start of by saying this - the merger is a wonderful idea... for some.  But for people like myself, it might not be so grand.<br>
<br>
I don't know if you have access to the private boards but I have a post there entitled CONCERNS WITH MERGER ALREADY or something like that <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   Please feel free to take a look.<br>
<br>
Now, for a quick little history on my background.  I've been involved in 2 previous guild mergers and they were all rosey until a month or 2 after the merger.  Then the inevitable poop hit the fan.  Then I found EH and basically found my EQ home.  I am not an officer of the guild.  I've only been a member (heck, I still might be in the probationary/trial phase) for a few months.  These opinions are my own and do not reflect EH in any way, shape or form.<br>
<br>
Before I go further, I will state that I will merge if merging or not being guilded with any of my friends/family is the only option.  However, given the option, my preference is to stay as EH with any members who feel the same way I do, if there is any.<br>
<br>
Also, I have grouped with some MG and SA people and found them to be wonderful and a pleasure to be around, but things do change when something major like a merger between two, much less three guilds happen.<br>
<br>
Now, on to my concerns and I do have an open mind and I CAN see all the positives of the new guild requests/rules.  But it just doesn't fall into my style of gaming.<br>
<br>
Level limit - do not particularly care for especially since we allowed everyone to bring their alts.  I can understand the need to not promote a stepping stone type guild for people to level up and move on but, with most of us having low level alts, we're going to probably meet alot of low level, wonderful players.  Unfortunately, they will not be able to be guilded with do to their lack of levels.  This may push them to level harder but for casual gamers (which I find to be the most loyal and enjoyable to be around), this is a problem.<br>
<br>
Raid Nights - I see and understand that at this moment there is NO REQUIREMENT for us to attend.  But I still read it as Highly Recommended / Expected.  And I see this changing in 6 months or so.  What happens when alot of our high level bretheren want to go to ToV or something but we don't have the interest to do it because alot of people aren't doing Raid Nights?  I mean, we will have the NUMBERS but not the INTEREST and so then do those members who want to raid get frustrated at those of us that don't and then we implement a mandatory raid night once a week or month?  I'm sorry, and I'm a little blunt, but my time online is my time online.  I'm a father of a newborn baby and I have 3 other children between 8-12 and a wife to keep happy.  So when I do get the pleasure of logging in to play, I want to do what I want to do.  Whether it's help a low level throw a dungeon crawl or get an item or faction or just sit and BS in guild chat.  And I feel that if I do not participate on RN's then I will, maybe not at first but eventually, be looked down upon.<br>
<br>
Raid Point System - To be blunt, this just sucks.  Now don't get me wrong, I completely understand why guilds do it and such but, particularly in a family guild, there are members who are contributing to the guild in anyway they can.  Why should they be &quot;punished&quot; for not helping the guild in raids but instead help the guild by guiding lower members and helping them become stronger which in turns makes the guild stronger.  Why should player A, who goes to say PoG all the time and many times the chances that player B has to get an item have even more odds in his favor?  Player B is a casual player, helps the guild when he can and maybe can raid once a month.  He doesn't have nearly the opportunity to get good loot from the planes or what-not and then gets an even lower chance because he cannot raid alot.  While player A, who, if there is no point system, will still have 100x the chance to get the item over player B.<br>
<br>
Another problem that I'm seeing atm, and I don't know if this is because the guild actually hasn't been formed yet or not, but I do not see any officer type status given for any of our members (Mooni in particular).  If I am go merge with another guild (or two in this situation), I would like someone I can trust to represent me and my ideals and that would have to be someone I know, hence someone from EH.<br>
<br>
Anyway, those are some of my concerns.  My main thing is I'm happy with EH and having the ally channel for meeting and grouping with others.  I know there will be a rift, a division, within the new guild of those who wish to pursue the raiding route and those who just play to play.  <br>
<br>
My question to you is - Where do you see the merged guild 6 months from now?<br>
<br>
Please understand, I'm not trying to rant or complain.  I'm just concerned as I have gone through this before without the results that were intended.  And when I have something as wonderful as EH on the line, I get &quot;cold feet&quot; as other have said <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   All the people in all 3 guilds are probably wonderful but with different mindsets of what they want out of the game.  I just do not want this to cause a major clash.  If the raiders can understand the point of view of the casual, family oriented type player this may work.  But, unfortunately, I see problems arising with 6 months, tops.<br>

<br>
But I DID read your post and when I have a few moments, I'll address them privately on the Arcanum boards, and yes, I do have access (don't forget, Graylina is a leader of MG).<br>
<br>
For now, let me assure you that some of the major changes you mentioned are going to be put on the back burner for quite some time.  Our focus is, and has to be, bonding the new family together first.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to send me a message anytime if you'd like to chat.<br>
