On this particular day he has taken the group as far away from home as Rathe Mntns. The objective: to familiarize his companions with the lands of Norrath. Currently he is explaining how best to defeat a hill giant in battle, noting however, that it will be a long time till they will need that knowledge rather than the trusty sow spell. having most of the afternoon studied a brave band of adventurers fighting a giant, and having now eaten a good meal. The party is preparing to make camp, out of sight from most beings. The evening is uneventful. But shortly after midnight, Khaldorn awakens with a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach. He knows this feeling well. It is a sign if danger...evil is near. Knowing that his young companions would be more trouble than use, he sets out alone in the direction that he feels is the right. Having used a special barbarian mixture of grease and some secret ingredients on his armor, he can move very silently....for a barbarian.<br>
He closes in of a small forest, slowly, looking for any clues as to what the danger is. The queasy feeling turns into a hard knot and without a sound, he pulls out a bottle of stout and takes a long swig from the bottle. He closes his eyes and waits for the liquer to loosen his nerves. &quot;Strange&quot; He thinks.<br>
&quot;I have never known such fear. Not even when I was fighting that craig by myself in FM.&quot;<br>
Having steadied his nerves he ventures into the forest, towards the hidden danger.<br>
Sneaking among the trees, in a very unbarbarian like way, he starts to hear hushed voices in a distinctly foreign tongue.<br>
He sits down, closes his eyes, and focuses on hearing the voices.<br>
He has basic knowledge of all the languages he's ever heard, knowing that the knowledge will some day become handy. <br>
Not like back in the old days, when he was adventuring around<br>
LOIO and an obnoxious halfling thought he could get away with insulting a barbarian by using the halfling language. Which had proven unwise, for this particular barbarian knew enough of the halfling language to get rather angry.<br>
He knows that some day his language skills could be used for something important.<br>
But this particular language is really hard for Khaldorn to comprehend.<br>
He tries instead to catch a glimpse of the beings using the unfamiliar language. He sees small forms, hard to make out in the dark. Judging by the fluid, elegant motions they must be....ElVES....no thats not the elven language....DARK ELVES....<br>
Knowing now which language to focus on, Khaldorn can now understand several words, and each one makes the look on his face turn ever more grim.<br>
Among the words he catches are:<br>
...dark assasins........soon........Phreezin.......dead.......Sphere<br>
.....Donal.........fake crown............mindcontrol....<br>
<br>
Having not fully comprehended the sinister prospect of his encounter, hes decides to quickly scribble down the words and heads back for the camp.<br>
Checking several times for followers he sneaks back to the camp and breathes a sigh of relief as he rouses his companions, wanting to contact the arch druid Aeaden, Chisajr or even Nellen.....someone he can trust within the guild. hurriedly the band packs their stuff for travel. This being done very fast, as they were ready to leave at short notice knowing the danger of the area for young adventurers.  <br>
barely audibly, Canute bestows sow first upon Cogito then himself. But when he turns to grant the spirit of wolf on Khaldorn, the silence is broken by a loud &quot;TWANG&quot;.<br>
Out of the darkness, at incredible speed sails a sheaf arrow and lodges itself in Khaldorns left thigh.<br>
Instead of screaming, he pulls out his large 2 handed hammer and at the same time gives the crucial note to Canute, demanding that Canute brings it to an officer of the Sphere of Honour. Knowing that further discussion and any expression of feelings about leaving Khaldorn behind will only waste precious time, the two youngsters scampers off into the darkness to the sound of Khaldorns probably final....&quot;CHARGE!!!......&quot;<br>

Phreezin dear your suffocating me and plz quit squeezing me so hard. I'm still hurting a bit.   As Phreezin lets up on his bear hug.  Rhapsodey looks over to her Sword sister Reoki.  ,&quot;excellent work as always Sis.  But next time would you plz put on a  leash on my  Dear Husband he's  trying to squeeze me in two and I really could go without my chest being Squeezed down into my stomach and up into my head.&quot;<br>
<br>
As Rhapsodey carefully sits down by Phreezin and wraps herself back in the blankets and lays her head against his shoulder.  ,&quot;Blast what happened?   I feel colder than the time I went Skin diving in the waters of Everfrost to Recover those bodies of those young warriors that were thrown in after they were killed.&quot;  She  takes the cup of soup that Reoki hands her and quietly drinks it.   After finishing it she looks at the sky and offers a small song of Thanks.<br>
<br>
After a short bit she looks at her Sister and Husband.  ,&quot;I think it is time that we payed my Dear Father a visit once I have recovered a bit that is.  Something is very wrong here and ive had enough of this.  But  I think that you two had best gather us some friends to go along.  I keep sensing necromantic magic as if we are being watched.  And if this is my father using it something is very very Wrong.<br>
Rhapsodey returns to watching the fire burn and as she does the fire  that burns in her eyes  begins to burn brighter as her determination becomes more set to see this game to an end.<br>

They stop only long enough for them to drink some water and for Cogito to make a copy of the note. The two have agreed that splitting up will increase their chance of success. The objective being to bring the note to someone trustworthy within the Sphere. Preferably an officer.<br>
&quot;ok. You'll head for the druid ring in NK and get to freeport. There must be someone round there. I'll search out karanas and if I dont find anyone I'll get TP'ed to...GFAY maybe&quot; states Canute. &quot;Fine by me&quot; says Cogito, happy to get as far away from the lurking evil as possible.<br>
The two break up camp and Canute renews their sow.<br>
Neither being good swimmers, Canute also casts levitate on the pair before they travel on at a frantic pace.<br>

I was there waiting for my best friend Stopher's wedding and their wasn't much for me to kill there so I just decided to go over to the Dirv camp and have some fun pick up a few of their rings and make a lil money.<br>
   Inhaling deeply I relax as the cool air flows into my lungs. Mumbling an almost silent prayer of thanks, &quot;Thank you Tunaare oh how I love your nature.&quot;<br>
     I hunted alone in the dark of the night using my harmony spell to make things relaxed and unrushed, when I felt the winds change slightly. Sure enough as I looked up I saw a man named Cogito running towards the East Commens and Freeport area. People always thought levitate was untrackable and silent but if you not what to look for it was actually louder and easier to track then if you were on the ground. Thats when I realized something was not quite right, the look on Cogito's face was one of extreme unease and a little terror. I wondered why he was in such a hurry and thats when I noticed that something felt very wrong, Nature's night was somehow corrupted their was a small sense of evil in the air. <br>
<br>
   Silently I followed Cogito wandering over WC when I realized he was heading east but not in a direct route, it was a route one would use say if they did not want to be followed and as I began to look for signs of other followers, I realized their was much more to this then at what I first thught. by the time we entered EC I was sure of it two Dark Elf Shadow Knights, were tracking him with relatively apparent ease. They had to be Shadow Knights for they were very good and I almost missed their signs of being their at all. surely Cogito could not know he was being tracked, but the look of unease and terror, he sensed it in the air also the wrongness of it. The Dark Elves were disturbing the peace of the night that alone was enough for me to take pity and spare some time to help this man. I sent my words softly along the wind almost as if they were the wind itself.<br>
<br>
   &quot; Stop friend their are DE's tracking you, if you wish to be free of them double back and...&quot;  I directed him along a route that would eventually bring the DE's back around and they would cross above and in front of me as they were tracking his path. It took a good 10 minutes for him to run the route and I could tell he was getting anxious as I dared not talk to him now because the DE's were closing on him, but he stuck to the route and I thanked Tunaare for the man's courage. As the DE's came close behind I concentrated on the essence of the air and the air where they wuld be silently encanting the words to invoke lightning the air grew charged and as I finished the DE's crossed into the air as two Flashes of light lit up the sky and struck the elves to the ground. One did not rise, as the inevitable thunderous explosion rocked the silence of the night.<br>
<br>
    The other rose and limped toward me with a confidence in his eye's that frightened me for in those eyes I knew he was hurt but I aslo knew that he was very skilled at what he did. As he approached me I panicked a little because I knew he was my better. I casted root and snare, but to no effect his steady unyeilding gait kept coming torwards me.<br>
    The ensuing battle was the a fight for my survival as my sword rang against his and my whip utterly useless for he had cut it in half when I had meant to trip him. Steel clashed against steel and I was growing fatigued yet he seemed only to become more aggressive, I felt a slash upon my shoulder and fell to my knee's here it would end. and as the Shadow Knight brought his sword forward at my head a look of shock suddendly bloomed on his face and he fell next to me silent. Looking at his back there was an arrow shaft, almost expertly shot that probably tipped the heart as it went through the unguarded are of his back, causing the heart to burst. I looked up and there was Cogito...<br>
   &quot; Friend my debt is paid, you saved me for I would have never made freeport, and thus I have returned the favor.&quot; His eye's narrowed,<br>
   &quot; You are Sphere are you not?&quot;<br>
   &quot; Aye that I am brother.&quot;<br>
   &quot; Luck could not be that kind, are you an officer brother of the forest?&quot;<br>
   &quot;Alas, I am not, Maychance I can yet help you.&quot; He pulled out a note and showed it to me and ass I read it, my heart saddened for it implied of things I did not want to acknowledge.<br>
   &quot;Cogito surely you are not the single bearer of this message?&quot;<br>
   &quot;No their is one other though he is probably in more danger then I for he has no help that I know of.&quot;<br>
   &quot; Let us copy this letter then and I too will bear it to where it needs go.&quot;<br>
   &quot; That's an excellent idea brother of the forest.&quot;<br>
and so we copied the notes as I bid him good bye I was floundering through the DE corpses and called out to him to wait. <br>
   &quot; I know not well enough the lit of the DE tounge to read these letters perhaps you...&quot; I let the question hang in the air.<br>
   &quot; Nor I sire.&quot;<br>
   &quot; The assains had these letters on them they probably contain information that would be helpful to Phreezin or Rhaps, surely they can find someone to cipher the lit well enough to maybe give them an advantage over their situation.&quot; <br>
   &quot; Carry this with you also, it may be of great import.&quot;<br>
 Thus we parted our ways and went seperately, at least now I thought their is a messenger they don't know about and hopefully all 3 of us survive this role fate has cast us in.<br>
<br>
<br>
       Love and Hugs to all,<br>
       Sheldone Brother of the forest, <br>
       and Ranger of the 23rd circle of Surefall. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uvaljeanesbdk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valjeanesbdk</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Brother of the Sphere</span><br>  Posts: 153<br> <font color=#330000>(1/3/02 4:07 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=26>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: The larger Scheme</span><hr size=1> <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :) --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/smile.gif ALT=":)"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END-->   thx for continuing the tale friend, but Cogito is a erudite wizard and the note was written by Khaldorn.

Another wash of pain, and this time a moan escapes his bloody lips as he passes out. <br>

&quot;you take my mount&quot; Zealen says to the young DE &quot;and bring the barb to the castle. Then have them send 2 platoons. We must catch his companions before they can alert the Sphere. We dont know what they know and they might ruin the masters plan.&quot;<br>

Thus to protect her dearest friends.  She also calls on the spirits to put up their own guard against fell magic.<br>
 &quot;I'm am going to scout the area for other assasins.  Rhapsodey I think you need to read this missive i recieved from your mother yesterday.  Something is not right here.  Your mother doesn't tlak or write this way as far as I can remeber.  Mayby you can find out what is wronge.   I am also sending a spirit message to ALL the shamans of the northern tribes.  They must be warned.&quot; Reoki states.<br>
<br>
&quot;Oh my faithfull hounds I need you run fast and hard.  Go to all the shamans you can find.  My people must be warned.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
Reoki then gathers several days provisions, and a few brave warriors.<br>
&quot;We will not let you go alone Wisewoman Reoki.  Take us with you or we will tie you up and go ourselves.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok. Ok. You can go.&quot; Reoki sighs.  &quot; We are heading towards the druid rings in the North Karana's.  I'm hoping to find out if that is the way our lovely friends, Donal's assasins, have been getting in to this area of the world.  I am also hoping to find more druids who are sympathetic towards our cause.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Reoki and her men staart moving.  After a day's travel she reaches the druid ring.  She thinks she see some one she recognizes......<br>
.... Canute finally reaches the druid ring in Northern Karana, after escaping just barely from assasins several times.  He has not even stoped for feaar for them catching him while he slept.  His reserves are running down.   Wait.  There is some thing coming up to me, he thinks.  It's not a person.  Here let me hide here in this bush.<br>
    Whuff. Whuff. Snort.    <br>
  Uch. Its a Big stag hound.  <br>
Quietly in his mind, &quot;Hello there little two legged brother.&quot;<br>
Canute &quot;??????  Are you a great spirit????&quot;<br>
&quot;Hummph.  You can not even tell what I am.  You need much more training little brother.  But enough of that we need you as you are for we need all the help we can get.  There is much danger for our people and for the Sphere of Honour.&quot; the staghound states.<br>
&quot;Yes, Phreezin is in mortal danger.  There are assasins after him.  Kladorn fought off several so me and Cogito could get our message to an officer of Sphere.  Do you know where thereid an officerthat I can givce this vital infromation to?&quot; Canute pleads.<br>
&quot;Yes little brother I do.  Wisewoman Reoki is on her way here.&quot;........<br>
........In Reoki's mind one of her staghounds send a message that he has found Canute who is in grave trouble and may have some clues as to what is happening, and that he is here at the druid ring hiding.<br>
Reoki starts to rush to find Canute,  Her guards following in her wake.<br>
&quot;Canute!  Canute! Where are you Canute?  It's Reoki.&quot;<br>
Standing up   canute calls, &quot;Over here.&quot;<br>
&quot;I am so glad to see you Reoki.  Here this is from Khaldorn.  I do not kow if he is still alive.  He had to fend off a couple of dark elven assasins.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ok, lets head back to the village.  YOu  look worn out and I can guarantee that there will be hot food and a warm bed back there for you.  Do you  think you can last that long?&quot;<br>
&quot;I'll try Reoki.&quot;<br>
Reoki casts several spells to hurry her band on its way.  They get to the village in less than a day with her spells helping them.<br>
&quot;Rhaps. Phreezin.  Look what we found.  Canute here was at the druid rings.  He has a special message from Khaldorn that I think you both need to read.&quot;<br>
&quot;This conferms some of my fears.&quot; Rhapsodey says. &quot;'m fully recovered now and I need to go find out some info by myself.  I know you wwwant to protect me dear but this I must do on my own.  What I need from you and Reoki is for you to start gathering our guild and calling in all of the favors we are owed and start a force heading to Kelithin.  The quicker you do this the quicker our fight will be resolved.  I love you both dearly.  Please lets get this stopped before your people are harmed more than they already have been.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Ok, we will see you soon rhapsodey.&quot;<br>
&quot; Love I do not wnat you to go alone but I understand you will be able to get info we cannot get.  Just be carefull.&quot;Phreezin says.<br>
<br>
At this they all gather their provisions and belongings and head their seperate ways to fullfill what destiny hass in store for them.<br>

Fearing the dangers that lie beyond the safety of the huge stone pillars he stays as close to the grand structure and the nearby guards as possible. His magical art is getting stronger but he is still too weak to attempt any serious battles. Too many times has he attempted to slay a Pincer Beetle only to have to run to a group of stronger adventurers waiting for a teleport to Luclin or another far off land or to the stone bridge and the safety of the guards to save him.<br>
<br>
As he practiced his skills a bard approaches him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Art thou named Iaein?&quot;, he asked.<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I have a message for thee&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you good minstrel&quot;. He handed the minstrel a gold piece for his troubles and before he could even thank him, the minstel was out of sight. &quot;Must be amazing to be able to travel at such speeds&quot;, he thought to himself.<br>
<br>
He broke the seal on the parchment and began reading.....<br>
<br>
&quot;My brother Iaein. I hope this letter finds you well. My journeys have been interesting and I have seen many wonderous things. I have missed you and my homeland very much. <br>
<br>
I am writing this letter as I have heard that there have been some disturbing events happenning in Norrath. I am hoping you can give me some information about them. I hear that the Sphere of Honour is in danger and that some of the members have been attacked or killed. I hope this is not so. Things seemed so peaceful when I left. I need to know exactly what has occurred and who is responsible. Rumor has it that Rhapsodey for one has been injured or killed. I need to know if she is safe. I also have heard that it is her royal family that is the source of all the conflict. If it is true that danger is about, I shall journey back and help Sphere become victorious against this tyrant. We will amass as great an army as we have ever had and destroy any that threaten the guild.<br>
<br>
Please get word back to me as soon as you can. I will send a messenger to you at nightfall with a response.<br>
<br>
Be safe my brother. <br>
<br>
With love and honour,<br>
Your brother &quot;<br>
<br>
Iaein wipes the tears from his eyes. It seems forever since he had heard from his brother and is very happy to know that he is alive and well. He can only wonder what adventures his brother has seen and can hardly wait until he can hear more about it. But his task is clear. He must seek out somone in Sphere of Honour and find out if these rumors are true.<br>
<br>
Iaein folds the parchment up and puts it in his backpack, a gift from his brother. He eagerly searches for a druid that can give him sow. Finding one in the middle of the teleport structure he heads to South Karana, a place he has seen many members of the Sphere in recent times. Being an enchanter of the 9th circle his journey is not without peril. He heads to South Karana and the Aviak Village that he has seen Sphere members fighting in.<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall be safe enough with Sow I am sure&quot;<br>
<br>
Iaein heads for South Karana......<br>

The Dark elf Traveling at night and being near oger and  troll allys has not been covering his tracks well and unbeknow to him has gained a tail.  Or rather a pair of tails.  2 Black wolves follow along behind him quietly totaly silent in their movements.  Suddenly one of the wolves breaks off and runs ahead of the de and his prisoner.  A few minutes later a Female dark elf warrior steps out in front of the De and his prisoner.   &quot;Halt  stand and be recognized.  I am Zalor responds the young dark Elf I bring a prisoner for the master and a request for Reinforcements from Platoon leader Zealen so stand aside and let me pass.  As he attempts to ride pass the Female dark elf guard she reaches out and takes the bridal of the mount.  I cannot let you pass till I see the signet that master orders you know this.   He sighs in frustration and turns and gets the signet from his belt pouch.  As he turns back he gasps in suprise and Pain as a War Arrow impacts with his chest passing straight through his body and impacts with the Tree behind him with a thunk.<br>
<br>
As his Lifeless body falls from the mount the female dark elf warror jumps back with an oath.  As she turns drawing her weapon an arrow takes her through the leg the heavy war arrow head breaking her leg and the pain causing her to pass out.  A female Barbarian warrior step from behind a tree Heavy war bow in hand.  Weapons protruding around her like a halo.  She slow and carefully walks forward arrow noked ready to fire another shot.  Kicking the weapons  away from the dark elves.  As the Black wolf comes up from Behind.  She looks up as it aproaches.  She speaks to the wolf.  &quot;YOu were Right Jaelynn  their are dark elves here for me to kill.  I see they have captured one of my Brother can you return him home for me while I go see what thes dark skined scum bags are up to.&quot;  The wolves speaks.  &quot;what do you intend to do with her Maith?&quot;  Nothing much Jaey im going to wake her up and ask her a few questions then im going to add her pretty white hair to my collection of dark elf scalps.  The normal for me since that day so long ago that you saved me from them:&quot;  Jaey shakes her head.  &quot;Maybee  I shouldnt of asked&quot; says Jaey as she and Khaldorn and the mount disapear to surefall Glade.<br>

<br>
“What are your plans, Dark elf, why were you  holding one of my brothers captive”<br>
<br>
Her attention on the Dark elf in front of her she does not notice the pouch Zalor’s  belt open up and a ring myteriously rises out of it before it vanishes.  <br>
<br>
“why should I tell you anything barbarian,?” the wounded dark elf gasps out. “ You could not understand it anyways, as limited as your brain is”.  With that the Dark elf Spat in Maith’s face.<br>
<br>
With a growl Maith pulls a knife from her belt and places the blade at the Dark Elf’s throat.  “ oh you will talk Scum, believe me before Im done you will talk..” <br>
<br>
Just then the sound of chanting reaches her ears,  A spellcaster.  Before she could recact the earth beneath her feet surges upwards and holds entraps her legs.  As she struggles against the spell she hears another spell start up.  As Maith turned her body to look in that direction, the spell ended and a burst of pure force slammed into her captive and sent her flying out of Maith’s grasp and into a tree.  The Dark elf slumps bonelessly to the ground her body crushed by the force of the spell and the impact with the tree.  <br>
<br>
Maith finally gets turned enough to see another dark elf standing some distance away.  She is dressed in leather armor, and wielding a staff and a strangly glowing shield.  <br>
<br>
“Its nothing personal Barbarian,  she had nothing more to tell you I just saved you the trouble of killing you.”<br>
<br>
Maith readies her warbow and is able to twist her upper body enough to get off a shot.  The arrow shoots towards the dark elf and shatters upon striking her torso.<br>
<br>
“That was pointless” the dark elf says “did you truly think I would reveal myself without bringing up my defenses? After all your reputation preceeds you.  Still I guess its no point in talking to you any further so I will take my leave.  Don’t worry the root spell will wear off in a few minutes.”<br>
<br>
With that the dark elf steps behind a tree and moments later there is the flash of  a teleportation spell being activated.  <br>
<br>
Maith curses.<br>
<br>
Far away from rathe mountains in a secluded vale on the continent of Kunark, the Dark appears.  She then moves away from the mighty combine structure so she can have a little privacy.  <br>
<br>
Pulling the ring she lifted from Zalor she peers at it intensly.  “Hmm”.she muses aloud “I don’t recognize this signet.  It does not match any used by either the great houses or by the dead.  If there is a new faction rising in Neriak then I should inform the master at the tower if the Spurned.” <br>
<br>
She goes to put the ring in her pocket and stops. “ and yet it this group is targeting the Sphere, then there is another I should inform,  If her money is good that is”<br>
<br>
She laughs softly  and calling once again her powers, Fades from view.<br>

A feeling that I couldn't shake. A feeling that chilled my insides.<br>
<br>
Rising to my feet, I approached Tunare with the fear of a young girl approaching her old and wise teacher. &quot;What is this dread I feel, oh wise one?&quot; I asked. Tunare motioned and her most wisest druid stepped forth. Together they clasped hands and as they pulled thier hands apart a swirling mist enveloped my vision. Time seemed to stand still, as visions of happenings on the mortal plane of Norrath came into view. My friends...no my family was in danger against my own...*tears welled up* my own homeland of Kelethin. <br>
<br>
&quot;I must leave from the Plane of Growth oh mighty Tunare&quot;, I spoke firmly. &quot;My family is in need!&quot; As I turned to go, I had another vision....one of a Dark Elf looking at a ring in wonder.

Ruddy Torchlight flickers and casts shadows around a small round room.  There are windows in the room that revealing not the sun and the sky but a ceiling of Dark stone.  A circular table with a few chairs took up the middle of the room, and in the Center of the table a small crystal Globe set on a pile of cushions.   An Elderly Teir'Dal sat in one of the Chairs gazing down upon the globe which was currently giving off a pale blue glow the face of a certain Teir’Dal Wizard can be seen in the globe.<br>
<br>
“ and so that is all I know” <br>
<br>
 The elderly Teir’Dal spoke “It is good that you brought this to my attention my child.  If there is a plot in motion by and unknown agent then we should do our best to make sure we are prepared in case some tries to involve in it without our knowledge.  I will make sure you are rewarded when the time come.”<br>
<br>
“Thank you Elder”, said the Wizard<br>
<br>
 “As for the signet ring I think you should send It to me so we at the tower can start our investigation”<br>
<br>
“Aye Elder I am sending it through now”<br>
<br>
The sphere glows a bit brighter as a globe of light detaches itself and floats down to the table.  The light vanished to reveal the ring.<br>
<br>
“Thank you my child.  Now we will handle the investigation from here.  Forget about what you saw in the Mountains of Rathe and speak of this to no one.  Do you understand?”<br>
<br>
“Yes Elder I understand”<br>
<br>
“Good I will contact you again if I need you for anything.” the Teir”dal waves his hand as the connection is cut off, the globe dims and then goes out.   As he reaches down to pick up the ring a voice comes from the shadows.<br>
<br>
“Do you think she suspects?”<br>
<br>
“No I don’t think so” the elder says, as his features melt away revealing a much younger elf.  “She has been gone for many years, why should she suspect that her teacher has been removed from his position.”<br>
<br>
“It was still a risk to do in the old master”<br>
<br>
“A risk that needed to be taken, the old one was too “noble” for his own good.”  The imposter sneers “ he could have caused problems. “<br>
<br>
“However”, he muses “I think we should keep an eye on his protégé I’m not sure some of his bad traits did not rub of on her.  We must make sure she does not talk.  Assign some men to follow here and if she tries to talk about this to anyone have them kill her immediatley”<br>
<br>
“It will be done” with that a figure in the back of the room turns and leaves.<br>

&quot;I have been sent to find out what has been happenning in The Sphere. I hear there have been dangers about.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Aye, tis true. These are dark times for The Sphere. Rhapsodey was almost killed and others have been injured as well. I am not sure exactly what is happenning. At first, it seemed like there was a disagreement between Rhapsodey and her royal parents, however, things seem to be much deeper than that. Others are now seeming to be involved. I fear that The Sphere may be a target but I am not sure by whom. We have no enemies that I know of and we have always been kind and helpful.&quot;<br>

&quot;Let them just try. I have been readying myself in the event of any foul play. I have not been attacked but I do sense something. Sometimes I feel like I am being watched. However if someone does wish to meet my blade, I am surely ready. Thou art a bit young to be out this far. You came here just to find me?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I was sent to seek out any Sphere members that can confirm what has been happenning. It appears that these rumors are true and I must get word out quickly&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Sent? By whom?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I can't say right now, but I am sure you will know soon. I can assure you that help will be on its way as soon as I send my message.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thou art being a bit mysterious, but you do seem kind and trusting. Is there anything I can help you with?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, thank you M'lady. I must journey back to North Karana. A messenger is coming at nightfall and I must hurry back to meet him. Might I get a Sow from you and possibly invisibility? This is a dangerous area and it will make my journey much safer.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will do better than that.&quot; Lyena casts a spell and Iaeain is given the Spirit of the Wolf. Then she casts another and the two disappear. As the two vanish a dark elf appears, obviously he had been invisible and was listening to their conversation.<br>
<br>
&quot;So, someone wants to help the Sphere. Those fools have no idea of the danger they are in&quot; His sinister laugh can be heard all over the Aviak Village. &quot;Soon they will learn just how grave their situation is, very soon. But still I must get to North Karana and find out who this person is.&quot; He calls to his companion who was waiting nearby. Come my speedy friend. We must away to North Karana&quot; As his companion starts singing the two disappear in a flash of blue light.<br>

<br>
&quot;Well here you are my young enchanter friend. A bit faster than SOW wouldn't you say?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes it is, lots faster. And since nighttime is almost here I will have just enough time to write my message before the messenger arrives.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Where are you supposed to meet the messenger?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;At the Wizard Teleport. That is where he first gave me the original message. I was told in that note that he would return later that night for my response&quot;<br>
<br>
As Iaein finished speaking a black wolf started towards him.<br>
<br>
&quot;LOOK OUT&quot;, Lyena said, &quot;If he attacks you the druids and treants will most surely kill you!&quot;<br>
<br>
Since Iaein had had SOW cast upon him he was able to quickly run away before the wolf could attack him. He started running west and Lyena quickly followed him. Once he was safely away from the ring he stopped and started to cast a spell. It was a spell that he had always kept memorized as it had saved him many times in the past. Iaeain casted his spell on the approaching wolf. As soon as the spell was cast the wolf started walking away, completely ignoring his previous prey.<br>
<br>
&quot;I can only assume that was the mum blur spell&quot;, Lyena said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes M'lady. I knew you did not want to harm an animal and neither did I. The easiest way to prevent a conflict was to wipe the animal's memory. Now I need to hurry to the guards at the stone bridge. That is the safest place for me to write my message and close to where the messenger is supposed to meet me.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I would like to go with you and make sure you are safe.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Thank you M'lady. You are very kind and I would enjoy your escort&quot;<br>
<br>
The two head for the North Karana bridge.<br>
<br>
Back in South Karana, the dark elf and bard are nearing the South Karana bridge. <br>
<br>
&quot;Quickly my friend. We must get to North Karana and find out who this person is. We do not need any intruders helping The Sphere. Anyone who tries will share the same fate.&quot;, the dark elf exclaimed.<br>
<br>
&quot;We are almost there now Sir. I can see the bridge ahead.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As soon as we hit the border of North Karana play the invisibility song. I do not wish to be noticed.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;As you wish Sir. I will do it now.&quot; As the bard starts playing his song the two fade away. They cross into North Karana just as they notice Iaein and Lyena approaching the bridge.<br>
<br>
Iaein sits down and scribes the message. When he is finished he rolls it up and seals it.<br>
<br>
&quot;Come, we must be at the wizard portal when he arrives. He is due here anytime now.&quot; Iaein pauses to admire the beautiful North Karana sunset and then hurries to the pillars. Lyena follows him not noticing that they are not alone.<br>
<br>
When they get to the bridge they notice a very fast bard approaching from the West.<br>
<br>
&quot;Is this him? He certainly looks like a messenger.&quot;, Lyena said.<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes it is. He is the same one that gave me the first message.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Hail Iaein. I was told to get a message from you. Dost thou have one to send?&quot;<br>
<br>
Iaein gives the message to the bard. &quot;Aye, please deliver this as fast as you can&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall Sire. Oh and no payment is necessary. I have been already paid to deliver this message. Good day Sire and M'lady&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Follow him&quot;, whispered the dark elf to the bard. &quot;I want to know where he is headed&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Yes Sir&quot;, the bard replied.<br>
<br>
As the messenger runs off, the dark elf and bard follow him.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well Iaein&quot;, Lyena said, &quot;your message is on its way. Do you need any further assistance?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I could use some buffs and another Sow if you don't mind&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Not at all. It will be my pleasure&quot; Lyena casts the spells on Iaein. &quot;Now I must head back to my guild. I need to find out if anything else is happenning. I will return here soon to see if you have any news. Be well Iaein.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fare thee well M'lady. Thank you for all your help. I hope I will be able to help you sometime.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Was my pleasure and as soon as you can cast Breeze, I will most certainly take you up on that offer. Oh, we have not properly met. My name is Lyena and I am at your service if you should ever need help. Was good meeting you. I shall see you soon.&quot; Lyena casts a spell and vanishes.<br>
<br>
&quot;It must be wonderful to be able to teleport like that. I am sure it beats walking. Hmmm, I better stay close to the bridge in case my brother needs my further&quot;, he thinks to himself. &quot;I hope everything will be ok&quot;<br>
<br>
Iaein returns to practicing his spells. &quot;I wonder if I can become a member of The Sphere of Honour someday. That would really be something. I will have to ask Lyena about it when I see her again.&quot;<br>

from his wounds and the evil poisons from dark elf weapons.<br>
He remembers that Reoki.... a great shaman and a member of the Sphere briefly stopped by. During the brief visit Reoki had used some powerful curative spells on him, thus probably saving his life. The fever has lost its grip on him and he is quickly returning to his former strength. <br>
He has gotten a few lessons in dark elf, and the conversation he overheard part of in Rathe Mntns is making more sense to him now.<br>
Apparently the secret master of the dark elves he encountered, has succeded in conjuring a mind-controlling item which bears close resemblance to the crown belonging to the elven king.<br>
Whether this item controls the king or Donal or even both is unknown.<br>
Khaldorn is also convinced that the conflict between Phreezin and Donal is not without some influence from this item. Whether the reason is to make the Sphere fight among themselves or whether it is targeted at Phreezin for some reason, Khaldorn can only speculate. <br>
This more comprehensive record of his experience has been written down and copied, and sent to all leaders and officers of the Sphere. <br>
As Khaldorn sits there...quietly thinking all the events through, Canute storms into the room. <br>
&quot;Khaldorn. Khaldorn you must pack you things and get ready for travel.&quot; Canute almost shouts.<br>
&quot;What?!?! why?!!?&quot; Khaldorn answer, already heeding the shamans request.<br>
&quot;The..the elven king has outlawed all members of the Sphere. And he will also outlaw any friends of the Sphere.&quot; Canute states, looking as if he havent realised the graveness of the news till now.<br>
&quot;Hes has put a bounty on the heads of all Sphere members, and has already assembled a small army to send against us.&quot;<br>
&quot;His reasons are that we kidnap and corrupt people, and the daughter of Donal being one of them. There are other mad accusations, but I dont remember them right now.&quot;<br>
&quot;We are to travel to freeport and meet with other Sphere members. <br>
We can only trust other Sphere members right now, anyone else is a potential enemy. Many will hunt us for the bounty.&quot;<br>
Having now gathered all his belongings, Khaldorn follows Canute outside. The two set off for Freeport.<br>
Many eyes following them..... <br>

<br>
A messenger enters and approaches Donal Kneeling before him.  My Lord I bring messages pertaining to your Daughter,  Your agents have lost her in the plains of South Karanna near the paw camps.  They Believe that she may have been killed by the paw gnolls and her body eaten.<br>
<br>
Donal:  WHAT.  Send a unit of loyal rangers to search for her  body immediately.  They are not  to return without proof of her death.<br>
<br>
the Messenger leaves quickly with his new mission.<br>
<br>
Seconds later.  as a shadow detaches from the wall and Donal stares blindly at the door that the messenger just left buy.  <br>
<br>
Shadow:&quot; Humm this could present a problem if  that stupid  child got herself killed  by the Gnolls and we cannot recover the body.  This will severally hampers are efforts to bring the High Elf Prince under our sway.  Hummm Mazak have several of agents begin a search through  the local villages for a girl that closely matches the Donal Child we may have to preceded to an alternate plan.<br>
<br>
A warrior Dark Elf appears before Donal:<br>
Mazak:  But Dread Lord wont the High Elf Enchanters notice this when they test her to see if she is actually Donals daughter.  My understanding was that this would only work with the actual child.&quot;   <br>
<br>
Shadow:&quot;  yes we will have to find someway around this situation.  At this time put all effort to finding her and finding a possible replacement&quot;<br>
<br>
Mazak:  Yes Dread Lord you wish will be completed or we will Die Trying.<br>
Mazak quickly departs from the audience chamber<br>
<br>
<br>
Shadow turning to the immobile Donal:  Well my puppet what is your Daughter doing.  I have a hard time believing after all the things she has already done that she would fall to simple Paw Gnolls.  HUMMMMMM  she is much more  resourcefully than any of my advisor could have envisioned.  I will definatly have to break her myself.  This will be fun forming her to my will.<br>
<br>
The Shadow paces back and  Forth before Donals unseeing eyes.<br>
<br>
Shadow:  Enough I think I will go speak to your wife I may be able to get some useful info from her.  <br>
<br>
With that the Shadow leaves through a hidden side door Leaving Donal sitting in his chair.<br>
<br>
A silent tear forms at the  corner of Donals eye and runs down his immobile face<br>

<br>
A lone Female Dark Elf stands silently hidden in the Shadows watching the comming and going of the Mansion.  Her Dark blue eyes not missing a thing not even the comming and goings of the Dark elves who are hidden by Invisibility spells.  <br>
<br>
Her Keen magical senses detect the opening of a gate near her location as she turns to look around she suddenly gasps as she doubles over Wrapping her arms around her stomach in pain.  She  quickly reaches into one of her pouches and pulls out a bottle with shakcing hands she opens the vial  and quickly drinks its contents.  Having no more than finished the contents of the bottle her senses detect motion comming from the forest.  As she watches a specter ghost quietly from behind a tree and glides over her silently.  Her skin raising in goose bumps at the close proximety of the specter.  Shortly after the first one passes more of them appear in the forest moving toward the mansion.  By the time the last one has passed she has counted 40 specters moving into the Mansion.  As she watches the last one pass through the mansion walls the pain her stomach passes and she quickly stands and moves off into the forest.<br>
<br>
Shortly she arrives at her destination a small  cave hidden in the side of a hill behind some ancient oak trees.  With the knowledge of some one who has been here before she careful climbs into the small cave avoiding  the traps that have been set within the cave.  She crawls back into the cave to a small camp set within.  STanding she takes a pen parchement and an ink well from the bag placed against the wall.  She carefully pens the words,&quot; The enemy has come as you expected.  The Heartsinger family is no more the last living member will die shortly at my hands.  We live for the one we die for the Honour of our king. May the Goddess protect us in our Mission&quot;  After completing the Message she rolls it carefully and places it in a metal tube.  Turning she takes a messnger Falcon from a perch and secures the message to his leg. Walking to the smoke vent in the ceiling of the cave she removes the hood from the Falcon and tosses him through the hole with the command to go home.  <br>
<br>
This done she turns to her bags and begins to unpack the making of a meal.  Knowing that if she fail and is discovered before everything is in place that this may be the last meal she may ever eat.<br>
