She was alone, for the moment. Ebos had some matters to attend to at the bank and told her to go on without him. If he missed the boat, he would meet her in Butcherblock Mountains. Alleusion was absolutely thrilled with Ebos's new spells. For with these spells, he could transport himself to almost anywhere in Norrath. Unfortunately, it wouldn't be until he reached his eighth circle that she could travel with him. So until that time, she was stuck with waiting for the boat.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There was a gentle wind blowing by the water this evening. The sun was setting off into the west, leaving the sky a deep red color. The sound of the waves were relaxing Alleusion into a deep state of meditation. Her eyes closed, deep within her thoughts, she didn't hear the footsteps coming from behind.  Alleusion sensed, rather then felt the person sit down beside her.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alleusion,&quot; came a female voice. Alleusion opened her eyes and turned, sitting beside her was her half-elf friend Dinasya. &quot;How can you sit there so calmly?,&quot; Dinasya asked. &quot;It's so noisy here that I can't get my thoughts together. If I can't get my thoughts together, I'm never going to regain my mana for the trip back to the Lake.&quot; Stress and worry etched the pretty half-elf's face. She had a reason to be concerned, for the river path to the Lake of Ill Omen was filled with dangerous and deadly spiders.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Suddenly, Dinasya's eyes widened. &quot;Alleusion,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;what happened to your hair?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Self-consciously, Alleusion's hand went to her hair, still worn in the same high ponytail it always was, except now, it was pure white. &quot;Oh, the color?&quot; Alleusion laughed. &quot;Funny story actually. I think I had the color scared out of it, Dina. But it's a long story, are you sure you want to hear it?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp At her friend's nod, Alleusion began her story......<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;I had been convinced by a friend of mine to go with her on an exploring mission. We had just heard of the new lands on Luclin and she wanted to check them out, but she didn't want to go alone. So, we went to the wizard spires in Northern Karana, and along with a handful of other brave adventurers, teleported to a place called The Nexus.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp From there, we went to Shadow Haven. Oh Dina, that is one full city. I could barely move there. I kept looking around and around. There was so much to see and do. My friend Qana kept turning around and begging me to hurry up. After leaving Shadow Haven, we went through some caverns and came out to a beautiful, lush, and grassy moor. I was told it was called Hollwshade Moor.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Well, Qana led me along to a camp of some sort. Who knew that the little grey men I was standing next to could see me. Qana had turned me invisible before leaving the caverns, so I thought that they couldn't see. Well, I was rushed by the entire camp and next thing you know, I popped up at the Lake, stark naked and hungry. I could feel Qana laughing as she told me to hang on, that I would get my clothes in a second. Then, just as quickly as I had appeared at the lake, I was back up on the moon. Qana had a dwarf standing next to her. Cute little thing she was, standing there all in shiny purple armor. Her hair was as white as mine. She told me her name was Syllie and that sometimes, some people's hair turns white with their first resurrection.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;And that's it?&quot; asked Dinasya, eyes wide. &quot;So when I get resurrected, my hair could turn white too? What about Ebos? Does he know your hair is white?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked at her friend, &quot;Of course he knows. Oh he had a good laugh at me when he saw me for the first time, but I got him back. Why do you think his beard is white? I had a good laugh at him over that one. Serves him right for laughing at me.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The two friends fell silent for a while. Dinasya still struggled to gather her thoughts, her frustration mounting. With a loud bang, she slammed her spell book shut. &quot;ARGH!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I will never be able to get my mana back!&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion looked up, stared hard at Dinasya for a second, and in an instant a change came over the young half-elf. Her eyes lost their stressed look, and she relaxed. &quot;Wow, what did you do to me Alle?&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Just a little something to help you think. It doesn't last forever though, but whenever you see me, I'll give you some more.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;A girl could get used to a thing like this.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Once again, silence fell. This time however, it was a calm silence, each girl lost in her own thoughts. Alleusion was thinking about Ebos, as always. The halfling friend that she had joined up with in the beginning had become so much more to her. They hardly ever went anywhere separately. Where you saw one, there was the other. Alleusion wondered what could be taking Ebos so long at the bank, when another voice startled her out of her thoughts.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;Alleusion,&quot; came the voice. She looked up from her book and saw a young man she knew, a wood-elf named Kattn. &quot;Ebos asked me to take you to him.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &quot;But, Kattn, I'm supposed to meet here. Although,&quot; she trailed off as she saw the boat in the distance, &quot;something tells me he's not going to make the boat.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Kattn held out his hand to help Alleusion stand up. &quot;Please, Alle, come with me, he wants to surprise you.&quot; He turned to Dinasya, &quot;You too Dina, you should come witness this.&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Mystified, both girls stood close to Kattn, as he opened a portal. Through the other side, Alleusion could see the walls of the druid training hall in Surefall Glade. Before she had a chance to question Kattn, she was pulled into the portal. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp When Dinasya and Kattn arrived next to her, Alleusion turned on Kattn. Questions warred with the scolding she wanted to give Kattn, but she couldn't think of the words. There, standing behind Kattn, was Ebos. At the sight of her friend, a peace filled her, overflowing to him, as she felt herself join with the spirit of a wolf. It was a ritual they went through whenever they saw each other, and this time was no different. <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Ebos took her hand and spoke one word, &quot;Follow&quot;, and began to walk. They walked along the water edge until they came to a roaring waterfall. Ebos reached into his pocket, and placed a small, cool object in Alleusion's hand, closing her fingers around it. She started to open her hand, but he stopped her. &quot;Wait, listen to wait I have to say.&quot; At Alleusion's nod, he began, &quot;Alleusion, we have been together since you left home,&quot; seeing the pain in her eyes that the memory his words evoked, he paused, &quot;as we gained experiences and circles, we have always been together. We began as strangers, then friends, and now, I hope, so much more.&quot; He stepped back and watched as Alleusion opened her hand.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Her eyes flew to his as she realized what she held. &quot;Ebos, this is a wedding ring,&quot; she whispered.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Drawing in a deep breath, looking up at her, eyes filled with uncertainty, he said, &quot;I know. Alleusion, I want...I want to...,&quot; faltering, he paused, not sure of what to say.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alleusion's face brightened, she looked down, then looked away. He wasn't sure what she was thinking, and it was killing him, this not knowing. &quot;If you don't want to,&quot; he began, &quot;I...&quot;<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Eyes flashing she turned on him, &quot;Don't you dare for one minute begin to know what I want. I have wanted this for a long time. I was wondering when you were going to ask me...&quot; Alleusion's voice trailed off as she took in the shock on Ebos's face. Once again, it seemed they could read each other's thoughts.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Alle, came a voice inside her head, please...I'm begging you...marry me.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Looking down at the ground, her cheeks pink, eyes bright with tears, she answered him back, Yes, Ebos, I will.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And with those unspoken words, they joined hands, and hearts, and lives. Standing back, unnoticed, were Kattn and Dinasya, the only witnesses to their joining. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#989dca><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/blormani79848.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=ebos1>Ebos1</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Lor Mani Friend</span><br>  Posts: 1<br> <font color=#333333>(1/21/02 9:16:28 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/flormani79848frm9.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=6.topic&index=1>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: The next step</span><hr size=1> &lt;sniff&gt; oh, how i love this story!!    <!--EZCODE EMOTICON START :D --><img src=http://www.ezboard.com/intl/aenglish/images/emoticons/happy.gif ALT=":D"><!--EZCODE EMOTICON END--> <br>
