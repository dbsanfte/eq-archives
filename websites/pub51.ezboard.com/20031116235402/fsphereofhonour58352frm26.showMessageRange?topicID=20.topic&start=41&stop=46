In this form of the Great Wolf, I could travel faster than any man and outpace even the foul Orcs that surrounded my home among the ancient old growth trees. In only a matter of minutes, I would be at the fork in the road that would lead me to my king where my pride would not stand in my way of begging for the release against my guild. <br>
<br>
Looking down I realized that I had stopped my running. Lost deep in thought, the realization that I had not made a left toward Kelethin but rather a right toward the heart of the Orc outpost known as Crushbone sunk in. I stopped suddenly smelling the foul air of the Orcs around me and seeing the torchs which light the entrance of Crushbone not to far off in the distance. My tail swished from side to side as I began to think that perhaps it wasn't a mistake that I had come to Crushbone... if I was able to convince the Orcs to withdraw the constant assults on Kelethin then I'd be able to gain more trust with my lord the King and in exchange for this 'favor' he would put an end to this Sphere 'hatred' once and for all. After all the Orcs have been a constant thorn in the eleven community for generations. My Orcish is rusty and Emperor Crush is not known for his diplomatic nature but still I shall try. <br>
<br>
With a renewed sense of purpose I casted my Superior Camo and headed directly into the enemies belly...in search of Emperor Crushbone. <p><center><select>

<br>
&quot;We are in luck. He seems to be slowing down&quot;, the dark elf said, &quot;Catch up to him.&quot;<br>
<br>
The two easily catch the now stopped bard.<br>
<br>
&quot;Greetings my friend. Could you please tell us how to get to Kerra Island? We were told to head west, but I am not sure exactly where we need to go.&quot;, the bard asked the messenger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Surely, all you need to do is continue West to Qeynos. Then take the boat directly to Kerra Isle.&quot;<br>
<br>
As the bard went over the directions with the messenger, the dark elf snuck behind him and struck him, renderring him unconcious.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's bring him to a secluded place where we can question him a bit.&quot;<br>
<br>
They brought the messenger to a remote area of the West Karana forest and tied him securely to a tree. He was awakened to a very painful blood boil spell. He screamed in agony.<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, look who is awake. We are sorry for the inconvenience, but you have some information that we require.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I know nothing. I am just a messenger.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;We know this. What we want to know is where you are headed with this message and whom it is meant for?&quot;<br>
<br>
The messenger makes no response. <br>
<br>
&quot;Look, you will tell us what we want to know or the torture will be severe. Tell us what we want to know and you will be released unharmed. You have my word.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I will tell you nothing, so you are wasting your time.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't understand why you would risk your life for another, but it is no matter. I will give you one more chance. Where are you headed?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I shall never tell you&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Fine, have it your way.&quot; With that the Dark Elf casted another spell, this one weakened the messenger. This was followed by yet another blood boil spell. The messenger screamed even louder as he felt his life being drained away by the powerful spell.<br>
<br>
&quot;Ppplease, have mercy. No more.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Tell me then, where are you headed?&quot;<br>
<br>
His life almost gone, and barely concious the messenger said, &quot;I amm headded for Surefall. Please leaave me alone&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;See, was that so hard? Who are you bringing this message to?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;I....I... can't betray.......please......he saved me.......no more....&quot;<br>
<br>
With that the Dark Elf cast another spell. This one was the strongest spell he had. <br>
<br>
&quot;Ahhhhhh.......I ....can't breathe.....help me .....someone.....&quot;<br>
<br>
Those were the last words the messenger said as his life faded away.<br>
<br>
&quot;I knew he wouldn't tell any more, but he did tell enough. Let us go to Surefall Glade. We will find this person on our own. I have a plan. Grab the message and let's head there right away.&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;What about him?&quot;<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's untie him and leave him here. These are dangerous areas. It will be assumed that he ran into a band of bandits. He really should have been more careful&quot;, the dark elf laughed.<br>
<br>
The dark elf and bard head off to Surefall Glade. <br>
<br>
<br>

The other will try to find out who this &quot;dark master&quot; is.<br>
Volunteers for these missions are to notify the temporary council.<br>
<br>
Some of the first to do so are Khaldorn, Canute and Cogito. All of them knowing however that their taking part in either mission is highly unlikely, as they are not among the most experienced guild members. <p></p><i>Edited by: <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/uvaljeanesbdk.showPublicProfile?language=EN>Valjeanesbdk</A> at: 1/13/02 6:31:24 pm<br></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#cccb9b><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/bsphereofhonour58352.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sornwolf>Sorn Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Sphere</span><br>  Posts: 152<br> <font color=#330000>(1/15/02 7:58 pm)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=20.topic&index=44>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title>   Re: Action</span><hr size=1> Meanwhile in the Kelethan Forest just outside the Donal Mansion  the Female dark Elf stands outside the mansion watching her Pitch black armor covered  by her cloak.  A smile crosses her face as she watches one of the elven kings messengers arrive at the gate of the mansion and quickly be admitted.  A few minute later the messenger and a small unit of rangers leave quickly by  the front  gate.  She focuses her attention on the rear gate just in time to watch over 2 score dark elf warriors leave under the protections of invisibility spells.  She chuckles quietly to herself as she  watches them leave.  She quietly stands and begins to move toward the mansion.  Some distance from the mansion she stops at an ancient oak tree.  Reaching into a knot hole in the   side of the tree she grasps the chain with and gives it a yank.  And the side of the tree pops open revealing a secret door going down into the ground..   She  sniffs the air coming up from the tunnel with an expression of displeasure.  yuck.  well I hope that smell is a good sign and they have forgotten about this entrance into the mansion.  As she quietly climbs down into the entrance closing the secret door behind her.  As she reaches the bottom of the ladder into the tunnel she finds herself waist deep in dark water.   She Quickly makes her way along the tunnel eventually arriving at another ladder..  Climbing up the ladder she comes to another door.  Holding her  breath she listens for sounds on the other side hearing nothing she opens the door and steps out into a  bedroom in the mansion.  She quietly looks around the room noting the dust covers over the furniture.  Grabbing the one of the dust covers off of one of the dressers she use it to dry her armor and tosses it on the floor.<br>
<br>
Stepping to the door she listens quietly for a second and  then opens the door and steps into the hall.  Closing the door she moves down the hall.  With a soft humm she disappears into invisibility as she proceeds   down the hall.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile in the audience chamber of Donal Heartsinger we find the Dread Lord and Mazek discussing  their plans.  Lord and Lady Heartsinger sitting silently in their chairs.  <br>
Mazek.&quot; Dark Lord our warriors should arrive  at the docks well before the Kings messenger and the rangers.  I have directed them to take the little  brat at all costs as soon as her ship dock.   Dark Lord.<br>
<br>
Dark Lord,&quot;Very good.  If the king and his son get to speak to her before I have prepared her we could have a problem.  Mazek send a unit of warriors to kill the kings messenger and the rangers.  Make sure that the Barbarians take the blame.&quot;<br>
<br>
Mazek  yes Dark Lord.  As he turns to leave a knock is heard on the side door.  <br>
<br>
Dark Lord.  Enter.<br>
<br>
Side door opens and A female Dark Elf warrior enters.  I come with a message for the Dark Lord.  <br>
<br>
Dark Lord, &quot;what is the message&quot;<br>
<br>
Female Dark Elf.&quot; The Message is as follows Dark Lord.  Gratings Dark Elf scum.   You may now Die at my Heralds Hands.   Signed The High Elven King.&quot;  As the Female Dark Elf draws her weapons and quickly steps forward Swinging her mace into Mazek's stomach with a sickening crunch as she steps around his falling form she quickly Decapitates him with a swing of her Wakizashi.  She calmly proceeds toward the Dark Lord.  AS she approaches the Dark Lord screams in rage and release a fireball at the Approaching Female catching her squarely in the chest.  The blast sends her flying across the room and into the far wall with the crash of metal armor.<br>
<br>
The Dark Lord Cackles in glee at the motionless smoking form laying against the wall.  How dare you a pitiful female warrior challenge me.  As he raises his hand to release another fireball.  AS the fireball streaks across the chamber the Female elf tumbles out of the way coming to her feet as the fireball explodes behind her.  The blast shredding her cloak and burning the black paint from the armor revealing the Dark Blue  armor beneath it.   The Dark elf image melts away revealing Rhapsodey.  Her eyes ablaze with rage she begins to run at the Dark Lord.<br>
<br>
Dark Lord.&quot;  YOU!!!  I think you need to say hello to your Parents.  Donal, Oleandra Attack.  kill your daughter but make it slow I want to watch her suffer.&quot;<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Screams in rage as her parents interpose themselves between her and the Dark Lord.  Her mother Drawing her ancient sword and her Father begins to cast a spell.  Rhapsodey quickly makes her decision.  FATHER FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU.  As she Throws her mace it ancient body already covered in Magic fire at her father.  Just as Donal is about to complete his spell the Mace hits him with an explosion of ancient fire and wild magic her Father is burnt to ashes.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Scream for forgiveness turns to a scream of pain as her mother sword tip easily passes  through the armor on her right thigh and into the thigh itself.  She quickly spins away from her mother and Recovers her mace.  She is forced to tumble again as another of the Dark Lords fireballs screams past her head and detonates on the wall behind her.  As she comes to her feet she desperately parrys her mothers attacks.<br>
<br>
The Dark Lord begins to Laugh as he watches Rhapsodeys attempts to defend herself from her mother.  ,&quot; Rhapsodey why don't you give up.  I  know that you have never been able to best your mother in a fight you have never even come close to breaking even against her.  I promise if you give up now and submit to my desires that I will make it as painless as possible for you.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey Screams in rage again.  She knows that Dark Lord is correct she has never even come close to the skill of her mother.  She knows that she cannot win as long as she fights as she was trained by her mother.  She gasps in pain as her Mothers sword finds another hole in her guard and connects with her left shoulder.  AS she spins away from her mother attack she lets her left arm drop as if injured so severely that it can no longer be used.  Her mother quickly closes in to take advantage of this new weakness.  Rhapsodey make every effort to defend herself with only her mace arm.  As she intentionally leaves herself open for an attack that should give her an opening she prays to herself that her armor will hold up and turn her mother sword stroke as she watches the slash streak  toward her right side she steps into the attack robbing it of strength.  As her mothers sword bites into her armor and her side she smashes her mace down onto the sword shattering it while simultaneously bringing her wakazashi in her left hand up and driving it up through her mothers body in a killing stroke.  As her mother falls to the ground she turns her attention to the Dark Lord. ,&quot; You are next scum bag prepare to DIE&quot;  Dark Lord,&quot; I think not Rhapsodey.  You have ruined my plan's at this time but im not so foolish as to think that I can kill you for sure.  I think We will have to meet again.  I relish the thought of the day when I will make you call me MASTER.&quot;  With a blinding Flash the Dark Lord disappears.<br>
Rhapsodey screams in rage as her Mace swings through the area that the Dark Lord had just inhabited.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodey staggers to the body of her mother and drops beside her picking her still form up she cradles the body to herself and begins to cry.   <br>
As she Crys she hears weak sounds coming from her mother.  As she quickly lays the body down she discovers signs of life.  Rhapsodey quickly begins to sing a song of healing focusing all of her spirit on her mother.<br>
<br>
Oleandra, &quot;Rhapsodey my Daughter&quot;<br>
Rhapsodey,&quot; Quiet mother let me heal you&quot;<br>
Oleandra,&quot;Rhapsodey listen to me it is to late I am dead already and you know it all you are doing is hurting yourself.  Don't blame yourself Rhapsodey you saved both of us we were  trapped and could do nothing.  You set us free the only way that we could be set free.  You have won my child you finally beat both of us in a fight and in the process you saved us from a fate worse than death.  Rhapsodey Please let us go.  Sing our final song for us my child and let us both rest in peace.&quot;  with her final words the light of life Leaves Oleandras eyes.  And her  body becomes still and cold.<br>
<br>
Rhapsodeys song  falters and stops  as she watches the light fade from her mothers eyes.   She just sits their holding her mother body.   She finally stands picking up her mother body and carrys it out into the court yard and places it on the ground.  With A broken voice she begins to sing the song of passage of her people.  AS she sings she draws her mace and with the force of her will summon fire from her mace to incinerate her mothers body as it burns away to dust she drops to her knees her song becoming strong and clear the final versus heard for miles around the mansion.  As the last note is finished she collapses in tears and crys until her exhaustion and injuries overcome her and she passes out.<br>
