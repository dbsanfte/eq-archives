I am glad you shall be at my back for the wedding and for your spear to protect me. It makes my stomach churn to think that anything should happen on my day of happiness with my wife and I ask that you watch her especially for me. If anything would happen to her I fear I would fall into depression. I thank thee for your spear and I know my wedding will be a wary celebration but I hope it to be Just that a celebration where sphere can relax, and forget their troubles for a day, and maybe just maybe this wedding will tie our guild to another, one more ally is always a treasure against the trouble brewing...   <br>
<br>
     Brothers in the Sphere. Stopher Mnk of the 12th Sanctuary<br>
<br>
<br>
      Elsewhere, on the same cold dark night this letter was delivered; two Dark Elves make their way deep into the third gate of Neriak. Heading for the Necro's guild with a silent but deadly purpose look in their eye's. Neriak's most powerful guild looms in the darkness. It's gates begin to thunder open as the two DE's silently pass through the outer wall.<br>
  A guard hails them just short of the inner throne room.<br>
&quot;HALT.... PURPOSE!&quot; The guard grunts out, his wary eye's looking over the two dark elf travelers. <br>
    The guards attitude told them something that might make their information a little more valuable and maybe they could use it to boost their own pay off. For by the sounds of the guards command when it should have been a question something had gone wrong. The Sphere had gained a point somewhere, moved an important piece on the gameboard...<br>
    As they were about to anwser a wicked voice choked out  &quot;ENTER!&quot; in a barely contained rage. <br>
 The Dark Elves hesitated knowing the kind of mood their Lord was in... yet they entered slowly.<br>
   The Dark Lord growled at them as they entered,<br>
 &quot;What News?&quot;<br>
<br>
   &quot; Good News your Lordship, a member of the Sphere is planning a wedding, we have no proof of it but we are sure it is fact.&quot;<br>
<br>
  The other elf cut him off anxious to get his own say in what they had discovered...<br>
  &quot; The wedding will relax the Sphere they will be celebrating this wedding and (he looked over at his partner) and whatever succsess thay had against you. (cringing underneath the Dark Lord's glare)  <br>
  &quot; Along with that sire they are planning a raid on the befallen... an easy zone to conquer but also one of the more evil zones in Norrath it would be easy to make this raid a little more difficult for sphere. Toss a little help in, while we would retain our complete aninymity, and at the same time shave off some of the Sphere's power, mind you only the week would fall but still the week hold power in any guild. For the weak support the strong.&quot;<br>
   The Dark Lord pondered this and turned to the elf who suggested his plan...<br>
   &quot; It needs MUCH refining but I like the general idea maybe we can get our edge back here.&quot; Turning to the other...<br>
<br>
  &quot; YOU!! However, incompetent fuel brought me just information, it takes one man to bring information, yet this elf here took it a step further why should I put up with BUMBILING IDIOTS!!! When I can have people who serve as well as your aquaintence did here. &quot; Giving no time for the elf to anwser the Dark Lord unleashed his pent up hatred and frustration at the new wrinkle in his plans on this poor elves unfortunate soul and shoving all his rage, hatred and frustration into a single canted spell, one so feared and so horrendous it was not used anymore. The mans body began to sweat and his blood tempeture rose just slowly, his joints locked so he could not flee. The Dark Lord watched as terror entered the elves eyes and he finally allowed himself a small chuckle at the insane torcher that had to be traveling through this mans body. Gleefully he watched the mans blood begin to boil, and bubles forming on the skin, blistering and peeling away like paint as the emotion Hatred took on the form of fire and burned slowly in his heart where it festered. at the end of this perfect (in the Dark Lord's eyes) torcher not even ashes remained of the body, the spot where he had been standing contained nothing at all for hatred devoured everything and just as it devoured this man he planned for it to devour the Sphere... <br>
      &quot; Come General....&quot; the Dark Lord paused.<br>
 &quot; My name, Lordship is Orilyeus.&quot; <br>
 &quot;General Oridyth then come, you are to take Maiziaks place as my cheif advisor and counsel.&quot;<br>
<br>
  Oridyth the Dark Lord thought to himself, I like that Worm Wood in some language translations, Named for the worm that infested wood making it unsturdy and unusable so that it could not even be burned for if it was it left a stench that nothing save time itself could remove. Yes, he thought this will be one of my Greatest General's yet and the SPHERE WILL FALL. He cackled gleefully to himself and for the first time since he could remember his face broke int o an evil little smile, but a smile nonetheless. <p></p><i></i></td></tr><tr bgcolor=#b9a1d0><td nowrap width=20% valign=top align=left><span class=title> <A HREF=http://pub51.ezboard.com/bsphereofhonour58352.showLocalUserPublicProfile?login=sornwolf>Sorn Wolf</A></span><br> <span class=usertitle>Guardian of the Sphere</span><br>  Posts: 154<br> <font color=#3333ff>(1/16/02 6:46:44 am)</font><br>   <a href=http://pub51.ezboard.com/fsphereofhonour58352frm26.showAddReplyScreenFromWeb?topicID=22.topic&index=3>Reply</a>   </td><td valign=top align=left class=m><span class=title> Re: WEDDING !!!!! =)</span><hr size=1> Sometime later as a steady rains begins to Fall in the Forest of Kelethin.  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey begins to stir the cold rain having awoken her.  She slowly and painfully rises from  the ground and begins to limp  toward the safety of the house.<br>
<br>
As she enters her sense detect sudden movement inside the entry hall ahead of her.  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey,&quot;Come out of  their whoever you are I mean you no harm if  you are a  good person.  And if you are evil you might as well come out as well and finish the job because im  to weak to even resist right now.&quot;  <br>
<br>
Tentaviley several heads appear from one of the doors down the hall.  And slowly an elderly male elf steps forward into the hall a tarnished mace in his  hands.  <br>
Darius,&quot; who are you and what do you want here?&quot;<br>
Rhapsodey,&quot; Darius is that  you?&quot;<br>
Darius,&quot; who are you and how do you know my name&quot;<br>
Rhapsodey Sags against the door frame holding herself up,&quot; Darius you old fool your eyesight is definetly getting worse when you cant even recognize the child you helped raise and who you helped name as well.&quot;<br>
<br>
Darius confusion and then an expression of Recognizition crossing across his face as he realizes that the stranger before him is the child he helped raise so long ago.  Dropping the mace with a clang on the stone floor he runs to her and picks her up with a cry of happyness.  Turning still holding her up he begins to snap orders to the other people in the house directing them to find the rest of the servants and to bring water and bandages and to prepare the lady Rhapsdoeys rooom.  As he guides her to the stairs and up to her room where he begins to tend to her injurys.  <br>
<br>
Rhapsodey soon passes back out as her  body loose the battle to stay awake.<br>
