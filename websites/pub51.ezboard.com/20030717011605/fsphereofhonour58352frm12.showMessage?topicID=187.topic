So I'm gonna need some help on this.  I'm gonna post on the Raiders, Torva, and XES sites to see if I can get some major help.  I've developed an alternate plan of action to do the hard crap first so the rest of the epic seems like a piece of cake.  I have worked this out into 3 HUGE RAIDS.  The first is in the Swamp of No Hope to kill one guy, then off to TD to take care of a little dragon infestation!  The second is Kedge which I'm hoping to get some wizards *cough Ardif* and pallys *cough Mysticcat* to go along cause I know they need some stuff from there.  And then last is KC to kill smalls Ven Sith but also to log in 24hrs later to kill his remains.  This one I'm hoping to work with another druid or ranger who would like to start their epics because at this point they are linked.  I will talk to some people to co-lead one or all of these.  I'll type out a more detailed version of one of these either tomorrow or Monday.<br>

Here are the following fun details.  First up is Ulump Pujluk in the Swamp of No Hope, he can be located near the froglok village at location Neg 100 Neg 1770.  He's a lvl 55 warrior with high magic resist and is often known to run when he gets to around 30% health.  He appears to be basically the type of mob you just have to beat to death.  I read that casters are pretty much useless which does include druids.  You can read more about his wonderful mob at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5318">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=5318</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
Once his life has been put to an end, we will all be wisked away to the vivid land of Southern Ro where we will travel to Oasis, then to Tim Deep to meet a good friend of mine, Faydedar.  I'm looking to talk to him again since the last time he stole my pod of seawater which my mother gave to me before she passed away, you know I promised myself I wouldn't do this /cry, /sniffle, ok enough of that, if he won't give it back to me I WILL KILL HIM!.  Faydedar is a lvl 60 dragon.  You can see a list of what he drops at <!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4470">eqbeastiary.allakhazam.co...ml?id=4470</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
I need as much help as I can get doing this part (which is only the first of many).  Please reply to this to let me know if you can assist me so I can start making the groups up.<br>
<br>
There is no loot on Ulump Pujluk, the only thing he has is for the Druid Epic.  As for Faydedar now, he has several things.  The Pod of Seawater will be defaulted to me.  The rest he drops seems to be spells and a Dragon Hero Bracer.  The bracer will be randomed off to those who are present and can wear it.  If no one wants it, it will then be offered to anyone who would like it for any character they have.  Tells must be sent to me and then I will random off who gets it, all decisions are final.  For the spells, the classes that can use them and are present will be included in the randoming for it.  If no one wants it then those who's alts need it will be randomed for it.  If at the end, items are left over, THEY WILL BE GIVEN AWAY AT RANDOM!<br>
I suggest you read more about this great mob, this is a great site and I would suggest you heed what they say.<br>
<!--EZCODE AUTOLINK START--><a href="http://www.crimsontalon.com/pages/guides/faydedar.htm">www.crimsontalon.com/page...ydedar.htm</a><!--EZCODE AUTOLINK END--><br>
<br>
Oh ya I almost forgot.  The lvl requirements are simple, for the first guy in Swamp of No Hope, 45+, I think anyone lower might just become cannon fader.  For the Faydedar it's going to be about the same thing.  I will allow bards, pallys, necros, sks, and other cleric/other healing types at lvl 35+ to come but must stay where the casters are so they will not get harmed.  Bards who are lower than 45 will play mana song for casters and THAT IS ALL.  Pallys will use LoH to heal main tanks after 45+ pallys have already used theres.  Sks will be the last to come, when Faydedar is low on health, SKs will come in and attempt to HT him (kind of a &quot;Who's Your Daddy&quot; type of thing) but they will stay in the back at all time.  Clerics lower than 45 will only come in and heal when the higher lvl clerics are running low on mana, they will come in and heal, but only as a last resort.  Finally necros, well honestly they get to do basically nothing, when the clerics get low on mana, they will expend all their mana twitching the clerics.  They will not summon their pets but may cast dots on Faydedar when he is getting low (ie 40% health left) but only then, not a percent more.<br>
<br>
The safest and easiest place I think it would be for everyone to meet at is the FV Ill Omen zone line on the Ill Omen side so no one gets agroed.  From here we will zone back into fv and zone into Swamp of No Hope and move down to the Froglok Village where we will buff up then kill.  After we have killed him, we will shuttle everyone who can make it to Sro where we will begin going to the next killing site.  Tanks try and bring a peridot or 2 for buffs (Oh ya you'll need them) if not don't worry about it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I feel I have explained things fairly well but if anyone has a question, ask me in game or email me at edodd@mvnu.edu, I'm only human I do make mistakes.  Also if I feel that someone has violated anything I have said here, you will be asked to leave and in doing so give up your right to roll on anything that drops- sorry rules are rules and I have to draw the line somewhere.<br>

<br>
Just wanted to let you know that in my experience with killing the triggered Faydedar twice now, the only thing he has dropped is the pod of seawater.  <br>
<br>
I think (though I could be wrong) that only the random spawn Faydedar has the chance of dropping the other nice dragon loot.  Otherwise, what's to keep people from going and killing Ulump (if you have enough people for a dragon kill, this should be a cakewalk), then going and triggering your very own Faydedar, just to see what he drops.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what my plans this weekend look like, but if you join chat channel /tavern (pw tavern) and ask, I'm sure you could get a few of us Raiders to come help out.<br>
