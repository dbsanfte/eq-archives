                    course people take days off) on average, then this is not 
                    the guild for you. This is not a casual gaming guild. People 
                    work, but we want the people who will be here most of the 
                    time we are raiding, which is usually evening hours, after 
                    work or school for most. Our guild objective is to see the 
                    hardest things to see in the game, and build up to doing it 
                    as soon as possible. Currently, our average levels are 51-56. 
                    Obviously we are not doing Trakanon/VS yet with these levels. 
                    But our advantage is that with such a tight range in levels, 
                    we are all able to group together, in any combination, at 
                    any time. By the time we can do Trakanon, we will be an efficient 
                    machine. </span></p>
                  <p> <span class="menutext">HALO is a class restricted guild.</span><br>
                    <span class="maintext">This means that we currently have a 
                    maximum of 5 players per class, 6 for porter and healer classes. 
                    Once we are at the maximum for a class, membership is closed 
                    unless a HALO member of that class leaves the guild. Currently 
                    there are no exceptions. </span> </p>
                  <p> <span class="menutext">HALO loot system is guild based</span>.<br>
                    <span class="maintext">This is, we do not lotto. Period. All 
                    loot goes to those who need first. If no guildies present 
                    on the raid need the item, or have better, the item goes to 
                    the guild vault for distribution to anyone who did not attend 
                    the raid, but can use the item. If no one can use or wants 
                    the item, it will be sold for cash to fund coffins, peridots, 
                    etc. This does NOT apply to ordinary grouping for loot, tho 
                    most guildies will do this anyway. We are building a fairly 
                    extensive spell bank at the moment. In the span of a week, 
                    we have well over 10 spells 51+, and some 55+, we will continue 
                    to build the spell bank for the use of our members. </span></p>

                  <p><span class="maintextblack">For new applicants, in the classes 
                    where we still have openings, we have these requirements: 
                    </span></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><span class="maintextblack"><span class="maintext">You 
                      must have a guild sponsor in HALO. This is one person at 
                      least who has played with you, likes you, will vouch for 
                      your personality and team spirit, and wants you on our team.</span></span></li>

                  <ul>
                    <li class="maintext">You must attend at least 2 HALO raids. 
                      This is not easy to do, as we do spend most of our time 
                      grouping together, and rarely group outside the guild, and 
                      most raids are guild only events. As we are a focused guild, 
                      we are not accepting ordinary applicants, but very specific 
                      types of players.</li>

                  <p><span class="maintextblack">If you fill all the above requirements, 
                    in addition to a critical last requirement, you play this 
                    game to have fun in the GAME, not to play personalities and 
                    fight with others, please post your application, new subject, 
                    listing your game characters, your level, and who your guild 
                    sponsor is. Request that your guild sponsor post a note for 
                    you under your post explaining his/her reason for you joining

                    other than your post and your sponsor's post. We will discuss 
                    your admittance with your guild sponsor and it will be your 
                    sponsor's responsibility to let you know about upcoming raids 
                    you can attend with us.</span></p>
                  <p><span class="menutext">Probation Period:</span> <br>
                    <span class="maintext">For a period of 1 week after guilding 
                    you will receive NO loot. Not on a raid, not anywhere. If 
                    your greed level cannot withstand a week of NO loot, do not 
                    apply. We expect that you will make every effort to play with 
                    your guildies and get to know them. We have some loud colorful 
                    characters, some very quiet sweet ones, and some utterly insane 
                    ones. All have their merits, but the unifying factor is that 
                    they will all be there for you if you are in dire need (no, 
                    this does not mean anyone will leave a group/raid to port 
                    you to your gimp in gfay to make a transfer).</span> </p>
                  <p><span class="maintextblack">Overly sensitive people need 
                    not apply. In the heat of a raid, people occasionally say 
                    things they don't mean. If this may cause you to disguild, 
                    don't join to begin with. Imagine your reaction when someone 
                    calls you an idiot. If you can't deal with being called an 
                    idiot, don't apply. (we do NOT abuse members, nor do we want 
                    people who call others names. BUT, the oversensitivity is 
                    the far worse problem).</span></p>
                  <p><span class="maintextblack"> This is an assessment period, 
                    and we are not guilding people to enrich them only to find 
                    that they will not fit in with us. After that week, you will 
                    have access to the guild vault and the spell bank based on 
                    your guilded (main) character's NEED. The guild vault will 
                    be databased, and you will find that when the website is set 
                    up completely, you will be able to access some pretty nifty 
                    features, including an interactive raid schedule, and guild 
                    news. Of course, other guildies can and likely will donate 
                    equipment you may be short of, but this will not happen in 
                    the first week. </span></p>

                    50), and since one character cannot play 2 level 50+ characters 
                    at the same time, only their main count towards the 5 limit.

                    if you are still interested. We are trying to build out a
