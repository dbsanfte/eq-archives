<TABLE BGCOLOR=#ccffff WIDTH=60% BORDER=0 BORDERCOLOR=#0000ff> <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1> <A NAME=POST665>  By <B><!-Email-!><A HREF="mailto:jaraxle@the-den.org"><!-/Email-!><!-Name-!>Gehmnal<!-/Name-!></A></B> on Thursday, December 7, 2000 - 12:06 am:</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><P> <!-Text-!>Ah had heard tell dat dem crazy ganomies done went &#39;splorin an&#39; found a new land o&#39; ice in tha south.  Me intereste peaked, ah decided ta see fer meself.  Ah first enlisted tha aid o&#39; a friendly gangler druid whot brung me ta tha Commons, so&#39;s ah&#39;d have a swifter time gittin ta North Ro, whar ah heard tha ganomies set up port fer a barge.  Tha trip ta tha dock wasnae eventful, an&#39; sure &#39;nuff thar was a ganomie &#34;pirate&#34; &#40;an&#39; ah use tha term loosely fer ye cou&#39; tell he was practicin&#39; his actin&#39;&#41; greetin&#39; dem whot whar waitin fer tha barge. <BR>Anyway, ta make a long story short, tha barge came an&#39; brung us ta an island in some vera cold waters indeed.  Runnin in tha direction more ganomies pointed me in, ah made me way ta a bigger dock an&#39; saw a most wondrous sight in tha distance.  Dem ganomies made a ship whot cou&#39; break ice floes ta pieces wit&#39; a circlin&#39; hammer thingydoodad!  Nae suren if&#39;n ah wanted ta be on such a noisy, an&#39; vera odd ta be sure, craft ah warily crept up tha plank.  Tha sailin was uneventful an&#39; long &#40;&#39;specially since dem ganomies done lost tha rum whot shou&#39;da been used ta keep e&#39;eryone warm!&#41;, an&#39; after passin many tremendous icebergs, we arrived at our destinashun.  Hoppin&#39; off tha boat, ah made me way ta a small outpost... houses made o&#39; snow dey was!  Ne&#39;er seen such a thing. <BR>After doin&#39; a bit o&#39; business wit&#39; some merchants, ah made a vera long an&#39; dangerous trek South West &#39;cross tha islands an&#39; broken ice floes, past wolves, an&#39; giants, ta one o&#39; da most amazin&#39; things ah&#39;ve e&#39;er seen in me life.  Twas a bridge spannin&#39; a great stretch o&#39; water, an&#39; tha durned thing seemed ta be made outta tha bones o&#39; some long dead dragon!  E&#39;en upon closer &#40;an&#39; Dwarven&#41; inspection, ah still couldnae tell whot it be made of. <BR>Crossin&#39; tha bridge brung me ta tha lands known as tha &#34;Eastern Wastes&#34;.  Ah made me way North West, as ah had been told ta do, across e&#39;en more dangerous territory.  So far ah was lucky enough ta nae run inta anythin, as ah vera much wanted ta gits me ta a friendly area a&#39;fore ah did any serious &#39;splorin.  After a brief time, ah found a small outpost, an&#39; it whar manned by Dwarves!  Nae kin like ye an&#39; me be, bu&#39; pale, icy lookin&#39; kin.  Dey whar friendly enough, bu&#39; dey made it clear dey didnae trust me fully yet.  Dey did let me rest an&#39; share tales wit&#39; dem though, an&#39; soon enough ah was on me way.  Still bearin&#39; North West, ah saw many dangerous creatures, but had tha luck ta nae git close enough ta find out if&#39;n dey likes Dwarves fer breakfast. Har! <BR>In tha distance, ah saw a vera large fort, an&#39; thinkin&#39; dis may be tha city o&#39; tha ice Dwarves &#40;tha Coldain as ah learned dey was called&#41;, ah made me way for it.  Alas fer me, it turned out ta be a jarged home fer giants, an&#39; ah was done chased away vera fast &#40;an&#39; was unable ta git any picshures o&#39; it neither&#41;.  Headin&#39; through a great snow ravine, ah finally entered tha Great Divide. <BR>Ah followed tha ravine West an&#39; ah ventually found me way ta a small stream &#40;an&#39; seems dem gangler Wizards be done at it agin, fer dem&#39;s has placed one o&#39; dem spires in tha ravine too&#41;.  Takin&#39; a moment ta wash up, catch a drink, an&#39; git me bearin&#39;s, ah started ta head North followin&#39; tha stream, goin&#39; aginst tha current.  Ah was told by tha Coldain in tha Easter Wastes dat dere home was hidden behind a waterfall &#40;seems dey mebbe trusts me more&#39;n dey let on, reet?&#41;, an&#39; ah figured mebbe dis stream led ta said waterfall.  O&#39;course me Dwarven untuishun done proved ta be right, an&#39; suren enough wit&#39; a bit o&#39; inspecshun ah found tha entrance ta tha city.  An&#39; whot a grand city it be!  Like me home o&#39; Kaladim, it be carved inta tha mountainside itself, but tha amazin&#39; thing be dis... it nae be carved inta rock, but pure ice itself!  Dis ice suren be wondrous stuff, an&#39; tha Clan miners&#39;ll suren hafta inspect it.  After gettin acquainted wit&#39; tha city, an&#39; havin a bit o&#39; rest in tha Paladin guild an&#39; gittin provishuns, ah headed out fer a bit ta &#39;splore aroun&#39; tha area jes&#39; ta see if&#39;n mebbe ah cou&#39; help tha Coldain guards wit&#39; dere duties.  Suren enough, ah found a lone dire wolf tryin&#39; ta make its way inta tha perimeter &#40;seems dese wolfies be smarter den yer regular wolf&#41;, so ah took it upon meself ta take care o&#39; it.  T&#39;was a difficult fite, but nothin&#39; ah couldnae handle, an&#39; after tha battle was done, tha Coldain congratulated me on a job well done!  A bit tired, ah headed back ta tha city ta call it a noche. <BR> <BR>OOC - Tonite I made my way to the lands of Velious, and to be honest, I am impressed.  I urge everyone to get the expansion and check it out.  Perhaps we can call Thurgadin our new home :&#41;  Some screenshots of things I saw on the way to Thurgadin are at <A HREF="http://www.the-den.org/eqshots/Velious/" TARGET="_top">http://www.the-den.org/eqshots/Velious/</A> &#40;each is a few hundred kilobytes, so it may take some time to see them, but i wanted to keep as much quality in the shots as possible.  The graphics really are great&#41;. <BR>Anyway, here are some /locs for you, if the general directions above are a bit lacking: <BR>Dragon Bridge in Iceclad Ocean &#40;to Eastern Wastes zone&#41;: -4574, 9328 <BR>Ravine to the Great Divide in the Eastern Wastes: -1792, 5576 <BR>Waterfall/Thurgadin secret entrance in Great Divide: -332, -127 <BR>Hope to see more of you there! <BR> <BR>Gehmnal Orkbane <BR>Holy Warrior o&#39; Brell<!-/Text-!> <P>
