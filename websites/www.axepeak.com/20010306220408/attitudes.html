<center><b><font face="Morpheus"><font size=+1>Dwarven Attitudes (<a href="roleplay.htm">back</a>)</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>There are several classic dwarven
attitudes that can be reflected in the role playing of your dwarf. While
not every dwarf will exhibit every attitude, it is a rare dwarf that does
not exhibit at least one of them.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Grumpy</i></b> - The Grumpy
dwarf is displeased with everyone and everything. The weather is always
too hot or too cold, the food never tastes like it should, and his companions
never appreciate him. Be careful not to make your grumpy dwarf a whiner,
however. While a grumpy dwarf loves too complain, it will always carry
with it the message that at least he/she is a dwarf and is able to bear
the burden of this adversity.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>"Hmph! Blasted humans, dragging
me around this noisy forest! They're lucky dwarves can take almost anything
or I would have bolted for home weeks ago!"</font></font></i>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Superior</i></b> - Most dwarves,
if not all, consider their race to be inherently superior to all others.
Elves lack the basic virtues of perseverance and consistency, humans are
rude and always in a hurry, gnomes take too much pleasure at the expense
of others, and halflings just are not willing enough to work. While dwarves
recognize that other races may have achieved power, none of them have reached
the level of civilization of the dwarves. The superior dwarf will take
any opportunity to point out the deficiencies of other races, often creating
friction when there would otherwise be none.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Confrontational</i></b> - The
confrontational dwarf will both give and take offense easily. He feels
that any disagreement is best resolved through conflict, quite often of
the physical variety. A glance, inflection, or badly chosen word could
lead to an attack from such a dwarf. This dwarf is also most likely to
insult others, just to provoke them into an assault.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Berserker</i></b> - This dwarf
simply loves to fight. He doesn't care what the fight is about, or who
started it. If he sees a fight going on, he will simply choose a side and
jump right in. Battle is a joyous thing, to be sung about with companions
afterward. The berserker dwarf sees combat as the ultimate expression of
his skill, and he loves it for that alone.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Leader</i></b> - This dwarf
has a penchant for taking charge of any situation. He sees what needs to
be done, and sets about getting everybody around him to doing it. Note
that this dwarf may not actually know the proper thing to do, but he will
always think he does.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Stoic</i></b> - The classic
dwarf, the stoic bears any situation without complaining. When others complain,
he considers them to be whiners. Faced with a flight a red dragons bearing
down upon his small party, the stoic will observe, "This could be prove
to be a challenge." He will then heft his axe and face the enemy head on.
Threatening a stoic dwarf is a waste of breath, since he will never show
himself to be intimidated by anything.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Greedy</i></b> - Dwarves are
well known for their love of wealth, especially gold and gems. However,
this should not be mistaken as general greed. Most dwarves simply love
these things for their beauty or usefulness. However, it is not uncommon
for some dwarves to take this to an extreme and feel the need to own these
things for the sake of owning them alone. Such dwarves may result to trickery,
theft, or outright assault in order to get hold of them.</font></font>
