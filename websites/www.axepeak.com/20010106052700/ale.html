<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>There are those that say dwarves love
ale more than life itself. While the dwarven love affair with ale may not
be that strong, drinking ale is unquestionably one of the favorite dwarven
pass times.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Clan Axepeak stores their ale in 30-gallon
casks, which is probably enough to get a party of dwarves through a single
night of adventure, assuming they aren't very thirsty. Most dwarves carry
their own personal mugs for traveling, and a spare as well in case of disaster.
These mugs are often very large and very ornate, and no dwarf would ever
trifle with another dwarf's favorite mug.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>There are several varieties of dwarven
ale distributed by Clan Axepeak, detailed below.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Axepeak Regular</i></b> - This
is the standard ale produced by Clan Axepeak. The standard price for a
keg is 5 PP when being sold to non-dwarves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Axepeak Quality </i></b>- This
is high-grade dwarven ale produced by Clan Axepeak. It is used for gatherings
of some note and for well prepared meals. The standard price for a keg
is 15 PP when being sold to non-dwarves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Axepeak Special</i></b> - This
is the top grade ale produced by Clan Axepeak. It is second to none in
terms of quality. It is served at only the most exclusive gatherings. The
standard price for a keg is 25 PP when being sold to non-dwarves, which
is a rarity.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Axepeak Light</i></b> - This
is a slightly weaker variety of ale (still stronger than any human brew).
It is mainly drunk during meetings and such, when a clear head is vital
and the constant talking demands frequent lubrication of the vocal cords.
Many dwarves prefer to travel with this ale when adventuring, while others
consider this to be too weak for good fighting. The standard price for
a keg is 3 PP when being sold to non-dwarves.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Note that the standard price for a
30-gallon keg of human ale is 1 PP. Even the weakest dwarven ale puts the
best human ale to shame, and only they wealthy can afford to provide dwarven
ales at their gatherings.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>(These ales and prices are role-play
devices at this time. However, Clan Axepeak does have quite a few members
that are developing their brewing skills.)</font></font>
