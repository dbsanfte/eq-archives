<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Clan Axepeak, the dwarven guild
in the game of Neverwinter Nights, was one of the most unique and
unexpected organizations within that community. Most predicted
that it would never enjoy a large membership, including its
founders. Many, in fact, expected it to die out within a few
months. In spite of this doomsaying, Clan Axepeak continues to
not only exist, but thrive, and it is considered by many to be
one of the finest sanctioned guilds in the game.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">This history of Clan Axepeak will
be presented in two halves. The first half will deal with the out
of character (OOC) history, detailing how the guild came to be
and the foundations of its philosophy. The second half will be
the in character (IC) history, which will review the major events
that took place on the message boards and in the game. Enjoy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>OUT OF CHARACTER HISTORY</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>A Dwarf Comes to
Neverwinter</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The very beginnings of Clan
Axepeak can be traced to a single dwarf: Nystramo (later to adopt
the full name of Nystramo Axepeak). That dwarf was, and is, me.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">I first created the character
Nystramo as something of a lark. I had been playing an evil
cleric/Magic-User for some time (who still exists to this day),
and had also played elves and half-elves. Deciding to try
something entirely different, I thought a dwarf might be an
interesting character.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The original Nystramo was a
Fighter/Thief. I couldn't quite bring myself to abandon spell
casting entirely. (Nystramo is now a pure Fighter, which I
eventually decided was more in keeping with his character, and
which was made more playable with the introduction of the potion
shop, fine long bows, and the implementation of the dwarven
constitution bonus.) After some time in the rolling room, I first
stepped into the city of Neverwinter as a dwarf.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">At this point two fairly pivotal
decisions were made. First, I decided not to use the ubiquitous
long sword as a weapon. It struck me as un-dwarvish, and if I was
going to play a dwarf I was going to play it right! I decided on
the battle axe eventually, though the hammer was also a serious
consideration. The hammer finally lost, however, when it was
discovered that fighters did not gain multiple melee attacks with
them. It was then and there that the traditional dwarven distaste
for &quot;elfy&quot; weapons was born.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The second decision was to speak
with an accent. I honestly have no idea why I decided to do this,
though I suspect that at the time I just thought it would be fun.
The accent came out as vaguely Scottish with a bit of a pirate's
edge to it. It was an instant hit with other players, and it
helped me maintain Nystramo's character in the most trying of
role playing circumstances. That accent remains the standard for
dwarven speech to this day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">For quite a while Nystramo
remained the only regularly played dwarven character in
Neverwinter Nights. His generally grumpy demeanor, his taste for
insulting elves and his occasionally biting sense of humor made
him a popular companion with many players. He became moderately
well known within a few months.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">One particular activity served to
increase his renown: PVP. I liked to throw Nystramo into the
middle of PVP's in Port Llast (back when that was the PVP capital
of NWN) just to see how people would react. He rarely survived,
of course, but he did manage to cast a few successful Hold
Monsters on the evil PVP'ers. His highly vocal participation,
however, always guaranteed that he was noticed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Enter Melkarris</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">After a time, another dwarf
entered the game: Melkarris. Created by a player who was inspired
by Nystramo's often eccentric behavior (eccentric by human
standards at least), Melkarris was introduced as Nystramo's
brother. Together they wandered the realms from end to end,
refining what it meant to be a dwarf in Neverwinter. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">It was during this period that
two more aspects of the dwarven character were defined. The first
was the dwarven love of ale. Melkarris and Nystramo would often
relax at a local inn (often Mataga's, and it was at this time
also that it became the traditional watering hole of dwarves)
downing enormous quantities of ale while chatting with the other
patrons.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The second was the dwarven
distaste for elves. While Nystramo enjoyed belittling elves
whenever he met them, Melkarris was positively cruel to them. It
was he who truly established the enmity between the two races.
While that enmity has mellowed in the ensuing years, many dwarves
in the clan still refuse to treat elves with any degree of
respect.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Melkarris' most significant
contribution, however, was his suggestion that I form a dwarven
guild. Although I was a bit reluctant due to the number of
dwarven guilds that had started and failed in recent months (I
can remember three, offhand) I eventually decided to try it
anyway. A few days later, I opened The Society of the Stone
folder with the dramatic description: &quot;Yet another dwarven
guild... hopefully longer lived.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>And Patroc1us Makes Three</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Perhaps a day or two after
opening the folder, Melkarris and I ran into one of the truly
legendary members of Clan Axepeak: Patroc1us. (For the record,
his name is pronounced Patroclus, not Patrokeeus or Patroshus.)
We met under Crossergate, I recall, and immediately laid into him
for using a longsword like a &quot;blasted elfy&quot; and talking
like a human. While he quickly picked up &quot;proper&quot;
dwarven speech, the battle over his longsword was destined to be
a lengthy one. (He eventually did trade it in for a proper
dwarven short sword so he could keep his backstabs.) </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Patroc1us' contributions to the
Society of the Stone were many. He was the dwarf who first used
manticore spines as weapons and who determined the best dwarven
tactics for many of the more difficult battles in the game. As
significant as both of these were, the most important
contribution made by Patroc1us was the introduction of dwarven
words to the clan vocabulary. Without Patroc1us such phrases as
&quot;sonn ultok&quot;, &quot;findar torst&quot;, and &quot;raugh
ar dun!&quot; may never have come to be.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>The First Meeting</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Shortly after the meeting with
Patroc1us, it was decided that it was time to formalize what The
Society of the Stone stood for. The three of us met in a private
room and hammered out our charter, what we offered members, and
what we expected of them. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">What we offered was basically
what any guild offered: camaraderie. We also offered hope for any
player who thought that non-spell casters could not survive in
the environment of NWN. Finally, we offered a solid role-playing
environment, something which was sadly lacking in many of the
current guilds.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">What we expected was simple. We
expected our members to role-play well and consistently. This
meant more than simply remaining in character during a
conversation. It meant accepting the limitations of dwarven
culture, which in turn meant restrictions on weapon and armor
selection. Long swords, two handed swords, and long bows were to
be shunned, as well as using bracers and rings as primary means
of defense. Our members would bear the arms and armor of dwarves:
axes, hammers, crossbows, and true mail armor. While some (mostly
Patroc1us) thought this too limiting at first, the final
consensus was that we were not going to play dwarves halfway.
Eventually, however, enough traditional dwarven weapons were
identified to ensure both variety and utility in the selection.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Growing Pains</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">For quite some time it was only
the trio of Nystramo, Melkarris and Patroc1usthat were regular
dwarven players. Many dwarves came and went, but few stayed for
any length of time. Membership was usually between 8 and 12 for
most of that time and the prospects for any significant growth
were few.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Slowly, a stable core of perhaps
half a dozen members was established. These were all dedicated
role players who were attracted by the Society's firm commitment
in that area. Some were veteran players who had grown bored of
the power wielded by Cl/MU's, while some were new players who
simply liked the idea of playing a dwarf. One type of member was
conspicuous in its absence, however: females.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The Society limped along in this
fashion for many months. Most people expected it to die out in
time, or at least to not grow anymore. It was during this period
that the Clan Resource Files were created. They began as a simple
file describing the various aspects of playing a dwarf in NWN,
from both a practical and a role-playing standpoint. Over the
years they have grown into roughly a dozen different files that
cover dwarven language, culture, and religion, while also
offering tactical advice, information on dwarven titles, and
guidelines for posting on the Clan Axepeak message board. No new
member of Clan Axepeak can ever say they lack information on the
guild.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">It was around the time that the
Clan Resource Files were introduced that membership began to
slowly pick up. Members were staying around longer, perhaps due
to the solid grounding the files gave them in the clan. While
membership never quite reached twenty, it was a more robust guild
than it had been. We were finally getting noticed in the game,
and dwarves were no longer quite as much an oddity as they had
been. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>The Missing Chief</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Unfortunately, just as things
were picking up, disaster struck. Due to personal reasons, I was
no longer in the game, or even online. The clan was suddenly left
without a chief, and it lost direction. During these months
membership flagged, and clan activity almost stopped altogether.
Things looked grim.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Fortunately, I returned before
the Society's folder was eliminated, and the clan slowly
recovered. In time it regained it's former strength, and there it
remained for some time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Homecoming</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Eventually, we realized that, as
a clan of dwarves, we needed a home, someplace in The Realms we
could call our own. It was not unusual for guilds to claim
ownership of a certain area in the game (such as the GOC laying
claim to Longsaddle.) Earlier in Nystramo's career, I had hinted
in a role-play with the Grey Company that the mountain found in
the North Western Woods had been an ancient dwarven stronghold
that had fallen during the war between the dwarves and ogres. So,
in keeping with this information we decided to officially
establish the clan's home in what was later dubbed &quot;Lonely
Mountain&quot;. Ritual quests were regularly held to cleanse the
mount of the giant and drider infestations that seemed to
continuously plague our mountain home. It was around this time,
also, that the name of the guild was officially changed to Clan
Axepeak, to more accurately depict the guild's clan structure and
to achieve a more dwarven flavor. It was then that I officially
added &quot;Axepeak&quot; as Nystramo's surname.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Ver 2.0</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Finally, after years of player
requests, the next upgrade of NWN was released. While this was a
significant event for all players, of course, it held particular
interest for the dwarves of Clan Axepeak. Rumors of enhancements
such as dwarven clerics abounded. Unfortunately, most of the
rumors proved untrue once players were allowed to beta test Ver
2.0.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">What did not prove untrue was the
increased difficulty of the game. In almost every area combats
were made more difficult. In particular the Lost Hills had become
particularly nasty, which made travel to Triboar a chancy
proposition and Lonely Mountain itself had become significantly
more deadly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Many players predicted the demise
of the dwarves at this point. Even humans were having difficulty
with the new challenges the game presented, so few expected
dwarves to survive at all. Unfortunately, it seemed this
prediction would hold true as the dwarven presence in Neverwinter
slowly dwindled.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Fortunately, the clan rebounded
after a short time. Once we became acclimated to the new
environment, we found new ways to travel. Fleeing battles became
commonplace for dwarves, especially those traveling solo. New
tactics were devised to defeat the new enemies that we faced. It
was certainly not easy, but we learned to survive in a world that
had been designed to bring the humans to their knees.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>A New Chief and a New
Area</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Once again, it was time for me to
vanish for a period. In my absence, Patroc1us took over the
reigns of Clan Axepeak. This was the period that Clan Axepeak
began its most impressive growth, and also encountered some of
its most interesting controversies. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The growth was largely due to
Patroc1us' dynamic leadership. He actively trained new members in
areas such as tactics and the art of fleeing, helping them to
survive without magic. Clan outings were regularly scheduled,
allowing members to adventure with each other frequently. Many of
the current clan policies involving membership, titles and elder
positions were established while Patroc1us was chief of the clan.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Another factor that contributed
to the clan's growth were the &quot;fighter friendly&quot;
additions to ver 2.2. The potion shop in Westbridge, where one
could buy potions of strength, speed and extra healing were
particularly useful. Another help was the Lifegiver quest, which
rewarded adventurers with Amulets of Healing, something no dwarf
should be without. The new areas introduced were populated
largely with NPC's that could not be easily eliminated with
fireballs, a human's favorite weapon. For many of them, the best
solution was a strong fighter with triple digit hit points. These
areas were made to be laid low by a war party of dwarves.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The first controversy was brought
about by version 2.2 of the game, which introduced, among other
things, fine long bows to the game. Some dwarves immediately took
to these weapons, since their value for a fighter was
unquestionable. However, many dwarves (myself included) rebelled
against them. We argued that bows were elven weapons, and no self
respecting dwarf would use a weapon favored by elves. We stuck to
the trusty manticore spine as our missile weapon of choice.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The debate went on for some time.
The times were changing, though, and eventually the fine long bow
was adopted as an acceptable dwarven weapon. Its usefulness
simply could not be easily ignored. To resolve the discrepancy of
dwarves using bows, I wrote a short story detailing how the fine
long bow was actually a dwarven creation, not elven at all.
Considering how this weapon emphasizes strength as well as
agility, this is not an altogether unreasonable assumption.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The second debate revolved around
the clan's sanctioning. Despite its high visibility both in the
game and on the message boards, Clan Axepeak had not yet earned
sanctioned status. This was due to the relatively low number of
members in the guild when compared to other sanctioned guilds.
While we were close to the number required, we always seemed to
fall short by just a few members.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">One of the solutions offered was
to merge with the duergar. The duergar, for those who have not
encountered them, are a small band of evil dwarves who live in
the Underdark. While not true dwarves, they are very closely
related. A few inspired players banded together to create some
duergar characters, most notably Gimkur, their chief. For a short
time they provided some of the best role played enemies the clan
has ever seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Merging with the duergar was a
controversial suggestion, at best. On the plus side was the help
in gaining sanctioning, as well as the benefits of being able to
work more closely with the duergar players in developing
interesting plot lines. In addition, if Axepeak gained
sanctioning and Crackskull (the duergar guild) did not, our
folders would be seperated. This would discourage inter-guild
role-play. If we were to share a folder, such interaction would
be quite simple. On the negative side were the difficulties such
a merger would present, such as who would be the GM of the guild,
Patroc1us or Gimkur? Since there were so few duergar, would they
be fairly represented? Finally, of course, there was the simple
point of not wanting the two clans to become too
&quot;friendly&quot;, which was a risk if they were to merge.
Finally, a vote was taken and the suggestion was overwhelmingly
defeated. (For the record, I voted for the merger.) This was the
first and only general guild vote ever held on any guild matter.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Shortly after this vote, however,
the clan gained official sanctioning. This tremendous achievement
is thanks almost entirely to Patroc1us, who worked relentlessly
to expand our membership to the required size. The impact of
sanctioning went much further than any had predicted. Almost
immediately membership in the guild skyrocketed, and has been
maintained at that level since. With sanctioning came one other
benefit that none could have guessed: females.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><strong>Women With Beards</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Women had been under-represented
in Clan Axepeak since it's creation. The first female dwarf on
record was Krishara, Nystramo's own fiancé. She was,
unfortunately, not meant to last and after Nystramo's first
disappearance she disappeared as well. She has returned twice
since then, but did not remain for long either time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">There had been isolated female
dwarves prior to sanctioning, but it was not until Axepeak became
sanctioned that steady female dwarves came on the scene. While
still largely under-represented, there are now a number of female
dwarves who have become not only regular players, but are
included among the clan elders and the chief's guard.</font></p>
