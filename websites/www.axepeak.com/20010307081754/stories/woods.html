</font><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><em>(A Short Story that took
2nd place in a Guild of Heros Monthly Contest. Ole Tig plays with
stream of consciousness writing.)</em></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Half running, they moved through
the trees, dwarven lad and elven maiden. One gliding, another
barreling, both apprehensive. The Woods. Dread. Fear. Knowing
that there would be trouble. Reaching the edge of the woods, they
plunged. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Sweet, sticky smells, ignored.
Cricket songs distract. Ale and wine untouched. Nerves on edge.
Full hazy moon their only light, brave companions, working hard
to avoid a fight. Barreling, the dwarf rolls into a roadside camp
of giants. No fear showing...but on they run. Fight and become
weak. Weak and unprepared. Unprepared means death in the woods.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Dodging roots, dodging stones,
dodging creatures of the night. Near, near, near! So near is the
crossroads. Crossroads of doom? Dark denizens praying on the
traveler? Maybe. Creeping close, listening. All quiet. Serene.
&quot;Hmmph?&quot; the dwarf asks. No crickets. Too quiet! A
furrowed brow from one. A raised brow from the other. Step
towards the bridge. Step. Step, knowing it will come. The
avalanche. Bodies, so large. Fantastic! Horrid faces near
invisible, high up in the night sky. Monstrous moans to rake your
spine. An elven magic blast! Flames! Light! Darkness please, begs
the dwarf. Charging forward, there is no other way! Brawn bulling
forward, dwarven axe swings, HARD! Bury the smoking beasts
quickly. Hard swings! Split them in two. An elven whistle. A call
to get down. The dwarf tastes dirt and more fire roars. Most are
dead now. Only one lurches. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">And now a new foe. Many images of
the same black figure fly across the bridge. Ambush! A road
raider! Which one to attack? Shimmering, grinning, casting, the
vile mage comes. Quick tingles, yet elf and dwarf shrug. No foul
one! Not this day! Another vile spell! The dwarf stops. Maiden
sees and casts back. Volleys traded. The air itself burns and
sizzles. Both stand fast. Dwarf unmoving, sees the lone giant.
Near death, yet he comes for vengeance. Foul behemoth! Closer,
closer as the light and dark casters sweat and toil, cursing each
other. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Doomed dwarf. A frozen plaything
soon. Giant bellows. He laughs though near death. &quot;Eat
you!&quot; he slavers and reaches out. Dwarven axe, frozen in the
air, drops slightly. Free, he holds until he feels the hot
breath. &quot;Death frum</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Below!&quot; The axe takes a leg.
Giant tumbles, twitches, travels to the netherworld. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Wizards! Tired. Drained. Tossing
mere sparklers. No victory here. The dwarf bellows. Black figure
trys again. Dwarf shrugs. Black figure barks, yet retreats. Off
into the night. Elven maiden slumps, but smiles. Dwarf winks.
Brandishes mugs. A small keg! The maiden laughs then refuses.
Laughs then accepts. Amazing ale! Axepeak ale. Feeling better.
Ready to move.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Again, half running, they moved
through the trees, dwarven lad and elven maiden. One gliding,
another barreling, both apprehensive. Onward, through the woods.
Run again, run again, stay alive. To make Berun. Safety. The Inn.
Quiet, unassuming, yet safe. Rest now. The next road. The next
road will be harder. Drink. Laugh. But remember. Death is close.
A whisper, a breath away. And thank your god! Thank your god for
your companion. Not of blood, but common purpose. And respect. A
furrowed brow. A raised brow. One slight smile and one
&quot;Harumph!&quot;</font></p>
