Throughout th&#39; lands o Earth this be a common time o&#39; year fer crazy folk ta doff their business clothes and git dressed up like they was lords, ladies, musketeers, strumpets, pirates, gypisies, highlanders, etc... an go to ren faires! <BR> <BR>Watchin alla th&#39; hullabaloo has fostered in me an idea.  I plan to hold an in-game Dwarven Faire Event.  This will be my most ambitious event undertaking to date as your chief. <BR> <BR>I plan to hold the faire on a Saturday.  The faire will consist of a series of contests/games and raffles with dwarven themes. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll start accepting donations for the platinum and item raffles anytime.  Meanwhile, as the raffle pot grows, I&#39;ll be coming up with game and raffle rules, and arranging for this event to be advertised on several high profile websites. <BR> <BR>What I&#39;ll need from ye kin is: <BR> <BR>-Volunteers to run individual &#34;booths&#34; - These are to be small games &#40;trivia, races, etc&#41;. The Axepeak running the booth will group with up to 5 players at a time.  By using the group, the dwarf running that &#34;booth&#34; will be able to have a channel just for his/her game.  In order to minimize logistics of waiting lists etc, I&#39;ll suggest that the booth-runner just shout something like:  <BR>&#124;FIRST FIVE PEOPLE TO POKE ME MAY PLAY IN THE DWARVEN FAIRE TRIVIA BOOTH!  PRIZE IS 10 PLATINUM!&#124; <BR> <BR>-donations of items for the raffles.  I&#39;ll break the items donated out into useful packages, and raffle them out as preludes to the finale platinum raffle.  The platinum pot will consist of whatever seed money is donated, along with the total of the sold tickets.  I plan to charge 50 platinum per ticket, and limit each character to 5 tickets maximum. <BR> <BR>-Ideas!  If this is to be more than a day of watching the text channels spam across your screens, we&#39;ll need some interesting and original ideas for games and events.   <BR> <BR>-Storm Moradinson <BR>Clan Axepeak Rorn Gor <BR>Old Mithrilbones <!-/Text-!> <P>

Drunken races&#39;ll be goot.  Pummel&#39;n skeltons be fun.  The most to collect goblin beads over a certain time, is a good one,  the most skunk glands, bandit tongues etc.  Swimmin races too -shudder-  though I refuses ta run that booth. <BR>Count me in on the plannin and helpin, it sounds like a bunch o hard work but a blast too. <!-/Text-!> <P>

Er lets see a real dwarven one.   <BR> <BR>Me gots it!!! <BR> <BR>Tha Soulforger, tha old one. Ye members.   We ken have tha booth Dwarf read tha soulforger while tha idgits  er me means tha peoples in tha booth tries ta kill a giant bare hands before that soulforger be recited.   Er me wou go first but since me did it long ago me think me exempt. <BR> <BR>Now fer a real one &#41; <BR> <BR>How bout somthin fer rogues und me guess monks as well.  Tha jumpin contest ken be done somplace decent see who takes tha least damage,  perhaps in tha elfie tree house off a bridge or platform.  Me also like tha elfie jumpin skills contest.  ye runs about up ther  und nae ken use the bridges ta get ta a place.  starts on top und jumps from roof ta roof till ye get ta the lift platform or some sort. <BR> <BR>Nae sure how many takers there be as one slip und it cou mean splat.  But me used ta jump from roof ta roof lots, still takes a short cut now und then wehn me up there.  May has ta have a cleric do this one as a res may be needed. <BR> <BR>-scratches beard-  browine huntin er nae ta many bodies ta clean up, Somthin if BB fer sure.  Finds tha dwarf.  Nae druids or rangers tha means trackin . or ifin it ok then all has ta be rangers und such.  there be some er nice places ta sit high up or tha nicks und folds O tha earth.  Cou be hard ta find even with trackin.  Wou have ta do a trial run ta see how it be. <BR> <BR>Me keeps thinkin O things.  A race about caludrin startin und endin at unrest has a few kin in places ta make sure they go by. it a circle O a zone. <BR> <BR>Just some ideas ta ponder on. <!-/Text-!> <P>

<TABLE BGCOLOR=#ccffff WIDTH=60% BORDER=0 BORDERCOLOR=#0000ff> <TR><TD><FONT FACE="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica" SIZE="3" COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=-1> <A NAME=POST973>  By <B><!-Email-!><A HREF="mailto:worried70@hotmail.com"><!-/Email-!><!-Name-!>Badaph<!-/Name-!></A></B> on Monday, May 7, 2001 - 02:23 pm:</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><P> <!-Text-!> Some other idears: <BR> <BR>Dwarven dueling in the arena in Kaladim. We can just go bare knuckle &#40;although probably nay be able ta hit yer opponent if everyone wears their best armor&#41; or use weapons to speed things up a bit. Each oppenent has ta down 5 or so dwarven ales before the round starts of course.  <BR> <BR>Something else i always thought might be fun but would take alot of coordination and around 32 dwarves. A dwarven chess match. Everyone makes a 1st level dwarf of various types. Pawns=1st level warriors with no armor. Bishops= 1st level clerics in banded. Rooks= 1st level rogues with banded armor &#40;visible only&#41;, Knights=first level paladins in banded with a shield. The King and Queen can be Paladins or Warriors and would wear bronze or fine steel, maybe just a BP and the rest banded and weild a fine steel weapon.  <BR> <BR>Also each team would have a leader that directs the moves.   <BR> <BR>Of course the match would take place on the chess board in BB. This presents 2 problems however. First off, some of the squares are occupied by stone pieces. So we would have to work around them somehow. Secondly undead minions spawn there. These would easily kill any 1st level people there. So we would have to deal with them somehow. I suspect we would have to have someone close of higher level to kill them quickly, maybe remain sitting at one their spawn point to get that first agro. Course the ones actually on the chessboard would mean someone would have to sit in the way.  This would also prevent your normal adventurers that frequent their from killing them.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;pieces&#34; are moved by the direction commanded by that teams leader. When one dwarf enters the square of another dwarf they /duel and the winner gets the square. He does not get a heal however. What this does is make the other team&#39;s captain make a move quickly. If an enemy unit is hurt you want to attack it fast since 1st level characters regen health so fast. Clerics can buff and heal only adjacent units not in combat and that consitutes a move for that team.   <BR> <BR>The winner is of course, the team that kills the opposing team&#39;s king. Nay sure what the prizes would by, maybe a small cash prize would go everyone that particpated with a slighty larger cash prize going to the winning team and possibly one good item to random off among the winners.  <BR> <BR>Another possible event that also takes some coordination is short dungeon raids. Get a few druid or wizard volunteers and grab a bunch of dwarves and head off to an appropriate level dungeon for a lighting strike with high level clerics/paladins supporting the group&#40;s&#41; with heals, buffs, resses, etc.  <BR> <BR>Thats all i can think of at the moment. Will add more idears later. <!-/Text-!> <P>

Though the chess match might take a long time depending on how quick folks made their moves. <BR> <BR>I like the drunken brawl contest too, have the gotten they arena in Kaladim to work yet? <BR> <BR>Cheef an I were talkin about a curse&#39;n contest.  We&#39;d have 3 judges and a line o folk what come up with inventive cusses.  Rules would be : No irl curse words &#40;obviously since the game won&#39;t allow&#41; and no perversity&#40;sp?&#41;.  AND since the judges will be dwarven, points will be taken off for slights to ourselves ;p <BR> <BR>Good curses like &#34;Ye jarghed kobold kissin orc faced goblin baby!&#34;  Is a prime example.  The judges would get like 5 finalists and then have a spout off to determine the winner. <BR> <BR>Har! <!-/Text-!> <P>

Keep um coming! <BR> <BR>From all I&#39;ve gathered, I think I&#39;ll have my hands full runnin the raffle.  I&#39;ve contacted Araknacat and delrachnid who used to run a monthly raffle in EC.  In spite o bein a pair o Inkies, they were quite helpful in sharin advice and tips on how to run it and what pitfalls and rules to avoid. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m gonna make myself, and members of Clan Axepeak exempt from winning the grand platinum prize.  As much as I hate to do this, I fear the implications o&#39; favoritism if an Axepeak should win several thousand platinum in an event run by the clan. <BR> <BR>Once we settle on the events of the day, I&#39;ll give us a lead time of 3 weeks or so to actually have the event, in the interim we can refine our booth set-ups, collect prize item donations, and  start selling raffle tickets. <BR> <BR>I think this&#39;ll be a grand, if labor intensive, event! <BR> <BR>-Storm Moradinson <BR>Clan Axepeak Rorn Gor <BR>Old Mithrilbones <!-/Text-!> <P>
