He’s laid a geas on me that I come here and share a song or two.  Is it that it would be acceptable to you if I fulfilled my promise? <BR> <BR>&#60;Hearing no dissent, she makes her way to a lighted spot, pulls an intricately inlaid lute from a protective pack and checks the tuning.  Looking around, she speaks again: <BR> <BR>“I’ve not entertained only dwarves before, so I hope these numbers will be acceptable.  The first I would share is a song of great battle. <BR> <BR> <BR>Storm clouds are gathering above my citadel <BR>And on the plain before me I can see <BR>Armies are clashing like a garage sale in hell <BR>And I know what my destiny must be <BR>All my defenses are cut and burned away <BR>All my retreats are closed and gone <BR>And all my hope has perished, this night will have no day <BR>All I can do is battle on. <BR> <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And a foeman I can face <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And someone I can slay <BR>Give me the chance <BR>To take some of them with me <BR>In this darkest hour I see no other way. <BR> <BR>I am no fighter, I hate the thought of war <BR>I&#39;ve never struck a man nor borne a scar <BR>I am a poet, that&#39;s what my life was for <BR>But even poets can be pushed too far. <BR>Once I believed that a man could choose his course <BR>To live in peace and sing a peaceful song <BR>But now my innocence is swallowed in remorse <BR>My dreams brought pain and heartache: I was wrong. <BR> <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And a foeman I can face <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And someone I can slay <BR>Give me the right <BR>To take some of them with me <BR>In this darkest hour I see no other way. <BR> <BR>The storm is breaking, here comes the hardest rain <BR>And I must go and face my final fight <BR>Look for my body out on the darkling plain <BR>Where ignorant armies clash by endless night. <BR> <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And a foeman I can face <BR>Give me a sword <BR>And someone I can slay <BR>If  I must die <BR>Let me take some of them with me <BR>In this darkest hour I see no other way. <BR>In truth there never was another way.&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>“As to the next, the other day, I saw a young fighter stumbling away from a fight that seemed to have had the best of him.  This is what he sang: <BR> <BR>Yesterday...all my troubles seemed so far away <BR>Now it looks as though they&#39;re here to stay <BR>Oh, I believe in yesterday.... <BR> <BR>Suddenly...I&#39;m not half the man I used to be <BR>There&#39;s a shadow hanging over me <BR>Oh, yesterday came suddenly! <BR> <BR>Why he had to strike right there, I don’t know, he wouldn&#39;t say <BR>Right between my knees; how I long for yesterday! <BR> <BR>Yesterday...love was such an easy game to play <BR>Now I have to look the other way <BR>I believe in yesterday! <BR> <BR>Yesterday...ladies were so easy to impress <BR>Now I need an icy cold compress! <BR>I believe in yesterday!&#42;&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;GIVE ME A SWORD <BR>Zander Nyrond <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42;YESTERDAY <BR>Saavogg Haraldsson <!-/Text-!> <P>

No better way to get a skald to sing!  Here is another pair. <BR> <BR> <BR>Stand up! Stand up for Odin, you warriors of the beard! <BR>Lift high the Raven Banner that half the world has feared! <BR>From Angleland to far Vinland shall sound the Warrior&#39;s Cry <BR>Till every foe is vanquished, and Odin reigns most high! <BR> <BR>March forth with steel flashing beneath the naked Sun <BR>and never stand at rest again &#39;til all the World is won! <BR>Let scarlet sword his symbol carve in every nation&#39;s sod <BR>&#39;Til every man still breathing stands up for Odin God! <BR> <BR>Let ships with prows of Dragons the mighty oceans cleave <BR>and every land not Odin&#39;s our crimson gifts receive. <BR>Let Raven Banners fill the sky where every man has trod <BR>And all the soil beneath them belong to OdinGod! <BR> <BR>Stand up! Stand up for Odin, you Warriors of the North! <BR>With silver swords a-flashing to victory go forth! <BR>From Angleland to far Vinland our joyous conquest lead <BR>&#39;Til every foe is vanquished, and Odin&#39;s Lord, indeed!&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR>“There has been no insult here, but I once heard another singer, someone I never knew use this to let a loud knight know he was displeased. <BR> <BR>The Minstrel&#39;s Curse <BR> <BR>Alas for ye ye varlet, ye&#39;ve jested at me song.  <BR>So rude and so ungraciously, ye&#39;ve done me mighty wrong.  <BR>And now I shall unleash on ye a mighty minstrel&#39;s curse.  <BR>The punishment is terrible, and goes from bard to verse.  <BR>  <BR>May the fighters at the battleslay on ye fast and thick.  <BR>May thy face be dirty from a mudhole deep and slick.  <BR>May the fleas infest thy codpiece, may ye scratch until your sore.  <BR>May the jokes the jester tell ye be the ones ye&#39;ve heard before.  <BR> <BR>May the chilly winds of winter make ye shiver till ye shake.  <BR>May a draft blow out thy fire, may thy window bang and break.  <BR>May thy gate fall off its hinges and thy doorbell lose its chimes.  <BR>May ye live as says the Chinaman in interesting times.  <BR> <BR>May thy hat fall in the river, may the holes grow in thy socks.  <BR>May the mice invade thy kitchen and thy fields be full of rocks.  <BR>May thy fruit turn brown and moldy, may a wart grow on thy nose.  <BR>May the error in thy taxes be the one the audit shows.  <BR> <BR>May thy dogs not growl at burglars, thy tomcat cease to hunt.  <BR>May thy horse turn fat and lazy and thy pigs all cease to grunt.  <BR>May thy lady be contentious, may thy quarrels all be bad.  <BR>May thy lover never have ye, but your wife will think she had. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Stand Up For Odin  <BR>Lyrics by: Robert Cook <!-/Text-!> <P>
