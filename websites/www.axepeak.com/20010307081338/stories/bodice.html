<p><font size="2" face="Tahoma">&quot;Clan Axepeak rolled in late
last night,<br>
Drinking and talking, a normal sight,<br>
But very soon they weren't alright,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!<br>
<br>
Seems there was a drow love gem,<br>
Makes the lasses raise the hem,<br>
The lads get hot, chase after them,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!<br>
<br>
The Axepeak lads flashed lusty smiles,<br>
As they surveyed the feminine wiles,<br>
Morning would be full of denials,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!<br>
<br>
The Axepeak lasses were not shy,<br>
A kiss and hug for every guy,<br>
And then the plate mail began to fly,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!<br>
<br>
All too soon their chief comes in,<br>
Dove in to break up the tangle of sin,<br>
And splash some water on his kin,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!<br>
<br>
He flung the gem out the window,<br>
I'm sad to sing, it ended the show,<br>
I'll bet it was some afterglow,<br>
It's bodice rippin' time!&quot;<br>
