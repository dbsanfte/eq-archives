<h3>Groupin Etiquette</h3>
<p>
As life goes on in Midgard, and as ye gain in power and strength, ye'll
find that groupin becomes more and more necessary...and more dangerous fer
all involved.  Ta help folk out, here are some Groupin' Dos and Donts.
<p>
<blockquote>


DO have at least 1 healer in a group.  Full groups should have 2 healers.  If ye
don't have a good healer or two, ye'll nae be able to pull deep reds and purples...those
monsters will kill yer tanks if there are no folks ta heal em.  If ye have no healers,
ye'll be limiting yer experience greatly as ye'll only be able to pull oranges or
shallow reds ta avoid casualties.<p>

DO have an established leader who makes th' decisions.  Someone needs ta be in charge
who kens wot they be doin.  If yer not th' leader, then ye needs ta listen to wot
th' leader is sayin and doin.<p>

DON'T have more than one puller.  While it may be fun ta shoot arrows or zap lightnin
at passing critters, don't do it unless ye be the official puller.  More than 1
puller can get th' whole group wiped out if they both bring back big groups at th
same time.<p>

DO stay together.  If yer not th' puller, ye should stay verra close ta each other
in a small area.  Otherwise, ye may have unfortunate accidents.<p>

DON'T go afk.  Alright, sometimes this can nae be avoided.  But if ye does have ta
go afk, make sure yer STANDING UP and that ye've targetted the group leader and
typed /FOLLOW.  This will let th' leader drag ye around with them as they go.  Otherwise,
th' group may be stuck in one place doin nothing to keep from leaving you alone...or worse,
th' group may be stuck in th' middle of a nasty spawn, unable to leave without
lettin ye get kilt.  I've seen selfish folk sit down an go AFK in th' middle of a field 
full of spawning purples...then good folk die tryin ta protect the slagged git.<p>

DON'T nuke or melee if yer the designated healer.  Aye, zappin critters or smashin em
is fun, but all ye are goin ta do is to distract ye from yer job as healer and cause the
nasties ta aggro on ye, ta boot.  Let the tanks tank, an let the zappers zap.  Ye be a
healer, and yer skills are unique an verra special.  Focus on th' job at hand.<p>

DON'T run away if yer not a tank and a nasty attacks ye.  Call fer help, and stand still.
Th' tanks should come ta cover ye and taunt the beasties off of ye.  If ye run around screamin an'
trailin a critter behind ye as ye go, it makes it verra hard fer th' tanks ta save ye.
Some folk say that wigglyfingers like the healy folks and rune an spirit folks should
nae even swing their weapons if attacked.  All that does is scratch th' critters and make
em hate ye even more.<p>


DON'T nuke critters right away if yer a wigglyfinger.  This'll get th' beasties ta
attack ye as they charge in.  Let th' tanks whack on em a lil bit and get em nice and
riled up.  Then yer nukes will have less chance of drawin th' beastie on to ye.<p>

DON'T ferget that th' most important thing is ta have fun!<p>
