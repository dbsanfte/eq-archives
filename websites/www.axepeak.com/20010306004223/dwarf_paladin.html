<p><font face="Tahoma">This document is intended to help those dwarves
who choose to play a paladin in Everquest. It will focus on both the role-play
and game play aspects of this race-class combination. What it will not
do is tell you how to gain levels as fast as possible, where the best camping
sites are, and how the paladin compares in terms of overall power with
other classes. If that's the kind of information you're looking for, perhaps
Clan Axepeak is not the guild for you. What I will try and do is help you
to have fun, develop a believable character, and stay alive during the
critical early levels.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Dwarven Paladins as Characters</font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Dwarven Paladins?</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Many people, accustomed to the old AD&amp;D rules
in which only humans and half elves could be paladins, think that a dwarven
paladin is a strange concept. Nothing could be further from the truth.
Paladins are the epitome of holy warriors, and if there are two things
a dwarf takes seriously, they're battle and religion. Dwarves were made
to be paladins.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">What I will try and do is help new players understand
how dwarves are generally raised to think, how paladins are trained to
think, and how the two can be melded into a single character. Keep in mind
that these are only guidelines, and there are as many varieties of dwarven
paladins are there are of any other race/class combination. The important
thing is to understand the norm, which will help you create a believable
character even if he or she deviates from that norm.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">My Honor Is My Life</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Trite, but true. Paladins cherish honor above all
else. They will not lie, cheat, or steal. They will not take advantage
of the weak. They will sacrifice their life so that their comrades may
live. If this does not sound like the kind of character you want to play;
perhaps you should consider a warrior, or even a rogue.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Fortunately, this all sythesizes well with the dwarven
outlook. Dwarves are courageous, and live for the thrill of battle. Any
true dwarven warrior would die before deserting his kin in battle, and
a dwarven paladin would be even more loath to do so.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Honor is the primary reason that paladins may not
use bows or spears - those are the weapons of peasants and cowards. A true
paladin faces his foes toe to toe, not from a distance. For this reason,
paladins will generally not attack a foe from behind, which is considered
dishonorable and cowardly. One exception is when fighting the undead, which
are not alive and thus honor plays no part in battling them. The goal there
is to simply rid the world of as many of them as possible, as quickly as
possible. If that means approaching them from behind to get that crucial
first blow in, have at it.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Similarly, paladins will generally not attack those
creatures that are significantly weaker than they (i.e. those that con
green to you). There is no honor in defeating those that cannot hurt you.
Some exceptions may be made for both the undead (which a paladin will generally
attack on sight, regardless of strength) and for those races that are enemies
of the dwarven people - orcs, goblins, and ogres.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As a final note on this section, do not think that
a paladin must blindly rush into a battle that he knows is lost. To die
in vain would be a waste of your own life, which would be an insult to
Brell Serellis, who gave you life. There is no glory in throwing yourself
at that mummy, knowing that it will surely kill you. However, if doing
so would delay the mummy, allowing another to flee to safety, that would
indeed be an act worthy of a paladin - and of song.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Dwarven Paladins and Other Dwarven Classes</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">How do paladins get on with clerics, rogues and
warriors? I'm glad you asked!</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Paladins and clerics are, naturally, very friendly
toward one another. This can be seen clearly in the design of Kaladim,
the dwarven city. Underfoot Hall and Underfoot Cathedral are located right
next to one another, so that the paladins and priests may keep in close
touch with each other. Paladins have a deep respect for the bond that clerics
have with Brell Serellis, while clerics value the strength paladins contribute
to the war against evil and the undead.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Paladins are also generally on good terms with warriors,
though they don't give them the same respect they give clerics. While they
admire a warrior's superior battle skills, they generally feel that warriors
lack the discipline that is required of paladins. This isn't quite as obvious
in dwarves as it is in humans, or especially high elves, as all dwarves
share a certain battle lust that goes beyond the boundaries of discipline.
However, dwarven paladins often feel that their warrior brethren aren't
quite serious enough about battling evil. They may think that warriors
engage in the war against evil purely for the thrill of battle, not for
the goals that paladins have dedicated themselves to.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Paladins do not like rogues. Rogues are sneaky,
dishonest, and dishonorable. They lie, they cheat, and they steal. They
are the antithesis of all that paladins stand for. A paladin may tolerate
a rogue in his party, but he will not speak to him unless he must, and
when he must don't expect him to be polite. Most rogues would be better
off not letting on what guild they belong to when in the company of a paladin.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma"><font size=+2>Game Play Tips</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Getting Started</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Your dwarven paladin will start his career in Kaladim,
the dwarven city. The good news is, Kaladim is not hard at all to navigate
once you get to know it. The better news is that dwarves start out with
better than normal Sense Heading skill, so I can easily give you directions
using North, South, East and West.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The first thing you want to do is turn in your guild
note. Find the stone archway to the north that leads to a tunnel and follow
it. You'll zone to North Kaladim, where the first structure you'll see
is the mine cap (with some interesting mines underneath) and the bank.
Continue on to the northern tunnel, which will lead you to Underfoot Cathedral.
Behind the cathedral is Underfoot Hall. Atop Underfoot Hall, on a balcony,
you will find your guild master. Give him your note, and in exchange you'll
get a tiny bit of experience and a tunic. Congratulations! You are now
a full-fledged paladin!</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">The Butcherblock Mountains</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Dwarves are blessed with an absolutely wonderful
beginning zone - The Butcherblock Mountains. Right outside the gates you
can find snakes, bats, dwarven skeletons, and goblin whelps - all wonderful
prey for new paladins. The whelps sometimes carry sacks of various sorts,
and the skeletons often have weapons, so these are particularly choice
prey.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Once you feel a bit bolder and stronger, you can
take the road to the right up to the docks. Near the farthest guardhouse
you'll find more snakes and bats, plus worker scarabs, rock spiderlings,
goblin grunts, and krag chicks. The krags are not hostile, but if you kill
enough of them they will be. This can be a problem, since krags tend to
appear in groups and will aid each other in fights. They're also stronger
than anything you fought so far, by a significant margin. No matter what
you're fighting, don't be afraid to run to the guards for help if you need
it. If you get down to half of your health and think you might lose, make
a run for it. If you wait much longer, you're sure to die if you run.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Once these hunting grounds get too easy, the road
leading away to the left from Kaladim will take you to the crossroads.
All sorts of fun can be had in that general vicinity, but I'll leave those
discoveries for you. Have fun!</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Paladin Powers</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">A word of warning - the early life of a paladin
is not an easy one. They are not quite as capable in battle as their warrior
kin (though they are certainly no weaklings, and can "tank" very effectively).
They have slightly lower hit points, do not learn many of the key warrior
skills, and have slightly more restricted weapon choices.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The only early benefit paladins get early on is
the Lay Hands skill. This skill will allow you to completely heal yourself
or another, once per game day. (Note: this means a game day of actual <i>play
time</i>. Your character must be active for 24 Norrathian hours to be able
to lay hands again. There are 4 Norrathian days in a real world day.) The
moral is, keep that Lay Hands skill in reserve until you really need it.
Use it when the only other alternative is death - yours or a companion’s.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">At level 9 you get your first set of spells. I'll
tell you right not these are <i>not</i> going to turn your paladin into
a magic wielding scourge of evil. A paladin's magic is useful, but not
nearly as useful as true cleric's. Here's a brief run down of your first
set of spells, and what they are good for.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Light Healing - This will heal about 10 points of
damage per use, and at level 9 you should be able to cast it about 4 times
if you don't fizzle. It is not much use in combat (you're better off swinging
your weapon instead of casting this), but it can speed up the down time
between battles very nicely, both by healing damage on yourself and others,
and taking some of the mana load off of the party cleric.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Courage - Keep this spell up constantly. It adds
to both your hit points and your armor class, which is always nice. It
can be cast on others.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Yaulp - While this spell only lasts for 18 seconds,
it's cheap and is a quick cast. It adds to both your armor class, strength,
and attack rating which is useful in tough battles.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Spook The Dead - This spell, if successful, will
make undead flee in terror for a brief period. It's mostly useful for evening
up the odds if you have more than one skeleton on top of you. It's also
just plain fun sometimes.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Flash of Light - This will blind your enemy for
a short time. While it's not clear if it has any effect in combat, if successfully
cast on an unsuspecting NPC they will run blindly in a random direction,
which makes it useful for getting past a tough opponent. If it fails, however,
they'll attack you immediately. They'll also attack you once it wears off,
so make sure you have a safe place you can reach before they catch you.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Cure Poison - I've yet to find any poison that really
does much damage to you, so this spell does not seem particularly useful.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Sense Magic - Rumor has it that some magic items
look like perfectly ordinary items until this spell is cast on them. It's
cheap, so there's no reason not to pick it up, just in case.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">You don't get your next set of spells until level
15. Patience is a key trait for those who wish to play a paladin.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Paladin Skills</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">When you first start out, my recommendation is to
not assign any of your skill points, with the exception of placing one
point in Taunt. Your combat skills will go up with use, and it's not difficult
to keep them maxxed after you gain a couple of levels.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Once you reach level 9, it's helpful to place anywhere
from 3 to 5 points into Channel, Alteration and Abjuration. If you plan
to use Flash of Light, drop some into Divination as well. After this initial
"seeding", you'll find that simply using these spells should be enough
to keep your skills in these areas high. Cast Minor Healing and Courage
on yourself and others frequently. Divination may be a bit more difficult,
but it's not a crucial skill and I wouldn't worry too much about it.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Another recommendation is to choose two weapon skills
that you want to focus on, and start working on them early. You start with
a short sword, so your one hand slashing skill will be the first to rise.
One hand slashing offers a very nice variety of weapons, including some
traditionally dwarven weapons - the axe, battle-axe, and short sword. Below
is a list of the "traditional" dwarven weapons in each weapon category,
along with each one's vital statistics. Of course, it's completely up to
you whether or not you wish to use a "traditional" weapon. Note that weapons
that a paladin is not allowed to use are not included in the list. Also,
lower speed ratings indicate faster weapons.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma">The only traditional dwarven piercing weapon is
the spear, and paladins are not allowed to use spears of any sort. This
list does not include the ratings for rusty, tarnished or enhanced weapons
(such as combine or fine steel). Your initial weapon is the equivalent
to a rusty weapon of the same type in terms of damage and attack speed.
This list should make it clear that even if you choose to "limit" yourself
to traditional dwarven weapons for the sake of role play, there are certainly
enough choices for your paladin to make him effective in combat.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">A good method of choosing which weapon skills to
focus on is to choose one one-handed skill and one two-handed skill. Decide
which of the two will be your "primary" skill and work that skill until
it is "maxxed" for your level. The maximum skill level for a paladin's
weapon skill is your levelx5+5. So, if your paladin is 5th level, his maximum
skill in any weapon category would be 30. Once you max your primary weapon
skill for your current level, switch to working your secondary skill. Be
aware that due to their slow attack speeds and high damage, two handed
skills advance more slowly than one handed skills.You simply don't swing
them as many times in a given battle. You may find it necessary to drop
a few practice points into your two handed skill now and again if you find
it lagging too far behind your one handed skill.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Rumor has it that the majority of the Holy Weapons,
which are very potent weapons only available to paladins, use the hand
slashing skill, with most of the remaining ones using two-hand slashing.
Taking the rarity of these weapons into account (as of this writing, there
are no reports of any players finding one), this may or may not be a factor
when considering which weapon skills to focus on.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma">This is only a very brief overview of the life of
a dwarven paladin in Norrath. I hope I have helped you to understand the
role of a dwarven paladin in the dwarven culture, and given some useful
advice on how to make the most of your paladin’s abilities. Suggestions
