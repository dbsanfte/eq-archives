<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>No successful guild is the work of
a single person. Hence, this page introduces and thanks many of the most
influential members of Axepeak.</font></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">NYSTRAMO</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Nystramo, known as the Olor Kuld among
kin, was the founder of the Society of the Stone, which later became Clan
Axepeak. No dwarf has ever given more of his time and effort to the guild.
He was the chief of Axepeak for a large part of the guild's life, and continually
strived to make it a haven for dwarves and roleplay in Neverwinter Nights.
The success of Clan Axepeak can be directly attributed to his efforts.
I consider myself lucky to have adventured with Nys, and I hope all kin
get the opportunity to adventure with him sometime.</font></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">&nbsp;PATROC1US</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Pat is one of only two dwarves who
can claim to have been there when the Society of the Stone was formed.
He has served as both Under Lord and War Lord, and is responsible for many
of the current traditions of the clan. His appearances in the realms are
now few and far between, but every kin should show Pat (or as we have affectionately
dubbed him, "Scowler") the respect he deserves.</font></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">MELKARRIS, HIUFANG LI</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Although these dwarves are no longer
active in the clan, they each contributed greatly to Axepeak during their
stay here. All dwarves should remember their names, as we all owe them
a debt of gratitude.</font></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">DWYVYRN, STARKADH</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>These stout dwarves have contributed
much to Clan Axepeak. They have both willingly taken on any task that was
asked of them, helping the guild to stay something resembling organized
in difficult times. Each has been more than happy to assist young dwarves
gain experience, and all present fantastic role models for new members
in terms of roleplay. They are valued advisors, and are among the first
consulted when any decision needs to be made.</font></font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">GIMKUR</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>The founder of the duergar Clan Crackskull
gave Clan Axepeak a shot in the arm when it needed it most. Gimkur's contributions
to the roleplay between dwarves and duergar won't be forgotten.</font></font>
