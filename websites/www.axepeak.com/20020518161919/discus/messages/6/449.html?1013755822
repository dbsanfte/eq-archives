He was my husband in real life and in some other fantasy roles in other games. His RL name was Bill Jackson. I am sorry to tell you all that he died this afternoon after surgery to repair a dissecting aorta. <BR> <BR>There was little that Bill enjoyed more than to enter a game as Tohrm and give the Axepeakers a hard time. In fact, I first met Tohrm in Neverwinter Nights when his group of Duergar, led by the irrepressible Gimkur, attacked the clan during an outing. Gimkur was able to cast a successful charm spell on Frigga that night, and ended up kidnapping her. She was rescued later, of course, but the spark between Tohrm&#39;s and Frigga&#39;s muns was struck. The rest is the stuff of romance. <BR> <BR>Bill loved to roleplay and some of his fondest memories are of interactions with many of the older players in Axepeak. I know many of you can remember those in-game encounters well. <BR> <BR>So tip a stein of ale when you can to Tohrm. And remember us in your prayers.  <BR> <BR>Frigga/Grissella/ and now Frygga in DAoC <!-/Text-!> <P>

No torches burned here, duergar eyes need no such aid to pierce the supulcre gloom of their underdark home.  A circle of the grim, grey-skinned dwarves known as the duergar stand, in full battle gear, in a circle around a cold stone slab upon which lies the body of the legendary duergar warrior called Tohrm. <BR> <BR>Before a battle or any dangerous undertaking, duergar would commonly sneer at and insult one another, maligning each other&#39;s ability and worth.  The duergar thus believe that, by challenging the pride, they  spur each other on to victory.  When the battle or mission is done, the duergar that succeeds takes great pleasure in ritualistically throwing the insults back in the face of those who had insinuated his inability to win.  Regardless of the truth of their emotions, to the duergar, kindness is a weakness and it is never shown in public. <BR> <BR>Tonight, one by one, each duergar warrior steps up to the slab and hurls insults at the corpse &#40;though few would have dared insult Tohrm in life!&#41;.  Sneering and waving their weapons about in the traditional effort to spur the departing duergar spirit to a greater hatred of his foe, in this case, death itself.  After the traditional insults are hurled, the circle of warriors turn their backs for a moment, thus allowing a moment of privacy to the mourner. <BR> <BR>When Norrogh Madbeard&#39;s turn arrives he steps up to the slab, the tiny silvered skulls on the ends of his dreadlocks ringing together like eerie bells. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tohrm!  Ye misbegoten spawn o&#39; a orcan prostitute!  Ye walked on three worlds as a plague to the Axepeak&#39;s an still they elude ye.  Die then ye raven-bait slag.  Die and go on to the afterlife and await the Axepeak fallen there.  Who knows, maybe there, on ye final world, ye&#39;ll slay more than ye could here!&#34; <BR> <BR>The duergar warriors then turn their backs allowing Norrogh a moments privacy with his old comrade-in-arms.  Quietly, so none of the others can ever hear the private words, Norrogh leans down and whispers to Tohrm&#39;s corpse. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well Tohrm, at times ye led us, ye always inspired us, and none was ever more cunning, or more vicious in battle.  If any duergar ever lived who was wicked enow in battle to defeat death and stand ready to do battle wi&#39; Crakskull&#39;s foes in the land o&#39; the dead, it&#39;s ye.  Go then old samman, go an fight on in the afterlife, an when ye get there, saves a place for old Norrogh.&#34; <BR>------------------------------------------------- <BR> <BR>OOC -  <BR>Bill was known to many of us.  Not just in Axepeak, but in the Knight&#39;s of the Round Table, and other guilds as well.  Irrascible, intelligent, loyal, a soul who will be missed by many. <BR> <BR>The vast majority of the old Crakskull clan players are still among us in Clan Axepeak and, even though the dwarves of Axepeak would happily toast Tohrm&#39;s demise, I can not bring myself to write a joyful post at such a time.  Thus I prepared instead my version of a duergar send-off. <BR> <BR>Though Tohrm was the ememy of Clan Axepeak, Bill was ever our friend, and we are the stronger for it. <BR> <BR>Our prayers are with him, and his family.  We remain your friends Fryyga.  Dear lass that you are, you have known more than your fair share of loss and my heart is heavy for you.  You know I am always here for you. <BR> <BR>Love and Peace to both you, and to Bill <BR> <BR>-Storm <BR>aka Ed <BR>aka Norrogh Madbeard <!-/Text-!> <P>

Upon seeing his friend, Slaykin bellows loudly in rage and pain causing even the most hardened duergar warriors to flinch. <BR> <BR>His emotions momentarily spent, Slay leans down a whispers in Tohrm&#39;s ear: &#34;Me nay kens &#39;ow it happened lad but me kens ye fought ta da en&#39;.

He made certain to introduce himself to the new Page and get to know her in the way befitting a Knight. Shortly after that, he hunted me down as Torhm to find out what I was made of.  It was several weeks before he felt he could tell me that the evil but sometimes witty Tohrm and the honorable Lord Tuvor were the same.  All I can say is, I am very glad I proved to him I was indeed Knight material...I served as Lord Tuvor&#39;s Assistant while he was Initiator.  It was then that he became Bill.  We became friends and confidants.  He taught me a lot about being Initiator, a Knight, a friend, and mostly a good person.  I will miss him greatly. <BR> <BR>Jill, I am so sorry for your pain and your loss.

She holds her breath a moment, as if perhaps holding the scent of the rose with her would somehow keep her friend close as well.  She shakes her head slightly and places the rose upon the final resting place of this fallen Knight.  Raising her face to the heavens, she smiles sadly and whispers &#34;Be well, my friend.&#34; <BR> <BR> <BR>Lady Norielynn Elentari <BR>Initiator <BR>Knight of the Round Table <!-/Text-!> <P>

Slaykins&#39; tirade drives the group of hardened duergar warriors out of the cavern, leaving the fallen warrior to rest alone on his shield. <BR> <BR>A black-cloaked figure appears suddenly at the side of the basalt slab on which rests Tohrm’s earthly shell.  Scarred hands reach up to lower a hood, revealing a smooth bald palate, snow-white, brows, and intricately woven beard, festooned with strange beaded charms, the pale grayish caste of his skin a sharp contrast to the red embered glow of his eyes, piercing in the gloom of the cavern. <BR> <BR>Gimkur Crakskul, rests his hand on the shoulder of his fallen comrade. “Gah, ye calls dat a fitt’n weapon? Ye never did knows a hammer from ah spade…” he mutters as he throws back his cloak and brings forth a bejeweled and rune carved Mining Pick, a faint moan seems to emanate from the weapon, and as Gimkur rests the weapon at Tohrm’s side, a greenish glow seems to wash over the blackened steel. <BR> <BR>“Thar’n now dat be fitt’n steel ta takes to ye final battle, me Samman.”, “Sneer if’n ye will ye slag, liken ta be all dat brings ye thru da com’n battles, cause sure as me beard is long, ye arms has always been spindly as a kobolds.”  Gimkur looks up suddenly and peers about the cavern; still alone he continues his address to the fallen warrior. “Ye was me strength o’ arm, and shield, Me’d has nae other at me side.  When me own time o’ test’n comes, might ah be as stonefast as yeself?” <BR> <BR>Gimkur straightens up with a sigh, draws his cloak about himself and slips back into the shadows of the cavern and out into the tunnels of the underdark. <BR> <BR>--OOC— <BR> <BR>It pains me to bring forth Gimkur for such an occasion.  That I must use him to send one of the rare wonderful people I’ve met in his guise a farewell lays a heavy weight over my heart.  I still recall the strange and wonderful thing that happened in Neverwinter, from one Crakskul there became many, Tohrm/Bill was one of the first to come up from the caverns and join forces with Gimkur in fighting the Foul and evil Clan Axepeak.  Many of my fondest memories of those times involve Tohrm/Bill at my virtual side.  When the weight of demands and responsibility drove Gimkur back into the underdark, Tohrm carried the Crakskul banner, even across the world wide wonder to new lands. And while Gimkur is listed on this site as helping to contribute to the forming of Clan Axepeak, it was Tohrm there at Gimkur’s side helping to lend his special brand of chaos into the Crakskul/Axepeak mix. <BR> <BR>My thoughts and prayers are with you, Frigga and with Bill/Tohrm. He will be missed…. <BR> <BR>Gimkur Crakskul <!-/Text-!> <P>
