Mountains </font><font size=+0>(<a href="EQ.htm">back</a>)</font></font></b></center>

<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">Introduction</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">This guide will try and help new players familiarize
themselves with The Butcherblock Mountains. It is not meant to be a comprehensive
list of spawn spots, camping areas, or special locations. Rather, it is
meant to give a general overview of the region to get a feel for the surroundings,
and hopefully also help you stay alive a bit longer.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The guide is broken down into areas, and in each
I'll let you know important locations (such as guard houses, shops, etc.)
and what kind of monsters you can expect to encounter. This will only include
the random wandering monsters you may encounter. Monsters that "spawn"
in a certain location will have to be discovered on your own. Hints may
be given about the existence of some of them (not all of them), but specific
directions and what exactly you may find there will not be included.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">It should also be noted that this guide does not
cover every single region in Butcherblock, only the main ones that following
the roads will take you to. Anything off the "beaten path" is best found
by exploring or traveling with someone who knows the region. Reading about
those special areas here would only rob you of the experience of exploring
just to see "what's out there".</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">Kaladim</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Kaladim is where all dwarves start their lives.
It's located at the northern edge of the Butcherblock Mountains. With its
huge statue of a dwarven warrior atop the gate, it's impossible to miss.
Two guards stand duty at the gate to help those adventurers who get into
fights that are over their heads.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The most common monsters in the region are snakes,
bats, skunks, decaying dwarven skeletons and goblin whelps. These are all
suitable opponents for 1st level characters. The goblin whelps occasionally
give containers (pouches, small bags, backpacks, etc.), and the decaying
dwarven skeletons sometimes carry weapons, which can be either used to
upgrade your starting weapon or can be sold for cash. Most weapons sell
for over a gold piece, which is a nice piece of pocket change for new characters.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">A nice feature of Kaladim that not all cities have
is convenient shops just outside the city gates, which means you can both
sell your loot and stock up on food without having to enter the city.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Somewhere nearby goblins of the RunnyEye clan have
managed to set up a camp. If you happen to stumble upon it, approach it
with caution (or, better yet, avoid it all together!) The goblin camps
throughout Butcherblock are quite dangerous, and should not be tackled
by low level characters - not even in groups. While King Kazon Stormhammer
would dearly love to see all of the goblins in the region perish, he doesn't
want his subjects throwing away their lives to no purpose.</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">The Docks</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">If you follow the road leading west out of Kaladim
(to the right, if you are facing away from the gate), you will eventually
come to the docks. The Docks are important for several reasons. First,
they are the only means of transportation (other than magic) that residents
of Faydwer can use to get to Antonica. It's a very long boat ride to Freeport,
but once you have explored Faydwer to your hearts content you may just
find yourself longing for new territories to conquer.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Another useful feature of the Docks is the convenient
merchants who do business there. Since there is a fairly good hunting ground
nearby (which I will discuss shortly), this is a handy spot to unload excess
loot without having to walk back to Kaladim. There is a small price to
pay for this convenience, however. The merchants are all elves, and as
such generally do not offer the same prices for goods as dwarven merchants
do - at least, not to dwarves. You can also buy food and drink here, but
it is a little more expensive.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The Docks are also the easiest location to go fishing.
Bait is cheap, costing only a few coppers, and fishing is an excellent
way to keep your food supply up without having to buy the more expensive
ready-made rations. Even at low skill levels you should be able to keep
yourself fed for very little money. As an added bonus, you may find a rusty
dagger or tattered sandal, each of which can be sold for a few silvers.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">A little to the south of the docks is a guardhouse
with two guards. Just to the south of this guardhouse is some very good
hunting for 4-5th level characters. Level 3 characters can also hunt here
if they're careful. Here you'll find most of the monsters that are outside
Kaladim, as well as rock spiderlings, worker scarabs, goblin grunts, and
krag chicks. These are all tougher opponents than the ones you faced outside
of Kaladim, and they also all carry an extra challenge - they're all "team"
monsters. This means that if they see you fighting one of their own kind,
they'll come to help. So if you're only 3rd level and you want to take
on that worker scarab, check to make sure there are no others around or
you may find yourself fighting two or three instead of one! Low levels
should also be on the lookout for goblin grunts - as with all goblins,
they will attack on sight and are a bit tough for lower levels to take
on. If one spawns in your hunting ground, you may want to draw it back
to the guards so they can dispatch it for you.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">On the difficulty scale, scarabs and spiderlings
are the easiest, goblin grunts are a bit harder, and krag chicks are to
be approached with extreme caution! They are quite a bit harder than goblin
grunts, and when they appear they tend to appear in groups. As an added
warning, every time you kill one your faction standing with the krag drops
a bit. If you kill enough, all krags will attack you on sight, and fighting
two or three chicks at once is a daunting prospect indeed. As an added
warning, you should be aware that there are some much more powerful krags
to be found in Butcherblock that will not take kindly to your killing their
chicks.</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">The Crossroads</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">After hunting near the docks, the next stop for
most players will be The Crossroads, which can be reached by heading east
on the road from Kaladim. Not only are there more challenging monsters
here, but it is also the region that has the two exits from Butcherblock
besides the Dock. If you follow the road leading west it will take you
to the entrance to Dagnor's Cauldron. This is an <i>extremely</i> dangerous
area and should not be entered until you are much stronger - and even then
only with a good party. The road leading east will take you to Greater
Feydark. While Greater Feydark itself is not terribly interesting (mostly
due to the rather annoying elves that live there), it's one draw for dwarves
is the entrance to Crushbone Castle, home to the Crushbone orcs. On the
road to Greater Feydark you will also find two shops that will buy loot
from you, should you need to unload some. Guards can be found both at the
crossroads themselves and on the road leading north from the crossroads.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The Crossroads, as it is handled in this guide,
is by far the largest region in Butcherblock. Due to the wide variety of
monsters found here, it can be a profitable hunting ground for characters
up to level 10, or even higher in some specific locations. It is also a
highly dangerous hunting ground. While most of the monsters aren't naturally
hostile, there are a few that you should keep an eye out for.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The first thing to be aware of is that there are
some much stronger goblins here. The typical goblin found near The Crossroads
is quite a bit stronger than the grunts you faced near the docks. Even
worse, rumors abound of goblins who actually use magic - approach these
with extreme caution! Even strong adventurers have a difficult time with
these enemies on their own. Goblins are also "team players" - even if you
can take on that run-of-the-mill goblin on your own, keep an eye out for
any others that may come to his aid during the fight. Word has it that
more than one goblin camp has been established in this region, so be on
the lookout for them.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Among the wandering monsters you can expect to find
near The Crossroads are large spiders, large snakes, giant scarabs, giant
bats, lowland basilisks, emerald drakes, krag elders, dwarf skeletons,
and, of course, goblins. When you first come here, large spiders will most
likely be your primary prey. You can also take on the weaker large snakes
as long as you are careful to inspect them first. If they are white to
you, leave them be! The snakes have a disturbingly large range of strength
- some will be easy fights, while others will kill you without much difficulty.
Giant bats are a bit harder than the toughest of the large snakes.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The dwarven skeletons here are quite a bit more
fearsome than the decaying variety you faced earlier. Not only are they
tougher to kill, they hit quite a bit harder and some can even stun you.
The positive side is that they often carry cloth armor, which sells for
a nice piece of change, or can be worn for protection if you still need
it. Dwarf skeletons, however, do not carry weapons. Some say that there
are areas in Butcherblock where dwarf skeletons are constantly generated,
as if by some dark necromantic magic.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The most dangerous wandering monsters are the giant
scarabs, krag elders, lowland basilisks and emerald drakes. Fortunately,
none of these are hostile (except the krag elders, and then only if you
took a liking to killing krag chicks when you were younger). Do not even
think about taking on any of these alone until you have a better idea of
their capabilities.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">One rumor that has reached the ears of King Stormhammer
is the presence of ogres in the Butcherblock Mountains. People speak of
a pair of ogres, a male and a female, who are waylaying travelers and pummeling
them mercilessly with fists and weapons. Keep a sharp eye out for them.
They are to be considered extremely dangerous.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">One final piece of information is that the orcs
of Crushbone have begun to infiltrate the Butcherblock Mountains. While
it is hard to confirm this, many dwarves have reported seeing orc runners
entering the mountains from Greater Feydark. Some say that a small encampment
of orcs has already been established somewhere within the mountains. If
true, this would represent a clear and direct threat to the dwarves in
the region, who already have goblins and undead to worry about.</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">Conclusion</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">As you can see, The Butcherblock Mountains offers
a wide range of challenges for your character. Besides what I've described
here, there are a number of very interesting locations that have not even
been hinted at. If you explore you'll no doubt come upon them yourself.
Be warned, however, that very interesting areas are also usually very dangerous.
Be careful when you approach them so you can live to tell your friends
about it afterwards.</font>
