(<a href="roleplay.htm">back</a>)</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Barbarians- </i></b>Barbarians
are large humans that seem far too fond of animals, shown by their propensity
to wear animal heads for helmets. Though they are close to the size of
giants, a hated enemy of dwarfs, these large humans’ lust for battle and
acclaim as great warriors has earned a grudging respect from most dwarves.
Although no self-respecting dwarf would ever pass up the chance to taunt
a barbarian on the animal motif of his apparel.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Dark Elves (Drow)</i></b> -
Dwarves hate the drow with passion, but the hatred is tinged with fear.
Drow are the most powerful of the races of the Underdark, and more than
one dwarven clan has been made slaves by this evil race. It is almost impossible
for a drow, even a renegade drow that has forsaken his kindred, to gain
the trust of a dwarf.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Duergar (evil dwarves)</i></b>
- Saying that dwarves hate duergar is an understatement. They want them
all dead. Period. A dwarf will attack a duergar to the exclusion of all
other enemies and won't stop until either he or all of the duergar are
dead. (To play a duergar in EverQuest, on would simply role-play an evil
dwarf since duergar is not a race available in the game.)</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Erudites </i></b>– These high
men pride themselves on their intellectual abilities and social graces
to the almost complete exclusion of physical disciplines. Dwarves view
them as uppity humans that, figuratively as well as literally, look down
their noses at the crude blunt ways of our fine warrior race. Their lack
of physical, weapon-wielding warriors gain them no respect from dwarvenkind.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Gnomes</i></b> - Of all the
races, dwarves feel the most kindred to gnomes. Both races feel at home
in the caves beneath The Realms, and are fierce enemies of the evil races
that lurk there. Still, dwarves are bemused the gnomes' fascination with
machinery and gadgets, and gnomish practical jokes have been known to send
dwarves into rages that lasted for days. Gnomes that practice the necromantic
arts are frowned upon, because it’s just nae natural.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Elves (high, half, wood) – </i></b>Dwarves
tend not to make a clear-cut distinction between the different elf races.
A full section is devoted to elves preceding this section.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Halflings</i></b> - While halflings
can sometime grate on a dwarf's nerves with their constant chattering and
generally lazy attitude, they have gained the grudging respect of dwarves.
They admire their sturdiness and their ability to maintain a positive outlook
in a bad situation. Still, they tend not to be serious enough for dwarven
tastes, and they are not a dwarf's first choice for a companion.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Humans</i></b> - Humans tend
to be too focused on immediate gain, rarely looking at the long run. They
are impatient, and often rude, by dwarven standards. There are few things
a dwarf enjoys as much as taunting humans. However, they recognize that
the human race is probably the single most powerful force for good in The
Realms, so consider them important allies.</font></font>
<p><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b><i>Ogres </i></b>– Dwarves detest
evil races and that most definitely includes these bastard cousins of the
giants. They will take every chance to belittle, taunt and kill these creatures
which have no real value in the world except something to be killed.</font></font>
<p><i><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1><b>Trolls </b>– </font></font></i><font face="Tahoma"><font size=-1>Dwarves
feel the same about these evil green growths as they do about ogres.</font></font>
