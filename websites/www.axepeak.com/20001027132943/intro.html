<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dwarves are among the most 
  enjoyable races to roleplay, for several reasons. Dwarves are the least human 
  of the major races (with the possible exception of gnomes), and many players 
  have a difficult time relating to them at first. Fortunately, once you get to 
  know them, dwarves a very straightforward people and defining a character is 
  not too difficult.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dwarves, as a general rule, 
  are a race of extremes. A dwarf does nothing without throwing himself into body 
  and soul, whether it be fighting, singing, drinking, or mining. The dwarven 
  way is, if you're going to do something, do it not only right, but better than 
  every other race in The Realms. This single-mindedness is one of their finest, 
  and at times one of their worst, qualities.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dwarves tend to think of 
  themselves as superior to the other races in The Realms. While they don't deny 
  that humans, elves, and the other races have achieved power and a level of civilization, 
  they are convinced that these races would eventually make a muck of it all were 
  not dwarves around to keep them out of trouble. Many a party has gagged a belligerent 
  dwarf who was berating the other races in the group.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On the brighter side, dwarves 
  are likely the most fiercely loyal companions to be had. It is not an easy thing 
  to befriend a dwarf, but it is definitely worth the effort. A dwarf will stand 
  by a companion through the worst. A dwarf that turns his back on a friend is 
  lower than a kobold in the eyes of his kindred. When you make a dwarven friend, 
  you make a friend, and an ally, for life.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Please keep in mind that 
  the information in this file is meant as a guideline only. Feel free to disregard 
  some or all of its advice. The range of dwarven personalities is wide. Very 
  few dwarves exhibit all of the characteristics given here, and some don't exhibit 
  any at all. The only true guideline is to create a dwarven character that is 
  believable and enjoyable to play. However, if you deviate too far from the dwarven 
  norm it is advisable to explain why your dwarf is so different from all of the 
  rest. This will add to the depth of your character, and will hopefully add to 
  your enjoyment as you play him. Most of all have fun and never forget your keg.</font></p>
