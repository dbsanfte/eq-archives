LOOK!  It ate all&#39;a tha beer nuts again.  Gah!&#34; <BR> <BR>A rather irrate Diamond shoo&#39;d a large angry badger from her kitchen pantry while she berated her husband.  Picking through the empty sacks of nuts now scattered about the floor of her kitchen she grumbled and swatted at the persistant pet when it attempted to get back into its newfound den.  Looking over to where Storm Moradinson sat at the kitchen table cleaning his spear, her face turned red and she she set herself for battle with her hands planted firmly on her hips. <BR> <BR>&#34;Whut&#39;s in tha nine ell&#39;s duz ye think ye be doin,&#34; she asked with a menacingly quiet tone.  Storm, a not completely dense male, looked up at her deadly tone and answered suspiciously, &#34;Whut it look like I be doin, ye blind harpy, I sure as nae cleanin fish.&#34; <BR> <BR>Diamond muttered through clenched teeth something about him probably cleaning fish on the livingroom couch, then went off, &#34;Thot it&#39;d be fun ta has all tha kin over fer a party did ye?  So&#39;s ye up an invites um ALL over fer food an drink.  NAE EVEN ASKIN me er TELLIN me until tha night afore.  NOW ye sits at me newly cleaned off table and cleans ye spear?!  I thinks nae!

It was strong, yet poetic.  Eloquent, but familiar words invited the entire clan to gather at the Chief’s request.  The parchment was tacked up in a few strategic places.  Everyone who was anyone in Axepeak would be there.  Especially with the mention of feasting and ale.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Be inturestin’ ta sees ‘ow me Sis gonna prepares such a spread,&#34; Emmrald chuckled.  &#34;Mebbe I best see if’n she needs a bit o’ ‘elp.&#34; <BR> <BR>Her own delves were tidy if empty these days.  The coals burned merrily in the hearth.  Jewel framed portraits on the mantle served as reminders of the family who once lived here.  &#34;Aye, tis time I got out among me kin more of’n,&#34; mused Emmy as she collected her cooking and cleaning utensils into a large traveling pack.  &#34;I ken Di ‘as nae bu’ impulments o’ torstin’ in ‘er delves.

Hrm..a caterer!”  The old dwarf stopped and tapped the butt of his spear on the ground a few times as he considered his plight.  Slowly, a grin spread across his face.  With the sprightly steps of a much younger dwarf, he bounded off down the halls. <BR> <BR>Moments later, after traversing the many leveled halls of Lonely Mountain, Storm saluted the gate guards, Kost and Shale, and headed toward the Axepeak Portal bastion. <BR> <BR>““I wonder wha’ tha’ was all aboot?” muttered Kost.   <BR> <BR>“Wha’ wha’ is aboot?” replied Shale <BR> <BR>“Th’ chief had a mischievous grin on ‘is face!” <BR> <BR>Shale chuckled.  “So wha’ else is new eh?” <!-/Text-!> <P>

An&#39; now I ha&#39;e to traipse all the way back to me home an&#39; do a bit more bakin&#39; would seem.&#34;  Elayna winked at the Guildmaster and offered him the cookie. <BR> <BR>&#34;Aye, Lass, &#39;twould seem so...&#34; Gorak&#39;s words were cut short by the arrival of Arroe with his latest harvest of beets and armor he&#39;d dug up out at the farm. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ll just be off then..headed home a bit...dinner&#39;s laid out in the kitchen...fer ye all...mind ye no leave a mess now!&#34; She glanced about and noticed none watching, and quickly scribbled a note, tied it with a bit of yarn and pulling her cloak about her shoulders, she left. <BR> <BR>As she closed the door behind her, she heard the familiar grunt of a badger...but it didn&#39;t bare its teeth at her approach as the ones in the wild are wont to do, and she smiled and reached out her hand to let it sniff, then giggled as its cold nose burrowed towards her pocket. &#34;Ah! Ye&#39;ll be needin&#39; some payment, then, eh, good Badger?&#34; Elayna pulled a cookie from her pocket and as the badger munched happily, she tied the small scroll about its neck. &#34;There now, off ye go, an&#39; dinna straggle! There be a lady waitin&#39; on ye, an&#39; a feast to be prepared!&#34; <BR> <BR>Elayna straightened and without hesitation breathed a word of prayer then began her chant...and as the dust whirled about her, she sped away, racing towards her home. <BR> <BR>&#34;Dwarven....my oh my will the miracles ne&#39;er cease! The Goddess &#39;erself is surely smilin&#39; upon this one, this day...and he wrote it in Elven! Bless his soul!&#34; Elayna&#39;s grin broadened as she opened the door, and dumped her cloak unceremoniously on the chair, already rolling up her sleeves to begin the her work. <BR> <BR>She had learned many arts from her mother, a great Healer in Connla, yet one skill that ne&#39;er failed was indeed her culinary gift. Elayna had spent years in the kitchen, learning that prayers and chants and hunting and defending were all worthless if yer belly be without, and now, as she stood in her own kitchen, surrounded by the feast she quickly and easily prepared, she found herself thinking of how proud her mother would be to see that even in this day, with wars rampant and death all too common, on this day, her daughter was a woman...helping another woman...whose husband acted without thought, yet whose bravery knew no bounds when it came to keeping his woman happy. <BR> <BR>The Celtic Lady  packed the last basket and stepped back, the back of her hand pushing a blonde curl away from her face, and she surveyed her work, a smile upon her face. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ah this should do..he dinne mention a number an&#39; Goddess knows I&#39;ve n&#39;er been to a Dwarven feast but surely, if this would feed my clan, then it shall do the Lady Diamond&#39;s as well!&#34; <BR> <BR>She clapped her hands together and brushed the flour from her vest, then began her encantations. <BR> <BR>This too was a gift from her mother...and this was Elayna&#39;s secret that very few knew of...for many accepted her treats and knew better than to question how her stores n&#39;er ran dry...and she closed her eyes and chanted and then pulled forth a small, plain, wooden box and opened it. <BR> <BR>As she whispered her spell, the baskets began to waver, as if moving through veils and one by one they simply slid into nonexistence, until the last one disappeared. <BR> <BR>Elayna opened her eyes and closed the lid of the box, then slipped it into her satchel. She retrieved her cloak, brushed it off and fastened it about her slender neck, and slipped quietly out into the darkness, to head for Midgard, and to cash in a favor a certain Giant owed her...so that this eve the Lady Diamond would not go without, and the good Storm would not, after all, be sleeping on the couch. <BR> <BR>And it was many hours before she arrived safely home once more, her package delivered, guarded by the Giant and surely Rokfyst himself, with Viddl and Vaijon would see to it that none disturbed the feast that lay hidden in Rokfyst&#39;s precious Log, waiting for Storm to retrieve it, as she&#39;d asked in the note she sent home with the little Badger from Midgard. <BR> <BR>And that night the Lady Warden slept at peace, and she smiled thinking of the Dwarven feast that had been prepared by a Celtic lass, and it was good. <!-/Text-!> <P>

What was I thinkin!   Loo&#39; at what I&#39;ve come tae!  Fetchin an elf cooked banquet guarded by a giant!&#34; <BR> <BR>Storm Moradinson chuckled to himself and idly scratched his pet badger between the ears.  He sat atop a mid sized cart which was empty but for two large kegs of well aged Axepeak dwarven ale.   The frontier was a place for caution and he and his guards kept a close watch as they prepared to carry the prepared banquet back.  Several of his guards had looked at Storm oddly as he had spoken with the giant.  The giant had then stomped over the hilltop and returned carrying a log? <BR> <BR>Storm frowned as he climbed down from the cart and strode over to where the giant had dropped the log.  The giant merely chuckled with a gravelly thunderous rumble, gathered the kegs from the cart, and stomped off into the glacier ridden mountains.  The badger sniffed around as Storm and a pair of dwarven guards circled the log.  Finally noting a knothole of goodly size in one side of the trunk, the old dwarf peered inside and saw a polished wooden box.  Sighing, Storm reached in and took the box.  Turning the box over and examining it closely he rubbed his thick groomed beard and considered his options. <BR> <BR>&#34;Wellen, maybe elfs nae eat as much as dwarfs an she jus sent me this one box o&#39; cookies?&#34; <BR> <BR>Slowly, suspiciously, Storm cracked open the lid of the box.   Instantly a basket, no bigger than a thimble, full of breadfruits flew out of the box and the old dwarf glimpsed a dozen other baskets rising in a procession behind the first.  It was all he could do to slam the lid closed before any more baskets escaped.  The tiny basket wafted out of the box and settled on the ground, rapidly expanding in size till it was large enough to require two dwarfs to easily carry!  The breadfruits smelled delicious and although his dwarven kin stepped away from the clearly magical basket with ominous looks of suspicion in thier eyes, the badger was more interested in pilfering a treat for himself. <BR> <BR>&#34;Well, wha&#39;s wrong wi&#39; ye lads?  Fetch up thi&#39; basket afore the badger eats all the goodies..I has a banquet tae deliver!&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Jarghed giant had best deliver those kegs an nae just drink um&#34; grumbled Storm as he and his kin headed for home. <!-/Text-!> <P>

He were obviously nae thinking, ta be sure.&#34;   <BR> <BR>Diamond looked over to see her sister humming and nodding as she straightened the livingroom, she&#39;d already straightened the couch and cleaned all the hunting maps and notes off of the coffee table.  &#34;See, ye already doin it sis, ye a cleanin whiz, ye be.  That woulda take&#39;n me hours jest ta go through all tha&#39;.&#34; <BR> <BR>Emmrald had moved towards the hall closet with an arm full of books and papers and Diamond barely got a warning call out to her as she opened the closet door...&#34;Caareful! . .-rattle, clatter, startled cries- as Emmy dodged an assortment of used spears and bows.

Her quiver was full, her spear was sharp and she could smell fresh game in the air.  Ah, it was good to be alive!  It was a grand day to go hunting, but no need to hunt alone, when she was walking right past Diamond&#39;s house. <BR> <BR>Solla poked her head into the kitchen window and said, &#34;Hey, Di, want to go hunting?&#34; Too late she saw Diamond huddled over a potatoe, ruining a perfectly good knife blade.  She backed quickly away and turned to run, but she wasn&#39;t quicker than Emmrald.  Faster than a dwarf can say, I&#39;ll take another keg, she was seated next to Diamond with a potatoe in her hand. <BR> <BR>&#34;Gest what we needed, extrie help,&#34; said Emmrald smiling happily. <!-/Text-!> <P>

Peelin tators!&#34;  She holds up the vile root and pontificates. &#34;Alla me life when there be a dinner ta be made, I get sat at a table with this evil vegetable and tolt ta peels that skin off.&#34;  She stands, warming to her tirade, holding her potato in the air, &#34;Who says tha skin must be peelt off?!  Is tha skin so worthless ta be scraped frum the body o its tator only ta be thrown mercilessly ta trash heap?!  Nae, I says!  Tator skins has valuey!  I says, leave them ta adds a new flavor ta our meals!&#34;   <BR> <BR>Di finishes her sermon o tha sprout and reaches to drain her tankard, then notices Emmy and Solla staring at her.  &#34;What?&#34; she asks as she sits back down to the table, &#34;Just tryin ta live&#39;n things up in tha kitchen, is all.&#34; <!-/Text-!> <P>

A knock at the door brought a lass looking for Dimond.  Emmrald right away enlisted the lass, poured her an ale and handed her a paring knife.  &#34;Sonn Ultok! Goo&#39; ta meets ye, Solla!  We cin use more &#39;elp fer dis feast! Arau Thalorn ta ye fer stoppin&#39; by!&#34; <BR> <BR>While Emmy went to check the roasts and breads she heard muttering and came back to hear a finer sermon than she&#39;d heard in the temple either of Brell or Eir and to rival some of the ones from clerics of Berronar and Moradin himself.  The fact that it centered on a potato was touching, too. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ye ken whut, Sis? ye be rite! We gonna bake tha rest!&#34; Emmrald announced to the two warriors trapped in the kitchen.  &#34;But we needs sum o&#39; dat shiney foily stuff.&#34;  Emmy looked around. <BR> <BR>&#34;Ye gots enny ol&#39; armor or shields whu&#39; Storm wi&#39; nae miss, Di?

At last something she wouldn&#39;t be ashamed to be caught doing was mentioned. <BR> <BR>&#34;I&#39;ve never been very crafty, but I&#39;m more than willing to try to pound out some armor thin,&#34; she said, smiling happily at Emmrald.  She handed the frilly apron back to Emmrald with a horrified look on her face.  &#34;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a smith&#39;s apron at the forge, if you can show me the way.&#34; <BR> <BR>Solla had never been very fond of food that didn&#39;t start it&#39;s life running, flying or fishing.  &#34;If it doesn&#39;t move, don&#39;t eat it!&#34; her ma had always said.  After peeling a dozen or so potatoes, she was certain they never moved.  If it doesn&#39;t move, throw it in the fire.  Solla liked that idea so much better.  If it has to be wrapped in armor, so be it. <BR> <BR>Solla headed out to the forge while Diamond scrounged around for old armor.  There wasn&#39;t any kindling by the forge, but there were some large logs.  She headed out into the woods to pick up some small twigs and branches.  Except that her armor, bow and spear were in Diamond&#39;s house, she would take off running and never been seen passing this way again.  Argh!  Cooking!  A fire and a stick, a fire and a stick!  That&#39;s the way to cook. <!-/Text-!> <P>

A nod of understanding passed between them and Diamond pulled a rusty key from a hook on the kitchen pantry wall as she walked out the back door in the direction of a dark little used tunnel. <BR> <BR>Some would have thought it strange that she took her spear with her or that she had grabbed up the last handful of stale beef jerky in the pantry.  The huntress stoically traveled down several other dark and web covered tunnels to the back of the cheef&#39;s delves and stopped in front of a heavily fortifide and bolted door. <BR> <BR>Bracing herself against the door, she unbolted and unlocked it, then readied her spear.  Scurrying and shuffling could be heard in the confines of the piles of stored goods as she opened the door.  Stepping into the room, she quickly reclose the door as if to not allow something to escape, and peered about for some armor she could use. <BR> <BR>The huntress&#39;es trained ears could hear the stealthy shuffle in the back of the room slowly creeping in her direction.  &#39;Gah! Tha thing be stalkin folk now,&#39; she thought with a scowl.   <BR> <BR>Spotting a couple a discarded breastplates in Storm&#39;s scrap pile, Diamond knew she had to move quickly before the beast could get upon her.  Taking the handful of jerky from her pocket, the dwarven lass threw it will all of her might to the back of the cavern room.  The hardened jerky crashed into an old shield that toppled over resulting in loud crashes and clatters. <BR> <BR>There was a protective growl of rage not five feet from Diamond in the midst of a pile of pole arms, then a line of toppling weapons and various armors as the creature ran off in the direction of the thrown jerky. <BR> <BR>Acting fast before the creature realized what she was doing, Diamond grabbed up two rusty old broken pieces, tucked them under each arm and made it out the door.  Not five seconds after the door was shut and bolted tight there was a heavy crashed against the inside of the door then a roar of anger. <BR> <BR>Long ago resigned to its fate, the creature only scratched and clawed at the iron clad door a few moments before it shuffled off to eat its jerky offering.  With a breath of relief, Diamond relocked the door, situated the armor pieces better for carrying and started back towards her delves muttering under her breath.  &#34;What&#39;d ye do wit tha pet wolverine tha&#39; I&#39;d nae let ye keep in tha house.&#34;  Taking on a deeper gruffy voice she muttered back to herself, &#34;Ye&#39;d be proud o me lass, I founds a way ta protects tha store room.&#34; <BR> <BR>She took the broken pieces to Solla at the forge, drew two tankards of ale from the forge keg and sat down on a stool nearby to chat and watch as the lass worked. <!-/Text-!> <P>

She put the heavy leather apron on and was arranging the tools she needed.  She dragged the slack bucket a little closer to the anvil. Everything was ready when Diamond arrived with the armor pieces and ale.  A quick swig of ale and Solla picked up the first broken piece with thongs.  Solla held the piece in the fire as she worked the bellows with her foot. <BR> <BR>As she and Diamond talked about the various irregularities of husbands, children, kin and clan, Solla turned the armor piece, withdrawing it from the fire occasionally, checking it&#39;s color.  When she got it to a nice cherry glow, she held it on the anvil, and with a hot set, she cut the armor piece in half.  She threw the half in her thongs into the slack bucket, and picked up the other half and reheated it in the furnace. <BR> <BR>&#34;What sort of half-witted dwarf keeps a wolverine for a guard dog?  They may be furry and fiesty, but they&#39;re just no fun,&#34; said Solla as she pulled the iron out of the flames to check the color.  Cherry red, perfect. <BR> <BR>Holding the iron on the anvil she started drawing out the armor with a hammer.  She and Diamond discussed what the ideal lad would be like, and lamented the fact that none existed as she continued to reheat and draw out the iron.  <BR> <BR>&#34;How thin does Emmrald want this to be?&#34; Solla asked Diamond as she cut the iron in half with the hot set and threw half into the slack bucket.  The iron sizzled as it hit the water, steam rising up from the water.  This was hot and humid work.  When the sizzling stopped, Diamond took the piece out with thongs and set it aside for later reworking. <BR> <BR>&#34;Tin &#39;nough ta wrap &#39;round de tatters,&#34; said Diamond.  Solla and Diamond stared at each other, then started laughing.  &#34;Better ta be &#39;ere hammerin iron den in dere touchin tatters.&#34;  Solla nodded agreement and continued drawing out the iron. <!-/Text-!> <P>

She hung up the worn homespun aprons on hooks.   &#34;Ye’d think I offer’d dem sum kinda drowie nighties or sumthin!&#34; chuckled the younger Glanderlin Sister.   With a resigned sigh, Emmrald continued to prepare more food, turning a roast now, stirring some stew in between.    The bread had risen and she put it into the oven after sprinkling it with some savory seed.   <BR> <BR>&#34;Berronar, thankyee fer callin’ me ta yer ‘earth.  I dinna ken ‘ow me kin be more den skin an’ bones wi’ tha way dey cares fer wun anudder.&#34;   Stirring the coals of the fire she reconsidered.  &#34;Mebbe tha ale an’ torstin’ be enuf fer ‘em.
