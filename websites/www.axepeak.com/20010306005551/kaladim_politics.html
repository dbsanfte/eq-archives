of Kaladim </font><font size=+0>(<a href="EQ.htm">back</a>)</font></font></b></center>

<p><font face="Tahoma">This document is intended to help writers understand
the political underpinnings of Kaladim, allowing everyone to write within
a consistent framework about the dwarven city. It will discuss the various
factions at work in the city, important personages, and the most pressing
concerns that occupy the thoughts of the leaders of the city.</font>
<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">Important People of Kaladim</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">This rundown of important NPC's in Kaladim is by
no means comprehensive, and will no doubt be added to as time passes. It
currently includes the most prominent political figures in and around the
city. Future additions will include key shopkeepers and other NPC's that
can be found within Kaladim and The Butcherblock Mountains.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">King Kazon Stormhammer</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Kazon Stormhammer is the King of Kaladim. As such,
he is by far the most important and powerful dwarf in the city. All clan
chiefs and guildmasters bend their knee to Kazon.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Datur Nightseer</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Datur Nightseer is the guildmaster of the Paladin's
Guild. As is evidenced by the mighty fortress the paladins call their home,
Underfoot Hall, the Paladin's Guild wields tremendous influence in Kaladim.
They have a close working relationship with the clerics of Underfoot Cathedral.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Priestess Ghalea</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The head cleric of Underfoot Cathedral, Priestess
Ghalea's words are carefully considereed by all who hear them. Being Brell
Serellis' most prominent representative in Kaladim gives her a unique standing
in the city. Even Datur Nightseer and King Stormhammer pause before ignoring
her council.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Furtog Ogrebane</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Furtog is the guildmaster of The Stormguard, the
warrior's guild of Kaladim. While not as influential in political matters
as either Datur Nightseer or Priestess Ghalea, he none the less is taken
very seriously as the leader of the most powerful fighting force in the
region. Anyone who has seen the Kaladim Guards in action know they are
a force to be reckoned with.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Mater</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Mater is the guildmaster of the local Rogue's Guild.
While few people actually <i>like</i> the Rogue's Guild, they recognize
the nescessity of it. While Mater has no official political influence,
he often makes his opinions and wishes known through "unofficial" channels.
Since he controls the single most powerful intelligence network in Kaladim,
his opinions are listened to carefully, if not openly. Surprisingly to
some, Mater has little love for The Butcherblock Bandits. The bandits operate
outside the blanket of The Rogue's Guild's approval, and in fact are considered
by the guild to be an indirect threat. Since they attack travellers indiscriminately
they are bad for business, and when business suffers the Rogue's Guild
suffers. As Mater is fond of saying, "Don't pick your mark's pockets <i>too
</i>dry, or he won't be able to refill them."</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">There are persistent rumors that The Miner's Guild
is merely another front for The Rogue's Guild. While there are some indications
that this may indeed be true, nothing has been confirmed thus far.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">Nyzil Bloodforge</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Leader of the reknowned mercenary band The Bloodforge
Brigade, Nyzil Bloodforge may well be one of the most skilled warriors
of Faydwer, and perhaps among the best in all of Norrath. While he has
little, if any, political influence, his band of warriors is considered
one of the finest in the region.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">"Peg Leg"</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The leader of the Butcherblock Bandits is known
simply as "Peg Leg". He is a rogue of tremendous skill, and should not
be taken lightly by any who face him. While the other bandits are not nearly
as formidable as he, in groups they can be quite dangerous to the unwary.
The Dunfires and the Smeltpots are two clans that seem to have thrown in
their lot with the Butcherblock Bandits - any dwarves of these clans should
be dealt with cautiously.</font>
<p><b><font face="Tahoma">The Kaladim Guards</font></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The Kaladim Guards can be found in many places in
the Butcherblock Mountains and, of course, within Kaladim itself. Following
are the names of a number of the guards that can be used in fiction to
lend an air of consistency to any writing about Kaladim and Butcherblock:</font>

<p><b><i><font face="Tahoma">Political Concerns of Kaladim</font></i></b>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Few people will argue that there are two main threats
to Kaladim at the current time : the goblins of Clan Runnyeye, and the
undead.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The undead are by far the simplest, if not nescessarily
the least dangerous, problem. They seem to spawn from the ground itself.
Butcherblock is one of the few regions in which the undead can be found
during the daylight hours, which has led many to speculate that some dark
necromantic power is at work in the regions. More than one ruin has been
said to be permanently inhabited by dwarven skeletons, something the paladins
of Underfoot Hall have sworn to put an end to. Despite their best efforts,
however, the undead problem persists.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Clan Runnyeye has been a threat for some time now,
and as time passes the threat only grows. The goblins have actually managed
to establish a camp disturbingly close to Kaladim, in spite of frequent
attacks by the dwarves that seem to wipe it out on a regular basis. The
difficulty, it seems, is that the goblins breed with a remarkable speed,
and nobody has yet discovered where exactly it is that they're breeding.
Fortunately, only the whelps have thus far been foolish enough to wander
near the gates of Kaladim itself, and they are readily dispatched by passing
dwarves and the guards themselves.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Recent reports tell of aqua goblins, the water dwelling
cousinns of the goblins of Runnyeye, making ocassional appearances in Butcherblock.
They are generally considered to be more dangerous than the land dwelling
variety of goblin, and the fear is that Clan Runnyeye is forming some sort
of alliance with them. Such an alliance would represent a fundamental balance
of power in the region, something King Stormhammer is justifiably concerned
about.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">Adding to these difficulties is the recent incursion
of the orcs of Clan Crushbone into Butcherblock. Previously the orcs had
been considered a strictly elven problem, as Emperor Crush has thus far
deployed all of his legions into the Greater and Lesser Faydarks. Lately,
however, orc runners have been spotted along the road to Greater Faydark,
presumably carrying messages of some sort. The incredible speed of these
runners makes them difficult to intercept, so thus far little is known
about their overall purpose. Travellers have also reported seeing orc oracles
in the region, and they may have already established a camp of sorts in
one of the more remote areas of Butcherblock. There are also rumours of
dark elves seen coming and going from Crushbone Castle. Of all possible
alliances, this one frightens King Stormhammer the most.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">The Butcherblock Bandits, of course, remain a constant
thorn in the side of The Stormguard. While they had, until know, been content
to remain within their camps and conduct their "business" quietly, lately
the bandits have been spotted on the roads attacking travellers. One bandit
by the name of Qued has been particularly active, although the Dunfires
have been seen around as well. Fortunately for all concerned, Peg Leg himself
has not yet shown his face outside of the camps. In these dangerous times,
very few dwarves consider the bandits to be "romantic". They are merely
another threat to travel that needs to be dealt with. The Miner's Guild,
in particular, wishes the bandits eliminated due to the threat they pose
to local trade.</font>
<p><font face="Tahoma">One final concern is the presence of two wandering
ogres, often found in the vincinity of the crossroads. Of all the problems
Kaladim faces, these two ogres are the least pressing. While they are indeed
a danger, alert travellers are usually able to avoid them, or at least
make it to the safety of the guards before they can attack. It seems unlikely
these two represent any sort of intelligence gathering force from Oggok.
Not only is Oggok on the other side of The Ocean of Tears, the concepts
of ogres and intelligence gathering simply do not go together. They are,
at worst, a nuisance that King Stormhammer is convinced will be dealt with
in time.</font>
