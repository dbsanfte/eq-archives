They enter and he looks around mumbling about so many trees but he starts to feel a burning inside that he never knew before but yet knows it. It the feeling of a enemy he has never meet but knows he will but more to it. <BR> <BR>The party heads north from entering in the woods from the area that has a lake through some mines with nasty Goblins gathered. Knowing that they would kill his party they use various means to get past them. As they headed north in the forest they see a large fort. Thinking it best to go elsewhere and learn more of what is in here they find a path and head east. many things here could kill this hunting party without much effort so they keep going. Yet his eyes keep going back to the fort and he realizes that is the source of his feelings. <BR> <BR>They set up camp. The party is a Cleric which he has come to trust even if it is a Drow another miner and a magican. They start the hunt. Killing Gobbies and large ape like things called Brutes. Then beyound a large tree they hear heavy stumping on the ground and feel the ground shake. The party readies there weapons and the cleric cast a fast shield on the miners and they wait. Then it clears there view!!! <BR>A GIANT they shout to each other. Bideach feels his blood boil with hate and without thinking he ran to it and ducked under it legs and before it could turn around he stabbed it in the back. Then the party joins in the fight. When it fell to the ground they all said great work but a gleam was in Bideach&#39;s eyes. They asked, what is going on? Bideach responded with a smile. <BR>Later they see some broken armor off under a bush and it just the right size for a dwarf. Bideach&#39;s blood boils again. The he shouts <B>I am declaring myself a Forest Giant hunter. </B> <BR>He scouts around and sees that there is three types of differant age. Sapling the youngest, younger them him, Greenwoods that are about the same age but most more skilled and then the Evergreens. They be nasty and well skilled but yet not that much older. <BR>He says then to the group, this will decided on my last name since I am near 20th season of training and it will wait till I reach the stage of Evergreen Giant Hunter.<!-/Text-!> <P>

He decides the next chance he can, he going to go into the Forest giants fort and do some scouting around so as to be able to learn there habits. That in turn will provide infromation to be used to kill them. <!-/Text-!> <P>

Gadging the foes strength, he knows that if he stoped hiding it would be instant death. ~mumbles about getting caught in a trap~ <BR>Not sure if is his special ways to go scouting, he calls on Gods helpers to see if they think he worthy for there help. Afer a short time one appears and looks over what he got stuck in. After tell the helper that he looks down and sees water and can only turn, the helper magical lifts him out and goes on his way. Lookinging he still not see the trap and nothing on senses. he decides to walk along side of bridge and that worked. <BR>Scouting around in the fort he see many places that the foes could be killed. The are big but small in brains as they for most part are scattered about. He sees a few that are very well trained and much higher then his training as they be the Evergreens of the 23 to 27th seasons. Also he sees Greenwoods, some same trained as him, other better as they in the 19 - 23 seaons training and the easier foe named saplings of the 15-18 season. <BR>After spending time there he decides this could get done with the proper help for alone it mean certinn death. he will return and start his hunt. <BR>~turns his ears to Diamond for her wisdom as this being his first swarn enemy and her being so well trained~. <BR> <BR>I will look you up lass or we do it magik mail? We can share a ale or 3. I be in 20th season. <!-/Text-!> <P>

It was some of the pirates of lengond from a long ago land. .... Sitting down? Well it was some of Winters Reavers. Even da captian there. Well me bout fell over.

The hunting starts! Me see all sorts of beast and then me sees them brining in a giant.
