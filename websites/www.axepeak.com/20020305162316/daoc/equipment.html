<h3>Equipment and wotnot</h3>
<p>
Everythin' has got a quality to it.  Ye cin sees it if ye right-clicks.  See?
Aye, well this is how it be.  Monster-dropped quality is around 70%.  Storebought be in
the 80's.  Player-crafted be in the 90's.  And quest be 100%.  How do that all work?
Easy...th' values of yer armor are modified by that number.  If ye gots an AC10 piece of
armor with a quality of 75 (it dropped off of some bugaboo), then its AC is 7.5
<p>
If I makes that same piece of armor, it may have a quality o' 93...for an effective
factor o' 9.3
<p>
Crafted goods be better than anythin' else but quest items!
<p>

Keep in mind that th' other values modify the equipment as well, it is nae just quality.
Ye have to worry about DUR and CON too!  So that battered, ripped, barshed about piece of
heavy chain jerkin ye pulled off a Nasty will nae be nearly as gud as a lighter piece that
jus came off me forge.
<p>
Also...color conning does NAE tell ye which armor is better.  Color conning simply tells
ye how quick that armor is goin ta degrade on ye.  Blue playercrafted armor is frequently
better than yellow-conning storebought or drops.
<p>
Read the equipment statistics on all pieces afore ye makes a judgement on which is better, 
<i><b>don't go by color alone!</i></b>

<h3>Alrite, here's a lil' primer on Armor in Midgard.</h3>

<p>
I've had a few folks come up to me and tell me they wanted
"Armor that cons yellow to a 6th level".  Well that's all an' good, but
I've nae idea wot will con wot to folks.  Ye needs ta go to a vendor and
con th' armors yerself.
<p>
There are 3 types of studded leather armor.  They are(in order)
stelskodd, svarskodd, and starkaskodd.  Think of em as light, medium, and heavy studded leathers.
<p>
There are 3 types of chainmail.  Pansarkedja, svarkedja, and starkakedja.  Again, these
are light, medium, and heavy.
<p>
Each armor type can be made from different materials.  Bronze, Iron, Steel, Alloy, and Fine Alloy.
<p>
So when ye wants a piece of armor, ye should go to a town vendor.
Browse th' armor until ye find wot ye wants. (Pay attention to the stats on th' armor, and how it cons).
Then ye cin go to yer friendly armorcrafter an say "I woul' like a iron starkaskodd hauberk, please!", 
and th' armorcrafter will be able ta tell ye if'n it's possible for'em to make.
