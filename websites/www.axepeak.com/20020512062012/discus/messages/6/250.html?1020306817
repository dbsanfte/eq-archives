In this light I wanted to base it on one of my favorite author&#39;s trilogys. The only problem is I wouldn&#39;t want it to be something that many of you have read! <BR> <BR>Fortunately the novels are not in print, and they were never very popular. So my question is this, have any of you read Lawrence Watt-Evans&#39; trilogy &#34;The Lords of Dus&#34; &#40;The first novel is “The Lure of the Basilisk”&#41; <BR> <BR>Pat. <BR>grand plans, flawed production<!-/Text-!> <P>

I am excited indeed to have this much support and backup for the dwarves of Clan Axepeak. <BR> <BR>The old-school members of Clan Axepeak eagerly await this opportunity to RP a return to the land of their birth, and the formation of Axepeak.  However, those kin born in Norrath have nothing to fear.  Axepeak will not abandon Everquest as long as their are kin here who enjoy the EQ forum.  Axepeak will just evolve into the OLDGC &#40;On-Line Dwarven Gaming Community&#41; that will make a home for dwarves of many realms. <BR>New opportunities for role-play in multiple games, varied story-lines, etc abound. <BR> <BR>--Storm Moradinson <BR>Clan Axepeak Rorn Gor <BR>Old Mithrilbones <BR> <BR> <BR>P.S.

EQ,UO, and many games like them, have there place...but they all fall short of the good&#39;ol &#34;pen and paper&#34; type AD&amp;D exp;&#62; NWN2 promises to be more of a tool to play like this, but in a graphical 3d environment. IMO, NWN on AOL was an anomily, beacuse it was the first like this and most people that found it were AD&amp;D fans already and this helped the RP in that setting stay more true and closer to AD&amp;D. We&#39;ll never be a part of such a game again...NWN was a truely unique expierience. <BR> <BR>Getting awarded for roleplay, quests that involve more than just killing the right thing/things, and an environment/world that has been so well detailed by countless books and publications...now thats a game baby!!;&#62; <BR> <BR>and no more sifting thru page after page in your players handbook looking up secondary skills;&#62; hehe...gota love it;&#62; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m there kin! One thing is I&#39;ll prolly have to wait to get it for a christmas present. I am limited to 2 toys a year...and this will deffinately be one of them :-&#41; growing up is hard to do... <BR> <BR>Beldain Thunderkeg <!-/Text-!> <P>

While I have been doing this, I have noticed that you can transfer your BG and BG2 characters to NWN...or so they are promising this as a feature so far;&#62; <BR> <BR>I was wondering, with this said, if the gaming our guild DM&#39;s will be having will include or disclude these transfered characters? The items and levels these &#34;transfered&#34; characters will have could imbalance the game world if the said DM isn&#39;t aware of this as a possibility. <BR> <BR>I would have fun, but must admit, that my Dwarven fighter level 19 stacked with Dragonscale armor and a 25 con...could stickout and make things a little complicated. <BR> <BR>I would recomend that all DM&#39;s be aware of other players with &#34;godlike&#34; characters and set the prefferences to exclude transfer characters like this to make a nice friendly EVEN playing field for all to enjoy. <BR> <BR>Just my 2 cents...mouth drooling to see Lord Nasher once again;&#62; <BR> <BR>Beldain Thunderkeg <BR>31st circle cleric of Brell <!-/Text-!> <P>

They only thing that is alowed is  a translation of your stats from the system in BG to NWN third edition rule set. <BR> <BR>And I fear we are all too stuck in the mindset of MMORPG. <BR> <BR>There will be no such thing as a god like character. Just folk that don&#39;t know that less is more. And fortunetly axepeakers do understand what is good for themselves and their fellow players. <BR> <BR>First off the ratio of DM&#39;s to players will be huge! My plan was to make any one &#40;in the guild&#41; who wanted to be a DM a DM. So right there we have god&#39;s galore. <BR> <BR>If you prove to be a poor or problem DM, well I expect that peer presure will be enough to make one shape up or ship out. <BR> <BR>So how to deal with someone who has too much junk and or levels who is wiping the floor with a given module? I don&#39;t know. I will burn that bridge when we come to it. But truely I just don&#39;t think it will be a problem.  <BR> <BR>Were I to see such a thing I would just ask such a player why they were engaging in such an endevor so unworthy of their abilitys. And I would then take action depending on their response. <BR> <BR>And grief players will simply be asked nicely to leave or banned. Remember anyone can be made a DM, no more of the BS we get from &#34;powers that be&#34;. You see a grief player and BAM! problem solved. <BR> <BR>Power to the sammen! <BR> <BR>Pat. <!-/Text-!> <P>

In order to assure that we dont fall in with a bunch of &#34;power-gamers&#34; I&#39;d prefer that the axepeak nwn server use one of the presets that filters out non-standard items. <BR>After all, if we tactical dwarfs cant have fun RPing and handling combat without artifact level items, then why bother eh? <BR> <BR>As more documentation comes out, we will be able to begin formulating more specific guidelines for what we will and will not allow on teh axepeak NWN servers.  Not because I want us to be rigidly regulated, but because, in order to find other NWN servers worthy of linking with, and expanding our RP opportunities, we will need to be ready to filter and be filtered.  If we already have guidelines in place, it will make it easier for us to decide who we want to share our NWN creation with. <BR> <BR>Storm Moradinson <BR>Clan Axepeak Rorn Gor <BR>Old Mithrilbones <!-/Text-!> <P>

I will put one snip from it below for those of you who don&#39;t want to read the whole thing. <BR>------------- <BR>Q:How many people are working on the project? <BR> <BR>Zeschuk: Near forty. Between thirty and forty. It&#39;s a big project... it depends; there are different numbers at different times in the project. <BR> <BR>Muzyka: We go through different phases, so now they&#39;re in the &#39;implementation&#39; phase, so they&#39;ve done most of the design and prototyping, and now they are creating the actual content. They&#39;re actually nearing the end of that phase, so we&#39;re nearing the QA and testing phase. <BR> <BR>------------------ <BR> <BR>And on a completely different topic, philosophy. <BR> <BR>I hate condo committees/homeowner associations. I prefer to wait till something proves to be a problem worthy of placing restrictions on people, before inventing rules to limit one&#39;s freedoms. &#40;Amsterdam is just the best city on earth!&#41;  <BR> <BR>Since peer pressure will be a real factor &#40;at last&#41; due to the much more limited populations on these home grown servers, I think the players will find their own levels of comfort if &#34;free-market&#34; forces are allowed to evolve. <BR> <BR>And as I said before, with a hi ratio of DM&#39;s to players, grief players will be policed. <BR> <BR>My preferred policy will be to allow one to run with scissors ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Pat.<!-/Text-!> <P>

I tend to either make the decisions or delegate and trust the ones I delegated to.  I do believe in hearing how others feel before the decision is made however.  As far as delegation of authority goes, Pat has rarely, if ever, been wrong to my memory, and he has always been among the most loyal and dedicated of Axepeak&#39;s members.  That said, if he is going to run the official Axepeak NWN Server &#40;and I assume he will since the other volunteer has been absent and silent for such a long time, feel free to speak up Tyg:p&#41; then I will judge his decisions based on his intent.  And I have always trusted Pat&#39;s intent to be for the best of the Kin. <BR> <BR>As for the decisions on what to allow/not allow in the Axepeak server&#40;s&#41;.  I really think there are only two viable options:  &#40;a&#41; Use the pre-set that does not allow any non-standard items or, &#40;b&#41; have no restrictions at all.  Anything in between is too damned hard to police and I don&#39;t want to spend any of my playing time policing, or grumbling about what others on the server are pulling out of their um...hats. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s really too soon to decide what to allow/disallow I suppose.  I know NWN will come with a number of preset item filters and once we have a better look at those filters we&#39;ll be better able to determine what works best for Axepeak and those we will want to share our little corner of the Realms with. <!-/Text-!> <P>
